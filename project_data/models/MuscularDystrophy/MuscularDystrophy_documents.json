["Dealing with weakness So I have a type of EDMD which is the scale of things is not as severe as other MDs, however after I had spinal surgery 4 years ago my strength as got worse. Does anyone know if its possible to regain any strength at all as in the past 2 weeks of swimming seemed to double my strength in my legs however that was a while ago.  \n\n\nIt is hard when I have EDMD and some of my issues seem pretty severe right now mainly my arms which I can no longer lift to my face comfortably which most people with EDMD do not get. Holding my phone up and scrolling is becoming a problem now as well due to weak wrist muscles.  \n\n\nAny advice or things you may know to improve the situation just a little will be much appreciated and go a long way thank you. Yes I have EDMD and (used to) work out 3 times a week doing strength training usually with some yoga or Pilates too. \n\nIt is definitely harder to get stronger as you get older. I am 37 now and definitely do not feel my improvements as much as when I was 32-35. \n\nThat said. If you keep at it regularly you will be amazed what you can achieve if you eat enough and keep exercising. I went from a 250lb leg press to 1000lb over about 18 months (the numbers are all relative to your current limits)\n\nSet yourself a goal and find a personal trainer if you can afford it. They really help keep you motivated.\n\nKeep an eye on your heart. If you have a pacemaker like me you can overdo it quite easily on high heart rate exercises. Also I would recommend making sure you are on a blood thinner if you are not already. My doctor never told me we were at elevated risk for strokes so I was quite surprised 3 weeks ago when I had one. \n\nMy goal is to get back to the gym in December and get back to lifting bigger and better again. See if I can get back to that 1000lb leg press. Thank you for your comment, I am able to do no where near what kind of of weight you are doing should this be concerning, In terms of weight I struggle to lift my arms out sideways and my for my legs well I am un able to walk anymore, but would you say there is still a chance to build some muscle? Yes.\nIn certain positions I am unable to lift my arms in front of my face very easily either and they get tired fast. But you can get better by just doing that. \n\nFor instance hold your arms out as straight as you can for a few seconds let us say 5. Then relax for a few seconds then go again. It does not matter if you are holding weight or not. It is all relative. So if you can hold your arms out for 5 seconds and do it 20 times that is improving muscle. \n\nThe reason you are counting is so that you can track your progress. Write it down in a notepad or make a note on your phone. Watching your progress is vital otherwise you will just give up. Eventually you may be able to hold it out for 10 seconds 20 times. \n\nThis same principal applies for all muscles. Move, as much or little as you can. But make sure you track it and keep trying. It takes several weeks to get noticeable small improvements. But 100% you can get stronger\n\nEdit: focus things you want to get better at specifically. If that is holding your cellphone up then practice that\u2026 holding your phone is a weight. Keep doing it. But do not forget the things that can help too, like leg movement etc. Thank you I will start doing this. You actually made me want to start exercising again.

That prevents her foot from flopping, which can cause a charlie horse (sp?) when sleeping.\n\nLastly, if she has drop foot, there are devices you can use on your shoes to keep your foot in partial dorsi-flexion. I use x-straps, but there are others.\n\nI have a LGMD, and I try to use the crap out of these items. These are all great suggestions, thank you so much! I think your head and heart are definitely in the right place. For me, I would appreciate all of the things that are not MD related. It becomes a big part of your life and if not careful it can start to feel like it will define you. So, when someone does not even factor it in and their thoughts are about you and not your disease, it can make you appreciate it way more and feel \"normal\". Although, I do understand why you may need to factor that in now seeing as she may need a lot of things to help with her new diagnosis.

I also have severe chest pain at times and difficulty breathing but my doctor and neurologist think it is more likely long covid aggravating asthma or the myopathy?\n\nNow as far as it goes, i have not been explained what to expect. They say they believe it may be the mildest variant of a milder form of dystrophy but until this diagnosis never heard of lgmd only the more extreme forms. My doctor and neuro say I will have an unaffected lifespan but i may have difficulty walking in a few decades if i do not keep up w physical therapy as they do not believe it is going to affect my arms or hands.\n\nNow what symptoms did you experience or how did it progress for you? And there is any social support or network you guys use. I feel really alone and scared with this diagnosis. I am lucky to live in Australia so medical costs have been minimal at very least.\n\nThank you for reading and if anyone could tell me their experiences or message me about what they found that would be great Upvoting for visibility.

Has anyone experienced or is familiar with an issue where the person with MD \u201cstruggles\u201d swallowing/inhaling. Brain tells the body to swallow/breath but the body just does not swallow/inhale. Never happened when eating. When these little spasms/episodes occur the only way to get it to swallow/inhale again is to sort of clear the throat until it seemingly works normally again.  I sometimes have trouble drinking water. I think it is a pretty common issue to have trouble in this sort of thing. Swallowing while eating big issue for me now at the age of 36. Get weaker as I get older. Cannot really eat any foods I used to like. That should brighten your day I have myotonic muscular dystrophy, and I do have difficulty swallowing sometimes.  My throat muscles will spasm when I swallow, and it will cause me to cough uncontrollably and sometimes vomit.  I also have weak muscles, and so it hardly makes it past my vocal cords, and then I have to cough.  Sometimes my esophageal muscle will also lock up when I am eating or even drinking water.  What has helped me is to go slow when I am eating and make sure I chew everything very thoroughly before I swallow.   When I am in a rush and not noticing, it happens more often.  This can be a problem because it can cause us to aspirate into the lungs, which can cause pneumonia.  I have friends that have eventually had to have a feeding tube down the line, but they will still eat occasionally because, to them, it is worth the risk.  My brother, who hardly ever went to the doctor, had MD, and he did aspirate and died from pneumonia. Oh my gosh. I was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at 13, and I have experienced this my whole life. I had no idea this might be MD related... Another added to the yes pile.

I know it (the swalloing) always comes back after 1 or 2 attempts but idk what if one day it does not... Has this ever caused you any problems? It is obviously uncomfortable but idk it seems to return everytime I better start appreciating a lot of my meals a lot more lol. Daamn. This is quite scary tbh lol. Your doctors ever say anything about it? All my doctors say on a normal person they would perform a endoscopy and possibly expand the throat and upper chest region but because the anesthetic is so dangerous they do not even consider it. Could potentially die from the anesthetic Do you just get use to it? I thought i would be use to it after 1-2 years but my body still sort of just panics still because for that brief spasm it feels like i cannot swallow and my panic just panics. I worry about everything tbh, it is not that high on my list of things I am slowly losing, but it is there to be sure. Hi slowly losing, but it is there to be sure, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 Not many. It is just really uncomfortable My mom is 65, has myotonic and ever since I can remember, she coughs when she eats. It is recently gotten more frequent though.

Canada has universal health care and free education until university. Also depends under which province. As well there is ( Depending on the province you will get different services in health and education because they are both provincial. Also note that although there is a \"free\" health care you have to be resident (possibly minimum permanent resident) and there is a waiting period, even for Canadian moving from one province to another. I would recommend checking but I think the only province that does not have a waiting period for Canadian moving is Manitoba. And probably the worst province to move is Quebec as the health care is not the best; the waiting list to get a GP is years. Without to much knowledge I would probably suggest Ontario to be the best to move to as probably the most amount of services (most of Canadian population live there), would be able to find a job and support groups). Other than that BC is also a good place (other than the cost of life and price of housing) as the medical service are good and if you need facility for mobility aid it is very wheelchair friendly both in the facilities and the weather. There is a lot of facility in the bus and taxis. Overall if you can afford it Vancouver or Victoria would be top list.

I got a ck test in the morning and it came back negative. I was relieved but according to my doctor (a neurologist), I should get a ck total test as ck test is not complete and accurate. What is the difference between ck and ck total? I am really nervous and all of my future plans might be spoiled by this. Is there a chance that I might get a different answer from the ck total test, that I will take tommorrow. Having muscular dystrophy does not ruin your life. A CK test is not enough for a diagnosis anyway, because high levels could be caused from a lot of different things.   Typically the CK total is done first (I think).  Then there are follow up CK tests to determine which specific enzyme is elevated to help identify the root cause issue.  If you were given a specific CK test first, you may have been tested for only one enzyme, only the heart or only the brain enzyme for example.  Without a finding, your Dr may want you to get the total test next to see if any of the other enzymes may be elevated. I work in the field diagnosing MD and I have never heard of a \"CK Total Test\".

You should not project your issues onto people that actually have the disease. There are people with MD with advanced degrees, great careers, and thriving relationships.  I have know a guy that is been to 80 countries. Please do not tell me that my life is horrible when it is not.  If you had Duchenne's, you probably would have had symptoms for more than two months by this age. I have never heard of that. Is the CK level high and above normal? That might be an indication of fast muscle break down if you have not been exercising a lot which can cause high CK levels. Ck is ck as far as I know. Both of my children have duchenne md. Their ck was outrageously high when they were diagnosed but understand that CK alone does not diagnose muscular dystrophy. \nYou will need a genetic test or a muscle biopsy for a clear picture. \nI cannot imagine being 14 and going through this. My children are 12 and 15 and lost their ability to walk years ago. Even so, they are thriving. My oldest even has college plans. They are happy and doing pretty good. A diagnosis of muscular dystrophy is not the end of the world. An obstacle, sure. You are so strong mentally, never forget that. \nI know it is easier said than done but stay positive. One day at a time, it is all you can do. It could be a \"enzyme activity\" vs \"enzyme level\" issue: CK is usually measured by its enzymatic activity, because that is pretty easy to measure, and is very sensitive. \n\nSince blood usually has essentially no creatine kinase, any activity detected is very obvious, and in the case of Duchenne patients, *really* obvious. Serum CK from unaffected individuals will usually be 200 or lower, while from Duchenne boys it can easily be 10,000-1,000,000.\n\nHowever, creatine kinase may be present, but not active. Various processes, both biological and chemical, can inactivate CK, thus it is possible (but rare) to have high serum CK that is not detectable via enzyme activity.\n\nFor this you can detect the protein itself, which is usually more convoluted, since protein detection assays generally rely on antibodies and consequently...time, but they are possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, though, I would suspect that if you actually have systemic muscle damage, it would have showed up on a conventional CK test. Again, DMD boys can have CK levels 100-10000 times higher than unaffected boys: even with a significant level of enzyme inactivation, some elevation would be detectable. It is a pretty sensitive test.\n\nIn terms of DMD in general, reaching the age of 14 before encountering *any* overt symptoms already places you more than likely out of the range of a DMD diagnosis (which is typically diagnosed much earlier). Becker muscular dystrophy is possible, but there are also many other muscular dystrophies and disorders that are not dystrophin-related at all, all of which can have varying onsets and severities. \n\nAnd you may have...none of them. You have been feeling crappy for two months: this is a very, very short period of time within which to leap to the conclusion \"it is muscular dystrophy\". It could be something as trivial as a vitamin deficiency.\n\nIt is good that you are seeing a doctor, because frankly, more people should do that more often, but it is far, far to early to be making sweeping assumptions about the rest of your life.

My friend's son has DMD and we have been talking about putting him on a modified fast of bone broth for 5 days to see if we notice any improvement in his symptoms.\n\nHas anybody heard of this working or helping?  There does not seem to be any supportive research. I would lean towards it not being an ideal plan without the input of a DMD specialist. There is some research, but yes, it is also just a hunch. Do not see why a specialist would need to be involved when a fast is virtually harmless. Sapiens have been doing it for millions of years.\nFrom what I can tell, nobody has tried it.  Healthy sapiens have been doing it virtually harmlessly. There is not enough good data on the topic for those with genetic disorders. \n\nAlso, homo sapiens have not been around for millions of years.\n\nA specialist should be involved in order to discuss potential issues. I have DMD and I am 22. First of all, how old is he? What do you exactly mean by symptoms? Depending on his age, it may risk other aspects of health.  I get why you say I should have a specialist involved, completely agree and we will make an appointment with his as soon as possible. \n\nRight, my mistake. Evolution of the genus homo in Africa was about 2.5 million years ago, where they developed the first stone tools. I have no idea when they figured out how to boil water though.\n\nDo you have MD?  He is 3. I do not know all of his exact symptoms off hand. Have you tried doing something like this yourself?  I do not. I am a layman that studies this topic. My son has DMD (Exon 51 deletion). Not really, but at that age, I had to drink pediasure. By symptoms, I do not think your thought would do anything to help muscles.  Please, do not do that! I do not think you fully understand what DMD is. Its is literally and error in the code that makes your sons body. There is no way a fast will help his MD. The only thing you might accomplish is to further weaken him by restricting his food. Please consult your Neurologist. By the way I have MD. I am guessing your thought is that fasting will promote autophagy, and that autophagy could help his symptoms. I would be highly skeptical that autophagy will help. Also, I believe any calories, including bone broth, inhibits autophagy. So you would need to do a pure water fast. I might suggest reaching out to Dr. Jason Fung. You can Google him, he is well known in the fasting world. I fasted (a lot) and lost disturbing amounts of weight and got really weak. What your friend is talking about doing sounds like child abuse to me. If your friend follows through, be sure to call the police. I have not come across any research in this area and my initial reaction to your question was a somewhat outraged thought along the lines of, \"The only human being  you have any right to experiment on is yourself!\"\n\nConsidering the risk of muscle mass loss caused by fasting I cannot imagine any ethics committee would approve research in this area. To risk the health of someone else's child on a hunch seems to me to be totally reprehensible. DMD is life threatening and life limiting, this is not some trivial thing you are proposing. \n\nBefore you ask, no I do not have DMD, I have FSHMD instead so my MD is unlikely to kill me (just disable me) and I still would not choose to take this risk myself.  I have DMD as well, and have done growth fasting and it has helped me become a little bit taller then I would have been Oh really? What is growth fasting?  Well know as a growth hormone Do you mean how HGH increases while fasting?  Yes Very cool! How long did you fast for? Did you do a water, Bone broth or Intermittent fast? Were you taking vitamins, supplements, probiotics or any other drugs? How much did it help you exactly?  I mean not besides the pills that I take daily since I was little up to now. I did not change any of my pills for the growth hormone. I was able to have the hormones delivered to my home. I did a shot every night, I forget when I stopped. I was able to get this through a doctor. Anyways if your thinking about this, I would bring it up to his dad and maybe have him talk about it with a doctor.  Oh you took injections? I thought you just did a fast to boost hgh naturally I have seen a little improvement, I am definitely taller then I would have been, but only by a little bit.

Its the first time that the protocol is used by someone who has muscular dystrophy and up to now its working very well. This has to be done with a doctor though as the doses are really high.\n\nHere is the translated text and at the bottom is the link to the source:\n\n\"Post by Vandinha Mello, which has been dealing for two years with the Coimbra Protocol for Muscular Dystrophy. This is our first testimonial about Muscular Dystrophy and the high doses of vitamin D: \"Hello nice people! I almost do not go to Facebook anymore, but as I started reporting about VITAMIN D TREATMENT (Coimbra Protocol) for MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, I could not help but report the results of the last exams. I have been doing this treatment for exactly 7 months, and as I reported before, some enzymes in my body (CPK) were very high, causing my muscles to become inflamed, consequently losing strength (this is the disease process). But yesterday I received the results of the exams I did late July, and guess what? Below are the words of my doctor (Dr. Lucia Schaedler): \u201cYour muscle enzyme CPK and DHl are practically normal, indicating that thank God the inflammatory activity of your disease is stopped\u201d \ud83d\ude2d Imagine losing strength for 17 years and receiving such news that the disease is stabilized \ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude2d God only knows how happy I am about this, and I wanted to share with you this news, which has been people who have given me so many words of support and love since I decided to report on this disease I have \ud83d\udc95 Ps. With the disease stabilized, it does not mean that I will have the muscle strength I had before, but I will not continue to lose, now is to do the next step: PHYSIOTHERAPY to keep the muscles I have, and continue the treatment, but as for GOD, nothing is impossible, I will not stop believing that one day I can make my movements again before \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude4f Thank you, Dr. Lucia for all the dedication, attention and strength you are giving me! \u2764\ufe0f So that is it ... Thank you all for your strength and as soon as you have more news, I will report back. \ud83d\ude18\u2764\ufe0f \"\n\nSource:\n\n\n\nI have been 4 years now on this protocol so you can ask me questions about the protocol if you want. I dont know much about this particular case though.\n\nCheers There are a few suspcious things in this, at least from my understanding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, it does not mention what type of Muscular Dystrophy she has.  Second, it is my understanding that CPK levels are a RESULT of, not CAUSE of, muscle issues like damage and inflamation.  \n\nIt would be very interesting to see an actual discussion of how vitamin D is making up for the lack of dystrophin. Good question; what I know is that vitamin D is an immunomodulator which means it will modulate the immune system and make it stay quiet (no disease progression) when taken at the right dose.\n\nHowever, what I do not know at this point is if all muscular distrophy disease types are autoimmune or have an autoimmune component, but, what I know though is that vitamin D is very good at fighting inflammation. So what I understand from her testimony, is that wherever the inflammation was coming from, the vitamin D would have modulated it, and as a result of that her CPK levels are now at a normal level.\n\nFrom my understanding if someone has a muscular distrophy disease type that has an autoimmune component, then there is no reason why it would not work..\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nThe same protocol is presently being used on kids with autism and it works wonders; they socialize more, they go back to normal school, start talking to their parents, etc, and all of this is because autism was linked to an autoimmune component disorder. If it sounds too good to be true, it is likely too good to be true So first, muscular dystrophy (at least the major versions) are not auto-immune disorders.  They are a problem with the body's ability to produce dystrophin.  A lack of dystrophin results in muscle damage and scarring.  As a result of that damage, CK levels rise.  Vitamin D is generally recommended in higher dosages, but not to help the disease, but to help with bones and the calcium can be leached out of them and vitamin D helps here.\n\nDo you have links to some proper clinical trials showing these results? No unfortunately, not yet;\n\nThere is a study on the patient's adherence to the protocol that came out last year but several German doctors are working on publishing their results for next year, 2020. We are all, the patients, waiting anxiously to see the results officially confirmed. Its a leap of faith yes but I went trough it and I am glad I did.\n\nSo, from all the doctors perspective worlwide (over 100 of them for 30,000 patients since ~15 years), the informal consensus is about 90-95% remission rate for MS and 100% for psiorasis and Cronh's. I do not know for the other diseases but they are all that high.\n\nWhat usually happens is that the existing clinical trials use one single small dose for everyone, for instance 5000 or 10000iu and they then see \"some\" results but its not always convincing, and certainly not for a single therapy usage. For vitamin D to work efficiently the dose must be customized (weight, disease severity, etc) and people generally start at 1000ui/kilo as a basis. \n\n I can also PM you Dr Coimbra's email if you want to inquire about this particular case, I am sure he will be able to give you some better information.\n\nHere is another case reported:\n I hear you, we all have been hit with the last flavor of the day. Its totally understandable....\n\nAs I am mentioning above the protocol is not simple at all, you have to draw blood often, perform follow ups, take several supplements during the day, and above all we need to convince our GP to come on board once we have chosen this therapy. Its much more complicated than just taking a shot or a pill every month, but it is very well developed and been provided since 15 years now for various serious autoimmune diseases...\n\nBut... at the end of the day, its really worth it. I was dx with MS 4 years ago and I would never look back... :)\n\nYou can have a peek at the north american group if you want to, they are very friendly. The video linked above is also very informative:\n So, as I mentioned earlier, muscular dystrophy is not an auto-immune disorder.   The \"case\" reported is very much anecdotal and without the double blind placebo controlled study it recommends, there is basically zero evidence of what you are suggesting. I hear you and that is totally fine. \n\nSo after reading your comment I did search a little bit about the different forms and indeed, when we look at the Muscular Distrophy Canada website at  (  it seems that only 4 out of 22 forms are autoimmune related (GUILLAIN-BARR\u00c9, MYASTHENIA GRAVIS and MYOSITIS DISORDERS) so I would then believe that this girl probably had one of these 3. It would make sense anyway.\n\nHere is another testimony that was published this morning (myasthenia gravis):\n\n(\n\nHave an excellent day and let us cross our fingers so that these papers are soon published !\n\nCheers &amp;#x200B;\n\nFYI, here is another one that came out this morning  (myasthenia gravis) :\n\n ( \n\nHave a great day", "Virgin Mary Dr Joel Wallach discovered that MD was actually a selenium deficiency.\n\nHe is a doctor, a veterinarian, and pathologist.\n\nHe has great packet of minerals and nutrients for muscular dystrophy.\n\nThe Virgin Mary If you can afford his program, go for it.

Deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the major circulating form of vitamin D, is associated with an increased risk of age-related chronic diseases including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, cognitive impairment, and cancer. In this study, we utilized Caenorhabditis elegans to examine the mechanism by which vitamin D influences aging. We found that Vitamin D3-induced lifespan extension requires the stress response pathway genes SKN-1, IRE-1, and XBP-1. Vitamin D3 (D3) induced expression of SKN-1 target genes, but not canonical targets of IRE-1/XBP-1. D3 suppressed an important molecular pathology of aging, that of widespread protein insolubility, and prevented toxicity caused by human \u03b2-amyloid. Our observation that D3 improves protein homeostasis and slows aging highlights the importance of maintaining appropriate vitamin D serum levels, and may explain why such a wide variety of human age-related diseases are associated with vitamin D deficiency.\n\nIn Brief\nAn external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\nObject name is nihms820884u1.jpg\nMaintenance of protein homeostasis is crucial to cellular health, and contributes significantly to the lifespan of the organism. Mark et al. demonstrate that vitamin D supplementation promotes protein homeostasis and slows aging in the nematode, C. elegans. These findings identify a mechanism by which Vitamin D influences aging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nHumans acquire vitamin D through skin photosynthesis and digestive intake. Two hydroxylations are needed to obtain the bioactive compound, the first produces 25-hydroxyvitamin D , and the second 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D . There is no consensus regarding the appropriate cut-off level to define the normal serum 25(OH)D range. Experimental, epidemiological and clinical studies have related low vitamin D status with longevity. Although some results are controversial, low serum 25(OH)D levels have been linked to all-cause, cardiovascular, cancer and infectious related mortality. Throughout life span a significant proportion of human beings display insufficient (20-30 ng/mL) or deficient (&lt;20 ng/mL) serum 25(OH)D levels. Appropriate lifestyle changes, such as regular short exposures to sunlight (15 min a day), and an adequate diet that includes vitamin D rich components, are not always easily accomplished. Studies relating to vitamin D supplementation have methodological limitations or are based on relatively low doses. Therefore, dosages used for vitamin D supplementation should be higher than those traditionally suggested. In this sense, there is an urgent need for prospective controlled studies using high daily vitamin D doses (2,000 IU or higher) including cardiovascular, cancer, infectious and other endpoints. Relationship between vitamin D and health outcomes is not linear, and there are probably various optimal vitamin D levels influencing different endpoints.\n\n As you can see from my recent posts I backed up with science Chlorella Vulgaris for muscle regeneration, green tea to reduce dna damage to muscles, eggs to promote balance and help body make stem cells for muscles, broccoli to reduce antioxidant damage and inflammation to muscles, and vitamins D 10,000 iu per day to promote longevity.  These changes to my diet are also personally helping ng me with Muscular Dystrophy.  \n\nPost Script:\nSugar blocks Vitamin C, and high fructose corn syrup blocks Vitamin D. honestly i do not think so. I do not want to get hopes up. I feel you bro. Keep it up! Definitely! There is a gene replacement therapy in a phase 3 trial for Duchenne muscular dystrophy right now as well as 3 others in phase 2 trials. All have shown great promise. In addition, gene editing therapies are not far off. One company that is developing a gene editing therapy for Duchenne might dose their first patient near the end of this year and there is another company that will likely initiate their gene editing trial in 2022.", "Spinal Fusion - Important question Hello everybody. I am 28 y o M and I have DMD. I am about to get a spinal fusion / scoliosis correction surgery done on the 15th this month. I never got a chance to get it done when I was 15-16 y o because I live in a developing country (Egypt but I am having the surgery in Istanbul, I been in Turkey since July) so anyway I am just wondering if anyone is in or was ever in a similar situation.\n\nMy question is, did you have this surgery or any sort of surgeries after the age of 20? I understand it is a huge risk but living with a 60+ degrees spine curve is not good either. \n\nWould you be scared if you were me? \n\nThanks. My son is 24 with DMD. He had his spinal fusion when he was 15. He does not really understand the risk of surgery in his physical condition because of his severe autism. However, as his dad I can tell you that it is right to be nervous but if you can straighten out your back I am sure it is worth the risk. Good luck!! Thank you so much for your input.  I do feel that it will all go just fine.", "Hello, is there anyone out there? Bethlem Myopathy Hi I am looking for some advice as you probably know there is no one around me other then my mother with the same MD as me.\n\nI have Bethlem Myopathy.  And I would like to know if there is anyone out there who has it, other then my family? Hey there! I do not have Bethlem Myopathy exactly, but I have 2 COL6A1 mutations that mimic it so I am sitting right between Bethlem Myopathy and Ulrich muscular dystrophy, symptom wise. My combo of mutations has not really been recorded before though, so we are not totally sure what the future looks like. I am down to talk though! Hi!  I do not want to ask to many personal questions of ya on public forums, but do you mind if I ask your age?  Nice to meet you!!!  I did NOT expect a response.  Or one that fast for that matter. I am 23! I honestly was kind of shocked, I do not think I have ever seen any COL6A1 dystrophies mentioned on here before so when I saw Bethlem Myopathy I was like oh wait!!! That is my gene!!! Wow.  I am 25 myself!  My mother is 49.  She can still walk and works an office job, so if that gives you any hope!  It sure does me, but her and I exhibit different symptoms.  I have bad contractures in my leg which limits walking and have had a few procedures done, whereas her walking is great no contractures in her legs, however she has contractures in her arms and I do not.  \n\nFunny thing is before the test I took 2 years ago, they were thinking we had Limbgyrdle, I believe Ulrich was discussed as well as a couple other versions.\n\nI just cannot believe how rare this disease seems to be.  I am grateful to not have any fatal disease (as far as we know now) but it is so scary not to know what is happening or what the future holds.  I like being independent but I am so scared of losing the ability to walk because of the contractures , and doctors just do not know what to tell me, other then to stretch. I actually have the opposite problem that some people with the intermediate COL6A1 Myopathy have- all my joints are wildly loose and I constantly dislocate everything. only contractures I have are in my neck, and some beginning in my elbows That is awful, I could only imagine my neck feeling tight and not able to move.. I bet that causes awful migraines.  \n\nDo you know where your genetics came from?  I ask because I am still wondering if my 3 year old son has MD.  I inherited from my mother, and I was curious to as if I have passed it to my son.\n\nHe is really strong and does not seem to have contractures or any issues that I have yet.  The doctors said they did not need to test him or anything until he showed symptoms. Bethlem Myopathy is part of a spectrum disorder called Collagen VI-Congenital Muscular Dystrophy.  \n\n\nI have COL6 and manged a nonprofit dedicated to this conditon: (  \n\n\nHappy to answer any questions, and I would love to introduce you (and all respondents!) to the CMD Community. joint hyperlaxity is common in COL6. If you and your mother are affected, you have likely inherited COL6 in a dominant fashion. This means there is a 50% chance that your child will be affected. I can go more into the genetics if you wish. Your condition is called Intermediate COL6. :) It looks like it is from my mother and can be traced to her mother too, but my grandma is adopted so we are not sure if it goes back further than that. I am one of 4 children, with 1 other sibling appearing to have it. My mom is one of 4 children and also has 1 sibling who seems to have it. My grandma is an only child. I really started struggling a couple years after I finished puberty- we noticed I got tired quicker as a child, and was incredibly bendy and \"clumsy,\" but I was otherwise pretty normal. Specturm:  Ulrich (severe) - Intermediate - Bethlem (mild). There are specific milestones defined for where one might fall on the spectrum.\n\nBethlem is considered a form of LGMD (Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy) which is simply an umbrella term for milder or later onset dystrophic conditions (of which there are now about 35 distinct types). All LGMD's have a congenital-onset version that is caused by the same gene(s). Hey there! So I actually do not have an exact diagnosis of intermediate, because my mutations have independently been seen in people that were asymptomatic, but have not been studied together in 1 person. We have my info in a couple research studies and if we find other people with both mutations as well, maybe we have identified a new variant of intermediate COL6! I have yet another collagen related mutation on MYLK, so my \"diagnosis\" is just the presence of the mutations as of currently. It is cool to participate in genetic research, but I also wish I knew if there were any other people with these 3 mutations and if they look like me! We have colleagues at the NIH who can help interpret your genetic report.  \n\n\nMYLK is not related to COL6. Correct, but it is some of what causes some of my disease. I have total digestive tract paralysis that obviously is most likely a result of my MYLK mutation. That is cool, I would love to talk to some people about it! My genetics team here in Denver is super cool and I have gotten to participate in some nationwide studies, but I am always down to try and find someone else like me! The MYLK mutation is closely related to the Ehlers Danlos syndromes, which is one of the diagnoses I currently have. Not totally sure if it is accurate because there is so much overlap, but it is part of the differential I have right now.  So how would oneself find where they fell on the spectrum? What should I be looking for in my child as signs?  Is it just a waiting game? The most direct way to know is to have your child tested.  Otherwise, I would imagine the same symptoms you and your mother have experienced, delayed milestones, joint hyperlaxity, muscle weakness. Those on the severe end of the spectrum (called Ullrich) never gain the ability to walk or lose ambulation in childhood. They also tend to need night time ventilatory support sometime in childhood.  \n\n\nThose on the mild end of the spectrum (called Bethlem) typically retain ambulation well into adulthood and have milder symptoms overall - sometimes not even recognized as symptoms for many years.   \n\n\nIntermediate is pretty much everything in between.  \n\n\nI know many people diagnosed with COL6-CMD, and none of us are exactly the same. My sister is going through a diagnosis rn. She has a mutation they have never seen before on COL6A2. Me and my other sister are beginning to show symptoms as well. I am late but I do \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Hey! I see this is an old thread but I too have intermediate COL6A1! My son, father, uncle, Grandpa etc have/had the same! I have chronic daily migraines, fatigue and night sweats and was wondering if that sounds familiar to any of you? Thanks! Migraines are a common occurrence for me.  Fatigue is very common.  However night sweats, I do not deal with that at all.  But the other 2 are very common symptoms for me personally.  But I have noticed every person with Bethlem myopathy is different in their own way and has their own symptoms a lot.", "Old person with DMD Hello!\n\nMy dear friend Olaf has DMD and he turned 60 in 2020. I know this is very rare. Back in the 60s they told him he would never live past 18. \n\nI know now that with the advancements of medicine and science people with DMD will live longer. \n\nI wonder if anyone here know who is the oldest living person with DMD. I googled it and I get mixed results. \n\nThanks in advance\n\nEdit: I meant to write OLDEST. Not old. Idk how to correct it. Wow, that is awesome. I have DMD and I am 24, almost 25, and 60 is the oldest I have heard of but I remember my doctor telling me a couple of years ago that he knew a couple of people in their 50s who could possibly be in their 60s now. Do you mind if I ask what his mutation is?  I have read some studies that deletions very early and a couple other specific ones can progress slower.  My kids have a deletion of exon 45 and does seem to be progressing shower than average. This will probably get criticism, but I do not care. God has a plan for everyone and doctors, study\u2019s, medicine or that Devil of a disease, will never be able to determine or limit someone is time on this earth if God says it is not time. My son has MD and I pray and believe. I love and will always have a special place in my heart for the MD warriors that suffer at the hands of that monster. God bless you all. His mutation is exon 7. He tried to join the study for the medication that was recently approved. He was denied for his age. They explained that the medication was more for children. Good luck to you. What I noticed with my buddy is his desire to keep enjoying life. It might be a whole project to get him out the house now but (before pandemic) we would go to concerts, sports events, walk in the park. \n\nHis favorites was a drink at the local sports bar. I am actually a registered nurse. I do see people using medicine to play god while the person suffers. \n\nI have seen people keep their parents alive way too long. I watch them suffer in pain and agony. \n\nCPR and intubation on a 92 year lady is saddest thing I have ever seen. I saw her eyes look at me like a small child wondering what was happening. \n\nThere is a limit. \n\nI told my buddy to go see a lawyer and write down his wishes while he can still talk.

Genetic testing can hopefully pinpoint the exact type of MD you have. Yes. I never had a biopsy and I am glad because it was not necessary As was said previously, genetic testing will hopefully tell you your specific type. That being said, at least for LGMD (Limb-Girdle MD) VOU's (Variants of Uncertain Significance) are quite common and most do not get a genetic confirmation yet. Really?? Yea my doc said i def have lgmd, and when i took a genetics test years ago it didnt a confirmation, makes sense now, just figured id try again since it was so long ago, not that it ultimately matters i suppose I have not looked into it much since the National LGMD conference in 2019, however there is a lot of literature on it. Look into published studies by Dr. Peter Kang (Formally University of Florida moved up to Mid-west I think) but LGMD is largely diagnosed by a combination of symptoms, biopsy and blood work. The fact is LGMD was first diagnosed around the 1950s and has remains a rare disease so studies are all very small making it difficult to study.\n\nYou can use a genetic test to confirm a diagnosis. But given that we do not know everything about genetics it cannot be used to rule out a diagnosis. The lantern Project does a large panel of specific testing for LGMD (it is free if ordered by your doctor) and you can also contact Dr. Kang who is conducting an exome study.  \n\n\n\n\n(\n\nScience is progressing pretty quickly with CRISPR hopefully that means good news for us soon. Cool! Thanks! Yea i had two biopsys done, god knows how much blood work, and to finally confirm it was that test i cant recall what it was called where they put the needles inside of you and zap you a bit EMG I think. I had that done as well. Was weird having like a 6 inch needle stuck into my neck muscles. Yea that is it the emg, damn youre kneck that sounds uncomfortable as hell! I think they did my arms hands and legs  Remember with genetic testing you need to be testing for something specific, so it can be used to confirm a specific type, but I do not think they ever use it to test for them all and see what comes back positive. However that is based in when I studied genetics 9 years ago, Maybe things have changed since then I was diagnosed with LGMD but genetic testing said I specifically have EDMD, which has additional cardiac concerns. When I was spoken to about it, they said there are so many variations, if they do not have a starting point then they will only test for the most common ones. If they know a relative has a certain type they will start testing from there. Once they knew my relative's type, I got the results fairly quickly from a blood test and the biopsy was all for nothing. Mine was not though genetic testing, but though a specialist. But then after i received my results (which is BMD), they sent me to genetic councilor as well.", "Diagnosed with a Mild Dystrophinopathy this year. 36/M All my life I have had trouble with exercise, muscle cramping, increased CK enzymes and longer than normal timeframe for muscle related healing from exercise or injury. \n\nThis year I finally went all in on testing, complete with a muscle biopsy, first round blood test and finally a full genome test where they discovered I had an in-frame deletion of exons 45-48. My particular dystrophinopathy does not fit into any of the classical definitions of MD and I basically self describe it as a best worst case scenario.   \n\n\nI personally find it very hard to look into support because I know other people have it so much worse than I do and it would make me feel like a fraud to go to any sort of real life support groups since my physical appearance does not indicate any obvious signs of MD. I also understand that people with worse cases of MD would kill to be in my position and that genetic therapies for Duchenne  and Becker would be aiming at making their experiences closer to mine.   \n\n\nI have started physical therapy this year to focus on core training since for the most part my symptoms have focused on the arms and legs. I am finishing up with some extended heart testing at the beginning of the year to make sure I do not have any cardiac issues, since people with my specific type of MD sometimes have heart problems.   \n\n\nI find the concept of dating incredibly frustrating because I live in an area where people are very active outdoors, and while I can walk on flat surfaces for good amounts of time (hours), I find uneven trails/inclines and stairs very challenging. My doctor says I have one of the more optimistic cases they have seen due to my current mobility and age, but the specter of this getting worse as I get older is always in the back of my head.   \n\n\nIs there anyone on here that has been diagnoses with something similar to what I have? I would be interested in hearing about some of your experiences. I am 36 M and also have no obvious outward signs of MD. I have the Emery Dreifuss variant. I too struggle with outdoors stuff like hiking and so on but have found that telling people that and going anyway really is fine. \n\nMy girlfriend sometimes hikes alone. Sometimes I go with her but we go at a slightly slower pace depending on my physical conditions. \n\nI am now back in the gym regularly and have personal training once a week so am getting stronger for sure. \n\nIt may be worth getting tested for Emery Dreifuss as this can cause sudden death through heart failure. We have abnormally low heart rates and typically some kind of afib. I am 38/f and I have LGMD, but it is very mild so far.  I have had symptoms since I was a teenager, but I can still walk pretty well.  Stairs are a nightmare though.  I have the same concerns about dating to be honest and I have not tried since I was diagnosed two years ago.  However, I have seen quite a few people with way faster progression find partners, so I think it is possible.  I think the important thing is to not build your identity around it and to keep having a very wide variety of interests. I luckily have a friend that knows of my condition and is still willing to go hiking with me, at a slower pace than she is used to. I guess the fear is having to re-explain it every time I meet someone new.   \n\n\nOut of curiosity, did you know about your condition prior to meeting your girlfriend? I have seen some women on dating profiles make disclaimers about their longterm disabilities right up front and it is something I am considering doing as it might help to weed out people that just cannot handle it for whatever reason.   \n\n\nAnd on stairs. Going up or down a flight of stairs at the beginning/end of the day is fine, but the problem happens when I need to do a lot in a short amount of time. Just had a holiday party which involved a ton of stairs and my lower calf muscles by the end of the night were a painful wobbly mess. Yep, I have had this diagnosis since 17. Never really had it factor in any of my prior relationships. Well, there are a lot of us that are fairly close to normal, so do not feel bad about reaching out for support I totally understand. 19 M. I have fshd which is a type that effects my face, shoulders, upper arms and legs abdomen and hip muscles. Symptoms and progression as well as onset and which muscles are effected varies greatly in people with fshd. Symptoms usually begin before age 20 but can appear as late as the 50's and as early as infancy. Infantile fshd happens in 5% of people with fshd and it is when facial weakness occurs before age 5. It is known as severe and rapidly progressing most of the time. I have infantile fshd. But somehow im a lot less effected than most all people that have infantile fshd. I cannot run or sqaut. Stairs and getting off of chairs is hard but I can do it. Walking in itself is not that hard but I cannot get up after a fall but luckily I rarely fall. Cannot really lift weights and I am really skinny. But my face barely got effected by fshd. I am so fucking lucky. I cannot raise my upper lip but that is all. My face looks normal and has not been effected in any other way. Over half of people with infantile fshd are in wheelchairs by age 18. I can still walk and I can still work 80 hours a week on my feet the whole time. It is exausting but the fact that I can still do all this is a blessing from God. I got so lucky even though I have it hard. I have a great dating life. People are so accepting of my disability and it actually interests my dates and they help in anyway they can. Honestly I think I am so lucky. Having a positive mindset is what has helped me the most. It makes a huge difference, even if it does not seem like it. Life is what you make it they say. So I try everyday to be inspirational because of fshd. I am going to be a motivational speaker in a few years and that is my biggest dream. 5 years ago I could do gymnastics. I never thought my life would completely change when I turned 16, and my legs became effected and I had to give up gymnastics. But now I realize my true dream and that is to use my disease as inspiration You are probably categorized as BMD, since you are mutation is clearly less severe. But a disease is a disease is a disease, so you should never be ashamed for reaching out just because others have it worse. Everyone needs support and a feeling of not being alone in the world.\n\nI, 37 F was aadiagnosed with mild Dystrophinopathy last year as well.  In my case there is a stop codon in Exon 29 which results in the loss of Dystrophin in the affected cells and would cause DMD-type Dystrophinopathy in males.\n\nI am what they call an (isolated) manifesting female DMD carrier. Probably less than half of my cells still produce normal Dystrophin and shorter gene products (Dp260, Dp147, ... should be still produced).\nA\nMy symptoms were still so mild and unspecific, that I was misdiagnosed with Fibromyalgia about 8 years ago.

I am only 31 and this happened within just a few months as well as eyelid droop.

My neurologist did it for free with Sanofi Genzyme.  My advice is not to do a biopsy prior to a genetic test because they are painful and pointless if they can identify your mutated gene.  My cousin has charcot marie tooth syndrome and has a very happy life. I feel the same way about Nerve Conduction tests.\n\nThey are cheaper than genetic testing, but much less specific and much more error prone. I was tested genetically twice for free.  Honestly, unless they think you might have ALS (chance of that with a 9-year-old is very close to zero), EMGs are probably a waste of time too.  I have had three and I am not interested in doing it again No. There are other tests. I would not have my 9yo do this test. I had it done around this age and it is painful.

When I was young I often found it necessary to warn my friends about my condition just to avoid any rough play. I recommend you pay attention to his heart because it is often affected by bmd, also I am sure you probably heard that but swimming helps alot. But mostly let him live his childhood and treat him like a normal child, even though there will be times when he gets heartbroken. As for you, I know it is harder for you than it is for him, just keep in mind that a person with bmd can live almost a normal life, and if you are as good of a mom as mine (which I am sure you are) he will be just fine,bmd is not that bad :) My son is 28 was diagnosed with BMD at 8.

I just was not sure I would be able to keep up with the time restrictions coming up in the final exam, which is a great program in general.\n\nOver the past few years I have lost at least 50% of my left bicep. My chest muscles are pretty bare as well, leaving my clavicle bones fairly exposed. I have noticed that my thighs are thinning slightly as well. And of course my walking gait has begun to change in the past few years. I can still run somewhat but I am not running every day. I did notice a few weeks ago while riding a bike through slightly hilly terrain, that I was sensing some weakness in my arms and shoulders. Which is not exactly surprising but it was a new sensation.\n\nMy maternal grandfather has MD as well and he is into his 70s and only in the past five years or so has he finally gotten a motorized chair and even a stair lift.\n\nI am not really sure what to expect as this MD continues to move through my body. It feels like a constant shadow with me. Often unseen or noticed by others until I have to lift a heavy object or move a medium weight object over my head.\n\nAnyways that is all I got for now. Take care everybody. Any updates on your situation? I am a 30yo female and I have not been diagnosed, but my father had it and my sister has it, so I am pretty sure that is what is happening to me. I have had chronic pain in my shoulders for about 5 years, but recently noticed that lifting objects is difficult / impossible. Like I can pick stuff up but I cannot bend my elbows to lift it. My arms have to stay straight, if that makes sense. It is really hard to continue going to work in this situation. May I ask what you do for a living? I am a restaurant manager and I feel embarrassed when I cannot carry plates without dropping food or carry a tray of drinks to a table because I cannot bring it down without the whole thing collapsing.  Blessings, thank you for sharing.\n\nThrough school I was working in a kitchen at a bowling alley. Now I am in another kitchen at a movie theatre.\n\nI tend to bring a lot of energy to my work it is just the way I am, and so with not being able to life things I try to compensate by being better at the things I can do: cleaning, filling orders quickly, keeping things prepped. Luckily a majority of the work does not require heavy lifting, some things are a little heavy but over the years I have developed some ways to get things where I want them. But for the most part I am able to get by without much trouble.\n\nIf I am asked to do something I know I will have trouble with I just straight up explain my situation. Unfortunately I have had a lot of practice explaining to others what is happening, I am not doing it all the time but I am pretty good about facing the little twinge of awkward/anxiety that comes with the situation to the point that I am not bothered, it just is what it is.\n\nYeah straight arms, I have that too mostly on my left side where there is very little bicep left.\n\nI also try to keep myself from accepting the situation as final. It is more a spiritual practice, a personal experience in my relationship with my own body. While I see the effects every day I try to hold space I my being for healing, somehow. I am sure it is sounds a bit airy-fairy but anyways.\n\nI have also been doing research on acid and alkaline food. Mostly through YouTube lectures by Dr. Sebi. That is a whole 'nother rabbithole, but the tldr version is that his theory is that all disease is caused by acidic foods which largely includes processed foods, meat, starch.\n\nAnyways that is all I got for now.\n\nPlease take care of yourself.\n\nThank you for sharing and reaching out! So do you ever have energy for activities on your days off? I work five days a week, about 50-60 hours, mostly on my feet. So, on my two days off my body is just so exhausted and I do not have the energy to go do anything. Like, even going to the grocery store. Just do not want to do it. I used to go out all the time - movies, shopping, hanging out with friends. Now I just want to be at home playing video games or watching Netflix. Feels bad. What kind of doctor diagnosed you? I have heard I should see a geneticist from some and others say neurologist. I just do not really know where to start to get a diagnosis and do not want to spend an absurd amount of money to be certain. Thank you for your response!  Originally I was diagnosed at an MDA clinic in Chicago, one of the tests was to measure the muscle enzyme activity in different parts of my body, consisting of measurements by a small electrode or something that goes under the skin for a few moments. Other than getting information about the condition (I do not remember most of the finer details, but the gist is that my muscles are overproducing an enzyme usually helps to break muscles down so they can grow back stronger, that is my limited understanding) there is not much for direct solutions that I have found so far, other than physical therapy, which i have not kept up with over the years. though I was doing some martial arts a while back which was great, and introduced me to tai chi, pa' qua, and push hands!\n\nTangent: Push hands is fantastic I feel especially for my shoulders, I do not do it often enough. It is hard to explain but it is a partner exercise where the aim is to keep your balance while trying to \"uproot\" your partner. It is a great activity, really gets you into your hips and legs. I enjoy it a lot!\n\nA few years later I went to another MDA clinic in a different city, after moving, I did not like my experience with them. I am sure for some people they can be very helpful with funding, equipment, and information, but the doctor I had an appointment was very straightforward that there was not much that could be done. Which is fine, its just that the part that bothered me was how he conducted himself overall. He was clearly more interested in that my last name is the same as a prominent author that he likes, there is no relation, and i have read a few of the books, but I honestly could not give a F\\*. Anyways it really bothered me, and being in their mailing list put magazines in my mailbox with mostly ads for equipment that I am not really in the market for (mobility assistance).\n\nIt just reminds me of how much of an industry everything gets made into. Once again nothing against people that need access to that kind of equipment and services, it is just not where i am at right now. Quite literally I think I will need to be crawling to begin considering anything in that direction. \n\nIt is interesting you bring up energy levels, I am not working nearly as much as yourself so first of all kudos to you. I am at about 30 hours a week. There has been this question though in the back of my mind and you spoke directly to it. Since I do not really talk about it with anyone that much, it is hard for me to tell if i am just tired, lazy, or if maybe (sarcasm) I am dealing with some crazy muscle BS :I\n\nI close on the weekends, I have only had the job since Jan, sometimes I leave around 1230am sometimes (for whatever reason) 3am like last night (ugh), and then I still watch at least one show or play some games, usually not getting to bed till about 3-4 and then not sleeping until 5 or 6 maybe. Then not waking until about 12-1 sometimes. This is all a long way to say that, I notice it seems to take me a few hours to get out of bed. If I have to be up for something I can certainly do that, but if theres nothing pushing me it feels like it can take a while. I just cannot tell if it is a mental thing, but still theres this worn tired feeling in my lower back, hips, neck and shoulders. But once I am up, that is it I am standing, doing what needs to be done no problem. I have been a gamer for a long time, and so I am always ready to push myself through whatever it is :P.\n\nLooking at this condition I am facing as much as it sucks, I try to see what lessons there are. I have chosen to see this experience as one that is telling me to slow down and focus on my healing, and to prioritize that over all things, because I believe as each of us decide to focus on our healing idividually that makes an impact in the healing and well being of our society, planet, cosmos. Our attitude, outlooks, and actions is all we have, and there is much work to be done and peace to be made, we still have our minds and the ability to communicate, the Greater Works we are capable in this life of are still possible. I feel like another lesson is to be able to ask for help, that one is tough!\n\nok off to work! great conversation", "Hello, do you know a treatment cures muscular dystrophy in Japan ?

If insurance will not cover the genetic testing company called Invitae in san francisco will do it for $250 patient pay rate, but it has to be order by a physician. The problem is it could come back inconclusive and unless you are fortunate to have access to one of the handful of true Neuromuscular diagnosticians in the world you may not get a definitive answer. Genetic testing is the only way to get a definitive answer, but interpreting results of genetic test is fraught.\n\nLess then 20% of neuromuscular diseases are responsive to steroids.

His comment about it not being conclusive gives me hope that he is not completely clueless. And, \"Inconclusive\" is a term often used to describe myopathic muscle biopsies, so yet another reason to potentially pursue Collagen VI or XII (I.E. Bethlem myopathy). I agree. Never get a biopsy.  There are a lot of ways to get a free genetic test, especially if you are in the US Awesome, thank you for the information.

I have no family history, and so far, both of my young (4yo and 2yo) sons appear healthy.  But I know it is sex-linked and that sometimes symptoms do not show up until later, so I know I need to get them checked.  I am not sure why previous OBs never offered screening, but they did not.  My next steps are to go to the genetic counselor for my pregnancy, where presumably they will have more information about my carrier status?  I have an appointment with a pediatric genetic counselor to get my two older sons tested so I will have more informations, but they were not able to fit us in until January.\n\nI am not sure why I am posting.

Honestly, anything would be welcome, Did they tell you what type of muscular dystrophy you are a carrier of?  There are quite a few different types with varying severity.   I do believe in the US, they very recently started offering screening.  I have two boys with Duchenne and would be happy to answer any questions about it.  I am also a bit familiar with Becker's, as its similar to Duchenne, though less severe. According to the OB, the initial screen did not given enough specificity to know - from what she told me today, it could be Duchenne, Becker, or X linked DMD associated dilated cardiomyopathy.  I will be going to the genetic counselor Thursday where they will be talking to me about subsequent tests for more clarity, I am not familiar with dilated cardiomyopathy, but let us hope for Becker's.\n\nWith two boys, 2 &amp; 4, even if it is Duchenne, do not be in a panic.  It is a horrible diagnosis, but I really do believe kids that young are going to have a VERY different future than those that were born even 20 years ago.  There is an incredible amount of research going on right now.\n\nOnce you find out for sure, especially if it is Becker's or Duchenne, feel free to post here, or DM me.  I am happy to help you connect with a bunch of resources, and help you understand, from a parent's point of view.  Or if you have any questions now, I will certainly answer what I can.

If kids appear healthy you can not test them just in case, that is called a \"predictive\" test and they can choose to have it themselves if they want from age 16 up, but it is not your choice, certainly the NHS will not do it. If they are showing symptoms, then rather than \"predictive\" it becones a \"diagnostic\" test, and that is allowed at any age We are in the US, so not a concern.  We will be allowed to do the test.

They ordered a genetic test that was completed in September from which they wanted to do a genetic test for Fragile X Syndrome which can be associated with autism just to be safe. \n\nWe had his appointment for the genetic results last Wednesday and you can guess where this is going. We went in with no thoughts in our mind what so ever of DMD or any thing associated with it and left shattered. I am completely and have had a hard time dealing with it. From what i have read online i am not encouraged. They kept mentioning Duchenne's but only because it is the most common type and from what i have read, the worst type. They will be performing a Saliva Test on my wife and my son from there they will narrow the exact diagnosis. Someone, please help me understand what i am in for. \n\nMy Little boy so active, jumps on his little trampoline for hours a day watching Mickey mouse, Runs, plays up and down the stairs all day  and he is so strong and tall for his age. He is healthy, never been sick since he is been born, eats good, etc. Its just impossible to comprehend that he will end up in a wheel chair by the time he is 10 possibly!?!. I spent the first 5 days after learning of this in a drunken daze trying to cope with it. Can Someone here tell me what to expect and how to cope with this? Im still trying to absorb everything and its so overwhelming. What should i be doing right now? They mentioned Cinnciniatti Childrens Hospital is a great place for this. I want to get him the best treatment possible. Someone, anyone please help. Dear father:\nAt first diagnosis of muscular dystrophy, you will feel alone and isolated, You will have trouble breathing, sleeping and you will cry and/or rage.\n\nMy grandson\u2019s Duchenne journey started 3 years ago and one of the first contacts was with the child advocate at the Minneapolis Children\u2019s\nHospital. She was amazing! The first thing, a huge packet of literature was given to his parents. The advocate answered so many questions and helped getting him started.\n\nSomeone at your Drs office should be making arrangements or give you a referral to get your son scheduled at that Children\u2019s hospital.\n\nIf you are on Facebook, you will find many groups such as MDA and PPMD My favorite group is Duchenne under ten. I believe Bruce Ward is the group leader. This group is valuable for so much information. The best thing is everyone is so supportive and knowledgeable.\n\nIt is so very tough, I know.  I pray every day for our boys and their families. Let us not jump to conclusions yet. They are performing a test to figure our which strain of MD it may be. And there are a lot of different versions with differing degrees of seriousness. \n\nIt is going to be difficult but your partner may also need some support. I know my mother blames herself for me and my brother having MD as she was the carrier. \n\nI would look for local support groups and Facebook groups. Join the local MDA (MD Association) and get involved there so you can more easily track progression. Some forms are aggressive, some less so. They also have people you can talk to about it. \n\nWhile life is not easy with MD, it does not have to be terrible either. Also please bear in mind that many of us have MD and are just used to it. We do not feel any different to other kids, that comes much later in life!\n\nI wish you all the best :) from one MD guy to another. Thanks for the kind words. When they mentioned Duchenne's my phone instantly went into my hand. I do not understand why they told us that first. Reading something like that and hearing that news unexpectedly is quite the surprise. I have been reading lots of early stage clinical studies involving gene therapy that look promising. It is 2019, technology is amazing and ever growing. Fingers crossed. When where you diagnosed? What type do you have, if that is not to personal. Thanks! It could be that they have already managed to diagnose Duchennes but are looking to see which particular type has occurred, there are some that are \"surprise\" mutations, others are inherited from parents. So that might be part of the testing, or they may be looking to confirm a diagnoses.\n\nMy particular strain is Emery Dreifuss, which affects my neck, arms, legs and heart. I was diagnosed at 17 after 3 years of testing as all my life I \"walked funny\". I cant straighten my arms, put my chin to my chest or flex my Achilles tendon. I have had a pacemaker since I was 25 to protect my heart and am now 36. \n\nI have every day mild pain (muscle aches etc) and have developed a slight scoliosis from muscle weakness. All in all I live a relatively full life and as I point out to people over and over, I do not know any different, so this just feels normal.\n\nThere will be frustration, anger, despair and a whole host of emotions you and your family will go through. But you will make it through, if nothing else I have developed a new appreciation for life and making the most of the time we have on this planet and whatever form that takes.\n\nEverything feels very final, but just take it in baby steps and you will work it out. Do not be afraid to ask questions, although improving; many doctors are unfamiliar with MD and the varied progressions. Get a physical therapist involved ASAP, keep your son as active as he can be, whatever that level is.\n\nOne last piece of advise, it is very easy to be embarrassed or ashamed (not sure either word quite fits) and I have found personally that \"owning it\" has made my life a million times better. If I am upfront about my limitations people are much more polite and reasonable around me. The awkwardness comes from people knowing there is something wrong, but they dont want to ask the question.

My voice is rather high and I have noticed that a lot of people I know also sound higher than most people - though not all men and none of the women with MD that I know. Can MD have that effect on voice pitch? It may depend on what type of MD you have. I have OPMD and my voice is pretty deep. It is weak but relatively deep. Hi, my brother had MD, and I believe it does. Growing up, his voice seemed to get higher and higher as he grew older. You are right. The parts of the body that seem to control how deep your voice are are the throat and diaphragm. If your form of Muscular Dystrophy affects those muscles (either directly or indirectly) I would expect your voice to become higher, because your control over your diaphragm is weaker. I do not have any evidence to back this up, but possibly the fact that a lot of people with MD are prescribed steroids could have something to do with it? I definitely would say those with MD have higher voices than most. And age of onset of symptoms.

I am a 20 year old woman who has recently gotten diagnosed with fshd (facioscapulohumeral dystrophy). Actually, I was 19 when they ran the tests, and my neurologist diagnosed me on my birthday. Awesome, right?\n\nAnyway, at the time before I was diagnosed, I was exercising frequently doing Crossfit. This involved a lot of high intensity training and heavy olympic weightlifting and I loved it. I took a break from Crossfit as I was going through physical therapy right after I was diagnosed - solely to regain more mobility within my shoulders and arms. My physical therapist said not to do anymore heavy overhead lifting, as I tend to hyperextend my back to make up for the muscle weakness from my arms. Now I mainly run and do lots of leg and core work. But my arms are falling a little bit short. \n\nSoooo, I was wondering, since I ABSOLUTELY loved picking heavy things up and putting them down, what would be an alternative to Crossfit?

The dried leaves of this tree, used in traditional medicine \n\n#####Wiki:\n\n* (\n\n#####NIH:\n\n* ( (complete copy below)\n\n&gt; **Kratom**\n&gt; \n&gt;Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tree in the coffee family, found in Thailand and other tropical countries. Traditionally, in Southeast Asia, people have chewed its leaves or made them into a tea that is used to fight fatigue and improve work productivity. Kratom has also traditionally been used during religious ceremonies and to treat medical conditions such as pain and diarrhea, sometimes as a substitute for opium.\n&gt; \n&gt;Two compounds in kratom leaves, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, interact with opioid receptors in the brain, producing sedation, pleasure, and decreased pain when taken in high doses. Lower doses cause alertness instead of sedation.\n&gt; \n&gt;Some people in Western countries use kratom to try to treat pain or manage opioid withdrawal symptoms.\n\n&gt; **Bottom Line**\n&gt; \n&gt;There have not been any clinical trials (studies in people) to evaluate the health effects of kratom. There is currently no clinical research to determine if kratom is an effective or safe treatment for opioid addiction.\n&gt;\n&gt;Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, kratom is considered a new dietary ingredient since it was not marketed as a dietary ingredient in the United States before October 15, 1994; evidence of safety is required for new dietary ingredients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has seized some shipments of kratom products. Some commercial forms of the drug are sometimes laced with other compounds that can be toxic and cause death.\n&gt;\n&gt;***In August 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced its intent to temporarily place the two main active ingredients in kratom in Schedule I. Substances in Schedule I are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse;*** examples include heroin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). ***In October 2016, the DEA withdrew this proposed action, citing numerous comments from the public. The DEA will consider public comments as well as a scientific and medical evaluation by the FDA before deciding whether to proceed with permanent or temporary action regarding kratom\u2019s active ingredients.***\n&gt; \n&gt; **Safety**\n&gt; \n&gt;Although people may use kratom to try to overcome opioid addiction, kratom itself may be addictive. People may build up a tolerance to it (they may need higher doses to achieve the same effect), and long-term users may experience withdrawal symptoms if they stop using it.\n&gt;\n&gt;Studies in experimental animals suggest that high doses of kratom may be less likely than high doses of opioids to be fatal. However, some deaths in people have been linked to kratom. Typically, they have involved the use of kratom in combination with opioids or various prescription or over-the-counter drugs.\n&gt;\nA variety of side effects of kratom have been reported. They include anxiety, irritability, and increased aggression, which may be related to the drug\u2019s stimulant effects; and sedation, nausea, constipation, and itching, which may be related to its opioid-like effects. Increased pigmentation of the cheeks, tremor, loss of appetite, weight loss, and psychosis have been seen in long-term kratom users.

Or does anyone have any insight into this exact deletion? \n\nAll help is appreciated! I am sorry you are having to go through this. I do not want to put more stress in your life but you deserve to get a real answer. Mostly when an exon deletion occurs on the dystrophin gene it is usually either Duchenne or Beckers muscular dystrophy.  Women can carry the gene mutation but rarely ever show anything from it, other than possible heart irregularities. This is because the mutations only show up on X chromosome and girls have 2 and boys only have one, meaning the problem shows up in boys. Try not to google too much it is a dark hole, talk with a neurologist. I have two boys with duchenne muscular dystrophy and they are my world. Do not worry too much and congratulations on the baby, everything will work out. Hello, sorry to hear that. I have two sons. My wife has duplication and our situation is a unique one and we have not seen an similar detection in any gene database. But the gene is a big one and there are some many cases like these. \nHer sisters have boys but they do not have dmd. So you should definitely wait for the results of your test. \nHope everything is ok. Sorry to hear about your situation. The fact that the deletion has not been observed in anyone is probably why they are telling you it is likely pathogenic \u2014 benign mutations tend to spread in the population, so if it has not been observed anywhere it is more likely that it is one that causes problems, and makes people who carry it less likely to reproduce.", "Spinal Muscular Atrophy Adult onset This type hit me in my 30's.

My heart goes out to everyone facing this extreme struggle. If you looked at me,, muscular dystrophy would be the last thing you would think as I have ran 13 miles before and have ran a mile at 7:30 time and can do 15 perfect form pushups and 1 pull ups, however I can barely do a squat and cannot run fast. I wanted to know if I can do physical exercise more vigorously and if that would help me in the long run or hurt me. I have a very strong and tough mind and being physically fit has been something I always wanted to achieve but it just hurts too much and I just push myself too far sometimes that I get worried I am doing more harm than good but I feel stronger. I eat very healthy very little sugar, natural cooked food no processed foods. My dream job is a DEA agent but I am afraid my condition will not let me get there. Its very hard to want to give it your all and push yourself further than any other  only to get kicked in the face and not see results and maybe even make it worse. When ever I see someone else I know if they wanted they could start anytime to exercise and see improvement but they lack the discipline and mental strength. Have a good day and I hope you are able to stay happy in your life. I exercise every single morning, but I do not life any weights. Just rowing or swimming.  It has not caused any issues so far, but I think if you tear at your muscles it will be a problem.  I have had LGMD symptoms for about 20 years and I have a pretty normal life. My advice is to focus more on your intellect, because MD cannot take it away There are fairly specific guidelines that my doctors have related to me for exercise.\n\nBasically:\n\n1. Do not do resistance training on muscles that cannot resist gravity (for example, I can barely do the biceps curl motion, so that is out).\n\n2. Do not exercise to the point of causing delayed muscle soreness. (They previously were saying to keep number of reps low for resistance exercise, but I guess they changed the advice to basically just avoid hurting yourself.)\n\n3. Focus on exercises with concentric motion, avoid emphasizing eccentric motion (basically do not do negatives/just focus on the movements that contract the muscles).\n\n4. Cardio is fair game, just do not push do hard that it hurts you. (Where I am at now, I find it useful to break up activity, exercise the legs, rest them while moving more upper body, and alternate.)\n\nWhen I was younger I did manage to build some extra strength (as a teenager I lifted weights before I was diagnosed at almost 18).  But like you I also pushed myself too hard quite often.\n\nI always recommend going easy on your body, when you have a strong will and push yourself a lot, it is easy to start ignoring signals from your body that you should slow down and treat yourself better. Much better to listen to your body's feedback. As conditions like BMD progress it becomes more important to listen to your body. Bad habits established early in life can also be hard to break.\n\nMy other big mistake was always resisting the use of new mobility aids. Happened when I first got a cane, then when I switched to forearm crutches, and later wheelchairs. At every step I have kicked myself for not doing it sooner.\n\nSounds like you are much stronger than I was at my peak strength, which was close to your age. My son is 17 and he has BMD, he is just had to give up rugby after 5 years of playing as it is damaged his heart in the scrums. My only advice is to find something that does not have a high impact on your body. Good luck and do not let this condition spoil your dreams. I do not have anything to add to the fitness side, but just to agree with your point about mobility aids (and arguably other aids - shower seat or grab rail etc). They are there to assist. If you would benefit from it OP (and notice I said benefit, not *need*) get them. You are absolutely allowed to use things to help you at various points, and not all the time. You should always talk to your specialist before doing anything that might affect muscles when you have some sort of myopathy, but I will give you my take for what it is worth. I have a son with DMD, and I have done a fair bit of reading about DMD/BMD over the past ten years and I also exercise fairly regular (just not over the past two months, unfortunately).\n\nFirst, good on you for being able to manage even a single pull up. I know plenty of able-bodied folks that cannot pull that off. But someone else in the thread mentioned issues with negatives, and I think in the long term pull ups might be risky. My wife (DMD carrier) has a nagging injury from a partial tear of her bicep that occurred when she was doing negatives (she could not quite manage a full pull up, so I suggested negatives as a interim). The doctor at ortho said that it is a common injury with pull ups, especially when the bicep is slightly weaker. You might want to consider resistance bands instead, they are fairly inexpensive and you can do more reps of seated lat pulldowns instead of the pullups to try and build endurance (instead of shredding your muscle with high resistance/weight, low rep sets).\n\nBMD and DMD both have some slight change (more with BMD, I believe) based on the location of the mutation in the gene, but my understanding is that BMD produces a truncated, but functional dystrophin protein. Again, my understanding, but that would mean over-exertion could be problematic for the muscle tissue (resulting in rhabdo or similar rapid breakdown), but the main issue to be mindful of is cardiac related. You need to make sure you are going to a neuromuscular clinic (like the MDA) at least annually to get checked out.\n\nI do not know what the requirements are for the DEA. Most local LEO entrance tests require mostly endurance tests, so if the feds are roughly the same you might not have to give up on your dreams. 7:30 is a pretty decent mile. From memory, local LEO required 3 miles in 27 minutes, and that was one of the more strenuous requirements. Do not take my word for it, but I do not think you should give up on your dreams just yet. Yes I do annually get checked up by a neurologist annually and they say I am in excellent condition but they do not really tell me much other than that so,I have done my own research on the condition. I also think that if I eat super healthy throughout my life I could maybe get more years to live also I really really emphasize on my mental strength because I read a story on Wim Hof who did breathing exercises and used his tremendous mental strength to overcome the illnesses like the flu they injected into him. Also I like to go outside in cold weather just to try and resist the cold by calming my mind and focusing on my breathing which has worked really well because while everyone else is shivering I am dont seem to mind the cold (not crazy cold like 16 degrees). I hope that if I develop a strong control over my mind and body as well as eating good it might help the condition.   What is the estimated time frame you guys think a cure will be found? 2-5 years? 10-15? Discipline and eating well goes a long way regardless of everything else you have going on, so definitely keep that up. But idk man, I do not think you can overcome the flu with breathing exercises, that sounds a little suss to me.\n\nThere are a lot of dietary supplements you could look at as well. Curcumin, coq10, idebenon, ashwaghanda, arginine...I had a list at one point but do not know where I stashed it. I do not know how much they help, but it is another avenue to explore.\n\nWe had some bad experiences with the local neurologists at our MDA clinic. One of them did not seem to have any idea how exon skipping works, tried to steer us towards a trial for our son that was not meant for his mutation. Overall it seemed like the doctors there were more geared towards serving adult populations with ALS, which is how it goes I guess when you group a lot of different (but similar) diseases under one umbrella. Point is, if your neuro is not supporting the work you are trying to do, find a new one. Yeah I dont believe the flu thing 100% I just heard it but I definitely think you could reduce the effects but I cannot say I tried that so cant confirm it. Also I do take ashwaganda but not daily because my brother bought it and said it helps you remember things or something like that. My clinic is not so bad I think they just do not have anything to tell me since I dont have threatening problems. They do a lung test and a heart test every couple of years and they say it looks healthy.

I have been diagnosed with MD since I was two but was told it fell into the congenital myopathy grouping.\n\nI have had two biopsies now and have a pathology report from the most recent one, which as far as I can tell is inconclusive, but that was about 15 years ago. I am hoping there is more info to learn, if not a full diagnosis, but I am not sure what questions I should ask at this point. Any suggestions?  Could you ask your neurologist to request some genetic testing?  Maybe. I am currently living away from my normal area for a few months so I am trying to get into the nearest MDA clinic while I am here and hoping they will be able to do something.  Hopefully they can point you in the right direction and you get some answers. I know it is frustrating not knowing. Best of luck to you.  Thank you. I have been fine not knowing most of the time but recently I have just wanted to know.  Panel sequencing (a form of genetic testing) is likely your first next step.  It is coming down in price significantly, which is probably going to be an out of pocket expense as most insurance companies will not pay for genetic testing for adults.  Invitae, a genetic testing company, just dropped their patient pay rate to $250.  The testing you are looking for looks something like this:  and while I do like to promote Invitae for situations like this (no I do not work for them), there are several other genetic testing labs who also offer CM panel testing (Emory, Prevention, MNG, University of Chicago to name a few). \n\nIf your results from a CM panel test come back inconclusive, your next step will be to get in touch with the Bonnemann team at the NIH. This group specializes in diagnosing congenital muscle disorders.  Getting an appointment can sometimes take up to a year, but your visit will be well worth the wait.\n\nI manage the Congenital Muscle Disease International Registry (cmdir.org) and have a fair bit of experience in the diagnostics of congenital myopathy (I myself have a form of CM, and was not genetically confirmed until age 38).  Feel free to get in touch if I can be of additional service. Interesting, I did not know about any of that. Thank you.  Get to your nearest MDA clinic or even call them from wherever you are.

Maybe you could trim it with some scissors just so it is not poking out and getting caught on things? I would definitely try your best to leave it alone and not pull it out. I cannot imagine how annoying it would be. Hang in there! \\(I am a bit late to the party with this one\\) I would get down to your local doctor if you can, they will be able to trim it safely and also confirm that it is actually a bit of stitching and nothing untoward", "Information about the clinical trial EPIDYS by Italfarmaco for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy Hello everyone,\n\nfirst of all, we would like to introduce ourselves: we at admedicum are experts from various disciplines, such as health sciences, pharmacy and psychology, and some of us are patient representatives ourselves. We are committed to ensuring that the interests of patients are better integrated into the research, development and provision of health services. You can also read more about us on our website:\u00a0(\u00a0\n\nI am writing to you today to share information about a clinical trial for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Behind the clinical study called \"EPIDYS\" stands the Italian company Italfarmaco, which is researching in the field of DMD. In the study described above, the researchers are investigating how well a new drug - Givinostat - works and how safe it is. More information about participation possibilities and questions about the study can be found on the study website\u00a0(\u00a0\n\nBest regards,\u00a0\n\nMarina Rempel (admedicum)", "POV: MDA fundraising event from the viewpoint of a muscular dystrophy patient  Amazing \ud83d\udc9a", "Is there anything you wish your middle school teacher had known? Hello, everyone. I am a teacher's assistant in a public school (not in the US), and I have been assigned to help meet a child with Duchenne's (DMD) educational needs. I am going to meet him tomorrow and I have been doing my best to research for scholar trajectories of kids with DMD, but I figured I could also get help from this sub. So, is there anything you wish you could tell your teacher, or that wish your teacher had known, when you were in school?\n\nSome details: he is in early middle school and I will NOT be in charge of things such as helping him with self-care, going to the bathroom, etc. My job is to help him with his EDUCATIONAL needs, such as helping the class teacher have classes that are accessible to his disability. His doctor has recently told him to start using a wheelchair, but so far he refuses (and we are not going to force him to). That is all I know about him for now. \n\nThank you in advance to anyone who replies! :) You are a good egg. I do not have much advice because my disease manifested later in life (FSHD).\n\nI suppose teach him to advocate for himself. For instance,  I sometimes work in courtrooms and I need a computer because it is hard to take notes with my hands. Thank you for your comment! Just to be clear, you mean advocate for himself as in fighting to get accomodations? Yes. Advocate for himself. People just do not think about it.  It is not that they are being mean or callous. But being disabled is not their lived experience. \n\nAlso once you get past the cruelty of middle school,  people are generally helpful. We have two boys, one in high school and one in middle school, with DMD.  Especially if he is understanding the work, consider less homework.  Writing can be tiring. \n\nDepending on his medical care, he will likely miss school for appointments, and depending on treatments, it could be several days at a time.   As a parent I do not mind going over the work while they are away from school, but just being aware and flexible makes these times easier on the entire   family.\n\nIf the parents are okay, reach out and ask if there are any specific things they have concerns about.  And feel free to ask me.  I am happy to share.\n\nEdit:. Fixed autocorrect issues thank you so much! that is all great advice. will do This is the most reassuring post I have ever seen! I was under investigation for a NMD in middle school but was not formerly diagnosed until age 19. Middle school would have been a more joyful time if my teachers were a bit more cognizant of the psychosocial price of my disease \u2014 particularly the academic and social experiences I was left out of.\n\nIt sounds so silly now, but I still remember the heartbreak of being in the hospital when the other kids in my class did a painting project for our 8th grade graduation, or being left out of a big running challenge night, or having the school assume I could not go on an overnight field trip (when it was actually possible for me with accommodations)! By and large my teachers were lovely, but I wish I could have told many of them that despite my medical history I just wanted to be a kid. You should probably read about cognitive and behavioural impacts of altered dystrophin in the brain for some people as well as the physical things.

Today would have been his 21st birthday...this is what I wrote him. Here is to remembering one of the kindest, strongest and epic person i have ever known. Here is to you my brother. Bret, a kind, gentle, and innocent spirit. All who knew him, knew him as a fun loving, easy going, smart as can be nerd. He was unique, bright, and quite Sauv\u00e9 with the ladies. He had many girlfriends even before I started to like girls. And he did not mind the occasional fart joke. He not only touched your heart with his laughter, but with how sweet and caring he was. It was his love for animals, games, as well as his family and friends that left a mark on any person that met him. And Although he knew of the darkness and evil in life, all he wanted was for people to know love and peace. Even being dealt a rough hand in life, he wanted everyone, the world, to never judge and hate. He was an optimist if I have ever known one, Always looking at the bright side of things. As with anyone, his strength faltered from time to time, but he always picked his head up, and trudged on. Never being angry at someone that did not understand, I can truly say with my all of heart that I would not be the person I am today if it was not for his compassion, strength, and ability to forgive. I only wish that he could have taught the world what he has taught me. But I do not worry, he is doing so now with no limitations. I know he is sad that his time on earth was short, as we all are, but somewhere, I know he is playing, smiling, and laughing. I know he is with us in spirit and in our hearts, and in some of moms grey hairs. I made a promise to him that I am going to be strong for him, for my mother, and my family. I promised that I was going to be the best damn father that I can be. Promises I will keep even when time itself has stopped flowing. Bret, please watch over us. Help us to travel our paths in safety and in health. You taught us that there is nothing stronger then the bonds of family and friendship, to laugh and love, and to always forgive. I am going to miss you. Not a day will pass that I, our family, and our friends will not be thinking of you, hoping you are running, jumping and having the most epic of adventures . Do not worry my brother, we will be okay. Because of you, we are stronger people. Connected and together because of your loving and vibrant soul , we push on. We look to the future with optimism and hope.

Hi - I know you are freaked out right now but I do not think there is enough information here to make any conclusions about what is going on. A diagnosis of MD often involves looking at a biopsy result, genetic result, and a physical examination and history in combination. Biopsy results can be subjective, it can really depend on the expertise of the pathologist looking at the slides. Hopefully you will get more information from the physician you  see next week. If that physician does not seem to have much expertise in neuromuscular conditions I would ask to see someone who does. Thank you. I am sorry that you are angry and afraid, but this is a sub for people with MD, so maybe not the best place to go nuclear and share your euthanasia plan.  I do not use a wheelchair, but I do not think less of someone is image because they do and I certainly do not pity them at a bar.

I went through the same kind of feelings with you but I was 18 at in university when I was diagnosed. I was angry, hurt, emotionally broken and a whole load of other things. \n\nAll I could think was that I would be in a wheelchair and require assistance for the rest of my life. The idea of having a pacemaker in my early 20s was enough to make me upset. \n\nThen I got the pacemaker fitted. I went out that evening and had a couple of beers with my friends and joked around and realized that nothing much had changed. \n\nI still played sports, I still hung out at bars, met girls and had fun. \n\nIt seems so impending but I now am on my second pacemaker am almost 38 and doing ok. Plans change. Just do what you can. If you cannot pass the physical then you will find something else. I was going to be a lawyer and ended up in IT. I have travelled around the world, moved countries and have been living in the USA for almost 10 years now. \n\nThis is not to show off, life is not rigid.

My mind is a bit of a whirlwind rn. Therapy.. its amazing... there is a reason so many people are in therapy, because everyone needs it :P Desmin myopathy person here. \n\nCompletely normal to be freaked out. Mine started out mild and subtle. It can stay that way or it can progress. I am 24 and just now seeing significant progression. \n\nI would have more testing done. \n\nIf you reproduce there is at least a 50% chance your child could get it. It is been recommended that I do not reproduce. \n\nIt is unfortunate, but your career and life expectancy are affected. Letting go of those plans and being open to new plans that could be just as good can be hard to do, but completely worth it.\n\nThink of it as more of a change of plans, than a death sentence. You can still do things, you might just have to do them differently and be willing to adapt. \n\nThere is no timeline. \nAggravating the muscle over and over is what causes it to weaken, slow and steady helps you maintain. \n\nDo not pity yourself and do not take the pity from others, your life is not over, and it will not affect you unless you start showing symptoms of being affected. Having a diagnosis is just that, having a diagnosis. If / or when symptoms come, adapt. Take preventative measures now to slow any possible progression, be mindful. \n\nBeing afraid is natural, immediately wanting to go into a have medically assisted suicide if you have to be in a wheelchair is something you might want to consider thinking about why you immediately equate wheelchair with awful life. Your life can be just as fulfilling sitting (or standing, they have those now, ya know?) in a wheelchair. \n\nIf you are not bound to a wheelchair by now, chances are with (if you have it) your disease pattern is that you would be a part time user later on in life. \n\nYou have made it to your early 30\u2019s without significant heart problems or muscle problems associated with it, your outcome has much better potential than the rest of us with this.", "ProSoma: Logical Approach to Manage the Muscular Pain \nProSoma 350mg is the number one drug that is used for the treatment of muscles associated injury, spasms, stresses or sprains.

However, she continues to treat me like I am stupid and constantly makes comments about how is she thinks that I am falling short as a parent.\n\nObviously I am going to have to deal with her in some capacity for the next 18 years because she is my son's Aunt so how do I deal with her? I have never really liked her anyway because she is a busybody who has no problem telling other people how they should be living. She also creates drama wherever she goes. Even my mother-in-law has told me this. She seems to be worse with me though. I guess she thinks that disabled means completely helpless and incompetent parent and completely stupid.\n\nHow do I deal with the comments without creating more drama? How do I stand up to her in a way that makes her realize that I am not stupid and I am not an incompetent parent and I have not going to sit back and let her treat me like that anymore? How have you dealt with people like this? Thanks for any advice. I would have a sit down and discuss ableism and how it affects you. Maybe open the floor to questions and open up about her prejudices. How do you respond now?

I recommend this book.\n\nI am sorry you are dealing with this. Tell her in no uncertain terms that this is an inherited genetic disease - not something you did to yourself and while you appreciate her concern; if you want her help, you will ask for it and that she is being offensive in the way she is dealing with you.  \n\nNip it in the bid and do not worry about how she takes it. I guess I am just going to start doing that thanks. Like just keep gently reminding her that I know how to do all this stuff and if she does not stop then I may have to get nasty with her. I have noticed that she is the type of person that if anyone calls her out on her BS suddenly she is the victim which leads me to believe that she may have some degree of narcissism. I will definitely check out that book. Thank you for the recommendation. I will definitely do that. I will let her know that it is really offencive and that she is being ableist and you are right, I am not going to worry about how she takes it. She is the one who is being offencive and I should not have to make her feel comfortable. She needs to learn about disability and how to stop assuming things about people who are. I should not have to go out of my way to make her comfortable when she is in the wrong here. I am not going to worry about how she takes it. Not my problem. \n\nShe needs to learn to stay in her lane. That is a problem that I have heard that a lot of people have with her. I have heard that she treats everybody the same way and she does to a degree but I noticed that it is worse with me. Like she will literally stand over me trying to micromanage everything I do and I think I am going to take your advice and let her know that it is gotten way past offencive a long time ago and that she needs to back off and not care if she wants to play the victim like she usually does any time anyone calls her out and wants to storm off. Not my problem. \n\nShe needs to learn to think before she opens her mouth. It seems to me that she never learned that just because it pops into your head does not mean it needs to come flying out of your mouth. Like I said, she has said that she is never been around a disabled person before so she does not know how to act but you would think that there would be some small part of her brain that would go I am probably being really rude right now but she does not seem to be self-aware enough to realize that she is being rude and offensive.\n\n I do not like her anyway because she is a busybody and creates drama wherever she goes and has no problem telling other people how they should be living but like I said, it is worse with me. She literally seems to think that I cannot manage my own life at all and need 24-hour care. If I can manage taking care of a 14 month old, pretty sure I can handle my own life. Sorry, I kind of started to vent there and ramble on but it is just been so frustrating. I have put up with it for three and a half years.\n\n The good news is that my mother-in-law understands and has even complained about her to me behind her back before and says that she is tired of her coming over to the house thinking she runs the show. I told her that if she gets tired of her, she can always send her home. I do not understand how she thinks she can come into other people's homes and tell them how to live. She is lucky as her mother because where I come from, that is a good way to get yourself kicked out of somebody is house and told to never come back.\n\n I guess she thinks that because it is her mother, she can get away with doing it. It pisses me off because my mother-in-law is 64 years old and again, I am pretty sure she can run her own life without my sister-in-law's input but she seems to think that everybody cares what she thinks. Sometimes I want to tell her, not everybody cares what your opinion is so maybe you should learn to, you know, keep it to yourself. If you have not noticed I cannot stand her LOL. Sorry, rant over. Thanks for reading. I cant even give a solid piece of advice because I would just snap. I cant stand someone standing over my shoulder. However I would consider having your s/o help bridge the gap here. He does now. At first I did not tell him what was going on because I wanted to keep the peace but he did confront her a few times and tell her to back off but of course she denied ever saying anything to me. I think that either she is really self-absorbed, well I know she is self-absorbed too but I think maybe she really thought she was trying to help but honestly I think she knew exactly what she was doing. I just got tired of her micromanaging me and treating me like I was stupid. I will never understand why people see a physical disability and automatically assume that we know nothing about life and how to take care of ourselves and our children. I avoid toxic people.  The more intolerable they are the less I interact or go near them.  Your mental sanity is important. I agree. I have literally paid for a hotel for the weekend in the past just to avoid her. I refuse to be around her anymore. If I know she will be staying the weekend I leave. The only other thing I do is loudly point out their bad behavior .  Followed by potential reasons no evil person would say yes to.  Make the last suggestion a extremely dumb or ignorant reason and say it must be that. Thanks, I am going to try that lol. \ud83d\ude08 Alternatively when she wants to help, let her.  Pile on the tasks you need help with making her rue the day she ever offered to help.  Be so kind and ingratiating and explain how much it helps. If she decides to help again something more complicated is going on, and you may need to be nicer. Let her know you will not deal with her disrespect. You have enough to deal with. Do not let anyone treat you less than. If she is not helping with compassion she can move around. Thank you I have met some ableist people, I have been around them a lot. How I act is I call them out on everything, I never let them get away with saying something ableist and especially to me. I like to tell them straight to their face that there a pathetic excuse for a human being and try to dissociate myself with them as much as possible, let them know you do not want to be around them. If they keep watching over me treating me like a sub par human, I let them know they are not helping and that they are acting repulsive. If it is a close family member, I be a little more gentle but that is what I do with most of them. And I have done this to family members, a ableist is a ableist no matter what. I know I am pretty extreme in my views of ableist people, but hopefully people can take something out of it. I guess I am going to have to try that with her. It seems like with some people, being nasty is the only way to get your point across. I have tried everything else and nothing seems to be working.

I have been looking for information as my Nephew in Poland has received a couple blood tests done a few months apart with CK measuring 19000 and ALT and AST AT 500 and 300 respectively. I realize that this is an indication of muscle degeneration but nothing conclusive. He does run on his toes but by all other counts he seems perfectly normal. He is 5 years old and his mother is quite frightened. A doctor has told her that he is 99% sure that he has Duchenne\u2019s. But I wonder if this can be surmised without other tests and a biopsy perhaps. She has little faith in Polish healthcare and is insistent upon getting a genetic test done but not sure how to advise. For those of you who experienced this stage, what were typical next steps?\n\nReally, thanks for any information. \n\nJ I have 3 boys with Duchenne\u2019s and when my youngest was tested at 6 months his CK was around 3000. My oldest was 6 and his was 15000. It sounds like Duchenne\u2019s to me. Does he walk upstairs one step at a time? Does he use the gower maneuver (where he pushes on his thighs) to get up from the floor? I had my boys all genetically tested and they all have an Exon deletion on the dystrophin gene 53-55, which confirmed they had Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I am so sorry if he does. My oldest (age 10 now) just recently was not able to walk anymore and it is devastating. I am so sorry if it is Duchenne\u2019s. Thanks for the response, really really. I do not know a lot of details on how he ascends stairs or gets up. It is been over a year since I have seen him (covid) but nothing sticks out. His mother is waiting to have a genetic test done but apparently that will not happen for another three months (why I am not sure). \n\nI guess I am just a bit clueless. Obviously it must run in one of the parent\u2019s families? Or could it be a product of paternal age at conception (my brother was around 41/42). \n\nI am sorry to hear about your boys. I have no experience with MD but I imagine it is tough. I cannot even comprehend the strength you must have. But I am sure they are wonderful boys and strength is an afterthought. Gower's, enlarged calves, frequent falling were the main signs with our son. He was around the same age. Cannot tell you how much I read trying to figure out something else it could be. There are a couple of other things that can mimic some of the symptoms. Inflammatory myopathies (autoimmune or otherwise) can create inflated cpk/ast/alt, and iirc there is a form of hypothyroidism that can create some of the other symptoms as well, but the tip toe walking is a marker for DMD.\n\nThe only way to know for sure is to have blood drawn. I do not know if it has changed, but it was around 6 or 7 vials for the test, and they told us it could take up to a month for a result. The waiting was the real killer, but it ended up coming back within a week. They will test for mutations in the most common ranges first. From what I have kept up with, most of the treatment options are targeted towards deletions in the middle range of the gene. Pray you do not have issues in the very beginning or very end, where the protein attaches to the muscle cell, because the research for treatments in those areas is lagging behind.\n\nI saw you were asking about carriers. My wife's mother refused to get tested so we do not know for sure, but no one that my wife knows about has it in her family. It is not impossible for the mutation to be passed down for several generations without manifesting, but it is more likely in those cases that it was a spontaneous mutation in the mother. It is x-linked, which means her mother should get tested first. If the child in question has any sisters, they should be tested at some point. Really helpful. Thanks so much for this. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe No problem. Feel free to ping me in DM if there are any other questions. I do not know what the health care situation is like in Poland, and I hit a kind of fatigue point in hoping for some kind of cure a few years ago, so I may not have all of the current info on treatment options on the horizon, but not much else is going to be different from 10 years ago when our son was diagnosed. I have two boys with DMD, they were essentially diagnosed by their CK levels ( think 18,000 and 22,000).  The genetic testing came shortly after which confirmed it, and identified the mutation.  This is really important now more than ever as there are treatments out there for some of the mutations.\n\nDMD is genetic and 2/3 of cases are passed on from a carrier mother.  The other 1/3 are spontaneous.  It would not have gotten passed on from an unaffected father.\n\nAt 5 she should try to get him tested as soon as she can.  The standard treatment (steroids) are best started early.  As well, there are quite a few trials going on right now, especially for the younger guys.  Not that a few months is a long time to wait, but the sooner the better. Really appreciate it. I am helping her out from afar and all of this is insanely valuable. Her texts to me get progressively sadder and I can sense the emotion she is feeling, especially since she is a single mom. Thank you thank you The bad news is that based on what everyone above has already told you this sounds like Dmd.  The good news is that there are many trials available around the world that the boy might be able to participate in. There is no cure but there is hope. \n\nThere are many trials with very promising approaches. Since he is young time is on his side. \n\nAs mentioned above the standard of Care is high dosage of steroids which can delay the deterioration of the body and keep the boy out of a wheel chair for an extra couple of years. \n\nThe mother should be tested because she is likely a carrier and therefore any future children will have to be through an ivf type method. \n\nThey can contact project parent Poland chapter who can help them with information locally. \n\nOn a more personal note. This is the most difficult news for a parent to hear. It will take them a while to digest and they will need a lot of help so please try to be there for them. They will need all of the support they can get. Stepping back in here as I have been chatting with the mother. I have relayed a bunch of information and that steroids are the first step in treatment but she seems highly reluctant due to 1) perceived side effects of steroids at his age and 2) that he seems fine. \n\nI know that these are feelings that stem from trepidation and some lack of knowledge.  Admittedly though, I also do not know what these steroids do to a young child. What was your experience? Steroids absolutely have significant side effects, but it is considered the best thing for them.   There is a new one in trials that looks to reduce the side effects normally associated with steroids.  \n\n\nThis is the PPMD standards of care which is a great resource.    Thanks for those resources by the way.  I checked for Karl\u2019s specific missing Exons and found that there is a clinical trial (global as he is in Poland) for his specific condition. And it was approved by the fda. All great news.  He is 6 however and the trial is looking for ages 7-21 I think. What do these exon skipping therapies do?\n\nHis mother says that her neurologist is surprised that he is not showing or hindered in any way yet and thinks that perhaps the genetic test and blood test could be wrong. \n\nI am feel uneasy feeling dubious about the doctor\u2019s position but I am also not a doctor nor a doctor in Poland. \n\nShe is going to get Karl on steroids after the summer.  \n\nThanks for everything Exon skipping is essentially telling the body to skip another exon (or potentially several) to restore what is called the reading frame.    There is a good explanation here:\n\n(\n\nIt is known that some deletions seems to progress a little slower than others.  I believe some deletions very early on in the gene, as well as some other key ones.  My children have a deletion of exon 45 which seems to be one of those.  \n\nAs for the age, things can vary quite a bit.  Our oldest missed all the big milestones by quite a bit (sitting up, walking, etc), but at age probably 4-8 there probably was not a lot most people would see.

Neither she nor the father are carriers for FSH. Is it possible that one twin could have FSH due to a mutation and the other twin not have it at all?\n\nThank you in advance! Just guessing but I think if twins are identical, they have the exact same genetic makeup.  They became twins after a single embryo spits in two. \nIf twins are fraternal, fertilization occurred with two different eggs and so each embryo would develop with a 50/50 chance of having FSH.  Could be wrong.   I had the same thought. Though I know some fraternal twins can pass as identical. This is, also, assuming they inherit FSH from their parent (whereas I am more interested in the mutation aspect).\n\nThank you for your input :D I seen an article about 2 twins, 1 of which has FSH.

Awwe my little buddy lives on my wheelchair too.", "Great article ", "I need some guidance with a patient Hello, I hope this is appropriate for this thread. I am a medical social work student and I have a young patient (27/m) with MD (based on some previous threads, I realized I need to find out what type). I have been working with him for a little over a week and I have been having a hard time connecting with him. He is very quiet, does not have friends or socialize in any way. I would like to help him, while he is in my care. I have been able to find out that he likes gaming so I have been trying to find some online communities for him to connect to to be able to add some social aspects to his life to see if that could help him. Based on the research I have done his affect seems to correlate with the MD, as a lot of diff research has stated that MD can affect mental health as well. I am open to any suggestions on how to approach this patient in order to help him. I wanted to approach him with ways to help him socialize that were not connected to his illnesses since that is already what is highly discussed with him which is why I took the approach of trying to figure out any hobbies or pass times he has. But I also do not want to be dismissive. So any suggestions on ways to connect or things I should be aware of while in the process of trying to help would be greatly appreciated! Discord communities are great. If he is interested in games he can join communities for those games and instantly connect with people to play with. This makes me a little anxious meeting new/random people and stuff but I have been trying to do it more because it is honestly more fun to play games with other people and at least getting to talk during the day to something other than my puppy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA thing to note about gamers. We vary a lot depending on the games we play. There are people that play one one game there are variety gamers. There are people that only play stuff that is popular. Maybe find out what kind of gamer he is, and what he is into then suggest communities from there after some research. For instance, if you hear Fortnite is popular and suggest, \"Hey why do not you  join this Fortnite community because you like games?\" but he does not play Fortnite. If I were him I would instantly get the feeling you do not really understand me. Thank you soooo much!!! I know his fave game is Ark and it is a pc game but I researched that they have a phone app for it now. I have been trying to learn as much as possible to provide him anything to help his stay. I do not know if that info helps? I do not know what a discord community is but I can look into that if u have any specific links lmk! If you are familiar with Reddit think of how Reddit has essentially a forum for what ever reason someone wants. Discord is that but with voice chat and chat channels. You can have private or public servers. But most likely there is some arc official server. I know a few people, including myself, with the same issues that your patient is facing. There is a few pieces of advice that I can come up with right away. \n\nEveryone, especially gamers, have that one thing that gets their mind (and their mouth) going. Whether it is a new game, changes to an old game, or controversies in the gaming industry.\n\nIf you are truly invested in helping this man and he is as bad off as you say, start on a one-on-one basis. I know you are probably not a gamer and you are probably not adept at games...but if he is playing, sit next to him.\n\n Ask in-depth opinion questions. \"Has this game gotten better since it came out?\" Or \"What do you think about X controversy?\" , not \"what does that do?\". The reason for this is that you want him to feel. Period. \n\nThe numbness that overtakes those with disabilities can overwhelm every facet of their life. The difference between asking about fundamentals and asking about opinions is that the former can cause a very short, rehearsed response that leaves you with more dead air and numbness wheras the latter opens a dialogue. Try to verse yourself in how his games work and maybe the hot topics in his circles.  \n\nOver time, hopefully, he will open up to you and maybe you will establish a real dialogue. Maybe you will even try to play a round of his favorite game! When he can open up to and practice his social skills with someone physical, it is much more likely that he will be open to looking into communities. \n\nThis has become long winded and I could write forever. I hope it helps, somehow! This perspective was extremely helpful!!!! Thank you!!!! I def was trying to find ways of creating dialog instead of yes or no questions but I do not know anything about gaming! I downloaded the app for his fave game to try n learn more about it and to create more connection with him but this helps soooo much!!

As a teenager, I would wake up, get out of bed and be unable to put my heels on the ground due to this tightness. It always wore off by the time I was leaving my house for school, so I did not bother mentioning it to my GP. \n\nFor as long as I can remember I have had issues with achy arms (it started with them going extremely achy, like the end of pins and needles, from holding up books when reading. GP told me to stop holding up books and I did not mention it for another 12 years), and very uncomfortable fingers. My knees do not like to stay put and for the past year I have been having serious issues with my jaw. \n\nMy myopathy is labelled as mild - whatever this is, it is a mild myopathy, but I have been using a crutch for walking for over a year now and that does not feel very mild to me. \n\nI am in extreme pain, often, mostly at night.

I finally relented after a night of intense pain.\n\nMy problem is this: \n\nI am still in intense pain most nights. In my legs, in my glutes, my knees, my arms. My shoulders. Today I went to do a grocery shop - I really struggled to get my one bag of shopping home and was in a lot of pain by the time I got home (I got a bus, had a seven minute walk from the grocery store to the bus stop and still had to stop due to weakness and pain. I had to stop several times between the bus stop and our house, which is a two minute walk). \n\nBut for most of the day, my pain is well managed. I feel I am able to function.

Coming home carrying one bag of shopping was hell, and I am now lying on a hot water bottle in attempt to calm down the pain in my legs. \n\nIn these moments - almost nightly - I feel stupid for going back to work and am dreading it.

Stop beating yourself up for the things you cannot do, you would if you could and you know that. \n\nWhen dealing with the pain, learn your limits and get help for the rest - perhaps you need to pass on the grocery shopping?

The doctor REFUSED to give me the shot because he said people with MS are not supposed to get it. I told him I have had the shot before and I have MD not MS. He told me to go to the MDA clinic for the shot if that was the case. Like WTF? God I never realised how many people thought I had MS until I read this. I look back and so many people thought I meant MS... I think I know what I have. ", "Looking for answers My mother, grandmother, and great grandmother were all diagnosed with lgmd. My great grandmother and my grandmother were diagnosed in their late 30's before generic testing was wide spread. My mother, who is 59, only got diagnosed by symptom this year and it is waiting for the generic tests to be finished. \n\nI am getting tested by symptom at the end of this month. I am 38. I have already got osteoarthritis in my tailbone and a protruding disk in my l5-s1 space, as well as mild scoliosis. I fall often, 1-2 times a month, often have to use a cane for walking long distances as my right leg gets very weak. And which ever side I fall asleep on, that shoulder's ball joint ends up sightly out of place. I am unable too lift anything over 10 lbs and even some days that amount is too much.  My calves are huge compared to my husband's and always feel hard like rocks.\n\nConsidering the symptoms and that the lgmd does not seem to skip generations and also does not present until the 30's, could I have a rare dominant Gene type of lgmd? Should I have my kids tested? What should I do/not do prior to my tests? What kind of tests should I expect? I have done many questions but the websites I have been to have been really vague so I was hoping people with first have experience in dealing with all of this might be able to help me. Thanks in advance. Yes go get genetic testing done and test your kids. I cannot help you anymore on what to expect because I am 29 and I am just know getting the testing and diagnosis. I had an mri and emg so far and next step will be genetic testing. I had an MRI done for my back problems. I do not know what an EMG is or if I am going to have that done. I know I have testing for muscular dystrophy at the local hospital but no one has told me anything as far as what to expect it anything. I am very nervous! LGMD does skip generations.. From the research I have seen and from my own family. My mom has it and I have no symptoms. Her sister had it and passed away while her daughter does not have it. So far it has not skipped generations in my family. My great grandmother and her brother both had it, my grandmother had it, and my mother has it.  There are multiple types of LGMD, and for some types it does skip generations, such as the case with your family, and for others it does not. I had an MRI done for my back problems. I do not know what an EMG is or if I am going to have that done.

Thanks! ", "Dating with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ", "Relationships Hi everyone! I have LGMD and lately i have been struggling with relationships. It is like I would not like to let them know that I have a condition and try my best to hide it (since I can still walk right), whenever my friends go to parties or pubs I search if the place is on a 2nd floor so I can manage to keep it a secret and look \"normal\" (I hardly climb steps with the help of my arms), when they invite me for a walk or anything related to exercise I always refuse...\n\nAlso when it comes to the idea of having a girlfriend, I am likely to overthink the situation and put myself on a bad position, leading me to not even give it a try. It is been a while since the last time I had a girlfriend.\n\nHow you guys deal with that subject?, relationships in general are complicated but having a condition like this makes it way more difficult (in my opinion).\n\nAnd you guys have a girlfriend? or boyfriend? how it works as we are not as capable physically?\n\nI would love to hear your stories. \n\nHave a good one! I am 37 and an mobile but walk funny. I make sure I am making the plans. I usually tell them around date 3-5 if they have not brought it up already. It scares a lot of people. \n\nWhen it comes to dates I try and make it things I can manage, dinner and drinks, movies, etc. I am definitely not someone to invite people out on a hike. But I can do a mild hike. \n\nHonestly being honest helps. Sure you do not want to scare off someone by it being the first thing you talk about but I brush it off and normalize it. \n\nMy partner and I have been together for 8 years almost now. She struggles with the future sometimes but I do not really think about it. I just do what I am doing and try to stay as active as I can. \n\nGo to the gym, do your best. Try and say yes to things you may struggle with. Nobody gets annoyed at someone doing their best. Find compromise. \n\nGood luck. Have fun. I met my girlfriend on tinder. I am 35 and she is 32. I have Becker\u2019s MD.\n\nWe were chatting for a while. Talking on the phone. Then I invited her out for a coffee date. I told her in a text that I was disabled on the same day we were meant to meet up for coffee. She still showed up.\n\nWe did actually go for a walk (very flat area that I knew well) and I said as we were going into the forest. \u201cYou can push me over because I will not be able to get back up if you get scared\u201d she thought that was hilarious \ud83d\ude44\n\nAnyway, she had a bunch of questions and she was constantly asking me about it even one point she said she did not want to have children with me now she is begging for a baby \ud83e\udd23\n\nIt is not too bad except she gets upset because we cannot do things that involve stairs or hills which is something I have accepted but she is struggling with.\n\nI can stay home gaming and she can be independent and go and do those physical activities with friends instead. It is better for the relationship.\n\nAnd\u2026 If you can walk then definitely go for a walk! Thanks for your reply.\n\nIts actually really nice to read your post. I guess when it come to talk about the condition we may not set it up as something bad but normalize it. damn!, I always imagined my life with kids and all. \n\nIt was so cool to read your story bro actually I feel like giving a try on tinder now. lol\n\nThanks for your reply! I am 36, got diagnosed with myotonic muscular dystrophy 10 years ago, met my now wife 7 years ago. We met on OK Cupid, she saw on one of the questions that I had mentioned I was not allowed to give blood so had a suspicion there was something up with me, but I sat her down on the 4th date to tell her. I am still high functioning so it still came as quite a surprise to her but has never really been an issue.  \n\nThe GF I had before i did not tell for 3 months. She was upset I had not told her earlier, I learnt from that better be honest as soon as you know something is going somewhere. I mean it sucks, the reality for us all is likely a wheelchair at some point.. a lower life expectancy too.\n\nLife is too short to get hung up on these things, especially for us, so enjoy yourself, find people you like to be around and do not think too far ahead. Sure its good to have an idea of a plan for the future but I have friends who were perfectly healthy die from car accidents or sudden heart failure.\n\nAlso try therapy, I am sure like me you will have a lot of unknown issues due to your MD and its good to talk them through! So I have mild LGMD. Similar things to you, can walk quite well, just not a lot, and not quickly.\n\nIt sucks but I have always been really upfront about it. If it is someone I do not intend to be friends with or know well I will not bother mentioning it if necessary. But if I know I am going to be spending a lot of time with people I will just give them a heads up. My line usually is\n\n\"I have a muscle wasting condition called Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. Basically it really hurts when I use my muscles too much. So if we can take it slow and avoid stairs where possible I would appreciate it!\"\n\nI met my now husband on tinder and I told him before we had our first date. Just a quick \"you probably will not even notice but...\" And he is been great about it. All of my friends are, they will make sure I am okay, will not push me to do anything, will carry my heavy stuff etc. But I have had people who do not really care and will leave me trailing behind in a group.\n\nMy stance is: if people are inconsiderate then you are better off without them. People who are worth having will not care about your LGMD. It surely sucks! lol\n\nI need to stick to my working out plan to keep my mind clean. \n\nSometimes I stop working out and it makes me feel weird in a bad way. \n\nI have tried therapy but maybe I still need to find the right person cause it does not work for me. I guess you are right. Also your line to tell about the condition \"you probably will not even notice but...\" is great, lol. I might use it.\n\nWhen you are the man it is a little different because you are the one who is supposed to take care of things like that (carry heavy stuff, etc...), actually that is one of my concerns, it is like I can not be as useful as I would like to. \n\nThanks for your reply! There are plenty of men who do not carry heavy stuff and they are not even disabled.\n\nYou can be an amazing man by doing other things. Cleaning up around the house, cooking, making coffee in the morning etc etc. Also, all the emotional and mental labor that women get lumped with. Take the opportunity to take some of that load. So many men out there who do not do these things and women grump about it. A partner that helps out with domestic chores is a keeper!\n\nDo not let the patriarchy shape your view of how you are meant to be as a man, that is a recipe for not getting laid. Wow. You put into words exactly what i have been dealing with for the past couple years. I am 23, with LGMD, and I have gone through much of what you describe. I avoid stairs at all costs, I try to hide it (although my very close friends know and they are extremely supportive of me). But to answer your question, I too was avoiding dating for a while for more reasons than one. I have a horrible time with body image, so when it comes to being intimate it is a struggle for me, and also it is an uncomfortable conversation that I have always been terrified to have. So, usually i will talk to someone briefly, maybe go on a date or two, and then i will find my way out before it gets too serious that I have to disclose my full self. Recently though, I began dating a girl that I met online and I made it a goal of mine to tell her right away before we ever even met, and it was one of the best decisions i have ever made. She is so supportive, and while she still might not fully \u201cget it\u201d (we have only been dating for a few months), she is always willing to learn or let me explain. My point being, I think the best thing you can do, even if it is hard, is to let people know right away. I would love to talk more considering we both have LGMD and seemingly have a very similar situation\u2014 PM me if you would like :).\n\n\nEDIT: I want to add that something I really struggle with as I slowly get weaker is the people that i have known for years that are not aware of my situation. I often avoid people I have not seen in a while, and because it started to get worse in the beginning of the pandemic, I was able to use covid as an excuse to not see people. Now, as covid slows down many people I have not seen in a 1.5-2 years are asking me to hang out again and I struggle because it is so much harder to tell people that you have known for a while\u2014 to me it feels much more demoralizing. Whereas, when you meet someone new and tell them right away, it is a bit easier (for me, anyway). In a way, it is not as embarrassing. I was \u201cnormal\u201d in high school.. I could run, jump, dance, stairs, etc., and the harsh fact is that I am not that person anymore, and it is important that the people that I truly care about know that. THANK YOU for your reply.\n\nWe need to hear stories like that to feel capable to find the kind of relationship we deserve. I get your point and for sure its a mindset issue.\n\nActually I never thought this way until I got diagnosed. So many things changed. Lol, I am glad I am not the only one. \n\nAlso for me It is worse when it comes to tell the people I have known for a while. Maybe because what we always want to show to others is some improvement and well... \n\nHigh school was also my best moment physically and athletically, I played every sport possible and used to win some armwrestling competitions in my classroom, lol \n\nThanks for replying... whenever you feel like talking, feel free to PM me. My boyfriend has FSHD. We met on Match about two years ago. His profile was up front about his MD - a quick mention of his diagnosis and a note about how he does not let it control his life. \n\nHe is almost 40 and has been using a wheelchair in public for years, though he can walk with assistance at home and for short distances. \n\nHe is super thin and visibly disabled. When I met him for the first time, I found that I was still extremely attracted to him and decided to go for it. \n\nHe is a fantastic partner - thoughtful, self aware, hilarious, and sexy as hell. I am a smitten kitten and have been for a while now!\n\nI definitely appreciated him being honest from the beginning about his condition. If it is something that affects your daily life &amp; activities - and, by extension, those of any dating partners - it is only fair to give them enough information to make an informed decision. This will weed out a lot of people who are not interested in dealing with your situation, but that is good for you anyway. \n\nBest of luck!! Thanks for your reply!\n\nIt is cool to know your opinion specially because it comes from the other side of the relationship.  \n\nI think that is the next step for me, I need to feel comfortable with my condition around other people and, well, I hope I get to find someone who thinks the way you do. My Girl left me because of my disability Lmao\n\nHer Last line said That \"she did not deserve me as I am too much good for her and I deserve someone better than her\"\n\nAlso I do not hide my muscular dystrophy as you have to accept yourself first as you are and do not be ashamed. Put this like \" If you cannot accept yourself as you are how would you expect girl to accept you as a partner\"\n\nHonesty/Truthfulness is key to get a partner in such condition. lol, what you said after that last line? \n\nI need to accept my condition bro, that is the hardest thing for me :( \n\nThanks for your reply! My Last line means you need to be truthful to your partner since the beginning by revealing what your condition is, If she is the right girl she will accept you as you are : )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI struggled a lot as a kid (Bullying,depression,heartbreaks,Groupism) but I have matured a lot Now and all of these things disappeared out of my life\n\nI can literally identify who is right for me and who is wrong for me in first few meetings\n\nIt takes time to accept yourself but you have to sooner or later\n\nAnd I bet You that , The day You become mature enough you will laugh on your past self : ) Hi! My boyfriend has LGMD and since I have met him through a friend group I knew he had this condition from the beginning. His case is quite severe since he cannot stand up on his own and stairs are almost completely impossible for him to climb. All of this never stopped me from falling completely in love with him, he is the most caring, lovnig boyfriend I have ever had. What I am trying to say is, you do not have to be afraid about telling your partner about your condition, their reaction will be an excellent show of their intentions with you. If somebody considers it a huge problem, they are not for you (or anyone, because a person who truly cares and is with you for your personality will do anything to be with you and make you happy). Never be ashamed of your condition. It is a part of you and you deserve someone who will love every bit of your being. This is possibly my favorite reply on this post, thank you for that. \n\nAnd you might be right, I need to accept my condition and stop being ashamed of it because it creates mental boundaries that keep me from trying new things.\n\nStay cool! I am 23 and female. I have not been able to climb stairs for years. At first I was like you and tried to hide it but then as it became noticeable I could not. What changed my life is being completely open and honest about my needs and abilities with my friends and potential significant others. Ofc at first you will have a jerk or two you will need to shew away but I have found most people are more than willing to help and you will find someone who cares for you no matter what. My boyfriend helps me find the silver lining and is always willing to help and listen towhag I need help with. He says he does not mind bc helping me gives us a little more intimate moments that 2 full tables body people would not normally have. This disease will really show you who is worth keeping in your life. Wish you the best friend! I have had friends and past boyfriends even asking if they can give me a piggy back up the stairs to make it easier for me so I could join them. Being open and honest about this part of myself has really made life so much easier. You will find some falsely amazing people that want to help you and love you for you regardless of abilities Thanks for your reply and sharing your experience.\n\nFrom all your replies I know now that I need to be honest with other people and let them know that I have a muscular condition so I can feel more comfortable around others and also to know who is worthy to keep around in my life and who is not.\n\nKeep it up! I have BMD and I know what you mean with the whole stairs thing. I am always thinking about what stairs I have to climb at any point and limiting it as much as possible.\n\nBut what I have found is just telling people is not a big deal ever. Their response is usually \"that sucks. I am sorry you got to deal with that. I will help in whatever way I can\" and they do every time without hesitation. There has never been a time where I have asked someone for help for something and they have refused. People understand it is not your fault you have a disease. \n\nOn the relationship thing, I have had one boyfriend before. (yes I am also a male. Hopefully that does not offend you) but he did not care at all. The thing about relationships is they do not love you for who you are physically, they love you for who you really are. Your genetic code is not relevant. Just tell whoever you date what is going on. Do not look for pity, but do not hide it. It is part of you no matter what. Hiding it only causes more pain later.\n\nPeople will understand. It is not your fault, and you are still a human. Just be yourself and let others help you. You might need it. Yeah, that is the thing, I have to accept the condition and stop trying to hide it.\n\nFor me the mental aspect has always been the hardest part of the condition. Since I was diagnosed 1 year ago I still cannot overcome the situation but I guess it takes some time.\n\nThanks for your reply bro. Have a good one. Ahh, I went through the EXACT same experience.  Honestly, It got to the point where I had a successful career, I knew I had a lot to offer to the right person.  After talking to someone who I thought I may want to know better, I was completely honest about my situation.  I found people do not like to be lied to, through omission.  Remember you are not a disease.  You are a person who has lots to give to the right person.  Make yourself a list to remind yourself!\n\nMajority of my dates were cool about it and actually did not mind helping me when I needed it.  (I was still walking but had issues with stairs or curbs, etc )  I am so much more than the disease and people saw that and forgot about it.  There were a few who could not deal with it, but since I found out early on by being honest, I did not invest any time in them and have a broken heart.\nI have now been in my current relationship for over 4 years.  I got lucky (or maybe he did), we have a lot of fun and he helps me with A LOT.  He is used to it now and does not think about it.  I do as much for him as I can and he picks up my slack.\n\nYou are worthy, just give it time and be patient.  Do not be afraid to take some risks.  There is someone for everyone.  Love, Emily   So I am in the same boat as OP, and I have always hesitated to do stuff like this, but it is kind of funny, I was thinking same as you. Start off not talking about it, and then eventually when things start getting a little more serious I would tell them. Thanks! Oh my god the not noticing thing is so real. Seriously. Most people just think I just have a different gait and do not even notice anything weird about me.\n\nI think I will try that line whenever I decide to try and fit dating in my life. Thank you so much! I know I am not OP but I am in a very similar boat to him with BMD. Thank you for your reply. I think it is just important to keep forging ahead in whatever field I am in and get a successful career so that you can offer a lot to someone. Thank you. Like yes it is nice not to have something to stare at... But Christ sometimes it would be nice for people to know! I find it easier to ask strangers for help now but not I still struggle in silence a lot. It would be nice for people to know that I have a disability and might need help and not just lazy/unfit/overweight. Ah man I have struggled with this stupid mentality for so long. I think it is because us guys (especially first gens like me whose parents are from a far more patriarchal country) see our dads keep trying to take control of everything and keep trying to be on top of everything.\n\nBut lately I have realized how much that can hurt the women in my family such as my mom or my sisters, and how that it is not something to strive for. Thanks for your kind words, and I think the first step to becoming a better person is just being yourself and doing only what you are able. Thank you. Exactly, exactly. I just always get afraid of telling people because of how they might respond. I think that fear will make things worse than they already are. Being more confident in myself is something that I need to work on and something I need to accept. As my dad always says: \"You have got to play the cards you are delt.\" I try and use that mindset to ask for help, whether strangers or at businesses etc. If people think it is worse than it is, then correct them and move on. I once got asked what my \"Make a Wish\" was... That was a weird one. \n\nI am not sure if this is something you have been diagnosed with recently or grew up always knowing about. I have always known about my LGMD so it is a central point in my identity now. I have always known about it, got diagnosed at 5, learned about it at like 10, did not really sink in until high school. so it is definitely been something I have had time to struggle with. \n\nMy older sister actually said that same line about the cards I have been dealt to me, but there was a time before me starting college this year where I very nearly decided to end it. Luckily my parents were there to stop me, but later when I talked to my sister she told me that when I got to college that no one would put me down for it. \n\nI had always thought that people would just look down on me and not really look at me for who I was, that I was not worthy. But as I have started college, I have realized that people are not going to judge you for that. They are going to judge you for your mentality and how you look at life. What you do with your life. What your goals are for your life. \n\nI have realized that by focussing on my career, on my long term goal to be a doctor, I will automatically gain the confidence to be honest about myself. I think all those years in high school wallowing in self pity are the reason why now I have come to terms accepting myself. I do not stop myself from dreaming of what could be.... but I do not get upset at it.\n\n(That got way deeper than I thought, holy shit) That is about it. Just takes time. I am only just now getting to the point of accepting having a disability after being diagnosed like 10 years ago. To be fair, I was young when I was diagnosed so it did not really hit me until recently.\n\nI wish you the best of luck getting through it though. It will be tough but hopefully doable.", "Anyone here with Titanopathy? (24F) got diagnosed with this type of muscular dystrophy last year. It affects the TTN gene.

Hello All,  \n\n\nIt is my first post here since joining, and I am hoping this community will be helpful as we navigate the diagnosis we received just before all this COVID stuff went down.  \n\n\nSome backstory to start:\n\nA little over a year ago my oldest son (4 at the time) was admitted to hospital for significant leg pain to the point he could not walk or bend his legs. At the hospital, a blood test showed a highly elevated CK count (75000) and we were told he had an influenza induced Myositis. After a week long stay in hospital he was discharged with weekly blood tests following to monitor his CK levels. Around this time our youngest son (2 at the time) began complaining of leg pain and walking on his tiptoes a lot, so we requested blood tests for his CK as well.   \n\n\nBoth boys tests were abnormally high, even after our oldest had been flushed for a week at the hospital, and remained high. We began the bounce from doctor to pediatrician to neurologist to pediatric neurologist to geneticist. After about a year of waiting and appointments, we have learned our sons (3 and 5 now) both have *Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2A.* There is a 25 % chance our daughter (10 months) has it as well.   \n\n\nThe news was a lot to take in, and unfortunately we were not given much in the way of information or resources before COVID hit. I know 3 and 5 is pretty early to receive a diagnosis. I guess this post is an introduction, a request for resources (that have been proven helpful), and maybe a chance to join a network of people similarly afflicted. Hey, so I have Never actually posted here but saw your story and thought I would say hello. \n\nI am sure it is quite overwhelming to have that diagnosis. I am the third generation of my family having FSHD. I do not know much about limb girdle but I do know what it is like to be raised knowing you will likely have or do have MD. My parents raised us knowing we may develop it because my dad and grandpa had it. I watched my dad struggle through some things as kid which was a little scary but I felt prepared when it finally hit me in my teen years. \n\nI did have one phenomenal experience in my teens that helped my perspective. Before I fully developed FSH(the signs were there) I worked as a camp counselor at the MD camp in my state. It was, and still is one of my top experiences and something I cherished being able to do. There was a lot of love and support and good times had by the kids and I am glad I got to be a part of their lives. I grew up and matured that summer in to a young man. No one knew that I was developing it myself, but that was ok because I got to be part of some joy for kids and families that had a tougher existence than me at that point. \n\nI hope you and your family get the support you need. Have a great night and welcome even if it is just us in here.  Hey, thanks for writing back.  \n\n\n I am pretty new to the MD world. What is FSHD? There seems like there is a lot to learn with the acronyms. We have not told the kids yet, they are so young. Neither my wife nor I have this or know anyone in our family who has, so we are newbies. When were you told by your folks? fascioscapular muscular dystrophy. Had to google how to spell it. I am actually not as educated as I should be other than where it affects me (right should left chest and cross crossing my body going to my legs). \n\nI remember knowing in the 80s when ND was good at football and knowing I was not going to be a football player for them lol. So may 6-8 or so. But FSH does not hit until puberty in most AFAIK.  You may find this link of interest:  Thanks for the responses. Thanks! i have the same disease, if you want to ask me anything dm me, but you and your wiife have a long and hard road ahead of you, if your daughter has it, it will probably be lighter like with my sister but your boys will be hit hard, hopefully by the time they reach my age(27) a cure will exist I appreciate the honest truth, no matter how difficult. I was diagnosed with FSHD last year after a lifetime of struggling and a list of other diagnosis, now I know at 44, it was interesting to see your parents raised you with the knowing ...

Problems have been happening since later 2000s but just today after showing frustration to my mom why cannot dad do anything without needing help, it slipped from her tongue that he has muscular dystrophy. I suspected something was wrong but did not know he had official diagnosis. My mom also says she told him she has too much burden doing everything herself and he responded something like, \"what should I do then? Kill myself?\" She is been hiding it for years saying doctors just do not know what is going on with him. How do I deal with this? I read some more information on this, and its kind of scary. ", "What options are out there to be more independent? (income, transportation, daily activities, etc.) Still undiagnosed, but close to possible diagnosis of Miyoshi Myopathy. Been slowly declining with muscle/tendon issues for over 5 years. Often unable to do basic tasks on my own like cooking, cleaning, lifting anything heavier than a water bottle. I cannot drive... hate being driven around &amp; unable to get my own groceries, miss being able to walk everywhere. I have almost no income, and there is no way I could hold a job.\n\nAnyways, I am looking for more independence (&amp; as much avoidance of pain possible).... What help is out there for people with issues like this? And with no diagnosis yet.... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Income Independence**\n\nRight now friends &amp; family are helping, but they cannot just take care of me forever. I also have goals &amp; want to help take care of others again. Since I cannot work a normal job, I am considering starting my own business or something like a YouTube channel. I do not think I can get disability because I have no definite diagnosis &amp; it could take years more.\n\n**Transportation Independence**\n\nFor transportation independence (being able to go places on my own), I was thinking to move to an accessible downtown area. I can push my wheelchair on my own somedays... or I could get something electric. Would be amazing to have a grocery store on the bottom floor of the building (if that exists in the US). \n\n**Physical Therapy &amp; Exercises Independence**\n\nGoing to physical therapy honestly sucks. They are just like exercise-babysitters asking if I did my chores, but do not actually do much to help unless they massage (which they basically never do or do not do for long)... So I am thinking to instead live somewhere with a gym &amp; get a trainer + a massage therapist - I know my limitations, a trainer is a cheaper exercise-babysitter &amp; can teach me how to use the gym's equipment. \n\n**Cooking Independence**\n\nThis one, I honestly do not know how to deal with... I cannot afford a chef, I do not like pre-packaged meals &amp; I am a strict vegan (expensive for pre-made meals). I try to just cook lighter-weight things, but it is so hard for me to lift. And if family or a friend cooks, then I feel ashamed to ask for what I want, and sometimes they do not let me have what I want because they Google a million things &amp; say, \"oh, this is bad for your condition\". Hey. If it is limb girdle type R2 (or 2B, or Myoshi Myopathy), welcome to the club. I am not sure I can offer any specific ideas, although mobility aids and home aids are the thing to look for. I have a stool in the kitchen, I have a wheelchair for some days at work and longer days out (when they are allowed).\n\nIf it does end up being a genetically confirmed diagnosis, then you can also look into joining the Jain Foundation. It is a patient registry, and they are funding a lot of research into potential treatments etc. Wow... do you have it, too? I have not met anyone with the same issues, yet.\n\nI cannot remember what type the doctor said, but I would guess maybe type 2B (never heard it called as \"limb girdle\"). We still have to do a calf-muscle biopsy for the final diagnosis. They said I may be a symptomatic carrier of DYSF gene - so they said in most people who carry the gene, it is not active, but they said new studies make them think that something sort of activates it in people.... And they have seen many carriers of the gene develop the disease. It matches my symptoms perfectly, so I think it must be it.\n\nMy issues began with no longer being able to stand on my tippy toes (which I used to do every day), then I had issues with running &amp; walking long distances... then I would limp sometimes... then I would limp a lot. I went from running 5+ miles a day to only 1 mile with 4 breaks, then ran my last lap ever. Then I went from cane to walker to wheelchair. My right leg is noticeably smaller than the left, but the good leg is starting to develop issues as well.\n\nThere are many other issues involved, but the worst one is the rib pain / breathing pain... which was only occasional before, but has now been constant for over a year.  I cannot lay on my side, twist, take deep breaths, etc.\n\nI got this bicycle-seated walker called a Bi-Kube which I use on good days for getting around the house or going to doctors. On bad days, I use a Colours Spazz G wheelchair.\n\nI will look into the Jain Foundation if they confirm the diagnosis - Thank you!", "Modifying / Adapting a \"Power Wheels\" for my son with MD  We randomly found out about this concept in a very chance situation... and it was a game-changer.

Well I have it... And several of my direct and indirect family does too. \n\nThe facio part of it affects my face muscles. A test they did was for me to puff my cheeks out full of air. Then the doctor lightly pressed a finger on my puffed cheeks and they deflated quickly even though I was trying to keep the air in. I cant even begin to blow up a balloon. Our faces tend to look monotone like we are expressionless.   There is quite a bit out there for info.

Most of the time it is lower back in the middle. My back has spent 40 some years of being abused by having to compensate trying to do routine things.  \n\nNeck hurts too.  At least in my family the MD affects muscles holding up your head.  Pretty soon it needs a neck brace to hold it up, otherwise you end opposite staring at the ground.

So I am just looking for some directions, thanks So the problem is, is that if we damage our muscles we have no guarantee that they will heal properly, and the main way muscular hypertrophy is activated is by damage (micro-tears) to the muscles. \n\nFor this reason, these articles advise against certain forms of exercise.\n\n( a reddit user says that some light lifting is okay, but my doctors told me to avoid lifting. The FSH Society has a couple of recommendations for exercise (\n\nIn my opinion the best course of action is to not lift in order to preserve function longer, as I would like to be able to use my arms when I am older. Instead choose a form of low-intensity exercise like swimming that will keep the muscles exercised, but not over exert them. If you want to do strength training in your back and upper limbs you should avoid exercises with free weights were your scapula are particularly unstable (eg. Avoid overhead press with free weights). You are able to Target pretty much all of the muscle groups while keeping your arms in close to your sides, a physical trainer should be able to help you with this. Core exercises will also be helpful because of the abdominal weakness. Regardless of what you do start with low weights and work yourself up to heavier weights - listen to your body and have fun ! I was at a muscle clinic the other day and was told swimming and exercises in the pool is the best thing to do but not to the point of fatigue.  55 here.  I have made it a point several times over the past couple of decades to do some exercising and light weights and treadmill.  Each time in the couple of months after I stopped, I felt me getting weaker and getting worse. \n\nI know this question always gets brought up.  \"if I exercise will that help\"  I have never seen a definitive report that can answer it.

It is nothing serious, but I have never been around anyone with MD before and I would like to be as accommodating as possible. She is coming to my place and I am going to cook for her, likely going to hook up judging by the way we are talking atm. So in essence I want to know if there are any vegetarian foods or drinks that would be good for her MD, or if there is anything I should keep in mind about her physical wellbeing. \n\nPlease forgive my ignorance, I am not sure what type of MD she has (I think there are different types but I am not sure) or how severe it is. She appears to function normally (for lack of a better phrase), but I still want to be prepared. \n\nThanks for your help :) I am a woman who still walks with md. For me I just have to go slow or less strenuous positions when I get tired. I eat everything so I do not know of any dietary concerns just do not try to do a wheelbarrow cartwheel combo and you should be good. Maybe nothing in the shower of shea like me and has stability issues esp when the floor is wet. Also I wanted to say that I have read through this SR a little bit, and you all seem like really kind and caring people. I am proud of all of you for trying to make the best of life and for supporting all the people in your community the way you do. It is not so much that I am concerned about what to give her, because she seemed happy with what I am going to make. I trying to go along the lines of is there anything that is good as a pain reliever for MD or something like that. \nAlso I will keep that in mind, thank you :) My wife has MD. She is the sweetes woman I have ever met :P The symptoms are kind of mild, but that is what I learned in 3+ years of being together.\n\nFood: she eats everything and eats a lot. So, if your GF does not have any food allergy, that should not concern you.\n\nActivities: do not go for big walks (like a hour walk) without rest. Remember that her resistance is lower than yours, and a very easy walk for you might be a really strenuous exercise for her. Also, like someone said before, MD affects stability, not only strenght in the legs. \n\nWell Being: do not overprotect or underestimate her. That will make her feel bad. People with MD are capable of doing a lot of things at their own pace. Sometimes, when we are in love, we end up caring \"too much\", and that may be a little overwhelming for your partner. Also, try to appreciate a lot of what your partner does really well. And show some interest on her condition. Ask her what she knows about it, how she learned to cope with it, etc.. \n\nSex: we would come down to it sometime, would not we? Aim for positions that do not put pressure on her legs. That may make sex really tiring (sometimes painful) for the person. So, go easy when it comes down to it, right?\n\nGood luck! Be a gentleman and everything should be fine. Tell us how it went, if possible! My fiance has MD and has an calcium deficiency so in terms of drinks I give him water, lemonade and cranberry juice. Everyone is different so since we do not know what her diet limits are it can be difficult to say. But in terms of food, eating can be very hard and I feed my fiance chicken and anything that can be easily torn up. Or even easy to pick up with a fork. Examples- Chicken, tender pork chops, spaghetti, green been casserole, mac n cheese, gumbo. Stuff like that. Hope this helps For vegetarian options: I love the Beyond Meat Burgers, so yummy! Vegetarian tacos are always a good go-to. Anything with turmeric is also good because turmeric is good for inflammation and pain relief. It also sounds like I am in a similar boat physically-wise and I would say you will likely have to do quite a bit of work in the bedroom due to weakness + fatigue, but you seem like a very open-minded, well-adjusted person so it will likely flow naturally. I love how you came to this group to get advice, it is so sweet! Have a great time! A nice glass of wine always works for me.  :)  Have fun! Why do not you ask her if there is anything she likes to eat or any cuisine?  She may say she  likes some form of cuisine or she could say she is not picky but she does not eat this,this and this.  Really has more to with food preferences since MD rarely effects what you can eat until it effects it so much that she would definitely bring it up.  My nausea and vomiting were so bad that I was limited to mostly liquids for a few years so If I was up for going out gelato was my treat/meal of choice and what sustained me for 3 years.  \n\nIn terms of intimate activities.  Just imagine that you have not been to the gym for a long time and then lifted crazy amounts of weights.  You muscles feel like they could not lift one more thing or hold a position for a long time.  I slightly simplistic example of what it may feel like to have muscles affected by MD.\nReally in any relationship, but especially interabled, communication is important.  So is humour.  In general the last thing that someone who has MD wants to be treated like they are different.  Do not ignore it but it should not your big concern although it is very sweet that you are trying to be prepared and ask others.  Just like any other women she just wants to this to be a regular date. Food - whatever you might make any other date.\n\nActivities - nothing overly physical. A mile to her may feel like three to four miles for a non-MDA person. Ask her what kind of things she likes to do.\n\n\u201cOther\u201d activities - some forms of MD like FSHD impact upper body strength more than lower.  \n\nOther things\nMy pet peeve this week is people who confuse MD with MS...and then ask if my hubby and kids have had any luck with stem cell therapy for their MS.\n\nYoung adults with MD do not want to be treated like they are broken or inadequate. Mine despise pity, so just be chill about it and take her lead. \n\nWhile it warms my heart that you would be so thoughtful as to ask on this board, she wants to have fun like every young woman. Have fun and continue to be thoughtful, but understand you are not there to fix her and do not make MD the focus of the date. I was not going to try and be overprotective, I have dated people with chronic illnesses before, so that is something familiar to me. That is good advice though, you definitely helped. Thank you :) That is interesting, I will keep that in mind. Thank you :) That seems like really good advice thank you Oh, nice!\n\nGood luck, sir! I agree, it would be weird to focus on her MD. I just wanted to make sure I did not do anything I should not and maybe do something subtly to help out. Thanks for the advice :) Yes definitely, the way forward is with positivity and making the best out of life. I would like to focus more on the good things than the bad things, she is a really nice person and I would like to think she will have fun and not worry so much about her illness for at least a while.

I also have anismus (you might want to google that one I am not going to describe it). I was diagnosed with MS 11 years ago and my neuro would never say that my bowel problems were because of MS because the way it does not work is not typical for MS. Once we found out that DM1 ran in my dads family it all made more sense. \n\nSevere lower back pain. I bend over and trying to stand up straight is agonising - it is like my trunk muscles are locked in the forward position and do not want to release. All three of us are like this and my dad is now experiencing the same thing. He attributes it to old age.\n\nDoing anything with my hands that involves gripping for extended periods - using a hose, vacuum, writing will invoke pain and cramps. Once again, sisters are the same. \n\nI am legally blind (I lost my vision three years ago) and it is progressively getting worse. I have tunnel vision (they think due to MS). My right eye is now getting very very cloudy so next time I see my ophthalmologist I am a bit concerned about cataracts. \n\nMy sisters and I have all got facial myokymia to varying degrees. Mine is the worse - I get Botox to stop the spasm pulling my face over. One sister has the eyelid and cheek fluttering, the other just has the eyelid twitching.\n\nI have had a lot of things that I have been able to ignore and just adapt to - like the handwriting - I thought it hurt for everyone when they wrote as it hurt my sisters when they wrote for extended periods. \n\nTired, so so tired.  But it is a brain fog cant focus tired. I take dexampetamine to keep me awake during the day. \n\nWe have all got Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon.\n\nBradycardia- low resting heart rate under 60 bpm and POTS. We call it our \u201cdizzy disease\u201d. I pass out a lot. \n\nI am hyper mobile all over (aka double jointed - I can get my legs behind my head and do advanced yoga positions even though I have never done yoga).\n\nI stopped working in 2015 when I lost my vision - I have never had a problem with intelligence or anything but I did have a problem with maths when I was in school. I have dyscalculia (ie. maths dyslexia). Me and numbers just do not mix. \n\nEverything has gotten worse for us in the last 5 years. \n\nThat is all I can think of right now. \n Wow! Thanks for all the info!\n\nSo...some of what I fear may be symptomatic is easily attributable to other things, but...I tend to be looking for certain things, so I am just trying to figure it all out. \n\nDid your DM symptoms come up suddenly..? Some things I have noticed have sort of just...showed up overnight almost. That is not normal of DM, right..? \n\nAlso, where did your DM symptoms begin..? From my understanding, they begin distally, correct..? I have had some odd pains in my hands and feet (beginning practically overnight), but I have also had weakness/fatigue in my thighs just as suddenly...that is not really characteristic of DM either, right..? \n\nConfused.... \ud83e\udd14 My mum thinks I have had symptoms of this since I was a small child. My first documented issues with my hands and feet cramping was when I was 11 and my bowel needing to be cleaned out via a nasal gastric tube needing a two month hospital stay when I was 12. DM does not \u201cpop up overnight\u201d but it is one of those things you do not notice until it is pointed out to you either. You gradually just adjust and not even think about it. I notice when my hand does not open a doorknob or car door but my brain does not register - it could have been doing it for a lot longer than I think. I have always just thought I am clumsy. \n\nI have the classic DM1 hatchet face look - droopy eyelids, defined cheekbones, muscle wastage on my face.  \nI used to thank my nana for the awesome cheekbones when she was alive.\n\nDM1 starts it is the distal muscles, DM2 with the thighs and trunks muscles. \n\nDo you have any family history of DM1?

My specialists state that MD does not affect the bladder but idk what else could be causing this. i am mid 20s.\n\nAnyone have any thoughts on this? Some (many) MDs can affect the bladder if they impact on the muscles you need to push out urine so it could well be related. Best decision I ever made (exaggeration but not by much) was a suprapubic catheter.", "People telling you to \"work out\" or \"eat more\" Hey new here. First of all I have never been 'formally' diagnosed but as far as what the doctors say I have some unknown form of MD. My dad and uncle have the same condition. My dad went through genetic testing almost 30 years ago and they never got back to him. So it is all a mystery... The form I have is fairly mild and mostly affects my arms (forearms mainly) and legs (lower calves and ankles. My thighs have more fat on them due to my shape).\n\nAnyway two comments I frequently get are \"You need to eat more!\" when people see how thin my arms are (never mind that my body is not 'too skinny', is technically an hourglass and that eating extra food will not actually do a thing other than put more fat on my lower belly, hips, thighs and butt lol) and \"Why do not you lift weights?\" \n\nAnyone else have experience with these sort of comments? How do you respond? Most of the time I say nothing, especially if I do not know the person but I have a couple friends that keep repeating those statements even though I have told them it is a muscle condition that I cannot control. I am pretty good at ignoring them except it gets really annoying when I am literally grabbed at and my arms are yanked around like I am a rag doll. So insanely annoying. Funny enough because people would not say that to anyone over weight due to sensitivities but feel as if it is okay so say it to skinny people. Especially someone dealing with a condition. People are so ignorant. To be entirely honest 99.99999% of the people that have said those things to me have been overweight women. &gt; I have never been 'formally' diagnosed\n\nWhat is holding you back from getting a diagnosis? That sucks. I cannot imagine anyone having enough gall to grab me and wiggle me around. But there are plenty of idiots out there. Sorry you have had to deal with such ignorance. The medical system. I had years of testing at Children Hospital and they could not figure out what I have. Thanks. Yeah I do not get it either. I would never physically grab someone like that. Though what is surprising is if other people are around pretty much nobdy says anything or they agree with the person. I even get comments from time to time from my boss and a few of the people I work with. Tthese days it seems like thinness is one of the 'acceptable' things to pick on someone for. Yeah the \"diagnostic odyssey\" can be especially time-consuming, frustrating, and (sometimes) costly. The good news is that testing has improved significantly, and only in recent years have the genetic causes for some of the rare muscular dystrophies been discovered. \n\nAre you in the US? I wonder if a local MDA contact might be able to assist with a less cumbersome path toward a diagnosis (sometimes the NIH has clinical trials that will assist with paying for testing and even travel).  Experiences vary by region and by person - so hopefully you are near one of the better resources! I just tell them it is genetic and nothing I could do would change it whatsoever I do that though some people I know(and have known for a long time) still go off about my skinny arms almost every time they see them. Ignore them, there is nothing more you can do about the wilfully ignorant That is true. Though one of these people is a manager at my work so it gets annoying hearing her comments all the time. Not like I point out her physical flaws. No I would probably be fired for that. Have you looked into Inclusion-Body Myositis? It tends to effect the parts of the body that you were mentioning and it can be hereditary. I looked it up and the only thing relatable is wrist weakness. Also it tends to show up later in life while I showed signs of my condition very early on. heh when i was a kid and someone tried to mess around like that i tried to run him over with my wheelchair, he was rubbing one of those dodge ball balls on my head  to be annoying so i ran his foot over. \n\ni never had issues like people grabbing me or asking those questions, but i had a school nurse call child protection services on my mom, citing malnutrition because i got down to 60lbs even though i ate normally. That is horrible and hilarious at the same time. Horrible that he was harassing you but funny that you ran over his foot. Hope he learned a lesson. \n\nTBH it is mainly been other women that have grabbed at me. One of my guy friends occasionally will put his hand around my wrist and be like \"Look at how tiny your wrists are!\" and another one asked me once why they are small but that is about it. Most guys who find out I have a musuclar condition respond in more of an \"Oh you are weak? Aww that is cute. Here let me lift that for you\" kind of way. While with quite a few women it is been like \"Why are you thin? Stop making me feel bad about my weight!\" I think if a guy did what those women did to me (forcefully grab my wrists and yank my arms about) it would be a different story. \n\nWhen I was an infant my grandma thought my parents were starving me (they were not). She would try to force feed me until I threw up. Needless to say we were never close. luckily girls generally liked me back then so they were usually nice, though i had two girls try to bully me, they just stopped for some reason. looking back they were probably just shy or something and did not know how to communicate properly yet.  i did get questions but never anything bad like grabbing or whatever. then again i always looked angry for some reason so maybe they knew not to go too far or get too close. that all was over 20 years ago. Most girls like me as well but some of them were not so nice. And sometimes they think they are doing me a favour by pointing out my skinny arms and asking if I have an eating disorder. I think also because I am mobile I have that \"invisible disability\" stigma to me. If I were in a wheelchair people would automatically know I have a physical condition. But to most people I just look thin.", "To infinity and beyond. Free daily nudes if you register on datekisslover.com and send me screenshot   ", "Who has fallen out of their chair? Here is what has added to my fear of falling!  I have fallen out. It happened in November...this is not a consolation at all because I broke my femur from the accident.

Not much else to say really, but...\n\n###***__WEAR YOUR SEATBELT__*** \n\nThis applies to everyone but especially if you have limited mobility, and I feel like my parents and I were just oblivious to obvious information, but there is a specific seat belt in converted vans to go around a wheelchair user. The belts on the chair would most likely stop most falls, but they are not tested to the same level as seatbelts. Sorry I just saw this but yeah I never forget anymore especially being much weaker than I was back then. If I fell now I would get seriously hurt.

Hi all, I am wondering if anyone can tell me what to expect from a muscle biopsy from the thigh for LGMD? \n\nMy investigations have been going on for years now,  but I have finally been offered an appointment for taking a biopsy from my thigh to determine which type of LGMD I have. Because it is taken years to get here I was genuinely excited to receive this appointment. That being said, it will be a few days before Christmas. I have been told to allow a few hours to recover but now that I am calming down I am wondering what it will really be like. \n\nWhat is the procedure? How long will it hurt for? Will I feel weird or painful days after? I just want to manage my expectations for the following days. \n\nIf it changes anything, I am from the UK and it will be done under local anesthetic. Will appreciate any advice or guidance on this! LGMD here.\n\nI had mine off my gluteus medius. I live in the US.\n\nI was sedated under general anesthesia. I woke up when it was over. I have about a 2\u201d scar. I did not feel a thing. Was not even sore after.\n\nWish you the best of luck. I had my quad tested was under local anesthetic and some mild sedation. Was fine straight after but once the pain meds wore off I was in quite a lot of pain for a week. Going up and down stairs really hurt. \n\nGot a pretty cool scar on my left leg though.\n\nEdit: I am from the UK. Had this done on the NHS in Birmingham. I would not worry too much. \n\nThe weird thing was the local anesthetic, my body kind of went into shock but it was not painful. Had very strange butterflies in my stomach. I am not squeamish but you might want to look elsewhere when they cut it out. Looks pretty gnarly seeing your own muscle haha\n\nI would not plan on walking anywhere for a week or so. Lots of rest. Have someone else drive you. Had mine done with a punch biopsy under local.  Was pretty easy.  Did they do a genetic screening first? I have been told punch biopsies are not as bad but I have not had any further information so I do not know which I will have. I am still waiting for results on the genetic screening. Thanks for your response! Thank you very much. Good point about the scar, I should probably expect that. I do not mind but I had not thought about these details! Thanks for sharing your experience. I think I will definitely look away! I was thinking about looking out of morbid curiosity but I do not even like seeing needles go in so I should know better. Thanks for the warning on walking around for a week, this is what drove me to ask, in case I would not be fit as a fiddle afterwards. Just glad it is at the start of my Christmas break so I do not have to go anywhere. Strange that they would not wait for the genetic tests to come back. I am into video games. I distinctly remember playing a lot of counterstrike while my parents brought me plates of food and snacks ;) I was 17 at the time. \n\nThe leg pain was pretty rough for about a week, kind of like muscle soreness but at an extreme level. Hard to walk. Hard to sit down and stand up from a toilet.\n\nBut honestly it is worth it. \n\nBecause I had this test, it meant my brother and sisters only had to have a blood test to confirm the diagnoses. If you have any specific questions I am more than happy to answer either here or via DM. There is no reason to get a biopsy if you have a positive genetic test.  Do not put yourself through that Mine was almost exactly the same, although NHS in Nottingham. The weirdest part was feeling the top of my thigh muscle move when they cut the muscle; so although the cut site did not hurt, I did feel the muscle get pulled down.\n\n/u/bringthebums I would highly recommend taking the day after off work, if applicable. I went to work the next day (walked in), and spent most of the day shuffling around on my feet. Really regretted it.

Last year Peri walked the last quarter-mile of the race, and she was set to top that, and she did so in an amazing way.\n\nThe weather was not in her favor as she was not expecting to walk the final mile in wet, rainy and cold conditions in this Miami race, as her father, Paul, likes to describe it \"She is not a mudder\". Peri spent an entire year training in her basement, doing laps around a dry, steady concrete floor, and everyone supporting her did not know what would happen when the downpour started all the way from mile 1 to mile 12. But Peri was determined, and despite how difficult it was going to be as it is in calm, pleasant conditions, she got out of the chair she was wheeled in and pushed herself all the way to the finish line in that rain and when she crossed, the sun came out for all of us to celebrate with her.\n\nA lesson to be learnt here is that that if you are set on something and determined, it can be done and that nothing is impossible. Peri is a young girl that just wants to be like everyone else and that is exactly what she showed. This is a lesson for all those out there with this condition, with Muscular dystrophy and any limiting or impairing condition that with enough hard work and determination, you too can get up and earn that medal.\n\nPeri marched down the last mile with a group of 15-20 people cheering her on, as part of a group called Team Lifeline, a subdivision of an amazing charity called Chai Lifeline, which helps families and children undergoing cancer and other life threatening illnesses. Peri was so inspirational with her story that she even drew the attention of and recruited former Mets pitcher and current SNY analyst Nelson Figueroa to march down the course with the team. Peri's team consisted of her mother, father, brother, sister and a group of family friends and supporters. When she got to the final home stretch and got into eye sight of the people in the bleachers, the place erupted with cheers and chanting of her name \"Peri, Peri\". It was truly a majestic moment, and this was a moment that everyone should know about.\n\n This is a story of hope, determination and strength that all should look to as a sign of inspiration.", "Does anyone have experience with MD-related hearing loss?

He was diagnosed in 2006 and is now 16 years old. Since DMD is an X-linked recessive, I understand that, as his sister, I may be a carrier of the genetic disorder. I have been married for two years, and currently have a long-acting reversible contraceptive implant that is good for about 4 years, but I would like to have children once that 'expires.' I do not want to my children to go through what my brother is experiencing if I can help it, and I am not the warrior that my mother is. If I am a carrier for DMD, my husband and I will want to be aware and explore other options for having a family.\n\nIs anyone familiar with the process for getting tested? What it entails, how it works with insurance in the U.S., etc.?\n\nThank you in advance. (My older vrother has DMD). My insurance covered it, and it was a simple blood test. I am in MA and have great coverage, so there may be a little bit of a difference.  Thank you for responding! \n\nI have insurance through a University, and before that had insurance through the Military as a dependent, and I have not gotten *any* straight answers on coverage and process. It is reassuring to hear from someone that it was simple process. I guess I will just need to be more insistent about pursuing answers.\n\nThanks again! Your OB may be able to tell you what the procedure is classified as, so that you can call your insurance, maybe that is a good place to start?\n\nBut yes, the test itself is very quick and simple. I had it done when my husband and I started trying for our first. We had a girl, and when we decided to have a second, I asked for another blood test for it... Just to be safe. Because I (well, we) had the exact same concerns.\n\nBest of luck, and you are in my thoughts :) If you ever want to chat, whether about our brothers, or DMD, or what have you, feel free to inbox me! :) I am not at all familiar with insurance processes in the US (I am in Canada), but it is a genetic blood test that is generally used.  One very simple test that doctor's often order is called a CK test.  Normal for females is around 120.  My wife, a carrier, tested at around 300 which was an indication something was wrong and worth further investigation.  However, it is not definitive either way. When I got tested I received advice to go a prenatal geneticist at our local major uni. (Yale) I did a blood test. They also did a spit test to see if I carried anything else.  Correct. My doctor originally sent me to have the CK test and my levels were elevated. Not sure on the actual numbers. She then realized I needed the actual DNA test since it is more accurate and they could compare my DNA to my beother's (he has DMD) and it turns out I do carry it.

I could never competitively play sports and have just general weakness and tightness in my muscles. \n\nI know I am very fortunate. I am 29 and it took me this long to take it really seriously. Just thinking that how I treat my body now will affect my ability to play with future kids and all that. I just do what I can to increase strength and stamina. Stretching is my best friend, it helps me feel a lot better and I am pretty much stretching something most of the time throughout the day.\n\nI have started with some weight training to help with strength and I am pumped that I can feel muscles getting bigger, I also ride my bike quite a bit. \n\nMy whole philosophy is that nobody really knows how it will turn out in the future for me, so all I can really do is take better care of myself now. \n\nI am not at all familiar with your type, and I am glad it has not affected you very seriously and I hope it continues to stay mild. It would probably be worth finding out what specific mutation you have (and why your parents thought to check). \n\nDystrophin is a huge gene (0.1% of your entire genome is just this one gene), and the final message is stitched together from 79 separate parts (exons), all of which need to be spliced together in order. A lot of mutations lead to either deletion of one or more of these exons, or to an altered splicing pattern (so one or more do not get incorporated correctly).\n\nDystrophin protein is sort of like a barbell: a blob at the beginning (N-terminus), a long stick, and a blob at the end (C-terminus)\n\nThe really important bits of dystrophin are the N and C termini, and they both need to be present for proper function: if a mutation disrupts the sequence so that the C-terminus never gets made, you get Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n\nIf your mutation instead just chops out a bit from the middle but does not otherwise disrupt the coding sequence (so you have the blobs at the ends, but just a shorter stick in the middle), you get Becker muscular dystrophy, which is typically much milder.\n\nBMD is really variable in symptoms: some BMD patients never experience any muscle problems at all, while others eventually lose ambulation (but this occurs much later than DMD patients). It seems to depend on precisely which bits of the stick you are missing, but overall, it is much, much milder than DMD, and most of the front-running gene therapies for DMD are in fact essentially ways of converting a DMD mutation into a BMD mutation.\n\nFinding out precisely which bits you are missing might allow you to find others with similar mutations, and compare symptoms. Maybe find a specialist to discuss your options.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, though: if you are 22 and experiencing no obvious muscle problems, and continue to be fit and active...then *stay* fit and active. I also have a mild form of BMD. I always lifted weights, but never got any bigger. I was diagnosed at age 32. It explains why my quadriceps sometimes feel as though they are being stabbed during physical activity and why my legs are like rubber after other kinds of physical activity.\n\nMy gene mutation is ultra rare: I am the 21st person ever identified with it, but most other people with my mutation do not have heart problems, and most can still walk in their 70s, but have trouble climbing stairs Thank you so much for sharing your experience..

I have facial muscle weakness (I cannot even smile anymore), curvature of the lower spine, pain around the shoulders, and weakness in my arms. Actually, my arms are so weak that i cannot even lift a cup of coffee anymore. Should I have an evaluation for fshd? How do I bring this up with my doctor without getting dismissed? Hi! From the brief synopsis it sounds like you might. I have had FSHD my entire life, symptoms started when I was 3; 26 now. I am sorry you have to go through it but you are not alone. \nThe best, sure fire way to figure it out would be a muscle biopsy test. They take a very small sample of muscle and do a DNA test. Family medical history also is helpful. It is a hereditary disease. However, like all genetics, it can skip generations and just show up again as well as have various severities. Your great-great-grandad could have had it manifest later in his life and not realized what it was and just thought he was getting older and weaker. \nFSHD gets under diagnosed quite often. Your Dr might not even be familiar with it. They are human too and cannot know every symptom for every disease. As long as you do not come in, guns-a-blazing with \u201cI Googled, and WebMD said...\u201d your Dr should be open to suggestions. If not, you might need a new Dr. It is your human, you know it best.\nThere are plenty of resources through the MDA and they will be able to help give you some guidance as well. Having an answer and a name to what is happening to your human is the hardest step but the most important. \nI hope the best for you, friend. Feel free to PM me any questions. I will do my best to help.  Thank you! Your doc can order an EMG and nerve conduction study.  Many insurance companies will cover this and its less invasive than a muscle biopsy and far less costly than genetic testing.  If You fail EMG, you have some form of muscular dystrophy and should consider visiting an MDA care center to get a specific diagnosis.

Sitting in certain positions hurts. Basically any time-under-tension hurts, especially repetitive engagement.

Some days I am in so much pain I cannot even walk the dog. I am only 33. \n\nMy CK (Creatine Kinase) levels are through the roof for no reason so my doctor thinks its a myopathy (muscle disease). However my MRI (brain) came back normal, EMG nerve test came back normal, and muscle biopsy came back normal.   \n\n\nAny ideas or similar experiences? Thank you. Get a genetic test done.  I have no idea why people still do muscle biopsies for MD.  Anti-HMGRC Myopathy is one disease that seems like MD, but is treatable.  I have LGMD and nothing you have written sounds like it. Okay I will get a genetic test. Thank you! Good luck!  The more I think about it, the less I think MD is a possibility.  Have you been to an endocrinologist?  Some diseases like Addison's Disease can cause muscle weakness. My CK levels was though the roof, at one stage I had to go to the ER for an really high CK levels (they gave me IV fluids and whatnot to help reduce the CK levels)... I was initially diagnosed with myopathy. Also I would get chest pains whenever I walk up hills and often get an heart rate of 180-200bpm.\n\nAfter seeing a number of specialists (ranging from private rheumatologists to sport science guys) with no results from them. Then with my GP help, we sent an fax to a major hospital rheumatologist department.\n\nThen after a few months, I gotten a phone call from a neuromuscular department of that same hospital (I guess the rheumatologist specialist work in the public hospital referred me to the neuromuscular dept), saying that I should come in.\n\nA few months later I went to the neuromusclar department and they done like lots of test on me, including a psychical exam, eye test, MRI on legs/hips and brain, heart ultrasound and like 20 blood tests....\n\nBut what stand out to them was a blood test that they organized called an dystrophin deletion and duplication screen which screen out for various MD and I have an high enough of a score to have BMD.\n\nI was diagnosed with BMD a few months after my initial visit...\n\nIf you have a neuromusclar clinic nearby, I would suggest u to visit them... not sure what your health system is like in your country, but its should be under neurology category.\n\nAlso as a another commenter said, also get a genetic test as well... You have not had \u201call tests\u201d for muscular dystrophy. I second the comments that it is time for genetic testing and that I do not understand why they even bother with biopsy anymore for md.\n\nAlso, EDMD is one that can hit later in life. I have seen it several times among members in our social media group. Very helpful, thank you. Yes, my doctor wanted me to see a nueromuscular doctor specifically as well but the closest one booked me out 4 months and when I finally had the appointment last week they screwed up the initial telehealth appt and forced me to reschedule for next March!  Now I do not know what to do. I will see if I can get a genetic test.\n\n  \nInteresting you have chest pains--I get chest pains often too but usually only when eating high fat foods--cannot eat bacon, butter, or eggs any more. Alcohol does it too. Cutting out fatty meat and dairy helps me with this. I guess I meant \"all the tests I have had\". Thank you, I will see if I can get a genetic test done soon. I think they did a biopsy to rule out certain myopathies. Thanks for clarifying. Sorry if I came across snarky. \n\nWho is ordering your tests? A specialist? What country? All good. I have a PCP and a Neurologist who have been ordering my tests in the USA. Wonderful! I hope to find answers soon. I am sure this is really hard for you. I have always had sympathy for people that lose physical abilities later in life. It is a huge life changer. I have Always had challenges so it is just what it is for me. Praying that answers can come with solutions!\n\nEdit: grammar I went through this exact same thing for six years - normal EMG, normal MRI - negative for arthritis, Lyme, etc but a ton of pain any time my muscles were activated, and a high CK. They did a biopsy of my *thigh* and at first it was normal, but when they pulled a genetic test I came up for a SUPER RARE MD variant called Nonaka. The only way to confirm it is with a gene panel, and to check muscle biopsy for \"rimmed vacuoles\", which I guess they do not do ordinarily. Unfortunately it is an orphan disease, so there is not much info available, but check it out and ask your specialist if your biopsy was negative for rimmed vacuoles, and which thigh muscle was biopsied, as Nonaka is selective (the glutes are spared for some reason). It also goes by Inclusion Body Myopathy with Rimmed Vacuoles and GNE Myopathy even though it does not present the way myopathy does ever. \n\nHope this helps. Are you experiencing weakness as well or just pain? Still try to get into doctors in March (hopefully you can see them in person rather than telehealth, hopefully the covid stuff should be reduced).... its going to be a big help. \n\nThat Is annoying how you have to change your diet, with mines my neuromusclar doctors put me on a drug to control my chest pains/blood pressure to help reduce the pains but i still get the occasional chest pains whenever its involves hills. I had a thigh biopsy when I was a kid... I do not remember much but i had severe eczema where I had to go to a specialist children hospital in Sydney to investigate further, which nothing seemed to be followed up. \n\nThen during my adulthood, I struggled with high CK levels where my GP sent me to a specialist neuromusclar doctor where i was diagnosed with BMD. Hey was the biopsy painful and any side effects? Also which doctor did you go to that ordered the biopsy? This sounds more metabolic to me - which can also have high CK and muscle pain. A lot of metabolic diseases are things that you cannot even really test for either. Interesting, I have not even heard of metabolic disease. I will look into it, thanks good luck! it can be a very frustrating process. we looked at some of the glycolic storage diseases when we were going through it with my daughter, which are kind of combination metabolic/neuromuscular. \n\nhang it there - if you dont end up having one of the major subtypes, the clinical response will likely be pretty similar, anyway. unless it is metabolic, in which case there will be some dietary changes. \n\nI am trying to think - have you looked into one called CPT2?", "Help with survey design for DMD Hello all, \n\nI am working with a team of doctors who want to learn about what goals young men with DMD have for their futures.

I am not the most fit person out there but I enjoy exercise. My question is, will I still be able to improve on things like stamina with my condition? Will I be able to build muscle in any way?\nI apologise of these are stupid questions. I am just really confused at the moment. Hey! I have a limb girdle MD as well, found out 9 years ago. Do you know what kind you have? There are probably hundreds of different versions. \n\nAlso do any of your parents / aunts / grandparents have it? The advice I have been given is that it is good to exercise, just try not to overdo it. If I overdo it in the wrong muscles, I can have muscle soreness for a week or longer. My doctor is not sure what kind I have yet, but he is sure it is limb girdle. It is weird because nobody in my family has it.\nJust curious but what is it like living with limb girdle 9 years on?

Heard about the disease: bummer. you get 24 hours to feel sorry for yourself. After that, I need you to start exercising like *crazy*, as if your very life depended on it. Doctors might say stuff like, \"Do not get fatigued,\" but screw that, they do not really know what to do any more than you do, and if they say otherwise run away from them.\n\nSo go do lots of different types of exercise, weights, yoga, running, pilates, swimming, cross-train, stretch, biking, do them all. Walk and stretch every day, but rotate different other exercise stuff on different days. Get deep in the habit, but do not get in a rut. And never skip - if your sick or injured, scale back, but still do something. Think of the rest of your life as a race against the disease, and you need to work like hell to stay in front of it. Try to get stronger at everything. Keep records of your progress. Make your entire life around exercise, and do your best to enjoy doing it. This is it, you only get one shot at this, so go for it!!! Hey! I also have LGMD and am 21. I was diagnosed a couple months ago. I read the other response and just know that each and everyone is different. I have been advised against exercise, (especially anything where your heart rate goes up) but no doctors really know how it affects. \n\nIn my case, I found out I was hurting myself while excersining and kept spraining my self (literally 3 in 3 months) that would take forever to heal so I stopped. It does make sense as I was working out with a workout buddy and she got a lot stronger where I only got a little stronger which all fell apart recently. \n\nJust make sure to take care of yourself whatever way you go.\n\nI do not really know much about this to be giving advice to be honest.

My name is Nathan Bray, I am a researcher at Bangor University in the UK. We recently developed a questionnaire tool called MobQoL to help measure how mobility affects quality of life, we now want to find out how accurate and reliable that tool is.\n\nWe are looking for people who use any sort of mobility aid (such as wheelchairs, walking sticks, etc) to complete a short online survey. It should take about 10 minutes to complete the survey, and if you are a UK resident you will receive a \u00a35 voucher for taking part! You must be aged 18 or older to take part.\n\nIf you are interested, please complete the survey here: \n\nYou can read the study information leaflet here: \n\nThe project has been approved by an NHS ethics committee.

Coincidentally after having sustained a mild concussion. All these symptoms were attributed to the concussion. I kept taking her back to the doctor who kept saying give it time to heal. November she was worse and expressing she had anxiety about going up and down the stairs at school, afraid she would fall and get another concussion. The doctor said we should consider therapy for her anxiety. \n\nJanuary 7th we saw a new Pediatrician for a second opinion. She immediately felt this was not anxiety. Gave my daughter a thourogh exam, ordered a slew of blood tests and immediately had her start physical therapy. \n\nThe night of January 13th the Pediatrician called saying she was sorry to be calling me at home but wanted to give be the news before the Pediatric neurologist calls in the morning. She said the test results show extremely high levels of CK and elevated liver levels and combined with her weakening limbs, fatigue, \"Gowers Maneuver\" to get up from the floor, she said it is neuromuscular disease. Muscular Dystrophy. I asked repeatedly what else could this be? She kept saying she was so sorry and that with \"the highest certainty it is Muscular Dystrophy\". I asked what form, she said she could not officially diagnose what form, and even though extremely rare, especially in girls she felt \"whole heartedly\" it is Duchenne. She said however the neurologist will be the one who officially diagnoses that. \n\nI am in complete shock. They said to continue to keep her out of school for now. Keep telling me the neurologist is the next step. That appointment is not until the 28th this month. \n\nThis week she is had an EKG and echo cardiogram. Both came back good. Now that she is cleared that she can proceed with the MRI with anesthesia they have ordered. \n\nThe rug has just been pulled from under us. They gave us no resources. No guidance. They just keep telling me to wait till we see the neurologist. I know that is only 10 days away but right now minutes feel like years. \n\nI am seeking to share experiences, guidence opinions, information. We do not have any local support groups, nor an MDA office. I have searched Facebook groups,not a lot there and they seem to specific to each form and we do not know the form yet. \n\nI do not know how to process this. I feel like the Pediatrician dropped a bomb on us and said ok I am passing you off to the next doc now bye! \n\nLost. Shattered. Complete shock and disbelief. This link, ( (also in the sidebar) may be helpful in getting you oriented. The only way to be completely sure what strain of MD she has is to have a genetic test ordered for her. Pediatricians are not able to diagnose muscular dystrophy -- that is strictly up to a neurologist. Pediatricians do not really have the information or specialty to treat the disorder.\n\nThe good news is that there is a lot of developments in the muscular dystrophy world regarding medicine and research -- within the next 10 years I am absolutely certain we will have a cure for most of the common ones along with treatment options to slow progression.\n\nAnd always, it is best to find out as soon as possible than later. The fact that she is still doing the gowers act of standing up means that she has the ability to be mostly independent still. It is incredibly rare for females to have DMD -- so do not worry about it too much. Most people with MD live complete lifetimes with little to no organ involvement.\n\nAs the other comment stated, the MDA website is a good source of material and will get you started. When she is able to sign up with the MDA, even if there is not a clinic in your area, it is likely that they have resources in your area through sponsorship programs who can help. Hi...36 year old woman living with congenital muscular dystrophy ...as of 2011 I was told more specifically it is Bethlem Myopathy but to be honest I think it is possible to be a little bit of each of the types if that makes sense. I have been lucky to have been completely independent with no major complications until recently. Of course I have always had some limitations (stairs, falling, easily fatigued...) but thankfully nothing too hard to handle, I also have supportive family that had to learn along the way with me. You will learn too and you will do great! It is made me stronger in other ways and your baby girl is too \u2665\ufe0f My best friend and I were driving home from a shopping trip when her son\u2019s pediatrician called and had the same conversation with her that you had with yours. \n\nI wish there was something I could say that might brighten your outlook or even your current mood even just a little, but that is your baby and you have been told that realistically she has a life long disease that has no cure (at the moment). There is nothing I can say\n\nBut I am still so so sorry. I have got tears now thinking back to that day and knowing that so many more parents have had that day too. It really does feel like the entire world shifts on its axis and nothing is ever the same, and I am not even his mother. \n\nWe wear our green ribbons and drive hours to go to as many of the walks as we can every year. We bought one of those all terrain wagons from Costco and take turns pulling him when he gets too tired during the walks. I have been looking into an adaptive bike for him to ride that has a handle for a pusher (a big-kid friendly stroller). It startles  me every time I think of it, but his life has been spilt into before MD and after MD. \n\nBefore, we spent hours working on homework and taking away toys and games for bad grades and behavior. And after, well, that is all still there because he still needs to lead a normal life, but we go to the park and play and we read fun books more often than the ones sent home from the school. He was even made an honorary police force academy student. He is happy. \n\nAnd I hope you can find some way to keep your daughter happy too. Her life is not over, and there is every possibility that a viable treatment will be found in her lifetime. And until then, sickness should not preemptively end ones life. Live it to the fullest and have no regrets. She is never going to really know a life without MD so make her life with it memorable and amazing and lovely. \n\nLots of love and best wishes. \n\n(And please reach out if you ever need it)\n\nAnd edit: I know you are still emotionally reacting to the news, but try to understand that the pediatrician is not handing you off to the next doctor. She knew something was wrong and figured out what it was, and found you a doctor who is so much better prepared to treat your daughter. Already she advocated for your daughter by recognizing that her anxiety was not the answer and she is doing it again by finding her a specialist who can give her he medical treatment she needs. The pediatrician is definitely doing the right thing by referring you on so the exact type of MD can be identified. Because she is female, I would say that DMD/BMD is unlikely - it is more likely to be one of the other subtypes.\n\nIf you live in Canada or the US there is a ( which can be ordered by the neurologist you see. The genetic test is typically the only test which can tell you exactly what type it is. I was 10 when I was diagnosed with limb girdle muscular dystrophy. 27 now. I had a muscle biopsy to determine the exact diagnosis. I had weakness, trouble getting up from the floor, trouble carrying things, my mom noticed a weird gait when I walked. It makes for a hard life for sure, but it does not make for an impossible life. Find a neurologist or a muscular dystrophy clinic. And send her to mda summer camp if that is in your area. I am 17m and i have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I kind of know what you might be going through. I will say this, the technology we have to treat MD is improving every day. I hope your daughters health improves once she gets the care she needs. :) First of all, I am so sorry you have to go through this. Your daughter is ill, that is for sure and she needs you now more than ever. Please try your best to not let this break you and do not forget to ask family and friends for support! Do not let this isolate you!\n\nSecond, without a muscle biopsie or genetic testing it is not possible to say which form of MD you are dealing with, For the genetic test one would just need a blood or salvier sample, but at least in Germany any doctor would need your consent for genetic testing. So it might not be finally Duchenne, but everything else might be similar severe. If it is Duchenne, she would be one of the rare so called manifesting carriers as myself. And unfortunately one of the unluckier ones. I was just recently diagnosed with 37 and had rather mild symptoms for in retrospective my entire life. CK was determined 8 years ago for the first time and is elevated ever since, liver enzymes are elevated since I can think, I felt tired for at least 20 years and I was always a little weaker than other kids. \n\nThe next step is to confirm the type of MD, if they have not done this already. Waiting for the final answer, is really hard, because at the one hand you still hope this is all just a big missunderstanding and it is just something harmless. On the other hand you want to track down every information there is, but you think you should wait, until you know for sure.\n\nOnce you know, you can start to learn about the disease and can start to reorder your lives! And you will manage, just because you have to, because you are the parent.\n\nStay strong and reach out, if you need help understanding the doctors, sometimes they are not very talented in talking in plain language and cause more confusion. Really sorry to hear about that I also suffer from MD but myotonic not duchene. It is best to live a s normal a life as possible vacations while she is still walking a little sport I find swimming is good and yoga helps with stiffness . To give you a little hope duchene is one of the two types of MD with the most research going in to it there are some medicines right now but they are expensive.there is a gene therapy called crisper which should come online in about 10 years which should allow your little girl to live an almost normal life it sucks but basically live as normal a life as,possible and power on that all you can do really. &gt; ...as of 2011 I was told more specifically it is Bethlem Myopathy but to be honest I think it is possible to be a little bit of each of the types if that makes sense.\n\nI am just curious - was that diagnosis (Collagen VI Congenital Muscular Dystrophy) confirmed by genetic testing? I think they took a biopsy that I had done when I was younger sent for testing I feel bad for you, especially since that is extremley rare in female Thank you all for your comments. We had genetic testing done, it came back with varients unknown but with one pointing to Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. That combined with her CK levels and how she is presenting, they have officially diagnosed my daughter with Limb Girdle. They now want to do a muscle biopsy to further diagnose the subtype since genetic testing did not pinpoint a subtype. Her Neurologist is baffled by how quickly she has progressed/declined in the last month. We saw a second Neurologist who also feels Limb Girdle. However they are sending us to a Muscular Dystrophy specialist in Seattle for yet another set of eyes on Chloe. \n\nI am still processing all off this. Chloe is now in a loaner wheelchair while her new one is being made. Her fatigue is unreal, sleeps 16 hours and still wakes up fatigued. She is been missing a lot of school. It is all so heart breaking. I feel so helpless. Thank you \u2665\ufe0f They have officially diagnosed Chloe with Limb Girdle! May I ask how quickly things progressed with you? In the span of a month Chloe is now is a wheelchair. She can only walk short distances now and falls constantly. Also did you or do you experience fatigue? Thank you so much for the insight! You are completely correct about the Pediatrician being an advocate! Even the Neurologist we have seen now has praised her perseverance \u2665\ufe0f Im so glad you came back to give us an update! I have kept you and your daughter in my thoughts since I read your post. There is tons of people going through exactly what you are, but your description of the nightmare phone call resonated with me so much because its exactly how it happened to my best friend and something of her and her boy shows in you and your daughter and it breaks my heart for you. \n\nI read your other comments here about her diagnosis and the new specialist. I hope they can do something meaningful for you and your daughter  \n\nI am not sure if you use Facebook, but it is could be worth looking for some MD groups in your area. Play dates with other kids in similar situations could be really nice for her, and talking to other parents who feel what you feel could be therapeutic for you. \n\nAnd I know you are going to want to spend all your energy and time on your daughter, but please do not neglect your own health in the process. This is a huge life altering event for you, your child, your family and your marriage. Therapy can help tremendously if you are open to it. I know it sounds crazy to think about making appointments for yourself right now, but you will not be much good to your daughter if you are not at the best you can be yourself. ", "New diagnosis in the family My nephew was just recently diagnosed with Duchenne - his mother is my wife's sister.  My understanding is that this is nearly always genetic and not a random mutation - following the bloodline back several generations, there are only 2 males from possible carrier mothers so there was never a diagnosed family history.\n\nWould it be normal to have my wife and/or 2 boys (both under 5) genetically tested if the boys are both asymptomatic?  Would that be something health insurance would generally cover?", "Muscular Dystrophy Association Book Drive **In just 48 short hours**, we hope to raise $1,000 to provide books for children afflicted with neuromuscular disorders who receive care and support through Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA).\n\nBooks are a way for these kids who may have severe physical limitations to let their imagination run wild and feel like anything is possible.\n\n**The hope is to gift the books at MDA of Western Washington's Christmas Party 12/2/2018!**\n\nThe best part? **Usborne Books &amp; More (UBAM) will match the amount raised at 50%!** That means, if we raise $1,000, that is $1,500 in books for these amazing and brave kids. AND, MDA gets to choose the books that they think will be the best for the kids in their care!\n\n**Donate $0.50, donate $5, donate $100.** Anything helps!

Growing up with a father who went from taking bike rides with his 5 kids to using a cane to being in a wheelchair full-time was very hard. My love for this man goes beyond what you can imagine. He is truly the most giving, positive and amazing person I have ever met (or ever will meet) in spite of his disease.\u00a0\n\nAs a mother of 2 young boys, when I think of the families who have kids afflicted with these diseases, my heart breaks.\n\nI also have more info about the book drive and MDA (\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "Cannot deal with how tired I am anymore and I think others will get fed up of me I plan anything, I fall asleep. I get comfortable literly anywhere for more than five seconds, I fall asleep. I fall asleep in company. I fall asleep when I have things to do. I fall asleep when I have free time. Any time, anywhere, I just fall asleep. \n\nI am scared it is effecting my relationship which I am very happy in. worried it will effect my friendships. My hobbies are all dead at this point, I am too tired. All I do is fall asleep. And I hate it.\n\nAnyone else? Is this part of dystrophy? I need to be checked for apea but NHS taking their sweet time, and in the meantime I let my life fall apart to fatigue. I am so miserable with this. All I do is sleep to the point I am. not even me anymore, just tired. All the time. Should mention I am a manifesting carrier. I have never heard of it being a symptom, but maybe for some dystrophies?\n\nI have Becker MD and fatigue and muscle soreness come easily, but sleep never does. (I guess my secret is that I am never comfortable/relaxed enough. It is actually harder to sleep if I exhaust myself too much.)\n\nSleep apnea is definitely worth looking into. I tried CPAP and did not tolerate it (or benefit from it), but it seems to help a lot of people. (Regarding alternatives, I have yet to try bi-level PAP. Someone on here told me there is a type of brace/device you can have made to wear in your mouth as well.)\n\nI would definitely keep on your doctors about finding something else that might be causing this.\n\nAs for friendships and relationships, you might at least try and have a plan that you share with them\u2014it is got to be awkward if you suddenly fall asleep, I know I would not be sure what to do. I am sure people will be understanding of you give them some warning (or I hope so, at least). I do not know if you have had discussions about it, but odds are that you are judging yourself more harshly than your friends, of6 they really care about you.  I used to be like this, then I was started on CPAP for apnea and improved loads. Was then moved to a NIV machine for bilevel which improved things further. I still get a bit like that when sitting still but it really sounds like you need testing.\n\nIn the UK hope2sleep do a charity testing kit which I have successfully used. my neurologist said he thinks possible apnea but is taking his sweet time arrranging the test so not sure if I was supposed to arrange it? I agree and could be too my friend with zones was the same. I have other symptoms of it too. I am not a manifesting carrier, I have myotonic dystrophy (it is dominant, so you either have it or you do not) but daytime sleepiness or somnolence is a very common trait. It took me 1 year for my sleep study to be arranged, 6 months to get my results then another 6 months to get my mask I am on my 12th one and still cannot find one comfy enough to get more the 4 hours use of it per night. I am on BiPap, which helps a bit but I feel your pain. I am physiotherapist so on my feet all day which helps me stay more alert, but more than an hours notes to do and I really struggle, after sitting for 45 mins I am dropping off constantly. \n\nI do have one tip though, if you are really struggling pop a couple of pro plus and lie down for a 20-25 min nap, no longer! A small nap will help, the pro plus takes about that amount of time to kick in so you should wake nice and alert. I do that in my lunch hour often (luckily I am the only one in my clinic so can just lie down on the treatment couch) and I find it has made a big difference. I really recommend the hope 2 sleep one, which will get you fast tracked if alarming I have days where I sleep the day away and some days I feel ok.  I do not have sleep apnea.  Figure I do not sleep well so eventually my body just crashes.  Honestly you may lose friends.  It is a sad part of chronic illness.  You will surprised who sticks it out and remains supportive.  When you do not attend a few parties and events the invitations stop coming.  Wish healthy people knew just having an invitation makes you feel better and part of the group.  Sometimes your closest friends are unfortunately not the ones who stick around.  They just cannot adjust to your new limitations especially if you were the supportive one in the relationship.  They may also just have no concept of how awful you feel.  I have to remind myself that I may have doubted others in my position and I just did not get how awful some people could feel almost all the time and how you can struggle to do something like shower which I would  have done without though before. Likely apnea.  Plus a big chance of bradycardia with muscular dystrophy. I was getting tired, got a pacemaker fitted and since then have been way better. \n\nIf you have an Apple Watch or something like that you could measure your bpm while resting. If it is below 60 you need to go get it looked at. How are your iron levels? As someone with Muscular Dystrophy, I personally have low iron levels and I get super tired and lethargic. My doctor checked my levels and suggested iron supplements. Since I started taking them I have felt better. This might be something to have your general practitioner check. Look into orthotropics. Your breath is your life. You have more control than you think. If you do not mind me asking... what is your quality of breathing like? It is not super, the respiratory doctor has me on a daily inhaler, which helps overall but I do not have great lung capacity. I breathe shallowly and not exert myself to an extent where I am short of breath. I expect to be using a CPAP machine in the future too. My girlfriends sister has to use a machine to sleep. Her face is sunken and she lives... difficultly. It breaks my heart because I do not want her quality of life to deteriorate and that is what looks like is going to happen.\nShe is only 19. I recently discovered that my breathing was shallow and that I had a slight facial collapse and I have to be conscious of my breathing in order to feel human. If I let my subconscious take over, I am tired and distracted and cannot handle social situations and cannot think. I want to introduce her to the idea of r/orthotropics to see if that could be a long term solution to difficulty breathing. You get tired and lethargic? \n\nWhat is your breathing habits like? I breath normally. Had a lung capacity test done and it was normal. It was definitely my iron. I had not heard about r/orthotropics, I had to check it out. That said, I had a long orthodontic journey in my youth including a major jaw surgery that changed the shape of my face, ability to chew, speech and breathing.

Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy is an excellent resource of factual information. \n\nThere are a lot of therapies in trials right now, some are mutation specific, so if it is available to you, try and get the test done to determine the exact mutation.

I have been introduced to PPMD since we learned this was a possibility. I am slowly becoming acquainted with it and it seems like a great resource. We just learned today so it is all pretty fresh. Our neurologist was cautiously optimistic about the potential for gene therapy on the horizon but it feels like a losing battle right out of the gate. \n\nI know we are not alone but holy shit does it feel like we are on an island with no provisions. It will not be easy, that is for sure, but the good thing is, there is plenty of hope on the horizon.

Help him carry things if he is struggling, do not force him to do things you think he can do (but do not act like he cannot do anything on his own), and something my parents did at first that I despised is: do not ever downplay what symptoms he knows he has. \n\nYou cannot really imagine what it is like to slowly lose strength beyond your control, how frustrating it is to see those around you able to do things you just cannot. But as long as you are there for him, he can just be a happy kid. I appreciate the advice. Ultimately that is always been important to us - for him to be happy. Not being able to relate or help or prepare him for what is to come certainly causes added anxiety.

Some I know of are Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, Muscular Dystrophy Association, Jett Foundation, and Cure Duchenne\n\nA great way for him to cope could be summer camps. I personally loved participating in illness-specific camps. These include MDA camps, Camp Promise (Jett Foundation), Easter Seals, and Serious Fun Network camps I appreciate the information. (Assuming USA)\n\nIf you are open and ready to connect to other families for information or support, then I ditto Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy.They host conferences and other events. They also help connect families to other families. \n\nThey have also got a map of \"PPMD certified\" clinics in the country. Certification is based on a lot of things but it largely shows that the clinic is comprehensive and multidisciplinary. DMD affects a lot of systems and ought to have a big medical team for the best care. \n\nIf you are also worried about costs-which is reasonable-look into your state's department of disability services and think about applying for services. In particular ask about waiver or medicaid waiver services. All states should have those services, most do, but some are more robust than others. DMD unfortunately gets left out of eligibility in some states. In general these services help pay for things that will be needed with your kid's care. Medicaid should come in and act as a secondary insurance to help. Parental income should be waived from consideration for eligibility so there is no financial line. Ask if your clinic or hospital has social work. They ought to be able to give or find more information. \n\nDuchenne Family Assistance Program is a broad assistance agency that can help with a lot. That includes parent connection and also helping you through the waiver process. They are staffed by people familiar with DMD which is invaluable in itself. \n\nConsider applying for SSI on behalf of your kid depending on your financial situation. \n\nAsk about or look into title V state benefit programs. Like with waiver, some states have better versions of it than others. It is possible it might not help too much but they are meant to help plug you into additional services/therapies and also ease the financial burden. \n\nIt might be a future concern, but think about and ask doctors about how to talk to your kid about the diagnosis. You are going to be a role model for how he should react to the diagnosis. If it is a closed subject then that just makes it feel taboo and it will not protect him from much except protect him from accurate information. It is his body and he is going to know if something is different than his peers. Not saying lay everything out at once, but a great starting point is to answer questions in age appropriate and honest ways when he starts asking questions. \n\nIf you have Medicaid, look into your plan's travel/visit reimbursement options, especially if you are traveling far away for a clinic. \n\nTake care of yourself. Especially starting out it is completely ok to focus on yourself and your own coping. The classic self care metaphor of securing your own oxygen mask before helping others applies here. Take note of what helps you cope, take note of your support system, and do not hesitate to get assistance where it is available. My best advice is to just be as supportive as you can. I know, I know it is cliche, but it is very important. I have a slower progressing from of MD (LGMD), as well as my brother. We were diagnosed when I was 8 years old and it broke my parents at the time, but what is important is that they did not let me know that. I had no idea how hard it was on them until I was older. Now, as a 23 year old, I talk to my parents a lot about what I feel because all they want is to understand. My dad often portrays a sense of guilt which breaks my heart. I am happy, mostly, and it is mostly thanks to my parents not bogging me down with the details (as someone else in this thread put it) at an early age. I was made aware, I was allowed to ask questions, but most of all they offered me support at every turn, especially when it started to get harder for me. They would give me anything in the world if they were able to, and knowing that alone as the person living with it is enough to get me through. Their support is the reason I am happy at the end of the day, and it is hard at times but I would not be able to do it without them. ", "Ullrich dystrophy Anyone familiar with this Ullrich dystrophy? What is the life expectancy?", "My father(50) suffers from muscular dystrophy, is there anyway to help him/cheer him up? Hello!\n\nFirst, im not a native speaker, so sorry for some grammar and spelling mistakes.\n\nIm 23 years old and my dad is 50 years old. I do not exactly know when he got diagnosed with muscular dystrophy but I think it was about 10-15 years ago. About 8 years ago symptoms started to show, he was not really able to walk longer than 15 minutes and over the years he almost lost the ability to walk. 3 - 4 Years ago he finally got his wheelchair since he was not able to walk more than 3-5 steps (as much as he able to walk now).\n\nI was naive and I never asked (and he never talked about it) him about his \"illness\" - I always thought \"Yea its some muscular illness, the only side effect is - he will never able to walk again\" but a few weeks ago we talked a bit about it, because he told me \"He is not able to carry heavy things and he cant carry light things for to long\" and he told me its because of his muscular dystrophy. I was a bit shocked because I did not expected it (and never noticed it). He told me it affecting literally every muscle. \n\nA bit later i googled \"muscular dystrophy\" and found out, that the illness is deadly. Google told me that most people do not get older than 40 years. Are there more types of muscular dystrophy? Is it a \"rare case\" that my dad is already 50 years old? Beside his arms and his legs hes making a healthy  impression.  How is the course of disease? Do people die \"suddenly\" or do their health goes down over time?\n\nBut yea my question is, how can I help my father? How can I cheer him up? I know a lot of people will suggest \"Just ask him\" but my father is a really proud man. He does not want any help. He does not want his son to take care of him. But my mother died last year due to cancer and his parents and me are the only one who left from his family. But they are really old (75 each) and hes really dependent on them (cooking etc). He do get help from a nursing service (cleaning his aparment, cleaning his clothes and so on) and just in case my grandparents might die, the nursing service will cook for him as well.Hes probably emotionally dependent on his parents aswell but he has a lot of friends. \n\nIm working fulltime but I try to visit him as much as possible to chat a little bit with him and I really want to do more for him. He has a dog (Stafford) and hes not able to go out with him, so the dog never saw anything else than the garden. In my country you need some kind of license to take those kind of dogs out and I want to get that license to go out with his dog sometimes and I am pretty sure he would be happy about that. \n\nThis may sound a bit strange, but as a person with muscle dystrophia, what kind of help/actions would you be happy about? Is there anything you wish someone would do for you?Even if its just a small thing. You need to find out what type of muscular dystrophy he has. There are 9 main types and they vary a lot. It is incurable, but he may have a near normal life expectancy depending on the type he has. I would hide  offer him help around the house with things he might struggle with. My dad and I both have muscular dystrophy, but he is currently way worse than me so I always chop the wood for the stove for him and do any of the heavier lifting when he is gardening. Take everything said in this thread concerning diagnosis/medicine with skepticism since no one is likely a physician here (including me) but I study Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Because his symptoms manifested so late in life he is more likely than not I believe to have a normal or mostly normal life expectancy. Based on my own studies it is possible he has Becker Muscular Dystrophy, a less severe but more varied version of DMD.  Some people are essentially asymptomatic but others have minor weakness while others lose function over time. The big thing is to look out for his heart, to make sure it is not being impacted by the disease.\n\nAnother possibility considering you noted his limbs specifically could be Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy each with varied trajectories on how they impact the person\u2019s life.\n\nA last possibility is Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) since it is the most common adult conset muscular dystrophy. \n\nIf it is really a concern you could get genetic tests done to find out what he has. I may not have muscular dystrophy but I think that trying to spend as much time out and about would be what I would want. He may not be able to walk, but if he can do even short trips around the neighbourhood in his wheelchair it would get him out of the house and routine and in different surroundings :) Or FSHD. Considering his legs are a big issue I would say probably not since FSHD typically spares the legs as a whole (though lower legs are commonly affected) That is a common misperception. I have loved ones with FSHD. We first noticed it through foot drop. Where there is no longer any strength in the ankle, your foot drops when walking and you fall. Then it progressed to less strength in quads and hamstrings. My family member went from walking, hiking and running normally, to needing orthotics to help with foot drop, to needing a cane, to needing a walker, to needing a wheelchair when out, to needing a wheelchair in the house when having to walk more than a few steps and where there is not a counter or something to hang on to. FSHD went on to impact their shoulders - they can no longer wash or brush their hair normally. It impacted core strength, making it impossible to get up after falling.\n\nWe had to put a chair lift to get from the garage into the house, and a second lift to get upstairs. We had to put ramps in. We had to redo the bathroom to give a roll-in shower.\n\nThere are some people with FSHD that do not have all of these issues. There are some where the disease progresses very slowly. And there are some where it is seen at a young age and progresses rapidly.\n\nAnyway, not to argue. But OP - ask your father what type of muscular dystrophy he has. And think about ways that can help him depednign on how it progresses. We found putting in stair lifts made a huge impact on safety. Putting in ramps helped. Keeping things at a certain level where possible helps if your father can no longer bend down and get back up again, or can no longer reach over his head. \n\nWhen my family member could go out and walk to stores or restaurants - they would get very frustrated when friends would speed ahead. The best thing was when friends would go their speed with them and talk with them, not making it obvious that they were trying to match their pace, but making it like a friend going the same speed in the same direction while holding a conversation. Since most forms of muscular dystrophy are genetic and vary wildly in symptoms you should find out exactly what he has as a first step. Also, If it is not an X-linked disease (defective gene on X chromosome) like BMD, you should get tested yourself.", "Looking to donate? I did not see any rules so if this breaks any please let me know and I will immediately take this down.  I am looking for somewhere to either buy bracelets or pins for MDA research where the proceeeds will GO to MDA.  I worry about buying from a side like support store or such since I do not want to just wear the bracelet I want the money to go to research.  We had a solider who just lost his brother to MDA and want to show him support bother physically in the form of a bracelet or a pin and monetary to the research.  If anyone has leads or information please let me know. From what I can tell, donations for research usually make their way directly through the MDA and I do not see that they have their own products. You just make a donation and they have the option for a letter to be sent to the person you gave the donation in honor of. As for the other sites with products, My first impression is that since they are not MDA associated then the proceeds do not go back to research but I could be wrong!

I just say I have muscular dysrophy, people tend to go oh ok and that is the end of their curiosity, I have never had any one ask anymore than that.\n\nSorry I realise that is not helpful :-/ Good topic for discussion. A muscle wasting disease that has many different types Teach, educate the public. I regularly get asked at work by customers, especially because I have only started using a walking stick relatively recently. I am finding myself getting really frustrated by people asking me what I have done (like I have broken my leg), but if people ask, I will tell them I have got a muscle wasting disease. Sometimes I will say that is genetic, but not always. I get asked quite often also. I am 27 and walk with a cane. I just respond with,\u201d it is a neuromuscular disorder\u201d. It does get frustrating at times, but I think I have gotten to the point where I just try to educate people if they really seem interested. I would also prefer they personally ask me what is wrong than someone else When my husband tells people he has \u201cMD\u201d they always think he means that he has MS (multiple sclerosis, completely unrelated)! So I think the advice to say \u201cneuromuscular\u201d or \u201cmuscle-wasting disease\u201d is definitely more effective when trying to educate others.", "Want to take vaccine but worry a lot Im a 25M with MD. I really want to take the vaccine but I have grown unreasonably afraid to take it. In the last 3-4 years i have developed severe thanatophobia, and covid going around isnt exactly making it any better. I am fully aware that all reason and common sense tells me that im way better of taking the vaccine than potentially catching covid unvaccinated, but im still really anxious to get some kind of reaction or literally die from the vaccine. I know the chance of that is just absurdly small, but still, thanatophobia and all. Im going to take my first dose in about 3 days and im going to do it, my sister is coming with me to make sure. It would be nice though to not have the moments leading up to it be this tormenting. thanks for reading Hi! My (F24) husband (28) has MD and we have both been fully vaccinated with the Moderna. He  a actually had less of a reaction than I did! He has Emery Dreyfus MD, heart failure and a pacemaker for context. \n\nHe had some body aches and arm pain with the first half, and took a big nap directly after. The second half, he had arm/body aches, a fever, chills, and exhaustion. But it only lasted about 48 hours, and he felt fine directly afterwards. \n\nI highly encourage you to get the vaccine! I understand it can be scary, especially if you struggle with thanatophobia. Sending good vibes your way, my friend! Totally worth it, side effects DO vary person to person but mine were very mild (I have a form of md ) Pfizer vaccine. My mom has Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy - she got the Pfizer vaccine - sore arm for a day on both doses, second dose led to a sixteen hour nap! Beyond that, all was well. \n\nGlad your sister is able to go with you, you have got this I have a Becker MD. Barely felt anything with the first dose,  second dose my arm was just sore for a few days, not much else. \n\nOdds are it might be unpleasant for a short period of time and that is it.\n\nIf you have not had allergic reactions to vaccine before, you probably have nothing to worry about there. \n\nIf you are worried about things like blood clots, aside from being extremely uncommon, just remember they can usually keep those from hurting you much if you get to the ER quickly after noticing symptoms. And you would have the advantage of knowing to look for that or any other unusual symptoms in the days after you get the shot (as opposed to many people whose strokes come with no warning). I have Bethlem Myopathy\u2026got both shots of Moderna\u2026only reaction I had was a sore arm  While it is too early to conclude that ivermectin is not effective in treatment of covid 19, it is not a replacement for the vaccine.\n\nI would qualify your post as dangerous misinformation right now.  Family with 3 people with limb girdle who are all fully vaccinated. We were fortunate to have minimal side effects that did not disturb at all. \n\nAll the best! FSH-MD sounding off: receiving arm felt fatigued during the day of the Pfizer shot, then became stiff overnight, before resolving out in the following morning. General lack of energy/bodily fatigue during day 2 as well.\n\nAside from now getting great cell reception, the side effects were quite mild XP   I had horrific body aches with it and fever was awful  but fine now tbf, you might feel crap but it is very very brief You got better cell reception? Damn, I knew I should not have got the Moderna vaccine. (Dmd) I got the Pfizer vaccine and a few hours after I got it my arm started hurting a little bit and a few hours after that I could not life my arm over try head and then next day it was still hurting and by the third day i was fine Hey there, new to this Reddit. I actually tried to see if there was a Reddit for people with Muscular Dystrophies because of this very subject. I am 38 years old and have been living all my life with what every neurologist and MD Clinic just calls \"Non-specific Congenital Myopathy\". Over the course of my life, I have had 2 muscle biopsies and a few years ago some genetic blood test to see if there was any hits--everything came back inconclusive. My father also has been diagnosed with a type of muscle issue and is pretty much in the same boat as me. Every doctor and specialist just looks at us like we have landed from Mars and says we are both enigmas.   \n\n\nWith that said--I have been feeling like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place on the vaccines. I know Covid will kill me. I barely survived a bout of pneumonia years back. But the vaccines equally concern me as well in terms of side effects. Aside from my enigmatic (lol) MD, I do admit I did unfortunately let myself \"go\" with a bad diet over the years which also resulted with getting GERD too along the way. So the combination as well as the permanent after-effects from that previously mentioned pneumonia has resulted in definite noticeable chest/breathing changes over the years.   \n\n\nI use to be fairly energetic and able to get out of the house fairly decently, but now for the past few years I have definitely noticed far more \"My body is made of Jello and wet pasta noodles\" feelings. So that makes logistics of being able to make and keep a scheduled appointment for vaccination tricky. I considered booking an appointment where they come to the house to give me the J&amp;J, but I ave a lot of concerns about the blood clotting issues. And since it is one dose, your body is getting basically the equivalent of 2 mRNA shots at once--so your body is going to be hit hard. I know Reddit does seem to have quite a lot of J&amp;J receivers who are also dealing with a lot of issues weeks post-shot that are equally worrying.   \n\n\nI know my neurologist said since my disease is not an autoimmune muscular disease, he thinks I should be ok with the mRNA vaccines. Again, the challenges of ensuring (and hoping) I have enough strength and energy to get to both appointments aside--I know the heart related issues concern me alongside all the other side effects. Quite frankly, knowing how every day I feel weak and dealing with so much--the thought that these vaccines can knock me down so much lower (even if temporary) scares the crap out of me. Especially since there is not a whole lot of information or posts I can find from people like me who had various vaccines and what they went through aside from maybe this one and maybe 2 others.", "Muscular Dystrophy: Can Stem Cell Treatment Help?

I am a manifesting carrier of Duchenne, and I am reliant on walking aids and have weakness and chronic joint pain.

I found out when I was pregnant with my daughter a few years ago. My mom is also a carrier (we found out a couple years ago) but had a healthy son. I always had joint and muscle weakness, needed I knee surgery in my 20s. I was told by the surgeon that I just had weak joints in my legs and elbows, but now we know the actual cause. Beyond that, I have been alright. Recently underwent IVF and did not do so great with the progesterone muscle injections. I doctor\u2019s said they had never heard of it, but my legs went numb for months and are still recovery months later. I am eager to get my daughters checked to find out if they are carriers, but I will wait a few years before we do that. There is a Carriers group on the ( a mobile app and website that was developed to offer support and resources to those affected by Duchenne. Thanks so much, I have downloaded it and already found another manifesting carrier like myself has posted. Appreciate it!", "Have you ever had people accuse you of being melodramatic when you talk about the daily challenges of living with muscular dystrophy? I tried to explain to people that what would not affect someone without muscular dystrophy affects us very differently and can be detrimental to our health. For example my ex-roommate would frequently leave spills of water on the kitchen floor and not wipe them up when they happened and would leave things in the walkway so I had to talk to her about not doing this because it could result in a serious injury for me.\n\nWhen I have talked to other people about what I experience on a daily basis having to live with muscular dystrophy they have said things like stop over exaggerating it. It is not that serious. And I am like WTH?! Yes it is. It is for me. I have tried explaining to them the things that we go through on a daily basis and how our reality is very different from theirs and they cannot seem to grasp how different it is and I have been accused of being melodramatic and looking for attention. Have you guys ever dealt with this? How do you deal with it if you have? I just have issues with my parents babying me. They constantly ask if I need help with stuff when I come to visit. I know they mean well, but if I need help I will ask for it. In my teenage years I started showing symptoms of the disease -- I lived with my parents and they did not believe that I had anything wrong with me. They thought I made up everything I was going through so I could avoid doing things. For example, I would fall a lot and I started losing the ability to climb stairs around 15/16 -- they did not think it was a big deal and that I was faking the loss of ability because I was \"lazy\" and a \"drama queen.\" The massive aches and pains I felt from my muscle atrophy were just excuses to get out of moving for them -- despite the fact that moving for me made me literally scream.\n\nMy ex-partner's mother accused me of faking my illness for years. She continuously tried convincing my ex that she had seen me do things -- like walk up stairs, stand up perfectly fine by myself, climb up on chairs and the like. I do not understand why I would fake this or why people would be so set on trying to make me out to be a liar about something like this. It does not make sense. Of all things she was a nurse for the elderly -- and my physical issues are very evident. Her reasoning stemmed from, \"my other son has M.S. and you are not actually disabled -- he is not as bad as you so you are faking.\"\n\nI have gotten out of both of those situations. I do not speak to anyone who even doubts my illness or limitation. I do not need that toxicity nor do I need anyone to deny or trivialize my experience. Other than the previously mentioned experiences I have not really experienced much negativity -- aside from an old gym teacher and some terrible doctors. Those experiences are in my past. They just make for good stories of \"wow, these people are heinous.\" \n\nHead up, we do not need that kind of negativity in our lives. If you have no obligation to these people I implore dropping them. All people are biased and the more we continue on our individual paths, the more biased we become in our individual perceptions. People that trivialize disabled folks will more-than-likely always trivialize disabled folks unless they are personally confronted with something that changes their everyday perception. Yeah I know what you mean. I cannot really get mad at my old roommate because she did ultimately help me by taking me to her doctor that helped me out a lot. I really think that without him I would not have won my disability case finally. He was in touch with a good lawyer who the disability judges love. Anyway though for the longest time she convinced herself that I did not have muscular dystrophy. She even did research on it and said I do not think you have Muscular Dystrophy and I said while I am showing all the symptoms of it like my mom is. This is before I was formally diagnosed. So when we got in the office and the doctor said yeah you have muscular dystrophy I kind of looked at her like in your face. I hated it because to me it made it seem like she was trivializing what I was going through. I hate it when people are like well I cannot understand it and I am not going through it so therefore it is not happening. I hate to compare it to this but I am also a domestic violence Survivor and it is how domestic violence survivors must feel when people do not believe them or trivialize what they went through or even blame them for it. It happened to me. My ex's family did not believe that he was abusing me until I got a big black eye. And I told him that he was stupid for hitting me in the head because I have a neurological disorder as it is and I used to have seizures as a kid and I told my mom about how I am starting to have things happening like my head will jerk involuntarily and she said that I should be careful because that could be my seizures coming back. Everything I went through as a kid makes sense now. From the seizures to not being able to walk up and down stairs without holding on and without going step step down the stairs like you know how one step at a time that is how most people will do it? All I could not I would have to put both feet on the same stair before I could go down the next one. I am still like that now. But I am sorry you went through that because I know what you went through. I cannot believe your ex's Mom though. That pissed me off reading that. I only hope that you are as comfortable as you can be. If you ever feel like talking feel free to hit me up. I think other patients are melodramatic to be honest.  Other people are more likely to be overly helpful", "Doctors cannot diagnose So I am looking for some help here. I was diagnosed with MD at age 4 but specialist and doctors were always unable to specify which type. They had theories but my symptoms never fit in any one completely. Does anyone know if this is common or had similar issues?\nFor background my mother has syptoms and passed it on to me and half my siblings. None of her siblings or my cousins show any signs. Since the begining none of us could run or really jump. Stairs are a big difficulty and over time muscles seem to tighten and get weaker. \nToday I fell in the middle of town and without a chair or bench around I could not get up until someone finally passed by and I asked them for help. Anyone possibly know? I have LGMD2A and have similar symptoms. I am 30yr male, started showing signs around 16. Do your hands have difficulty relaxing after a tight grip? Sounds like Myotonic Dystrophy could be a possibility\n\n My doctor too cannot rlly determine my md type\nwhen i said is this Duchene md she said similar but she more incline toward cmt (forgot the type)\n\nFrom all my big family from my mother line no one have this desease, only me and my brother, my sister is fine and healthy\n\nI go to doctor pretty late (22 y.o) but in my life (now 30) i never live like a normal person (hardly go up stair now is impossible, even walking is hard now)\nYeah my calf muscle too is hard like log i do say its not elastic and sometimes i fell like tingling in my calf I was passed MD and they did not know I was going to have it at birth, actually it was unknown to my mother that she even had it until it was passed to me.  For years I was diagnosed with \"Limbgyrdle\" and other types of MD, even the one that effects the face muscles (long and hard name to remember), but about 22 years later, I finally got a saliva test done and found out that it was in fact, Bethlem Myopathy.  Which I was never diagnosed with.\n\nYour best bet is going to be that test.  I do not know what its called exactly but I had to spit in a test tube.  It took a long time for the results though...\n\nI have the same symptoms you do, but I would assume those are relatively common issues in all people with MD.\n\nYou could also try to look at more different specific symptoms, to cross out any that wouldnt match.  For example look for contractures (tightening tendon muscles which cause your legs and arms to \"bow\" instead of extending all the way), keyloid scarring, toe-walking, etc etc.. it seems all types have the similarity of decaying muscles, but other symptoms seem to vary from type to type. Try to ask your doctor if you can do a saliva style test, I forget what it is called but it was used to finally diagnose my MD after 22 years of not knowing which exact type... good luck, and I really hope all is well for you. Get a genetic test from a neuromuscular doctor. There is no reason not to do it Is it progressing from top down? Do you have trouble talking, or with facial expressions? It might be infantile facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 or 3. Most of the time only a genetic test can tell you the exact type of MD you have. Depending on where you live ( This might be the saliva test you are referring to.\n\nHowever, not all MDs are diagnosable by genetic tests such as these, we are discovering new genes constantly. Other types are not covered on panels such as these. Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1, for example, needs a separate genetic test. Ahh good to know, thanks for the info! Other than cost, in my experience the test is not covered by insurance. Thank you for posting that, very helpful! Periodic paralysis manifesting as long term weakness? Is it better or worse on different days? In addition to the InVitae panel mentioned by aurry above, this is another no-cost panel:   Thank you I have been considering it for awhile but it is very expensive currently. Thank you this is all really helpful! It seems more to weaken the larger muscle groups in the core, arms, and legs. But thank you for reaching out. While I do seem to have worse and better days no paralysis. No problem, and good luck with your future health. My daughter has a congenital neuromuscular junction disorder.  It is essentially congenital myasthenia gravis, but the biopsy and genetic test came back negative (but not all variations have been genetically mapped yet).\n\nShe has generalized muscle weakness, and experiences fatigue at a quick pace.  When she did not have meds, collapsing after exerting herself (like walking for 20-30 min) was commonplace.  Your fatiguing reminded me of her symptoms.  Something to consider. I believe Parent Project muscular Dystrophy can help have you tested for free  I would contact them directly I had weird issues as a kid that were not diagnosed till adulthood... but I grew out of most of them... Then I was fine for like 5 years, and other issues began with the muscles..... 5+ years later &amp; still do not have a proper diagnosis. To be fair, I spent some years avoiding doctors all together.... but that is mostly because seeing 100 doctors in a year &amp; having no answers is an annoying process that can sometimes feel like a waste of time. I have received multiple diagnoses for the same issue..... none are right.\n\nI wish I were not in the US, because the doctors here often diagnose based on immediate opinion, rather that based on actual examinations &amp; testing.\n\nOne time I asked a doctor if we could re-measure my calf muscle to see the progress from the last measurement. The doctor said, \"sure! Let me get my measuring tape.... Oh, shoot, it must be in the other room.\" The doctor put their hands around my calves as if they could actually measure it with their hands, and said, \"Well, looks better than before!\" then never got the measuring tape to actually see. -- Which by the way, my calves were not better, measured at home &amp; they shrank slightly since the last measurement.\n\nHate going to a doctor for leg muscle issues, for example, and they do not even do a proper physical exam. Like my doctors did not do one, then I later found out from another doctor that I did not have reflexes, which is apparently a big deal. I have done two and they were both free. Sanofi-Genzyme does a free one. My neurologist just had to request it. Some of the LGMD foundations do as well.

Also be willing to omit things. A memoir cannot have every single detail of an entire lifetime without being bloated Thank you, that makes sense. I have also heard other memoirs tend to have a central theme as well. Did you do that with yours? Yeah I did not start out with the theme either. One just kind of developed in the process, but I do not commend doing it that way. It definitely helps to think about what you are really saying, and why you are telling your story.

It is not worth risking your life &amp; the lives of others. Dial a ride is an option.  I would try to use cruise control when possible and work on your leg strength in case you need to use the pedals - you can also help modify the seat to bring your pedals closer so you do not need to push as hard Ask your doctor for a referral to occupational/physical therapy.

Thank you.\n\n(", "I was misdiagnosed for 3 years, and now my new diagnosis does not make sense...any insight appreciated Hey everyone, this is my first time posting and my physical therapist suggested seeing if anyone had a similar story to mine so here I am. \n\nI am 20 years old, and I was diagnosed with myotonic muscular dystrophy 3 years ago as a junior in high school. My original EMG findings showed consistency with a diagnosis of myopathy. Genetic testing was done on me, where they found a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Because of this, they said I myotonic dystrophy, as opposed to myopathic dystrophy. We were a little confused, since my main symptom is muscle weakness and instability- which has ultimately resulted in dislocated bones in almost every joint, my back to develop significant scoliosis, etc. however, they explained that since myotonic and myopathic were sister diseases, having the myotonic gene in my case was explained by myotonic dystrophy(rigidity)  having some symptoms of myopathy (weakness) in more severe cases. \n\nFast forward to last week, I finally had my MD appointment with my new adult muscular dystrophy doctor, I was transitioning from pediatric. I had been waiting for this appointment for 8 months. Long story short, this new doctor (different than who I thought I would be seeing) told me that I had been misdiagnosed. The CLCN1 gene mutation coded for myotonia congenita, not myotonic muscular dystrophy. They did not even test for the gene myotonic dystrophy is associated with. They said the error in diagnosis was \"just a transcription error\" though how the obscene amount of doctors I see every year for the last 3 years did not manage to catch this pretty important mistake is beyond me. \n\nThis new diagnosis does not make sense to me, or my physical therapists. Myotonia congenita is almost solely rigid muscles. While my hands and eyes have evidence of that, my primary symptom is weakness like I mentioned before. I even am now having heart symptoms (it is incredibly slow, 45 bpm + dizziness and nausea) which would also be consistent with myotonic dystrophy, but now since I do not have that, it is unexplained. I am just confused I guess, has anyone heard of my weakness symptoms with bone dislocations and instability, as well as heart symptoms in anyone with myotonia congenita? This whole thing still is not adding up. I also took a medicine supposed to treat the new diagnosis per my new doctor and it did not work. It is also important to note that while I have a known mutation on the CLCN1 gene, it is still a variant that has pretty much never been seen before, in the first of my kind. While that could explain some differences, it should not be that much.\n\nThanks for any help at all, I am just lost and confused with  all of this. Everything I knew for the past 3 years just kind of disappeared.  Not sure who your new doctor is, but I would check out \nTo find the closet Paul D Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy research clinics. You need to be seen by someone who is actively involved in research and treatment. If you have an usual genetic marker, you may be of special interest to researchers in the field. \n\nI have FSHD and see a doctor from John Hopkins in Baltimore. She is actively researching my kind of MD, which means I am receiving the most up to date information about my condition. I am also contacted for studies that I am eligible for. I am currently participating in a study and my DNA was sent to the Netherlands. Because the lab there is the most cutting edge, I received results about the DNA deletions that cause my kind of MD. These results were different than the original genetic tests I had done when I was first diagnosed because so many advancements in the field have been made. \n\nI would also find out if there is a registry for your dystrophy. I am part of the FSHD/Mytonic dystrophy patient registry which is located out of University of Rochester in NY. They may be able to help you find the closest research physicians in your area.\n\nGood luck! Stay strong (even if your body is not). Thank you so much, I really appreciate the advice! The clinic I am out of is involved in getting patients into research but they say I am no longer eligible given my new diagnosis. Thanks again, I will look into your other suggestions!

If there is anyone please let me know what type of routine you followed. thanks I have myotonic muscular dystrophy. I am not a big guy by any means but I stay in shape best I can. Just wanted to give you word of warnkng. I do not know much about becker, but if it is the same a myotonic dystophy the advice is always light weight high reps. General rule, if you cannot do 3 reps of 15, it is too heavy and you can do more harm than good. Oh I did not know that I have been doing weights where I can do only about 7 reps per set\ud83d\ude2c. I guess I do not want to look weak and do a really low weight. Thanks for the advice tho going to have to change some things. I also have BMD. I am a little bit older than you are. I have not built a lot of muscle mass but one can see that i work out. I bought myself a gymstick (a stick with two elastic bands) that i primarly use for weight exercices. Quite useful imo since it is easilly adjustable by just rolling it up.  \nMy routine is pretty basic. In the beginning i took some creatine. It consists of jumping jacks, sit-ups, push-ups, deadlifting, weight lifing, biceps curls, squats, etc. I do most of these in front of a mirror to control my posture. I adjust them individually and stop or switch ,when i feel a little bit of fatigue.\n\nFor Example: I do 5 push-ups, then I do 10 squats, 20 sit-ups, short break, lifting ...\n\nI try to do it every second day, around 30 Minutes sometimes less sometimes more. It always depends on how i feel. \n\nI do different exercices while training, so I do not have to take so many breaks. I also do light weight high reps because it is easier to know when to stop.  \n\nOverall i would say that I have gained more strength but I have lost some endurance. And even tho i look more muscular than most of my friends. I am not.  It is more about mainting your strength and not trying to build a lot of muscle mass.. I am also not a doctor so i do not know if what i do is healthy.  But to end this on a high note. Before I started I could do maybe 3 push-ups if I strained myself, now i can do around 10. So it is manageable. I started doing weights 2 months ago and right now I just stick to mainly machines but I do some free weight for chest and arms. I also have one day of cardio and I try to do at least 10 minutes on the bike after every workout. \nI have not started deadlifting or squats yet because I simply do not have the strength but I want to soon. How much do you squat and deadlift? I dunno. The gymstick I have offers resistance up to 20kg, so around that number since I completely roll it up, **when I deadlift**. \n\nBecause of muscle cramps I walked a lot on my toes when I was very young and dumb, so it is hard for me to keep my balance, **when I squat**. Therefore I usually do it without any weight. Oh okay you do it with the gym stick. I am going to get those as well because today I tried a 30kg deadlift using barbells and I barely managed it. Legs do not have the capacity yet so going to have to start without using weights. \n\nI also had a lot of cramps when I was younger which is how I found out that I had BMD but I tried not to walk on my tip toe so just ended up walking like I had a limp. And I also have bad balance which is why I cannot do squats at all now even without weights. I have muscular dystrophy and I think you can gain Muscles but at a certain point as my physiotherapist made me lift dumbells to build arm strength and after that I worked out for 2 years and I gained reasonable amount of muscles comparable to a Pubg character without six pack abs\n\nI cannot tell you a routine as I did not followed one, My workouts changed almost every month and I used the knowledge from physiotherapist  and YouTube to workout\n\nYou should start learning about workouts and how muscles function and start working out it will not do you any harm : )\n\nChannels: I suggest Athlean X and Builtwithscience\n\nConsult your doctor before doing heavy workouts\n\nI am not sure which muscular dystrophy I have but my first report suggested I have DMD and I cannot get second one because of COVID the hospital was not able to sent my  muscle tissue sample to lab\n\nAlso they overdosed me with Anaesthesia Its been a year and I am not able to regain my muscles strength in right leg\n\nI are not going to get tested again as it only did me a harm (sorry for this boring backstory) Hey pal, I also have BMD (im M25). Weight lifting kind of saved my live. When I was 16, I already had problems while walking long routes or standig a lot. Then I started working out and it helped me. But BMD hits different, i was lucky in this particular case that weight lifting is good for me. But you have to be extremely careful not overdoing it. I can recommend to not use machines all the time, since it is important you train all muscles, for stability etc.\n\nSome basic tips:\nDont overdo it - your muscle ache might lead to sickness due to the creatin kinase.\nMaybe also try a martial arts, it helps your self esteem, you have good warm-ups and it is a lot of fun. \nWork out a lot with body weight.\nDo some stretching routines.\nBe careful with your diet.\nAnd just inform yourself a lot about the way your body works and which workout routines do make sense. It will help you, sooner or later. \n\nYou wont get bulk, I guess. I did all the right things, worked out on almost daily basis and did a strict diet and I was at 75 kg  with 1,8 m height at age 24. It was frustrating, on one hand, but your goal should not be to be bulk, it should be to be healthy and being able to have a normal live. You will have to take more time for your body and workout then others, with less obvious results.  It might depend on the excersize. Bench or squats, were you use a lot of muscles, a few less reps are fine. But 10 as a minimum. On isolated excersizes you should do even more reps, 15-20 at least. By doing so, your strenght will increase way faster, too, than doing less reps. Hi, thanks for replying. I see that you got diagnosed at the same age as me and I will be honest i used to have lots of cramps which is how they find out my diagnosis and ever since I lost fat the cramps have stopped but recently I gained weight which brought back pain so I decided to start weightlifting. I try not to use all machines so that I have a wide range of exercises per muscle group but the main problem was figuring out what weight and how many reps is suitable for me as I worried about muscle waste. I try not to overdo it because i believe that will just have a negative effect. \n\nI have been thinking of doing ju jitsu in regards to martial arts as it translates to the gentle art which is probably the best for me right now. I did Muay Thai for a few months but stopped as it was pretty expensive but it was quite fun and the warmups helped.\n\nI am not too bothered about getting too bulked but I was still hoping that I gain a good amount of muscle like most people so is that not possible as well? I have been working out for 3 months so I do not expect to see a lot of changes so soon but have you been able to have visible muscle gain?.\n\nYeh I guess getting too bulk would not be good for me anyway so the main focus is for the body to feel better and to be able to use all my muscles for as long as I am alive. It is very frustrating but I guess we got to work with what we got. I would not say I have built significant muscle mass but I am 21 and I joined my college marching band and have seen massive cardio improvements since I joined which is great. In terms of raw muscle mass, my neuro team says weight lifting is very dangerous with BMD as pushing too far is too easy and too dangerous.\n\nYou have to understand that BMD fundamentally inhibits the ability to gain muscle mass so you cannot expect too much. That being said, with new drugs like Edgewise Therapeutics EDG5506 in early trial phases, that could be reversed very soon. Super hopeful that we will see a cure soon, but in the meantime, do not hurt yourself by pushing too hard for a goal that may be dangerous to attempt. I am kind of clmjng to terms with the fact that no matter what I do I will not be able to build muscle mass like normal people so I guess I am just trying to maintain and gradually increase strength because it is not good especially in my legs as now stairs are getting harder and I am only 20 so I cannot imagine what it is going to be like 10 years down the line so I want to do why I can right now. I try not to lift too heavy but I still try with the hope I get stronger.\n\nI have not heard of this drug before but I really do hope that it is a step closer to even the thought of a cure because every little will help so fingers but until then we are going to have to keep trying to Improve our health using what we have. I am going to try to be careful because there is no point doing something that will halt or ruin progress in hopes of a drastic improvement. Yeah, I am 21 and the stairs are starting to get really annoying for me. I hate how difficult they are becoming for me.\n\n But just play it safe and see how your body responds. The thing I always hear is do not work hard enough that you have pain 24 hours after. That is a general benchmark for it. Just generally staying active is good to slow progress though.\n\nBut yes, that new drug is super promising. I was just deep in the clinical trial phases of it but had to pull out for school reasons. Hoping to participate in phase 2 yearly next year. Lot of hope in the medical community though, which is really good. Personally I think we will see a cure in our lifetimes, if not relatively soon. Fingers crossed", "Constant aching (LGMD) Lately I have been aching pretty much all the time, particularly in my upper legs. Does anyone have ways they deal with this? I have myotonic dystrophy, but I get that too, random pain in my quads. I deal with it my foam rolling, stretching (child\u2019s pose seems to do wonders for me, but only if I am consistent) and hot baths. Unfortunately it is just one of these things that goes hand in hand with muscle disease. You can manage it a bit, but I do not think you can stop it unfortunately I get aching in my upper arms. What helps a bit for me is to have someone rub them like the way you do when you are trying to warm up. Not too firm, and brisk. 20 seconds or so buys be a brief reprieve. Sorry I do not have a more long term rec. LGMD? Limbs girdle muscular dystrophy? That is what I have and when I am in pain I start doing stuff (particularly anything that gets me active).

And read that it could be because of MD.. I got shoulder muscles/ biceps deformity. No weakness really other than less and much smaller muscles on my dominant arm/ shoulder. I am very skinny and have very small muscles. I am 5\u201911 tall\n\nWhat are the symptoms of MD. I am going to a specialist 25 February. \n\nThanks in advance There are various symptoms depending on subtype -- and within those subtypes there is a wide range of symptoms and progression. So how MD may affect one person it may not affect another in the same way or even as extremely. There is a wide amount of variance.\n\nI have LGMD2A, Calpainopathy -- my symptoms are toe walking, weak upper thighs, hips, core, shoulder and biceps. I also have winging shoulder blades. I have difficulty standing up by myself or lifting anything above 10 pounds. I also walk with a swinging gait and had the gowers sign when I was younger. I cannot climb steps or rise up from the floor anymore. But, I can push myself up from a table to stand, can still walk and can climb down stairs. My MD is focused in specific muscles but my body seems to be able to compensate for the most part, as of right now.\n\nGood luck at your appointment! Thank you. I have one last question. Shoulder griddle is that your shoulder or the back of your shoulder on the back. Because I have what looks like a atrophy on my right right shoulder. But it is like in the front. So my shoulder is also sticking out, is this considered shoulder griddle? Look into FSH MD. My husband was also diagnosed with mild scoliosis originally. How is he doing now. I do not feel any weakness right now. But have had anxiety and depression for a long time. I googled it but scared to go deeper. I know it affects the face and arms right? - Where did his symptoms start and what age? FSH is face, shoulders, arms, abs, and lower body. So he was originally misdiagnosed with mild scoliosis as a teen. He clearly had some symptoms present as a kid like not being able to fully smile, shoulder blades sticking out, but when he was about 30 he developed foot drop. \n\nWe like to joke it is the most inconvenient type of muscular dystrophy because while he has foot drop and has to wear AFOs to walk but the prognosis with wasting  is different in everyone. For the record he is a professional percussionist and drummer so knowing he could eventually have muscle wasting that impacts his ability to do that down the road.  \n\nBut keep in mind if he never developed foot drop he probably would not have been diagnosed. lots of people have it and never get diagnosed unless there is a major impairment, they just assume they are not athletic or are just aging. We now suspect his mom has it as well but she is never been tested. What happens to your belly button when you try to do a sit up or crunch? 95% of people with FSH MD have something called a Beevors Sign where their belly button physically moves up, here is a video \n ( I do not really get it. It is hard to see what the doctor is looking at &gt; Beevors Sign \nAnother video, shorter with less fill, more to the point followed by an oral explanation. \n\n* (\n\nThis appears to be part of a video series of tests.  Will post more links as they are found, and will likely add them to the sub if showing merit. Thank you. But if this is positive does this mean that you have some type of muscular disease? Maybe? I am not a doctor, I was only sharing knowledge we were given when he got diagnosed There are many types of MD and many other related disorders.   Some have good treatments and the new technology is moving fast for everything else.  The doctors and insurance companies have bureaucratic procedures that they follow that are not always up-to-date with the latest science.  You are young and may want to take control and push things faster, especially if you are getting worse.  IMHO \u2014 taking control is the best thing you can do for your mental health.\n\nOne thing I recommend is getting your own WGS    (Whole Genome Sequencing) done.   It used to cost thousands, but today you can get it done for $200-$300 at places like (   It will take several weeks to get results, so do it ASAP, then bring the results to your doctor.   Doctors do not always like it when you do that, because genetic tests are not very refined.   They flag lots of mutations for horrible sounding diseases that will probably frighten you, but then turn out to be meaningless for one or another reason.   It may also be that the test immediately discovers what is wrong.  My Dad has scoliosis, and his WGS shows a mutation that is clearly linked to scoliosis.  (I did not inherit it, and my back is straight ;). \n\nMy Dad and I seem to have something related to MDS called CMT, but the genetics are not definitive for us.  I am testing a theory based on a mutation that I have.  An amino acid supplement used by bodybuilders eliminated my nerve pain and might be reversing the degeneration my nerves.  I have not yet convinced myself that it it is real, but I like the idea that I am trying something.\nBTW \u2014 my doctor is interested in my theory and OK\u2019ed my test.   His rules would not normally allow him to prescribe something like that.\n\nYour should also think about environmental toxins that your might have been exposed to, and have your doctor test for those.\n\nAnyway, good luck !\nGet back to us when you know more!", "Need a little help for my cousin I am not sure how active this sub is or if anyone will even be able to help, but I have a cousin who is looking into getting tested for MD.

(I am 16) It is possible you have inherited it.  Best to talk to a doctor or genetic counselor to see about testing. Yea I have thought about that, just need to get Medicaid stuff figured out before we can schedule an appointment  You have a 50/50 chance of inheriting the gene. Genetic testing can confirm if you have inherited the trait. In most case if you have inherited the gene and have FSHMD progression will vary broadly, even in families with multiple family member having different levels of effect.", "Any information would be appreciated. Hi all.\n\nMy grandmother had limb-girdle muscular dystrophy most of her life.\n\nI was speaking to my aunty recently as hubby and I are about to start IVF. She has now told me tonight that my father, who I have no contact with has told her he is a carrier for muscular dystrophy although he never told her what kind. My aunty also told me my grand mother was tested to see if she was a carrier of the gene in 2011 and was told she was not (excuse my ignorance but if she had muscular dystrophy, would that not make her a carrier?) \n\nIt might also be a stupid question but what are the chances of any future child developing this? Hubby is not aware of any family history of muscular dystrophy.\n\nThanks so much in advance for taking the time to respond. Hey. The confusion might come from the usage of carrier. Some people say that a carrier is someone with a copy of the gene but it does not manifest. So because your grandmother had symptoms, she would not be considered a carrier in that sense.\n\nRe: the likelihood of any biological children you have developing it, it would depend on whether you are a carrier too, and what type of limb girdle muscular dystrophy it is. Some are dominant (eg you only need one copy of the gene from mum or dad) and some are recessive (you need a copy from both). It is probably worth bringing up with your ivd doctor to be honest. As u/WhiteheadJ notes, it really depends on the type.\n\nIf you yourself are unaffected, this pretty much rules out you carrying any dominant mutation (if it were dominant, you would be affected). \n\nIf you carry a recessive mutation, it would only be problematic if your partner carries the SAME recessive mutation (or, potentially, some sort of synergistic recessive mutation), which seems unlikely given his family history. And even then, the odds of a child being affected would be only 1/4.\n\nThe one exception to this is if the mutation is X-linked (such as dystrophin, in Duchenne), because you have two copies of the X-chromosome (so can carry a mutation without being affected by it), but men only have one: any male children you have would have a 50% chance of inheriting that mutation with no 'spare', and would thus be affected.\n\nMost limb girdle mutations, to my knowledge, are not X-linked.\n\nIt would be really worthwhile to find out exactly what type of LGMD your grandmother had: it might not tell you exactly what mutations to look for, but it would certainly narrow it down substantially. Thank you. I will speak with our specialist at our next appointment. Thanks so much for the explanation you have given, you have successfully explained it in a way I understand!

With therapy I think transpersonal psychotherapists are what are commonly used for psychedelic therapy. Here is the Yale manual used for treating depression with mushrooms  :\n\nBut really al the real trials with this stuff preselect mostly physically healthy people. There are no scientific trials or evidence for MD as far as I know. So this could potentially be very physically risky. So be sure to do research beforehand.

Have a sitter and be aware of nausea and stomach cramps but they usually do not last too long. Happy travels! I have actually found shrooming really supportive. It offers a real sense of ease, enjoyment and relaxation in my body, which is not my normal state, and reduced pain during the experience. The first time I did mushrooms I felt more IN my body than I had in a long time, very present with my physicality in a way that felt really enjoyable. That in itself felt healing. I also had a long-standing area of tension in my hip let go as I just lay there.. felt amazing!\n\nI would strongly recommend doing it in a setting that would allow to you to be with your body and tend to whatever sensations arise, as opposed to being in a social setting.

Of course doctors are excluded here but I get tired of people on the street or people like my roommate trying to give me advice about it when she knows absolutely nothing about it. Actually before I was even diagnosed she used to go grab her computer and be like I do not think you have it and here is why...\n\nSo I hate to say it but when I got diagnosed I kind of had this moment like in your face. Because she kept trying to tell me I did not have it. Now she tries to give me advice like if you would just exercise more or if you would just blah blah blah. I have a son I gave up for adoption and I tried to get ahold of his adoptive mother to let her know that she needs to be watching him because this is genetic. My mom had it too. Now instead of taking my advice and at least watching him she was like oh he is fine. Like she did not even take me seriously at all.

I would not even listen to what she had to say because I was like until you have had to live with it and until you research it you have no idea what you are talking about. She kind of wanted to get mad and scoff because I told her look I know more about this than you do.

The answer to that is yes and no! The damaged protein in your body, Dystrophin it stabilizes your muscles so they can properly work. The defect means your muscle break down easier then others when you use them. Unfortunately, muscle training works by damaging the structure and thus promoting regrowth, but with defect Dystrophin the destruction might be too devastating for a training effect to occurs. On the other hand not exercising damages your muscles as well. So the art is to only exercise to the sweet spot just before your muscles become sour.

Do not expect instant results and do not get discouraged)\n\nOne thing you can try is using CoQ10 as a supplement. Studies say it is useful for muscle repair in BMD, my neuro team said it was worth a shot, and personally I think it might be helping. Maybe it is a placebo, idk. I seem to feel better when taking 300mg a day so I am going to keep doing it. Yeh I hope it does improve my strength because right now my knees buckle out of nowhere when I feel fine so that is a bit annoying and sometimes embarrassing so I hoped working out may help stop that from happening. Another problem is running, I am very slow and sometimes people ask if I am injured which is also embarrassing and I just sort of laugh it off but it does decrease confidence.\n\nCan this coQ10 supplement be bought from any store or only pharamacies? Because at the moment I do not really have any options for helping with the disease. Thanks, it is good to talk to someone who understands. Yes, the knee buckling is extremely annoying. I know exactly how you feel. It is frustrating because it happens out of nowhere. \n\nCoq10 is available at most grocery stores I think. It is a supplement so it is not prescription (ay least in the US). \n\nI completely understand the confidence loss from the running comments. Which is why I usually just tell people I am not going to run because I have a muscle disease. People always understand once you tell them why. It sucks, but there is no other option. Just got to push through.", "Question: Suggested Gym-based Exercises for FSHD Quick bio: long-time reader (great community, thank you!), first-time poster. I have FSHD which kicked in when I was 16 but only properly diagnosed when I was 24. I have been very lucky and progression has been slow: I am now 40 and can divide by body in two: 'nipples down' ok as my core muscles (stomach/back) are now weakening but I can still cycle 1-2 hrs (calves sore but not enough to stop cycling); 'nipples up' pretty poor, I can just about comb my hair but lifting anything (incl. arms) heavier than 1-2 kg above shoulder height not really possible without some 'trick' moves.  Physio/Physical therapy support has been very middling for me in that in the past I was very disciplined but progress was little or none.  I am now very worried about 'disuse atrophy' in that I have not been exercising what little 'normal' muscle I have remaining and it is now weakening.  So, I know swimming is meant to be great but between it being too far to get too (and very body conscious to be honest), I am going to the gym for the 1st time in 20 years...\n\nI am not from the UK but this looked like a sensible starting point: ( My summary notes are:\n\nMix and match e.g. if you have done a lot of walking, next strengthening exercise should focus on arm and stomach muscles. Avoid 'over-work weakness': tiredness should not be confused with weakness.  If you still feel weak after you have rested properly (ca. 48 hours) then you have done too much.  \n\n\n1. Aerobic exercises  \n\\- 30 min long (3 x 10 min blocks per day if necessary)  \n\\- 5 times per week  \n\\- enough to talk, not enough to sing  \n\n\n2. Resistance exercises  \n\\- 2-3 times per week  \n\\- Prevent 'disuse atrophy' BUT aim for ENDURANCE and not strength  \n\\- e.g. 1 set, 8-12 repetitions for each muscle group  \n\\- Focus on increasing reps than weight   \n\\- STOP before fatigue  \n\\- Focus on core strength of stomach and back  \n\\- AVOID 'eccentric' activity where muscle is being lengthened e.g. squats or lowering phase of bicep curl.  \n\n\n3. Stretching exercises  \n\\- Only do when muscles and joints warm i.e at end of exercise  \n\\- Length of time to hold a stretch depends on joint or muscle: 30-60 sec  \n\\- 2 to 4 reps and DO NOT bounce \n\nSo, after an overly long post (thank you if you are still reading!) I am looking for your experiences about using machines/weights in the gym.  My instinct is that machines, rather than free weights, will  help provide support for weakened joints/muscles.  If you have also gone to the gym to train for endurance rather then strength, I would really appreciate hearing about what machines you find the most useful and what sets/reps you have done?  Did you see any positive/negative impact and, if so, over what time scale?", "My pregnant (16yo) is a genetic carrier. My niece is only 16.

Is she open to having a CVS or amino?  Oh man, I imagine there are so many thoughts running through your head right now. I wish could offer some advice. Mostly I just want you to know if you need to talk I am here. What does it mean to be in counseling as a carrier? It is ok to be upset. Being 16 and pregnant is a lot and watching someone you love be in a difficult situation is hard.

Be extremely positive, in my case I use rude humor on myself. If the child is female there is a 50% chance she might inherit the gene or being a carrier. Males have a higher chance of being affected by it hence, me . The first few years are not concerning, the symptoms are gradual.

The cardiac arrest and collapsed lung event on Nov, 15 2013 I call it; \"My Death\". I had another event similar to it but less severe, but this my heart did not get arrested.

I managed to sit on it fine. I could take off but my gosh it went fast so I stopped after 5m.\n\nWas sure this was not the right option for me because I had to put my leg down and I do not think I would be able to put it down quick enough. Thinking of trying to find a tricycle version similar to this. Love to get some links to any if you know.\n\nBut I think this would be a good option for those who recently found out they had BMD. Maybe you used to ride a bicycle all the time and need a different option I think this would be a good fit but for me it is been a decade since I have ridden a bike so need something with more stability. I retrofitted my bike with an electric motor. Best purchase I have made in my entire life. Highly recommend you buy a pre-built electric bike if you are not a mechanical minded person though (or an electrical engineer like me).\n\nOn the stability thing though, I think you might just want to train yourself to ride a bike again. Riding an e-bike itself should not be too big of a stress with BMD (which I also have), and a standard electric bike will probably be one of the best options for you. Just my opinion though. I used to be able to ride a bike 7 years ago but now I cannot push the pedals at all because my knee muscles are completely gone. Also, I cannot put my legs down without careful consideration otherwise I fall over.\n\nI recently found a bicycle(?) I can ride. It is a race runner. There is a race runner group near me that has race runners to try. I can use my legs to push off the ground to propel myself forward.  \n\n\nI am thinking of getting this one so I can go around the neighbourhood.

I discussed this with my specialist and he reassured me considerably. He explained that my muscles had been failing for years without me noticing as my other muscles could compensate, but when my affected muscles had got bad enough for the others to no longer be able to compensate I went to my doctor to find out what was wrong. By that time all of the other effected muscles were close to that point where other muscles could no longer help, so it seemed that things were going downhill very fast but the reality was that the progression was very slow. \n\nWith the benefit of time I can say that he described the process perfectly and the actual objective degrading of my muscles is very slow.

Maybe. I am on gabapentin and Norco. Gabapentin and opioids (of which Norco is one) both slow the firing of neurons, which will inhibit short term memory somewhat. Do not be concerned that this is something inherent to you. If you find yourself stressing about an instance of your mind slowing, remind yourself that you are taking two different sedating drugs; this may help you stay calm and not try to blame other people for what is happening. A chronic disease diagnosis can also effect your mood. So if this stuff continues to bother you, please speak to your primary care doctor or GP about it :) I find I am tired a lot because of my MD. Fatigue does not do your memory any favours so it could just be tiredness that is making you forget things. I think it is probably stress too.

It was a really horrible situation when a year later we reconnected whilst he was in hospital where he told me he loved me still, then he died the next day. After his death I found out he had a girlfriend, who was madly in love with him. \nWhen Kane and I broke up, he expressed to me that he felt like I was his only chance at finding love, as he thought that nobody would be able to see past his disability like I could. I thought he was so stupid to think that, he was such a beautiful soul- maybe beautiful is not the word... he was rude, abnoxious, and down right disgusting in the way a 4 year old boy might be, making poo jokes and picking his nose... but he fascinated me, was gentle and supportive and loved me harder and faster than anyone else ever had.\nBut he thought nobody else would love him, and I just could never accept that that was his reality. I adored him, and I was convinced someone else would too.\nThey did, but sadly he did not love them back... much in the same way that I did not truly love him back.\n\nI want to tell this story, however I am very aware of representation in media. I have had a successful career, but it has been built on ensuring that I have the fullest understanding of my characters. \nKane did not like to talk about the reality of his condition, lying to me on his death bed that everything was fine only to be gone forever 24 hours later. \nI was hoping to make this a more universal film to those who have muscular dystrophy and to paint the most realistic portrait possible.\n\nIf you would be so willing, I would love you to share your stories of love, and rejection.

I am a rare female manifesting carrier of duchenne MD. I was diagnosed 5 years ago when I was your age. I struggle walking up stairs and inclines and when I fall I cannot get up without help.\nI was sent to a neurologist and had to get a muscle biopsy and the doctors were able to figure out I had duchenne. I now have and now have a muscular dystrophy doctor I see once a year.\nMy last visit I found out I am getting weaker and he suggested steroids. They will give me a little strength back and slow the disease progress. Steroids have so many bad side effects, I am still thinking about taking them. I hate being so tired and drained of energy from doing everyday tasks so I am getting closer to just taking them. Sorry this is so long, it sucks you are going through this but at the same time it is nice to know I am not alone. Start with looking at looking at the MDA website under Limb Girdle since you had that diagnosis years ago.  There are many different types of LGMD.  I have type 2B.  I too went through 3 different rounds of painful needle poking (Electromyography).  There are many different blood tests available to determine which sub-type of LGMD you may have. \n\nThe reason that the info on this disease is so varied and vague is because little is know about them and each persons progression is different.  There is no set rule that you will be wheelchair bound within 10 years of symptom onset.  There is no clear progression path.  I am 40 and can still walk short distances.  I use a cane to help with balance.  Just last year I bought a motorized scooter for longer walks, like going to a stadium event or walking around a zoo.  \n\nI became a father around 30 years old.  My daughter knows about my disability but I try not to let it affect her much.  I may not be able to coach her softball team but I am there each practice and game to cheer her on.\n\nFor you to pass on your type of MD to your child, both you and your husband need to have the defective gene.  It is extremely unlikely for him to be a carrier.  But he can be tested as well once you have your diagnosis.   \n\nAs for your marriage, this will be a big change.  I do know several married couples where the woman has MD and is happily married.  I would probably recommend some type of couples therapy to help you both deal with your progression.  As for sex life, I do not think there is a direct link to any decrease in sex drive and MD.  You may face issues with not being able to be as active as before and this could cause issues.  But as long as both of you are willing to adapt to the changes that are needed, you can still enjoy a health sex life.  \n\nIt took me around 8 years from when I first noticed something was wrong to finally seeing  doctor about my increasing muscle weakness.  I too felt guilty and angry that something was wrong.  Knowing exactly which type of LGMD I had brought me some relief.  It still took a while to deal with all the changes.  It is not a short process.  \n\nMy advise in the stage you are at would be to try to remain as active as possible without overdoing it.  Walk when you can, swimming is excellent for MD patients.  Avoid heavy stresses to your muscles (so yes, no crossfit for you).  I personally attribute my continued mobility to keeping up with my daughter for the past 10 years.  I think keeping slightly active if a good thing.  But do not think any Dr. will give you any straight answers like do this or do not do that.  They really do not know much about the disease.  \n\nThere are several companies developing cures for types of MD.  And some for various types of LGMD.  It is a long process so we must be patient.   \n\nHope that helps some. We are not alone. It truly does help. Thank you! I know exactly what you are going through. I was recently diagnosed with the same condition with no symptoms as a child. I am a 26 year old male and am currently undergoing huge life changes and wondering the same questions as you. My fianc\u00e9 is very supportive and believes that this should not define who I am as a person. I am in medical school and worry that I cannot physically continue. I currently use a wheelchair for long distances so that I do not do any more damage than necessary. It took a while for me to wrap my head around the idea, but I realized that I should do what is best for my health. Things will definitely be difficult at times, but I am positive you can tackle anything that comes your way and find your own way to do certain things while still living the happiest life you can. Hope this helps a bit You have probably talked to a doctor already but for certain MDs especially in boys you only need one parent to have the disease to pass it on. This is due to the mother's x or fathers y chromosome. Girls have two xs so they have 1as like a proofread, although carrier manifestation does happen it is rare. Also why females have less likelihood of MD.", "Weight Lifting With LGMD Hey, everyone.\n\nI was diagnosed with LGMD after being sent to the hospital for the second time in my military career with Rhabdo. Shortly after that, they found that I also am dealing with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. It was a lot to take in, but after being medically retired, I have decided that I will not just let myself waste away.\n\nI have recently spoken to a Cardiologist, Neurologist and Nephrologist to run routine labs to ensure my CK levels, heart and kidneys stay relatively safe. \n\nI was just wondering if any of you have any recommendations for weight lifting? I got into it a few months ago, but had to take a long break after being hospitalized a third time for, you guessed it, Rhabdo. Part of it is just struggling to come to terms with not being able to go as hard in the gym as I used to. Guess I am still trying to break myself out of that USMC mindset!\n\nThanks for taking the time to look this over. Hey! I just wanted to say hi and wish you good luck. I was also diagnosed recently. I was trying to work out to lose weight but then kept hurting myself and found out I had weak hip muscles which led to getting diagnosed. I was advised to basically not work out at all by my neurologist( which is ironic because I had recently found an activity I liked in very long while).\n\nSorry, this probably was not the answer you are looking for but I saw your update and thought I would respond anyways.  I have fascioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and working at McDonald's has really seemed to benefit me. I have no clue about lgmd but I do know that depending on what type you have depends on if exercise is beneficial. If you did not show symptoms until later in life it probably will not progress too severely. I would say not to do too much heavy weight lifting as it can damage muscles. I would start with yoga and very light weights and work your way up from there. Best of luck Thank you very much for your advice, I really appreciate it. I had a conversation with my Neurologist and she recommended that I look for a personal trainer who can draw up a routine that keeps my limitations in mind.  Good luck! Hope you can find a good trainer. I have been debating trying to work out more or not so let me know how your journey goes. \n\nAlso please be careful, when I sprained myself, it took like 9 weeks to recover.( This is really why I have been hesitant to try again) Hi Im_Not_CreativeFL.\nOk, I have had LGMD2B for about 20 years. When i was first diagnosed I was just like you thinking that i would not allow my self to deteriorate and fight it by lifting weights. Well turned out that was the worse thing i could of done. The workouts greatly accelerated how fast i lost muscle. At first its not noticeable but you eventually reach a level that a workout leaves you with a loss of strength that is very noticeable. It was not until I saw a LGMD specialist who explained to me that my body no longer had the ability to repair torn muscle so all those workouts were hurting me instead of helping. He said to only do exercises that are non-muscle distinctive like pool therapy. I recommend you talk to a LGMD specialist before you accelerate your loss of strength. Good luck  ", "The cold is making me feel so weak I can hardly walk let alone get out of bed I hurt so bad I cannot do much of anything.

Hey,\nAnyone lurking here with SMA currently getting SPINRAZA injections?  Although my first loading dose was literally four or five days ago, things have already begun to change...it is weird and exciting.  \n\nIf anyone has any experience or anything let me know, it would be great to talk to someone.  \n\nCheers! My mum had SMA. I really hope things go well for you. Thanks.  Sorry to hear about your mom.  What type of SMA did she have? 4. The adult onset type. She and one of her brothers both had it. My mum was diagnosed in her 50s.\n\nCan you tell me what changes you have seen? I googled but could not find anything describing expected or hoped for reactions. I am really excited for you. SMA 4, interesting, I was not aware of the adult onset version but I am not surprised at all.  There is so many variations that the information is always expanding.  For instance I grew up with a gal that had the same unique diagnosis as her father, and those were the first ever discoveries of that particular subset of MD.  It was rare enough they ended up naming it after them.  Did your mom's brother have the same version or a more heavy diagnosis?  I know that the severity can be like night and day.  I was adopted so the lineage of genetic disorders in my family is completely unknown.\n\nI noticed changes literally the afternoon after the injection.  Not quite like Captain America after the Super Soldier Serum, abs, arms and a great smile...  But being honest, I am in my early 30's, it is not easy to get your hopes up for a 'cure' after the reality of the disease your entire life.  It always seemed impossible.  But I will be damned, the first thing I noticed when getting back in my chair was my neck and stomach muscles felt different.  It felt like I had more control and it is been easier to keep my head vertical instead of just letting it flop over sideways most of the day.  Besides the neck and core, my main right hand feels like I have a better grip, and my driving hand that has atrophied pretty severely feels like it can move a little better. It is really wild.  It is been two weeks since my first injection, and it feels like there is already been improvements, and the next is scheduled for the following Thursday...so who knows what to expect.  All of the staff, nurses, and gene specialists say that the real measurable changes are not visible until around the six to eight month range, so maybe it is about to really pick up, who knows?  All the research so far has been done on kids under fifteen, so there is not much to go on.  I have been lucky though, my version of SMA2 allowed me to be able to feed myself, draw/paint, and do a lot of things independently up until about seven years ago, so I am really hoping that the incapacitated nerves can fire back up again.  I daydream about what it would have been like to get the injection in my teens, but I am just lucky to have it at all.  So yeah, that is it so far. That sounds incredibly positive! I am really rooting for you. It will be awesome if you can reclaim whole areas of your life. I know, I know - do not get too excited. Any improvement is a bonus. But still! *crosses fingers*\n\nMy mum and my uncle had SMA-4. They were both fully able-bodied up until their 40s. My uncle was incapacitated faster although he was 10 years younger. He was using an electric wheelchair the last few years of his life. He died when he was 57. It was totally unexpected.\n\nI am disabled too, but it is muscular dystrophy. The doctors want to rediagnose my mum or uncle or me because there should not be SMA and MD in one family. I never met my dad though so who knows what his medical history was. Thanks for the positivity, I appreciate it.  \n\nThat late stage SMA is rough.  Sounds similar to the rapid progression of ALS.  \n\nAbout your diagnosis, SMA is a form of Muscular Dystrophy.  It is under the same umbrella, so there is several forms of Muscular Dystrophy like Duchennes, Becker, \nLimb-girdle.  So do you mean you have MS or...?  Because it would be rare to have MS and MD of any form in the same family.  If you have even the slightest chance of having SMA you should definitely look at getting a genetic test and go from there.  If Spinraza is then an option at that point, go after it. You are welcome. I really hope things continue to improve for you.\n\nNo, not MS. I have Welander Myopathy, it is definitely MD. I thought SMA was not a muscular dystrophy though the symptoms overlap a lot? The doctors checked and double-checked me for SMA. It is definitely not that. (They repeatedly said \"it is not SMA\" on my muscle biopsy report.)\n\nALS is terrifying. I am really glad I do not have that. Muscle Biopsy Report?  I have never had one of those before.  \n\n\nMy parents never got an official genetic test when I was young.  I finally had gotten it done in the last year while working toward Spinraza.  My parents and doctors literally guessed and everyone went along with it...luckily they got it right.  I am happy there is actually something now, and hopefully something will come down the pipe for the variations of myopathy.   Maybe your symptoms were obvious enough? It would have been awful if it would turned out you had something else just when Spinraza came along.\n\nThe neurologist ordered a muscle biopsy. They cut open my arm and cut out a chunk of muscle to test. You did not miss anything great, trust me. It was done under local anaesthetic. *shudders* Apparently, that bit of me was sent to Sweden as Welander Myopathy is only found in those with Swedish ancestry. (Lucky me!)\n\nI think they have found something for Duchenne MD. I read they were doing trials up in Scotland. (I am in England.) Who knows what they will figure out next? Although I have not started just yet my first injection is scheduled for this coming Wednesday at 9 AM, I must admit that I am extremely nervous about the procedure however I will feel blessed just to maintain my current levels. I look forward to following your journey and quite possibly sharing my years as well. Just a few days away!  I hope that it goes quick for you.   Depending on how messed up your spine is it takes a bit longer...my horrid scoliosis makes it more complicated than it should be.  I had my second shot on Thursday and have another in a few weeks.  Hope all goes well for you and definitely report back when/if you feel any changes!  3 and 1/2 hours before leaving for my injection this morning I woke with a splitting migraine ... dose #1 will now be on the 8th. I have let myself down but I will not hold myself here...  That is alright, at least you are still on the path.  It took me about a year and a half between insurance providers, doctors and coordinators to get the first injection.  Hopefully a few weeks in addition to your adventure is not so bad.

The are going to do an EMG in my right arm and leg to determine for sure if it is Muscular Dystrophy or ALS without me having to do more blood work. She said it is typically not painful, they do it in office, and I should be able to drive myself home afterwards. I am thinking of having my husband go with me anyways for emotional support and to make sure I get there and back safely since my right leg likes to randomly give out on me. She explained it to me, so I know its going to be tiny needles and then electrical currents through my arm and leg. Are there any problems I should know about when it comes to this test? How painful is it? Do not wear any kind of perfume and/or lotion.. I have had both legs and arms. I find it irritating more than annoying.. Getting tattoed is worse.. its not that big of a deal. you got this :) I have a tat as well! It was mildly painful to have that done to me.

I take low dose Norco, but not everyday. I take meloxicam everyday and sit on a heat pad a lot, both help a little. I would get a medical marijuana card if it was not so expensive where I live. I had low dose THC gummies once that helped way better than anything else.

I also got a surround sound system in my bedroom where I currently spend the majority of my time. I also listen to self development audio books, meditate every morning and night, and  take online courses to keep my mind occupied. Right now I am taking a mortgage broker course at the University of British Columbia Sauder School of Business in Canada. I am trying my best to stay happy and live a positive life. The most difficult part of my life however is dealing with the fact that I may never get to experience being in a relationship, not being able to hold down a job anymore due to the progression of DMD, not being able to travel anymore due to being on a ventilator 24/7 and being very malnourished. I also had major spinal fusion surgery back in 2009 which was a 10 hour surgery for correcting scoliosis (curvature of the spine).  So in conclusion, I would strongly suggest to you as a parent to do as much as possible with your boys while you can. Time flies so damn quick and you just never what may or may not happen in terms of progression of this disease. My parents are divorced, father was also physically and emotionally abusive to my mother, brother and I. Despite this I have traveled to many different places in the world including; Disney World, Disneyland, Hawaii, England, India, Abu Dhabi, and Mexico. \n\nIf you have any more questions just ask. It makes me feel good helping others out especially when I have been through all the stages of DMD ;)    \n Hi, I have two son. Elder one is 9 years old and the little one is six. We are aware of this situation for 5 years. Both can walk for now, but it is hard to run or climb ladders for the bigger one. We are using corticosteroids. We are trying to do the best we can to enjoy life together. There are some medical developments but there is no cure for now as far as I know. We are just hoping for a new treatment. By the way my boys have duplication if it makes sense for you. Good luck.  I do not know much about DMD, I have limb girdle MD. Have you heard of this website: \n\nMy best to you and your family.

My wife and I have been considering having a baby. I am the one with Myotonic Dystrophy, we both understand the risks of having a child that this may pass to.  And yes, we are working with medical professionals to get their opinions and options.  I am just curious to see if anyone took the risk and it turned out well?", "A Mess I was diagnosed with md, and although I have not had a genetic diagnosis, doctors say it is most likely LGMD. The onset was when I was 4~5yrs old and now I am 22. Fortunately, the severity(do not know what else should I say) of the MD is low, so the progression is very slow. I have only recently started to notice my inability to run (I could barely before, but now it is close to gone). I also can barely lift my arms over my head, and things are only worsening. I know other people are having it way worse and I should be grateful, and I am but this is where I start to become a mess. You see my mind nowadays is a cesspool of negativity. All I can think about is the unfairness. Unfairness about everything. Everyone around me friends/family support me, but I cannot help but notice their normal lives. Everyone around me say that I have a great future ahead, good education good job and what not, but what good that is if I am not even in a healthy shape to enjoy it. Everyday I wake up I feel hollow inside, everytime I push myself I feel the weakness pulling me back. Random aches, low energy, constant fear of loosing even a tiny bit of movement - always occupy a significant space of my mind, constantly reminding me about my special needs. The amount of insecurities I have is so much, sometimes I go numb thinking about them. And lately, my biggest insecurity has become relationships. Seeing all the people around my age being in a relationship really makes me wonder who will be stupid enough to accept me. Can I ever be in love with someone and will they ever accept me? With every day passing by I am slowly becoming a shell of a person. My childhood and teenage years seems a series of misjudgements and missed opportunities. And the future seems darker and darker as I progress. I say I am a mess because although I know the answers to most of the questions above, I can never accept/implement them. I miss my meds all the time, I sit around all day staring at screens, I waste the precious time I have, I hardly socialize, I constantly fail the few people around me and most importantly I am never able to accept my condition. Please take care of yourself.  You can live a full life.  Take supplements - research online.   Some that I take daily are coq10, ashwagandha, creatine, zinc.  Go for lots of walks outside.  Keeps your muscles strong and being outside is so good for your mental health.  I do not have the same type as you do but it sounds very similar as far as my symptoms and that it is slow progressing.  I was diagnosed at 22 and I am now 35 and I think my symptoms are around the same as when I was diagnosed.   You can do this.  One thing that helps me greatly is keeping a gratitude journal.  So whenever I am feeling really down I will start writing in it every night before bed.  Even through tears If all I have to write is \u201cRoof over my head, food in the fridge, my son\u201d.  There is always something to be grateful for.  If you can afford it you should definitely look into getting therapy, I know I could definitely benefit from it myself but it is so expensive.  Read a lot of books.  This is not the end of your life even though it is hard, you are not alone.  I accidentally got pregnant when I was 26 and I remember bawling in my doctors office telling her that I would be the worst mom because I have weak muscles and I cannot remember exactly how she said it but she basically said that my child would not care about my muscles, he will care about my love and my heart.  And he is 9 years old now and my whole entire world and he is the happiest sweetest boy so please known that things are possible.  And you can find love.  I have.  I have been engaged but I need to work in accepting love and not feeling like they deserve better.  But I am just telling you that there is someone out there who will love you.  Believe that, you are not unloveable or unworthy.  I am sorry that you are having a hard time but it will get better. Hey 26 here with LGMD. If you ever want to chat my DMs are open. I was diagnosed at 23 and we can date back noticeable onset around 6th grade. I am in a happy relationship with a partner who met me a few days before I was diagnosed and has stuck by my side. He helps me when I fall and try\u2019s to make me feel as normal as possible. With that I do still experience the emptiness inside and negativity. I am personally starting therapy on Thursday this is my second therapist since I have been diagnosed so hoping it is a good one. I am trying that and anti depressant meds as I have been depressed my whole life and the diagnoses has only made it worse. I play video games when I am not working and suck at socializing but my only advice when it comes to relationships is keep trying. Genuine people will not see your disability I do not know how but they will not. We are way harder on ourselves and see ourselves as unloveable but I know this to be untrue. My older sister is married with 2 kids and I am in a 3 year relationship. Love is possible do not give up &lt;3\n\nAlso... I am going to give you probably some unpopular advice but find what works for you.

", "Limb girdle muscular dystrophy promising results Hi everyone just wanted to post an interesting article that i came about now. \n\n\n\n\n\n Thanks for the post. Good read.", "I (20 F) cannot stop crying knowing I will ultimately become like my father. My father has Facioscapulohumeral MD. When I was young, he told me that his earliest symptoms started when he was 18 and it slowly became more noticeable when he was 30. He still was able to work in a construction site to provide for the family but eventually his muscles just thinned and weakened he can no longer walk properly and reach things above his head.\n\nNow I am 20, but I have always known ever since I was a child I was incapable of whistling, puffing my cheeks, sucking on things, and completely forming the \u201cO\u201d shape with my mouth. At high school I thought it was just me having buck teeth and that I needed to get braces in order to do all those but now that I am in college, looking back at how other bucked teeth people I know who were still able to do basic things well, I am suspecting it is MD.\n\nNow, I just told my father about what I think and the only thing he could say was \u201cOh my god, I hope not.\u201d\n\nI am legitimately angry at my parents for procreating when there is 50% chance their offsprings will suffer the same thing. I am the third and youngest daughter among all three female siblings and so far I am the only one who is speaking out about possibly having MD like my dad. I feel so bad, like I am just blaming my parents why they needed to make a baby one more time and I am just living the rest of my life slowly watching being unable to do things people take for grabbed. I am an art major and just imagining how I will never be able to draw again just pains my heart and I have been crying since last night I first started evaluating this situation. \n\nI just needed to vent, I guess. Of all things my dad could have given me, it is something incurable that would strip me off of my passion to draw. Did he know there was a 50% chance of passing on his md to his offspring when you were conceived? Plus there is a stigma around abortion for lots of people.\n\nI am in my 30s now and I am having similar feelings. I am still trying to get a diagnosis but I am very sure what I have is hereditary. But the more I think about it... they did not know back then what we know today about passing on genes. Live your life, you cannot change the past but you can stop passing on your bad blood. He definitely knew, so did my mom, and yet they still had me, their 3rd child. This is why I find it selfish. If I had a choice, I would have not wanted to be born. Well, here I am.\n\nI am trying to get a genetic testing soon. Are your symptoms very noticeable now or your\u2019re just speculating? I understand your horror, but you are not even diagnosed yet.  I have a different kind of MD, but cannot you still draw with FSHD?  My opinion is to let yourself feel bad about it, then move on.  Maybe seek some counseling, which is what I did.  It is not a death sentence.  A lot of people with MD have great lives and are able to do a lot of things. Breathe deep and slow down.  Even if you have the same deletion as your father, the gene is expressed differently for every individual. I have a 50 year old spouse who just has an awkward built and tight shoulders.  Mild discomfort at best.  We did not know it ran in the family.  I have one son who tested positive and is moderately affected with daily pain and mobility issues and another child is was a D1 recruited athlete who just recently received a clinical diagnosis. She is so mildly effected that most neurologists probably would not have picked it up had she not had a family history.  She has no pain or discomfort or wasting.  Would not even quality for clinical trials. \n\nGo see an MD specialist to get diagnosed. If you have it, you will probably go through a period of mourning.  But life will go on. It is not the end of the world. Women often have less severe symptoms. Hey so I know literally exactly how you feel, my dad has this type of MD and showed proper symptoms by the time he was 20 so obviously he knew something was wrong by the time he had me at 33. I am the middle child of 3 and I am the only one who has it and I was the only sporty child and  started showing symptoms at like 12 I am now 23. I have been through this phase of basically hating my dad for like a good couple of years for the exact same reasons as you have said, like why would you have kids if you know somethings wrong ? But I guess what helped me kind of come to terms with it (kind of anyway) is that my dads just a guy trying to live his life and like any person with a disability wants to be treated like a normal person which involves getting married and having kids. I agree from a logical stand point it is kind of fucked up but you cannot expect people to be so brutally logical about this kind of incredibly human stuff. \n\nThis kind of thing is super hard to talk to people about because people literally just do not understand, like the one thing I get told all the time by people is \u201cwhy do not you just go to the gym\u201d  but if you want to chat to someone who knows what is up you can give me a message, I promise you will not be loosing the ability to do art probably ever. \n\nAnd one last thing, it is ok to be upset about this so do not feel bad about thinking these things. My dad passed away 25 years ago so I wish I knew his disease progression. My uncle and Dad was diagnosed with CMT, it is a hereditary disease. My uncle started his symptoms in his 30s. Now he cannot feel below his knees and needs a walker to get around. Looking back at home videos of my dad (38 in the video) he has the same wobbly jelly legs as I do now.\n\nOnto me... I am 33 now, symptoms started 4 years ago. I first went to the doctor because I had begun getting difficulty climbing stairs. EMG from 2016 shows moderate weakness by my knees. At my toes it is severe weaknesses. I could barely feel a sharp pin when they pricked my foot. I had extensive genetic testing done at one place, which came back negative. So I had a biopsy on my muscles and nerves, which was not clear which disease I have so they basically gave up on me. Early 2019, I started getting bad cramps so I needed to get another opinion. I am lucky I live close to two major cities. They a full genetic neuropathy panel. If that is negative they will do another genetic sequencing on me.\n\nI feel like they diagnosed my dad and uncle with CMT with all the knowledge on the topic at the time, but nowadays they need a genetic test for a definite answer. Take a breath. \n\n\nEvery life is a death sentence, it is the great equalizer, but YOU have the power on how you live it out. You are in control of your reactions to things outside your control. Be KIND to yourself, and others too. Life is meant to be lived, no matter your circumstances or genetic defect. If you are diagnosed then you can begin to strategize on how to live your best life. Sorry to post again, but I kept thinking about you.  \n\nI would encourage you to have a little hope.  There are drugs in the pipeline now that are getting tested.  Look up Losmapimod trials.  This drug may potentially turn off the toxic gene that causes FSHD.  There should be a cure or treatment or something in the next 5 years or so...so please be careful about going to those dark places where you think your parents should have aborted you.  I know this is hard, assuming you do have it, but advancements in science could make this a non-issue for people like you who may be in the early stages. \n\nAnd to be blunt, FSHD is not the worst of the muscular dystrophies.  FSHD does not weaken the heart muscle and/or should not take your life at a young age.  Sorry to dish out a little tough love, but I would count your blessings as this could be far worse. I do not think you need to blame your parents. You are a blessing to life. Just wait to see what the future holds and let the emotions out. You are not diagnosed yet. My parents did not know I would be born with MD but here I am at 23 with autoimmune and genetic diseases. I do not blame them for having me. Life is a gift that we are blessed with. You just have to learn how to handle the hurdles. Right now, you can channel your emotion into art. There is a video of a girl with MD that cannot walk but is a fantastic artist. You should Google it. She lays on her side as she paints. You sound just like me... Except I am 31 now. Experiencing what I feel like is the worst pain of my life. I also could not do any of those things as a child. My mother always told me that I may be a carrier, as women could not have this disease. But that was in 1980's rural Mississippi. As we all know now, that is a lie. I have just gotten my genetic blood work done and am awaiting test results. I already know what is wrong with me, but every time I go to the doctor, they seem to think because I am not in a wheelchair, there is nothing wrong with me. \n\nPlease, take care of your body. Do not drink, do not smoke, do not do drugs. You should definitely go ahead and see a neurologist soon, because preventative care is the only care that we have. If you can even call it that. I am already in my career and cannot change it. I wish if I had known earlier, I would have gone to college and chosen a different path. Computer design maybe good for you, since you are into art? \n\nRight now, the most I can hope for is something from home as a career and I have no idea where to start. Take advantage of the fact that you are young and symptoms have not begun to exhibit yet. \n\nIf you ever need to talk, you can message me. I totally understand your frustrations and anger. Do not be mad at your parents. Maybe they were given shitty medical advice when your mom was pregnant. Use them for the insurance, if you are on theirs. Hello, how are you? Sorry I just saw this because it is a second account I do not use often. I am sorry to hear you are having the worst pain in your life. How did the genetic testing work? My doctor did not tell me to do one or anything after voicing my concerns because she said i may not have it and the symptoms i have had ever since childhood are not too bad or whatever which really pissed me off. Can you give me advice on how to get genetic testing and what the process is? I am under my parents\u2019 insurance so I got that part covered. You should get a referral to a neurologist and they have to order the test for you. Mine was not covered by insurance, so I had to pay about $450 to Athena Diagnostics.

Recently I have noticed that my body is very weak\u2014 most notably throughout all of my upper body, as well as my butt and thighs. I do not remember when I started noticing these things, it could have months or years ago. My GP insists that I need to see a psychiatrist rather than a neurologist, which is what I requested, but she seems convinced that my symptoms are from \u201cdeconditioning\u201d, and that my mental health is to blame. I agree that I am not in as good a shape as I could be because of my sedentary lifestyle, but I cannot remember if I lay down for 16 hours a day because I feel so weak, or if I feel so weak because I lay down for 16 hours a day. I have a very ungainly appearance, and I have noticed various physical symptoms that I believe are consistent with FSHD. \n\nHave any of you guys been met with resistance from your doctors when you first brought up symptoms related to muscle weakness? How can I convince her to let me see a neurologist? Even the doctor at the merge denied that I have problems with muscle function. No. \nBut I have been depressed and fixing my depression goes hand in hand with my sedentary lifestyle. It is a vicious cycle. \n\nSpeak to a therapist. But also walk, roll, run, cycle for 45 minutes a day. No phone time. Just walking and taking in things around you. \n\nDo that for 2 weeks and you will notice your energy levels increase. Go up and down stairs for 10 minutes straight. \n\nI sometimes find I am lying to myself that the reason I am unable to do stuff is because of my muscular dystrophy. The reality is that I am unfit and have not exercised for weeks/months. I am on reddit again - I downloaded it because I started checking online sources for various diseases and I had a really hard time finding any MD forums where the psychological nature of the condition is discussed, is it common for people with MD to develop mental health disorders? You would think so right? I could not find any resources that describe the correlation between MD and things like depression and anxiety. I really want to become stronger, but I am so fatigued that I cannot bring myself to stay upright and my AHDH gets in the way of creating and executing exercise routines. The only time I exercise is when it is impulsive, and I will walk around for 6 hours or whatever but I will not exercise again for a very long time. Ask your doctor for a CK test. This is a simple blood test and should not cost much. If your CK levels are high this could mean you have fshd, but why is your doctor so against doing the genetic testings? I am in the US and it took awhile to get to a diagnosis but insurance covered most of these costs\n\nAlso what do you mean by weakness. I am diagnosed fshd and have scapular winging and can not lift my arms over my head. \nAre you experiencing this type of weakness? I have a full range of mobility, no issues with moving my arms around, but my shoulder blades do wing out. I have described this to my doctor but due to covid I have not been able to get her to give me a physical exam and I think she may be skeptical since the doctor at the merge did not detect anything wrong with me (though it seemed to me like he only checked muscle function in my arms and not my back or chest.) I am quick to become fatigued when doing nearly activity and I notice my muscle weakness most when sitting up, using stairs, or lifting things. There is a definite correlation between chronic disease and depression it just makes sense. But if you have ADHD then you need to be addressing all of these things. \n\nThe best I have ever been mentally is when I was also working out almost every day. Without the proper tests you are really just guessing. The doctor will not permit you to take these tests? Maybe contact a neurologist yourself idk. I had a lot of doctors dismiss my symptoms in my childhood bc most of them do not know about fshd at all. In fact, when I get a new doctor, I always have to literally explain fshd and how it works to them, bc it is an orphan disease. Find a different doctor if your current one will not listen to you. No doctor could diagnose me so I researched and concluded I had fshd, then I went to a neurologist at wake Forest and let her come up with a diagnosis without telling her I thought it was fshd. She said fshd then I told her I had came to the same conclusion. That was 4 years ago. I cannot run or squat and stairs and chairs are a little hard but i can do them by myself. Getting off the ground is impossible unless I have furniture to help me. I am 20 now and I have not lost strength in 3 years. Everyday I try to tell myself it has no control over me. And let me tell you, the best thing you can do is be as active as possible. Even just standing/walking and being up is enough to help you greatly. If you do have fshd, and do not get up and walk much etc then you will lose strength so much quicker. Since 16 I have worked 40-80 hour work weeks bc I work in fast food most of the time right now and it is a really easy job. I take kratom which is a tree leaf that relieves pain anxiety and depression. Some kinds of kratom give you energy.

I have FSHD and have been planning for the worsening of my condition since I was very young. I would advise others to do the same but I understand not everyone has the same fear as I do of not being able to financially care for myself. Yeah, I wish I did that. I have been diagnosed with LGMD since I was 8, but it never effected me until I was 19. When i decided to go to culinary school after graduating high school, I was just following my passion. I was not thinking about the logistics of how this industry was not equipped to cater to the future me, even if it did presently. I do not regret it, because it is what I love. A lot of times I wish I just went to school for something else though. I hear you. I grew up very poor so I became obsessed with finding a career that I could do even at my weakest, since I knew I would not have anyone to depend on. My dad has since passed and my mom is not able to care for herself as she is quite old. I am just grateful to have planned so well. In college I had a friend who was majoring to become a film Director, despite also having a progressive disability, and I remember trying to talk him out of it and then stopping because who am I to tell someone what to do? I often wonder how honest I should be with people who have progressive disabilities and whether it is right for me to persuade them to abandon their dreams for more realistic careers. I am curious, would you have wanted someone to be brutally honest with you or just mind their own business? I am 31 and have LGMD 2A as well. I work in advertising sales and have been remote since Covid lockdown with hopes to be fully remote moving forward. I was lucky enough to start at the company 10 years ago before my health got worse. I have not looked elsewhere since I worry if other companies will be as understanding but you would be surprised. Just follow your passion! Stay positive and surround yourself with people who care for you. It will all work out. Idk. I would not have listened if someone was brutally honest with me, so it is hard to say. I wish I was just self aware enough to have made the decision myself. IT stuff, I sit in an office chair for 8-12 hours a day. My body is aching more and more but at least I can afford to live. I gave that shit up!

I just have the symptoms I described plus a couple VOUS on a gene report. \n\nMy question is, how would you describe your muscle weakness? Hi!  I have a slowly-progressing case of LGMD.  I cannot run or jump, but I can still walk ok after 20 years of symptoms (with a limp).  It does not really feel like anything until I try to do something and it is hard.  In the early stages, I never really noticed any kind of shaking, but I had significant clinical weakness by the time I was genetically diagnosed.  I probably would not have even gone to the doctor with your symptoms.  The science is developing all the time, so maybe in the future it will be easier to pin whatever you have down. Feels like my legs are jelly. Cannot really feel my feet very well. Also the constant foot flapping causes my legs and feet to always hurt after working. Thank you, Julieta. Thanks for sharing.

My doctor told me not to worry because I am healthy and if I were to have muscular dystrophy, I would already be showing signs of it. But I read that muscular dystrophy could manifest itself anytime from 20s-70s.\n\nIs anybody scared of manifesting it later in life? Is there anything I can do? What type of MD runs in your family, and where does it run in your family?   This can all help get an idea.  Some forms are barely noticeable in some people, like Becker's not being diagnosed into their 60s.  If it is Duchenne, you will almost certainly know before you were able to ask this question. It is my mom's side. Currently, none of my siblings have it. It is affected my mom's siblings.\nHm in that case, I think it is Becker's and not Duchenne, as I have not been diagnosed with anything yet. Thank you - I will have to look into Becker's. Becker's can vary widely in how it presents.  It is relatively uncommon in the world of MD, Duchenne being the most common.  However, they are both X-linked recessive ((  If it is on your mom's side, we would still need to know more.  It is typically carried by females, and if they are a carrier, they have a 50/50 chance of passing it on to offspring.  So it becomes important to start tracing.  I am not sure what country you are in, but if it is available (either free or at a cost you can afford) you should consider genetic testing for at least yourself, but potentially your mother and her siblings, her mother and any of her siblings.  With Duchenne, a very simple blood test called a CK (creatine-kinase) test can almost be used as a diagnosis.  In Becker's I do not believe it would be that clear.\n\nIn our case (2 boys with Duchenne), we first found out when my wife's sister's second child was diagnosed with DMD.  When I heard this, and did the research, I realized that if she was a carrier, there was a chance my wife was also a carrier.  With Duchenne's, roughly 1/3 cases are spontaneous birth defects.  The other 2/3 cases originate from a carrier mother.  Turns out my wife is a carrier, and as it turns out, so is her mother (not surprising when her 2 daughters are carriers).  There was one son there as well, but lucky for him he was not affected, though he had a 50/50 chance of getting the defective gene.  My mother-in-law's mother passed away years before the diagnosis so she could not be tested.  My mother-in-law has one sister, who has refused testing which is unfortunate because she has two daughters, both in their child bearing years, one with a very young child or two (we are not close with them).  So the while the disease will halt with our children on this side, it could be continuing on that side of the family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus my recommendation for genetic testing.  If available a genetic counselor can help determine who should be tested. It does depend on the type of MD.  I have myotonic muscular dystrophy and did not realize it until my brother was diagnosed with it in his adult life, and I had similar symptoms, although he was much worse.  I did not notice my symptoms until I was in my 30s, although I had earlier ones that I did not attribute to the MD.  In hindsight, we realize it was my father that had the mutated gene.  Myotonic Dystrophy gets worse with each generation, and if one of the parents has it, there is a 50/50 chance of the children having it.  There are no carriers per se, just milder symptoms. Similar to FSHD.  My teen son was diagnosed young and has very noticeable symptoms.  Hubby was diagnosed thereafter at 48 which explains his odd build and chronic discomfort.  Progression, severity, and age of onset all differ. Live a happy life with what you got?

I have gained respect for what the gaming industry has to offer each who finds it of interest. \n\nIn that span of decades, have also gotten to know a number of outstanding individuals through online collaboration. Strange now looking back at the relationships formed.  Relationships that could not exist in 'real-life'.  Truly unique as our only points of contact were the gaming environment and the talk channels where we collaborated effort.  Where I played, all who showed up were welcomed and treated as equals.\n\nSome were with people with disabilities.  Though that was never a factor.  Some were disabled veterans who had the game in their hearts but not so much at their fingertips.  Well, in all honesty, all there had the game in their hearts.  It making its way from there to our fingertips, well :) therein lay the rub :) for each and every one of us. \n\nThough no longer a member of these associations, am still very much a gamer.  The attraction of fictional video worlds still holds interest. Not so much due to the 'goals' of the game played but for the transportational powers of immersion provided.

So what does that mean for you?\n\nMe: It means I will just get weaker over time, it affects my arms and my legs. I have been told my legs will go first but I cannot do too much with my arms like carrying or above my head. I could end up in a wheelchair but we will see.\n\nThem: :(\n\nMe: :)\n\nI suppose I have an easier time of it because my MD is mild and I still look fairly able. I know it is not very common so people do not know much about it. They do not tend to want to know details, they just want a basic understanding. If anyone actually wanted more detail I would be happy to go into it with them but I am not going to name genes or complain about specific actions I can no longer do right off the bat. People generally are not looking for that level of information! I am a sister. My parents told me to just say, my brother has duchenes muscular dystrophy, which is a deterioration of muscles in the body. If they asked more questions my answers would depend on if I was in a good mood or not. I have said that line 1000 times over the years. \"Alright, this is a horrible analogy, but its the best one I have, so please stick with me through the end and I promise it will start to make sense.  Muscular Dystrophy is like Cancer in that just like there is no one disease called 'cancer' there is no one disease called 'muscular dystrophy'  it is a term that references a class of diseases with a common symptom.  In the case of cancer it is unchecked cell division.  In the case of MD it is progressive weakness of the muscles.  There are a number of variant forms with various intensities and timelines, just like with cancer.  If you google it, the number one thing you will see is Duchenne or Lou Gerhigs...those are kind of like the Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma of the MD world.\n\nMy wife has a variant called 'Limb-Girdle' which means that it predominately effects the muscles of the limbs and trunk.  That is why she is in a wheelchair.  When we met 15 years ago she could walk for short distances and now she cannot even stand on her own.  There is no cure, there is no treatment, and honestly not a whole lot of data on what her progression looks like from here.  For you or I when we exercise our muscle cells tear and then new cells plug that gap, that is how you get stronger.  For her, if she exercises and her muscles tear the cells die and she gets weaker.  As an added bonus, if she does not exercise enough the muscles atrophy and she gets weaker. Its a lovely balancing act we have never really achieved properly.\n\nShe is sharp as a tack and has a PhD.  Next time maybe you should try talking to her rather than acting like I am the only one who can speak to you.  Also, as a side effect of her MD type she cannot cough effectively as such COVID would kill her.  So please for the love of all that is decent an holy put on the f!cking mask.\"\n\nAaaaaand Time.

But I realized something is wrong with me even sooner. First time i did realized was in the first grade when i had to climb up till the first floor where my classroom was, also when I was playing outside with the other kids I was slower at running. I was able to participate to gym class till I was in the fifth grade then I just could not keep up. Long story short, it sucks to have this desease. Now I am 21,and I go out of the house very rare, only if I have to. I am a student ad Psychology right not, but I am not performing very good. I am that type of guy that barely says hi to his classmates, and of course if someone does not start the conversation there is no chance I will. If a teacher puts me to talk to the rest of my classmates I my face will get red and I would not know what to say becouse my social skills are very poor. I hate that I have to think every time I go out that I could have to climb some stairs, and people will stare at me. And people are staring at me when I simply walk, when I walk by a group they are suddently silent ant that makes me very anxios. And lastly, i hate it when they ask me, why I walk the way I walk. What happend to your leg? Why are you walking like that? Is there a cure? Can I help you climb the stairs? Anyway if you have a question or two feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer. (sorry for the bad english) I was always slow too but the weird thing is once I ran a half marathon and if you you would look at my upper body you would think I am super athletic  but my legs are very weak I sometimes dont understand why I am diagnosed with muscular dystrophy when I look the way I do and can do somethings people with muscular dystrophy cant the major problem that I have is my legs are very weak and I only see a problem in my legs My fiance has it. His older brother also had it so my fiance has known his whole life. He is 30 now and still walks. He struggles with stairs and long distances. We recently went on holiday and hired a scooter so he would not have to worry about the long walks. He goes for his yearly check up and 6-month heart check up and has never had any issues. \n\nThis is not the case for everyone though, Becker's is very different for every person.

Hoping to compare experiences? About two years ago my fatigue and weakness got to a point that I started to lose the ability to exercise at all, and some basic activities at home and work (holding my arms above my head) got very challenging. The one specific thing I felt and still feel on a daily basis was a weak, heavy sensation between my shoulder blades.\n\nNow, I work a much less intense job and it feels like even sitting up and supporting my head is enough to wipe me out most days. My neck and back feel incredibly weak and overworked on a daily basis. I get pretty bad back pain which I think is from weakening hip muscles and their inability to support my pelvis/core.  \n\nSome really simple stuff, even the isometric tests I have had doctors do for whether they can \u201cbreak\u201d my strength leaves me sore. \n\nDriving for longer than 30-45 minutes is a chore now. Something about steering just really wipes me out and taxes my shoulders.  Carrying anything above my chest level is a recipe for needing a serious break. \n\nWhen I am active (sometimes still rowing, sometimes walking the dogs or swimming), I have to watch my intensity really carefully or I need 5+ days to recover.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same stuff? The heavy, dead feeling between my shoulders is honestly the worst part of all this...\n\nI have been through pretty much every test imaginable over the last two years. Two sleep studies, and an MSLT which led the first neurologist to think I had some pre-narcolepsy. The stimulants he prescribed did not help, so I kept looking for other opinions. Blood work and endocrinology specialists had nothing. Finally got into a neuromuscular specialist who found muscle weakness, pronounced scapular winging and confirmed myopathy on EMG in my spinatus muscles. I had pretty much every genetic test (aside from FSH) done after that point - only a pseudodeficiency for GAA. That led to muscle biopsy #1 in February, which showed some potential PFK deficiency but that was not supported by earlier genetic testing. Earlier this month I had another full blood/metabolic workup done, along with forearm and cycle ergometer exercise testing - all that looked normal, and muscle biopsy #2 after the biking also is seemingly OK aside from some surplus of glycogen. So both that neurologist and my primary neuromuscular specialist agree that FSH is the likely cause and they will be testing for it soon. If it is not FSH I have no idea where to turn next because I feel like a shell of who I was 2.5-3 years ago and something is definitely wrong. I have FSH and have experienced most of what you described. Mine is early onset, though, as my symptoms started when I was three. I am 32 now, and was wheelchair dependent from age ten until two years ago when I came down with pneumonia (but that is another story lol). \n\nBefore my chair, I would get tired easily from walking, could not really run and have trouble with stairs. My shoulder blades also \u201cwing out\u201d and I cannot raise my arms very high. \n\nDo not be afraid to rest. It is just as important as keeping active to slow the deterioration.

I do not have a full blink, so my eyes are constantly drying out. My doc prescribed an eye moistening gel that helps a lot tho. \n\nAs for things that help, do not be afraid to try assistive devices. I wore leg braces for a few years to correct my foot drop (I was a \u201ctoe walker\u201d). I hated them at first, they made me feel like a robot, but I got used to them after a while. But what really helped me was getting my first wheelchair. You would think that giving up walking would have limited my freedom, but it was the opposite. Because I did not have to waste energy worrying about how far I could go before getting tired, I just *went*. But of course your situation will prolly be different. You might never even need a wheelchair. \n\nAhhh my diet. It needs work XD. I am a big fan of McDonald\u2019s, and I am Italian lol. Do you have any issues swallowing? That is one of our weaknesses with FSH. I found it helps to chase every couple of bites with copious amounts of whatever beverage you are having. Please note that rapid intoxication may occur if said drink contains alcohol XD. Coca-Cola is my preferred drink; the bubbles help get the food to where it needs to go. \n\nOh!

Might be of interest. \n\n If you are applying for SSDI and have multiple conditions it can be a bit tricky, but if you are applying solely on your muscular dystrophy its more straight forward.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the SSDI blue book definitions for diseases. Particularly, muscular dystrophy is reviewed on the following guidelines:\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**11.13** **Muscular dystrophy**, characterized by A or B:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A. Disorganization of motor function in two extremities (see ( resulting in an extreme limitation (see ( in the ability to stand up from a seated position, balance while standing or walking, or use the upper extremities.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;OR  \n&gt;  \n&gt;B. Marked limitation (see ( in physical functioning (see ( and in one of the following:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Understanding, remembering, or applying information (see ( or  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Interacting with others (see ( or  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Concentrating, persisting, or maintaining pace (see ( or  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Adapting or managing oneself (see (\n\nYou need to have these limitations documented in your medical records by your neurologist, physical therapist, or other specialist. If you do not have sufficient medical records, contact your doctors and request them. If you do not have proof of your limitations, the SSDI reviewer will deny you. Secondly, gather any records from any other clinic or provider you have had treatment with as the Social Security Administration will require them. Not having these documents gathered can significantly delay the process as you wait on providers.\n\nIf you do not have this evidence, get a new appointment with your doctors and make sure they document your condition and limitation in writing. These are typically after summary reports the doctors write to document your visit. \n\nAlso, you need to verify you qualify for SSDI. In the last ten years, you need to have 20 quarters (three month periods) where you had taxable income. If you do not meet this requirement you do not qualify for SSDI, but likely SSI. You can sign up and view your estimated earnings on my social security website.\n\nOnce you have this information, consider the financial aspects of the transition. Since you cannot be working during the review of your SSDI application, utilize any short term disability your employment may offer. First get on family medical leave act, then short term disability and lastly if you have long term disability once short term expires. Review the policies of any STD/LTD you may have access to as private policies can exclude certain conditions. Depending on your income situation, you may be eligible for medicaid depending on your state if you lose access to your employer health insurance or cant afford the COBRA premiums. Apply for SSDI the day you stop working. If you have straight forward records with a clear cut blue book requirement met, it should only take about 3 months. You will not receive payment for 6 months from the date you stopped working if approved. If your case get denied you can appeal but you may be looking at a much longer process (year to 18 months) for determination.

However having a healthy diet can increase longevity of being ambulatory amongst some children/rarely adults as being small can cause less muscle exertion to move. A special diet would not allow you to produce dystrophin if you have muscular dystrophy.  Think of it like having all the ingredients but no recipe.  The body, even on a not so great diet, has what it needs to produce dystrophin, just its instructions for doing so mangled so instead of getting a nice cake, you get a puddle of goo. So everything is there,  just not produced correctly or at all? in my case its a weakened expression of the dystrophin, 80% less than the normal amount. Less weight to move = less effort and strain on muscles. But a good diet is probably going to help in other aspects. Thank you, very helpful links:) Depends on the exact type of MD and potentially the exact mutation.  However, I cannot see any dietary changes affecting that 80%.   However eating properly will still have lots of other benefits. Well a bad diet just makes you have more health problems on top of it all. For the past many years I have strived to keep from eating a lot of processed foods.  It is an impossibility, but so far fast food has been eliminated so have canned foods.  Sticking to fresh fruit and veggies, beans and rice, fish and lean meats has gotten my weight down without having to actually diet.  Along the way, became a halfway decent cook. Unfortunately the body of a person with dystrophin deficiency cannot be impacted by adding certain nutrients. The bodies blueprints  for creating dystrophin are damaged not the parts used to build it. There are instances where the body will be forced to convert some nutrients into others to compensate for what it needs.

No one in their family has had it before. \n\nDo not yet know if wife is a carrier or not. \n\nWhat are the chances it is passed through to our future children? Can it be passed if only one parent is a carrier or does it need both parents to be carriers ? It depends on the type and the method of inheritance. If it is a dominant form of LGMD and your wife is a carrier she has a 50% chance of passing on the mutated gene to any of her children -- of which the child could be a carrier or a manifest. If the gene runs recessive then you both would have to have the gene to pass it on -- which would be a 50% chance of inheritance, as well -- 25% carrier chance and 25% manifest chance. It would be best for you both to see a genetic counselor and be tested before procreating. Thank you for the info. Could it still be dominant if neither of my wife\u2019s parents or their parents have any symptoms of LGMD?  Yes. No one in my family has LGMD symptoms but I have autosomal dominant LGMD2A.

I am an escort (ie provide sexual services from home or visit people's homes) and I have had a request from a man to visit him who has muscular dystrophy. He has only told me he can walk ok with some physical aids but cannot travel to me (which is totally fine).\n\nI know v little about this condition, though i have now spent some time reading up, but I wanted to ask people who know for real - what might I be able to do to make this man's experience the best possible?\n\nAlso (which I cannot seem to find online), I struggle with my hearing slightly and am worried about a communication barrier. Is this something I should broach beforehand and is there anything I could have on hand which might assist?\n\nI really hope this post is appropriate and in the right place. I have a feeling I will be told to ask him all these things myself, but just in case there are a couple of hidden gems of advice I will take the plunge, and ask the members of this sub :) thank you in advance I have MD diagnosed at birth. 55-year-old F. Depending upon his mobility, do not expect anything strenuous. I do not mean that jokingly. However, everything else is fine works fine. Thank you for thinking of somebody with a disability I know whoever it is will appreciate it greatly. Thank you for responding. This reassures me, I just hope that the man enjoys our appointment. I did not want to pepper him with questions too much beforehand and thought I may get some useful answers here. Your feedback is very much appreciated, thank you again :) As a man with MD, I can only offer generic advice. \n\nA. Some handicapped people are VERY quiet for one reason or another. This is not the norm but it is certainly a possibility. I would recommend being very open with your pre-meeting conversation.\n\n\nB. Like the previous comment said: do not expect anything strenuous. However, some forms of MD can cause joint problems. Do expect to take some time to understand how your bodies will work together and do not get discouraged if the first or second attempts do not work. \n\nC. This one is a bit more general, and personal. I have no clue who you or your client are, but I have learned over time that people whose minds are left to wander can oftentimes....expand ones kinkiness. This might sound like a lot of pressure, but remember that this person may have plenty of fantasies or kinks that they are immediately unwilling to divulge but would regret not talking about later. If your first time goes well, a handicapped person may very well be your best client due to this person finally having a way to sexually express themselves. Thank you for taking the time to give me this information, again very useful.\n\nI am hoping that this man will feel comfortable enough to share desires with me. But with many appts it is not until afterwards that I get a message telling me secret desires/links, 95% of which I am happy to indulge or attempt to meet in the middle.\n\nI am glad this guy chose me as Im not the type to go into an appt and be looking at the clock, I really enjoy what I do and have been told I am good with nervous customers /first timers. I know I will be slightly nervous due to the unknown aspect but then I am always nervous meeting new ppl\n\nThank you again for your frank feedback - much appreciated I do not have MD, but my fiance does. Every man does have their own kinks but when we first had sex he was extremely nervous and it did take some time to calm him down. He has very limited mobility and cannot walk so his joints and knees are sensitive. Eventually you do learn how to work with the person but my advice would be to take it slow at first. Not too slow to make him feel like he is different, we want him to have a good time. But being considerate and making him feel good during it all. Be careful but do not make him feel different. I would ask exactly what he wants to do beforehand but if he just gets nervous and does not know. I would try to show a bit of dominance by getting on top of him and making out. Trying to get him into the moment and let him go from there. Hopefully once he is in the moment he will be able to be more confident to take control and be satisfied. If something does happen, like you accidentally hurt him a bit, not that I think you will bruise him or something but just simply if his joints start to act up. Do not be afraid and do not show it. But of course if it is something serious than yeah by worried. This is new for him so he may be doing positions he is never done before. I hope this helps and kind of makes sense. If you have any questions you can always just DM me There is a lot of different kinds of muscular dystrophy with a lot of different effects; has he mentioned to you which type he has? Idk if u saw my update post, but the appt went really well last night, I meant to dm u but I am totally disorganised and did not remember. But this advice was just fantastic. He was VERY nervous, so I took the lead somewhat... Turned out he liked being submissive (which was handy) but with him telling me verbally what he would like to happen next. It worked wonderfully and I hope he will be a repeat customer. Your advice was spot on \ud83d\ude0a If its OK I might message u in the future for further advice about more technical bits?\nThank you so much wherever you are, from me in the UK :) I totally forgot to ask to be honest, but he did mention he was not diagnosed until his teens.

That will do a lot to inform you what accommodations you might be able to make. I have FSHD - the most case asymmetrical type, so there is a wide variance to the progression between people that have it, even amongst family members.

But I wanted to hear your guys experiences or if you know about it. I have Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), i also have a less extreme case of it, I had a surgery a couple years ago which helped a lot, I am a 15 year old male btw. My question is exercising good for Muscular dystrophy or does it speed up the muscle decay? I want to go to a gym but I am still unsure of this question. I have heard MD patients can suffer shorter life expectancy\u2019s, to my understanding EDMD is usually a lot less extreme type of muscular dystrophy, are there still limits on life expectancy it can impose? Hey man. I also have Emery Dreifuss as does my brother. I am 37 and have known since I was 17. \n\nThe biggest risk factor is heart failure so keeping the heart healthy is a priority. This means regular cardio exercise. Nothing crazy. Watch out for the heart wall getting too thick. \n\nThat said, I worked out HARD for 3 years with a personal trainer who was very understanding of my condition. I had weak legs which is a massive predictor of mortality, but I was unable to squat due to the contraction in my Achilles. We found that using the leg press machine was really beneficial and I eventually set myself a goal of leg pressing 1000lbs which I hit after about 18 months of training. \n\nIt was great, I felt amazing I was eating better. Working better. Felt sexier haha! I know it sounds stupid but I honestly think it was some of the best shape I have ever been in. \n\nI started my own business around the same time so ended up having to stop the training. I was too busy and too poor to continue! But since then I have tried to get better again and honestly can say that 100% it is worth it. \n\nIf you want to chat more about this I am more than happy to speak to you and your parents on Skype or something. I have done the same for many other people with EDMD. \n\nTake care! Thank you for the response, my edmd also effects my legs and hamstrings. I definently want to do and already do some cardio. What do you mean by weak legs being a massive predictor of mortality? And thanks for the Skype offer but I am good, are family is going through a rough time and so is my dad. So, generally, people with weaker legs die younger, which kind of makes sense. If you have weak legs, you do not get up as much you do not walk as much you do not get good blood flow etc. it has a knock on effect. \n\nSo if I were you I would try and move as much a you can. I really like Pilates, yoga and weights. I suck at cardio but am trying to get better. Eat a lot, move a lot and try and keep flexible. \n\nPlease bear in mind I did not start any of this until I was about 32. I was your average IT gamer guy.

I mean sometimes it seems like the only thing they are looking at I went to the conference in October this was for MDUK I was hoping for some news on rescuer he and treatments for myotonic but every talk and workshop was f***ing duchene again and again and again but there so many other forms of md like Beckers or myotonic (which is 3x as common as f***ing duchene) I get it is nasty but how about giving us with the other forms a bit of information is that too much to ask? A lot of it comes down to the fact that DMD has a well known and documented natural history. Certain outcomes (eg. Average age to wheelchair) are consistent. This makes it a lot easier to run a study and look at treatments and how they affect these outcomes. Because of this - DMD is an ideal candidate for research treatment studies. Other conditions, like myotonic dystrophy and Becker's are more common but more variable - it is harder to measure the impact of the treatment when there is so much more variability in the population Duchenne is one of the most aggressive forms of MD. If they can fix Duchenne they can fix other forms. \n\nI get it is not specific to us, I understand that not everyone is the same within a specific diagnoses too. But try to be \u201chappy\u201d that there is a form of our disease that has so much attention. \n\nI am an emery dreifus guy :) There are lots of reasons for this (the other posters have raised several of them).\n\nAnother major reason is the basic genetics of the disorders.\n\n  \nDMD is X-linked recessive rather than autosomal dominant. It is caused by *loss* of dystrophin: as a consequence, it can be (potentially) treated by *restoration* of dystrophin. \n\nIt is a horrible disease, but it is one with a fairly clear-cut fix (though the actual practical implementation of this fix is extremely challenging): \"put dystrophin back\".\n\nAnd right now, as we speak, there are multiple therapies that are achieving this: people are talking about this because we finally have therapies that are actually targeting the core problem rather than managing the symptoms. The same is true of myotubular myopathy and SMA (both also 'put gene X back in' type fixes). There are children alive today that would otherwise have died, children walking when they would otherwise have been wheelchair bound. I was at a talk on therapies of MTM and they showed a chart of 'time spent on ventilation': it stopped half way because they could not measure it anymore. The kids were doing so well breathing unaided (and using their limbs) that they kept pulling the ventilators out in irritation. \n\nThese are success stories (or success stories in the making), and people understandably want to talk about them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMyotonic dystrophies are much more complicated: firstly there are two of them (DM1 and 2), and secondly they are autosomal dominant. They are not caused by the absence of something you can restore, they are caused by the presence of something that you need to somehow remove. \n\nAnd given that it is usually due to large expansions of repetitive sequence, this is quite tricky to target genetically. This sucks, obviously, but that does not make it any less true. \n\nIf it gives you any comfort, while most conferences I have been to have had many DMD-focussed talks, they have also covered many other conditions. These conditions are not being neglected, they are simply harder to address than DMD, and are consequently not as far ahead. I know your frustrations - of course I am glad progress is being made in duchennes. My diagnosis is hardly being researched in the U.S. and much of it is still trying to understand the disease. Probably because its a lot rarer but crops up more frequently in northern european populations.

Hi everyone, I am a 20 year old guy living with BMD and over the past few years I have had deteriorating leg strength. Most of my propulsion up stairs is coming from my lower foot pushing off with my calf muscles which are very strong. Climbing steep hills or biking are also quite challenging because I am lacking ability to propel with my quadriceps very well. Otherwise I have normal core and arm strength and cardiovascular health all remains normal so I am happy for that.\n\nMy question is, is there anyone here similar or anyone know of any research that shows the ability to improve muscle strength at this point? I started seeing a specialist physical therapist in the last couple years and we have been creating workout routines to help increase muscle strength. (recently I set a goal to join my college marching band which has been my motivation to work hard at it). Recently I have kind of lost some motivation because about when I expected to start seeing improvements I feel like I am either the same or worse. (could just be me analyzing every little thing though).\n\nI really want to see improvement but I also want to know how realistic it is to get there. If anyone has had any luck with muscle strength improvements, I would love to hear about it! My doctor basically told me cardio was the answer (like zumba and pilates) and no weightlifting. I have not done those because they are time-consuming and expensive as hell, so I have been walking a lot.   My husband has BMD but was not diagnosed until age 33. If he had known that he had BMD when he was younger, he would not have tried doing all the things that he did (sports, recreational activities)\u2014 he is told me this many times. He has the same difficulties with steps that you have. \n\nOne thing we do know- working out to the point of exhaustion is harmful if you have BMD. So that is probably why weightlifting is not recommended.  \n\nWe have not found any research yet that shows the possibility of building muscle with BMD. However, there is promising research being done that might change treatment options for men with BMD. It is called CRISPR genome editing. \n\nIt sounds like you are doing a great job of staying as fit as you can. Keep it up and stay hopeful! I was diagnosed at 32. I spent a lot of my 20s lifting weights and not getting much stronger and thinking I just was not trying hard enough.\n\nI am hoping for CRISPR, as well, but my particular gene mutation is not fully understood: it is on exon 1, so my neurologist is baffled as to why I do not have severe Duchenne instead of mild Becker.

These I had not considered to be DMD related, but other symptoms such as fatigue made me wonder if maybe somehow they are related to being a carrier...\n\nBelow is a list of what I have been experiencing for years, then more detailed descriptions of them further below.\n\nFatigue\u00a0\n\nHard time catching breath\n\nDeep muscle aches -upper back, legs\n\nShallow muscle aches- upper back, arms, scalp, face\n\nJoint pain\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAt a young age (elementary school) noticed I had a hard time breathing as deeply as my peers especially during gym. Never enough to be concerned or need an inhaler.\n\nCollege years, noticed this inability to catch my breath when singing or while laying down on a somewhat regular basis. Still have a tough time catching my breath at times, but have been able to practice deep conscious breathing to help with it.\n\nAs an adult for probably the last 7 years or so, my body is in a regular state of aching - so much so that sometimes I forget I am in pain because it is just normal. Its hard to describe what and where I feel the pain, because I do not remember what not feeling this was like. I have aching joints, an aching upper back, my arms and legs just have an ever persistent tenderness to them. My scalp and my face have a tenderness to them wherein I often find myself giving myself mini massages throughout the day.\n\nAs the years go by, I thought it was just aging, but I have gotten more and more physically exhausted and fatigued throughout my days and needing to sleep now a minimum of 10hrs a night to feel rested enough to start another day.\u00a0\n\nI work hard and am a dedicate individual in what I am doing. I like to stay physically active (I have a ballet physic - I do not dance so much anymore but do stretch and practice some yoga), I am injury free. I have not noticed muscle loss or weakness really except for when it comes to opening jars. I have good balance and can lift items 50lbs+ pretty easily with good form.\n\nThose close to me (not related) say it is not normal to be as tired as I am, nor as achey as I am for seemingly no reason...\n\nI am sure there are more things I am forgetting to list, but does this sound familiar to any of you for a manifesting carrier of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy?\u00a0\n\nPlease, feel free to ask me any questions or share in discussion with me! I would like to speak with someone who may be experiencing similar things as me.\u00a0 I do not know much about manifesting carriers specifically but the breathing issues can easily be tested with PFTs and that might give you some answers? My wife is a carrier. I recommend seeing a neuromuscular specialist and cardiologist.\n\nShe has some of the same symptoms like needing lots of sleep, achey muscles... \n\nBottom line is you should see a doctor, someone  that can offer sound advice and direction into the future. This is way above Reddit\u2019s pay grade... Thanks for the recommendation. I do plan on getting genetic testing/a genetic counselor and continue on getting further testing for my symptoms. \n\nI know that people experience different physical symptoms... Sometimes when speaking with past doctors, I have been looked at funny and questioned about the concerns I am having. I know sometimes for people it is work to get a doctor to listen to your concerns. \nI am hoping with a consistent doctor listening to my concerns, some of these worries caused by past experiences will subside. Thank you. I will look into PFTs and see if that is something I can request. Absolutely. You need to seek out the neuromuscular center in your area than deals with boys and girls that have MD. They will assist you in getting your genetic testing, and referrals. Doctors that do not not deal with this regularly, probably will not be much help.\n\nWhen our son was first diagnosed.

He said based on the family history and my symptoms, he is putting the preliminary diagnosis as LGMD (unspecified). I got my blood drawn to check my CK levels and for a 'check for all kinds of LGMD' genetic test. Of course, after I got home my aunt informed me that my no-contact birth mother get a call from her doctor yesterday saying that they had a positive match to a mutated gene that can cause a type of Muscular Dystrophy and is also linked to ALS, aka Lou Gehrig's Disease. Which would have been good to know before I went and got tested for LGMD, even if my aunt could not tell me the exact gene that is wonky.   \n\n\nAm I worrying too much? Is it possible that my grandmother, great-grandmother, and my great-grandmother's brother were all misdiagnosed? What if the genetic test comes back negative for LGMD and I have to start all over to figure out what is wrong with my body? Even if they cross off one disease it does not invalidate all of the work up to that point. It will just lead to more questions and will help find out what is wrong.  If your mom has a positive match you may to and then you can have a face to the monster if not it should give some kind of answer,even if its \" well you do not have that\". You are valid in your worry but try and keep it down to a level that does not make you crazy. Have a great day! Thanks so much for that. It helps so much to hear someone say that.

I get it! I am 30 and just now figuring out what is going with my health. I have 2 daughters so they are getting tested as well. So I am at the LGMD National Conference in Chicago right now.\n\nThe take away so far has been you like many others are clinically diagnosed. The next step is genetic diagnosis. However, many people never get a genetic diagnosis. It was roughly 25% get a confirmed genetic diagnosis. Roughly 50% find some sort of Variance of Unknown significance. Then another 20 to 25% come back totally negative on the gene panels. There are forms that are not tied to genetics and can be autoimmune.\n\nSo, if it comes back negative you do not need to start over. Additionally, there are different methods of genetic testing. My first panel was 20 something genes. It came back negative, so they sent out a new gene panel with 105 genes and an exome mapping. \n\nSo there are other steps. Talk to your neurologist about looking into the free tests. Through, the lantern foundation, GRASP-LGMD and University of Florida is doing a study where you can get an exome map done being run by a Dr. Kang.

I can understand why you are hesitant to tell them but I think you should be open with your parents and tell them what is going on. Can you schedule with a doctor to see what is going on with your breathing? I hope everything works out for you.  Just one thing after the other this year its just never ending what if it is bad news I just know it is going to be bad news I do not know how I will react or cope if it is heart failure I do not know how my parents will cope either I am more worried for them I am scared to tell them Im going to try to tell them in the morning if I can I will probably end up not saying anything though Then as a family, you will face it together.\n\nNot telling them would hurt them more in the long run. \n\nThese last two years have put extraordinary pressure on all of us.  With the most important part of that line being, * of us'*.  Together it is much easier to face problems. i (23F) have DMD and i also feel like this sometimes. its like you have so much weight on your chest, like your body stopped breathing on its own so u have to breath manually and deep breathing became hard. (i know it feels stupid and silly). it happens when I am stressed or sometimes without any reason. i just focus on something i like and everything becomes normal after sometime. \n\nYou should talk to them i know it will be hard but suffering alone and getting stressed does not help be positive everything will be just fine.\n\nI am sorry for your loss Heart failure actually is not as bad as it sounds usually. It is a stupid name, I think heart failure means that your  heart simply is not working normally, that can either be by a little margin or a lot, but the does not mean your heart is literally failing on you. This year has sucked so much but dude just go get checked out at the hospital. Also I use stuff like the cough assist for more lung expansion, if your medications do not interact with it you can use nebulizer or inhaler and see if that helps but I would advise going to a doctor before taking it because it can make your heart race. Maybe you can use the bipap at night if your doctor says it is fine. Also there are many medications to handle heart failure effectively, I know it is hard but please do not worry right now. Just like everything else in life you will pull through Speak to your doctor. Get your heart checked out. I have had a pacemaker since I was 25 to help me. \n\nSpeak to your doctor and explain your breathing has become hard. I sometimes have apnea at night and it worries me and puts strain on the heart. \n\nDo you have a cpap/bipap machine? This sounds a lot like anxiety. With what you and your family have been through it would not be a surprise if stress has sent you into this state. PLEASE talk to your family and see a doctor. It might not be as bad as you think, and you could be adding to the anxiety unnecessarily with all this worry. I am 43 and have suffered from anxiety my entire life. THIS is what it feels like when it is at its worst and I am struggling to deal with all of life's hardships. I also want to say, my 22 year old son has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I understand a parent's perspective in this case, and I believe they would want to know. My heart goes out to you and your family. I am pretty sure it was just my anxiety playing up, it is been a stressful hard year and I have really been struggled with my mental health lately with everything that is happened, I am so sorry if I wasted anyone\u2019s time I just got scared and felt like I could not tell my parents with all they are going through it is not been an easy year for them Thank you so much though for responding I am going to go get my heart looked at just to rule things out cause it could just be my anxiety playing up again, and I do get my heart checked every 2 year and I have recently been put on heart medication to stop it from getting worse and I do not use any machines to help me breathe at night or during the day or anything like that yet  Do not ever feel sorry for reaching out for help or support. I think that is what a lot of Redditors are here for, honestly. I know I have turned to Reddit in uncertain or difficult times over the years, and have found a lot of comfort in the community.

Please know that there are better times on the other side of this, and that you are not alone.  I have a heart check every 6 months now so I would make sure you do that regularly. I believe the BiPap is best for muscular dystrophy as it helps remove c02 as well as provide us with oxygen. \n\nI am yet to require a cpap/bipab but i expect it in my future. \n\nDo not take chances with your breathing and your heart, these are the 2 things that are most likely to kill us :)  You can talk with me if you want They are pretty sure it was just due to anxiety (panic attack) and that is why I was struggling to breathe but they are going to check my heart just to make sure, I hope it is ok and I appreciate all the kind words and advise from everyone I cannot say thanks enough \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Remember worth medical problems the outcome are generally better if you catch it early. \n\nSo your choices are very bad news now, or worse news later. \n\nOr, of course, it turns out to be nothing major.

How old are you, I was diagnosed with BMD when I was about 3 I think and they only tested me cause of my older brother really, they thought he had a problem with his hips originally until they did a muscle biopsy on him when he was 10 that is when they realised he had BMD and he never had problems with his heart until he about 16 he was on medication for years, he passed away this year...

But however earlier on in my life, I had a muscle biopsy when I was a kid, then nothing happened until recently. Prior to my diagnosis, I had been put onto anti depressants which caused my CK level to jack up to like 40000 (average is 45 to 250), then my GP referred me to rheumatologists/sport sciences with no success there. Then I was referred to a major hospital rheumatologist department which sent me to a neuromusclar department.... that when i found out that I have BMD. I am surprised it look them that long to diagnose you with it, you are doing great you should be proud of yourself mate... do you use a wheelchair or anything for long distances if you do not mind me asking, I am sorry about your heart btw I just was not aware of it, i thought i was reasonably fit (i used to go to gym) until I done a CK test. I also battled social issues and anxiety so they put me on a anti depressant and a blood test with CK levels involved which jacked up... Also I was rushed to the ED as well at one stage. \n\nNo I do not use any wheelchair or any walking aids at the moment.... but anything could happen in the future. Everyone with BMD are different I suppose, but you are doing well especially for your age that is amazing... I am sorry you were diagnosed with BMD so late in life I cannot imagine what you felt like when you found out... and that is the thing with this disease you do not know what is round the corner or what challenges we will face in the future, but like I said you are doing awesome I hope you are doing ok", "Maickel Melamed after 17 hours will finish the Boston Marathon Let us get him some support!!!\n\n\n\n\n", "I realized something about gene therapy.

He has a feeding tube, has one of those suction things because he can no longer swallow, and a breathing mask.

So this time they sent him home with a chest tube. He is had it for a couple weeks but now his lung has fully collapsed again with the tube in. So the problem is no longer being solved with the tube. They decided to remove it and put and even bigger chest tube in to see if it helps. \nOk so forgive me and I should mention a trigger warning about death- - - \nI am worried he is on his last bit of borrowed time. If they do surgery to repair the lung it is very high risk because of his condition. They have also discussed a Trac (throat tube for breathing?) \nHas anyone else experienced anything like this?

I am 51, male.\n\nBack in school days, I remember hating PE because I did not like being forced to run because I simply did not like the experience.  Other kids seemed to run with such glee and to me, I was slow and it was miserable.  But I did it because I would have gotten a bad grade if I had not.  I never complained to my mother about any of it; I figured I was just slow.\n\nSo fast-forward to the past few years.  First, I have noticed that my calves are swelling.  Just a few days ago, I took a good look at my upper arms and I was shocked by how thin they had gotten. I had never really looked at them before, really, and I rested my elbow against the edge of the desk and cocked my head back so I could see it better, and it was unnaturally thin.  I was reminded of a time at work when I had to lift a big box of merchandise up into a bin (something I had done many times before) and it was like the thing suddenly got heavier and started coming back down on me.  I had to push it up with my other arm because the one was not doing it.  And I work in a retail environment where moderately heavy lifting is a thing, but I have noticed that things I was able to pick up before, I either cannot or it feels more difficult.\n\nI recently had a reason to break out into a little trot-run to get out of someone is way and I nearly fell because my left thigh, despite feeling like it was doing all it could, almost could not hold me up on that first stride.  Thighs are getting thinner, to the point where my calves are bigger around than my thighs, at least right behind the knees where there used to be a bulge from the quadriceps.  It is just atrophied, but it is not emaciated yet.  I can still walk, but it is getting to where the pain in my hips burn like they are utterly exhausted when I do.  And I have noticed that the way I walk is changing to try to compensate for how my hips are feeling, which is extremely tired and begging for rest, and then it feels like ecstasy to just sit for a bit.  And I am 5'11\"/205-210 pounds, though about 20 years ago I soared to 290, so I am not carrying around a whole bunch of extra weight, though I am working to drop another 30-40 pounds.\n\nI wondered if that has been the experience of others with BMD, particularly like not even knowing you have it until you are in your 50s, and then having it all make sense why you did not exactly find lots and lots of physical activity pleasurable like others did.

They are based in an Asian country, so understandings are not that developed and the healthcare system is poor to average. This is the road so far:\n\n* Vitamin D test below normal levels\n* CPK levels at 14,000\n* EMG test\n* Muscular biopsy indicates DMD\n\nHowever, when administering the blood test to scan for genes: (dystorphin: Genbank (NM_004006) was tested for deletions and duplications across exons 1-79 by Multiple probe-based litigation amplification (MLPA). The result turned out negative for deletions or duplications. They are unaware on how to proceed now. What could the issue be here?\n\nEdit: Test kit used is DMD MLPA Mix, MRC Holland, Amsterdam, Netherlands (CE-IVD marked) I am not familiar enough with the details of those genetic tests to know, but do they detect premature stop codon?  That is another possible cause of DMD along with deletions and duplications. They do not. It is literally genomic DNA based (blood cells do not express dystrophin), looking for deletions/duplications. You are correct: PTCs will not be spotted by this, nor will things like splice mutations/frameshifts.\n\nOP: The biopsy appears to have already answered the \"dystrophin yes/no\" question, and if there is no dystrophin detectable by dystrophin immunostaining, then yes: DMD is a very likely diagnosis. \n\nSequencing of the dystrophin gene (or perhaps the transcript) would help pin down the precise mutation, and this is critical information that could well influence the therapeutic options available: many of the current therapies in development or trials are sequence-specific, so will only work for certain mutations. Appreciate your help! Genetics really is not my field, so are you saying they did the wrong test or they should attempt the next test of sequencing of the gene? How is this sequencing usually performed? It is a solid test: a lot of DMD mutations are either duplications or deletions, both of which the test can detect (and it is a cheaper test).\n\nNext gen sequencing (of the entire dystrophin genomic locus) is typically more expensive, but it should identify the precise mutation, and as noted, it will detect single nucleotide substitutions such as those that cause premature termination codons. They literally sequence every single nucleotide of the dystrophin gene (it is about 2.4 million bases: the longest gene in the human genome). \n\nI cannot speak to precise costs (which will vary by geographic region anyway) but it should be 'affordable', if not necessarily cheap. Given the nature of current sequence-specific therapies, establishing the precise mutation is pretty important.\n\nIt can use genomic DNA purified from blood, too, so no need for more muscle biopsy.\n\n ( Much appreciated! So would it be best to order these tests?\n\n* \n\n*  Both of those seem like they would do the trick.\n\nBefore committing, though:\n\n&gt; Muscular biopsy indicates DMD \n\nDo you have more detail on this point? If they simply used histological staining (haematoxylin/eosin or similar) to identify muscle pathology, I would proceed with caution (a lot of different muscle disorders can produce DMD-like muscle pathology). \n\nIf they actually performed an immunostain for dystrophin (and found nothing), I would be more confident.", "Anyone else have \"trapped nerve\" sort of pain in your back?

Ok thanks for your reply I have been experiencing the exact same thing for a month now! Although it only affects the right side of my lower back. Sometimes it is gone for a week then suddenly comes back. Usually this feeling goes away when I lie down for a while. For causes I was thinking that I gained a little weight and my wheelchair got a bit tight, or simply because of all the sitting.. but after I saw your post maybe it is just comes with MD \n\n(I was diagnosed 20 years ago, they could not specify it they say it is a mixed type. I have been in a wheelchair for 4 years now.) Omg  I gained weight too, I mostly use a mobility scooter, I try be active but having have a more sedentary lifestyle atm. Maybe it is an MD thing, and yeah like you itll come and go. Annoting.

I am at the stage where I pretty much cannot walk over uneven ground, and have a little difficulty walking on a smooth surface. I cannot lift my arms fully. Is there any way to slow down the disease's progression? Any things I need to keep in mind?\n\n**Note:** I have not been officially diagnosed yet, so I do not know the full details. Where I live, a diagnosis requires a few tests, which are insanely expensive - and out of my budget, as a part-time writer. However, after several consultations with doctors and intensive research on the internet, we have found that my symptoms point at LGMD. A cousin (mom's side) has it too. He is in his 30s. I understand if you do not want to comment without an actual medical diagnosis, but I really *need* this. I am struggling to deal with this, and I am desperate to make lifestyle changes and decisions that will help in any way, *any* way at all. I need to work to survive, so if I can slow its progression even by a year, it will make a huge difference. Please help me. Hi there! I have LGMD(2A). LGMD is highly variable dependent upon the type. Some LGMDs have organ issues, some do not. Some are more progressive than others. Some spread to the distal muscles. All of them typically start in the proximal muscles though (shoulders, hips and trunk). People with the same type of LGMD may also have more ability than others.\n\nNow what I can tell you is that it is progressive -- regardless of type. The amount of progression you have may not be as bad as someone else and at some point you may not progress any worse.\n\nIn my experience, I have a progressive form of 2a -- I am nearly 27 and have extreme difficulty standing up from a chair, I cannot climb stairs at all, cannot walk on uneven ground and if I fall down I cannot get up from the ground without someone picking me up. Prognosis-wise, I do not doubt that I will be a full-time wheelchair user within the next 20 years. \n\nUnfortunately, LGMD is one of the least studied forms of MD. Research focus is typically on DMD and BMD. The MDA was recently awarded a grant to study some experimental treatments with the disease, but I would not get our hopes up yet that it is going to be a cure all -- especially when they are focused on some of the more obscure types of LGMD. 2A is the most common form and they are not studying it currently, and never really have outside of observation. The NIH also has funding for LGMD, but they are primarily focused on just observational study as well.\n\nRight now I am on Baclofen and Prednisone to help maintain my muscles, decrease pain and give a little extra boost to strength. Unfortunately, Prednisone has only been studied in small controlled studies of LGMD 2B and 2C. But, I can affirm, with 2A it has worked for me. The side effects of corticosteroids may not be worth it and you would need to discuss treatment like this with a doctor. It is highly experimental and may not work, so I also would not bet on this helping. Prednisone has not improved my ability to stand up better or climb stairs -- but it has increased my energy and given me a little of a strength boost in my arms. The baclofen is a muscle relaxer to help decrease the pain -- I have a rare symptom of the disease that causes pain and relieves some tightness of the contractures. The baclofen helps tremendously. I have also heard that MM can help and it is highly recommended by my neurologist, but I am currently on a contract with my PCP with Tramadol that bars me from using MM. When that contract expires I may consider trying it.\n\nThe only thing that is helped me over the years is learning how to strategically place things around the house to help me move around so I can decrease falls and \"climb up\" objects to stand from a seated position. I have also purchased a wheelchair so I can avoid falling in public. My partner and I are almost 30 and I feel like doodoo every time they have to pick me up from the ground. I definitely recommend investing in chair. Eventually the disease may progress to where you have to use a power chair. I am currently at that point but do not have the funds, nor the proper setup or vehicle to use a powerchair in public or my home. \n\nIf you can, apply to be in the MDA -- Muscular Dystrophy Association. Your neurologist can sign you up and has to fill out medical paperwork. You can participate in studies to help the future of people with the disease and they have \"loan closets\" for mobility devices.\n\nWell wishes. I know that this is tough. It is taken me many years to accept that I have a progressive illness, so I can understand any disappointment you have. Do not worry about having an undiagnosed subtype -- there are so many people out there that do not get a genetic diagnosis who have this illness. If you are interested and have not yet, ask for a muscle biopsy and possible testing of antisynthetase antibodies. Myositis can mimic LGMD and is treatable. I also would not get too hopeful that this is the case. I was originally diagnosed with \"idiopathic inflammatory myopathy\" and they thought I had advanced Polymyositis until the genetic test came back.\n\nAnother recommendation -- begin looking for support groups. Reddit is kind of \"dead\" for MD patients. I find most of my support on Facebook -- there are so many active groups there for us. One group I am in is called \"Muscular Dystrophy Subtype Unknown.\" There are so many people there without a diagnosed subtype of LGMD. Additionally, I would like to add: if you can, apply for SSI/SSDI. You are going to need insurance. This is not the type of disease you do not have insurance for. It is progressive and there is not a treatment.\n\nI completely understand online research though. Funnily enough, in my late teens and early 20s when the disease was first starting to rear some heavier symptoms I had done research and concluded it was LGMD. I did not have insurance and eventually there came a point in time when I knew something was incredibly incorrect about my body. Self-diagnosis is valid, though can be incorrect. But I knew what I had before an official diagnosis as well. There is nothing wrong with that -- you are entitled to know what is going on with your body and you know your body best. I have suffered with back pain and muscle spasms for almost ten years. Sleeping through the night only happened in my dreams. Travel was limited by the necessity to stop frequently, get out and walk/stretch. A 200 mile trip could take 6 hours. Hotel beds were excruciating. After three weeks of routine dosing, my dreams are now a reality. Sleeping thru the night, driving for extended periods and staying away from home overnight have given me my life back. One word of caution, with your doctor's guidance, start with a small dose Lioresal 10mg (Baclofen) and be patient as the dose is increased. Beginning large may cause extreme sleepiness. Yep, the voice of experience. Fell asleep in mid sentence! I use the services of this Worldwide store ( Prices are available. Quality is good. I am sure of all one hundred percent Thank you for taking the time to answer. There is a lot of helpful stuff in here. Just one more thing - do you find exercise helpful? I came across a post here where someone recommended lots of exercise, and I found that encouraging, because it is something that I can do in the comfort of my home for free, while working. Medicines scare me somewhat, because they could have side-effects, or I *might* use them incorrectly - especially syringes - causing myself more harm than good. I am not from the US, but that is a good tip! I will try to find its equivalent here.\n\nGood to know that you have been down the same road. I remember posting somewhere about this earlier (when I had not been to as many doctors and only had a vague inkling about it), and everyone was super anal, like \"No diagnosis, no advice. Sorry, gal\". I was afraid that would happen here again. Thankfully it did not!\n\nI had a long chat with my parents earlier this morning about it. They are incredibly supportive - especially dad. He is a rock. With them, I think I will be okay. It is provided immense mental fortification, if nothing else. Exercise is one of those things that we are not certain about. Some LGMD patients can exercise just fine and others cannot. Honestly, it can be a \"damned if you do, damned if you do not\" situation. I was given the okay by my neurologist to do very light aquatic exercise -- but as soon as I feel any ounce of muscle fatigue I have to stop. When we overuse our muscles and we are undergoing micro muscle tears during exercise our body has difficulty healing them, so to speak. During the RNA amino acid translation with our DNA we are missing certain genetic proteins that help our muscles -- which is why our muscles are diminishing and becoming infiltrated with fat (inflammation). Some patients can increase their strength with light exercise and it is definitely a good idea to get some kind of activity in because our hearts are a special type of organ that may become affected later in life with cardiomyopathy. You definitely do not want to overdo it though. I currently go to my local YMCA, swim a few laps, do what aqua aerobics and cardio I can without overdoing it. I find that it feels great and stretches everything out. Also, if you can try getting into physical therapy they can really help you out and help maintain your strength. I was going to aqua therapy for a few months and it helped tremendously -- they also taught me how I could exercise in the water without overdoing it.\n\nAdditionally, if you are overweight it is best to begin some kind of lifestyle change. I am overweight myself and the excess weight on the impaired muscles causes increased weakness.\n\nThe medications -- Baclofen and Prednisone, are tablets. They are not addictive and you just take however many your doctor prescribes a day. I am on 10mg of Prednisone Q1 daily and Baclofen 10mg Q1 twice a day. They are also not too expensive if you do not have insurance or the insurance is not a socialized program. Without insurance my Prednisone would be $30 USD and the Baclofen is also in the $30 USD range. The United States is absolutely awful with medical pricing though so it may be even cheaper wherever you live. I highly recommend asking your doctor for a low-dose of Prednisone, especially if you are going to be working out. Before Prednisone I could not exercise without extreme pain and now I can do a solid work out multiple times a week. Baclofen is completely unnecessary unless you have the rare symptom of muscle pain. My muscle pain feels like I am going through a cheese grater -- with the Baclofen it is virtually nonexistent.\n\nThe side effects of Prednisone are a little intimidating. However, MD patients are not placed on high doses. My neurologist started me on 10mg, which is a very small dose. Earlier this year after seeing muscle strength improvement she boosted me up to 20mg twice a day. I started gaining weight dramatically and had intense mood swings and there was not a noticeable difference in strength afterwards. I was tapered off the medication entirely for a little while and there is a noticeable difference in how weak I am without the medication vs. how much strength I have gained on it. To an average person I still appear frail but it is made a world of difference in my ability to stand, walk and even do basic tasks. \n\nIf you need to know anything else please feel free to ask! You can also shoot me a message on Reddit at any time. It seems this is a bot account. The same text is posted on so many threads I am fairly sure of it. The account's just a day old, and they are posting the same thing over and over - with a promotional link! Darn, that is scary. I read about micro-tears once, but the thing is, usually I feel no pain after a light workout. I just do a bit of walking and yoga. Do you think it could be causing problems despite the lack of pain? I realise it is best to consult a doctor, but this is just for discussion. I want some idea of what to expect in the time it will take me to find the right doctor, and get an appointment.\n\nI generally lead a dangerously sedentary lifestyle, so I guess exercise might do me some good. I mean, I cannot remember the last time I went out of my house. It is definitely been over a month. During day, I am either lying in bed reading, or sitting at my desk working (i.e., writing). I have started walking a few hundred steps at intervals throughout the day. Oh, and I am underweight.\n\nGood lord, muscle pain sounds scary. I do not think I have ever experienced anything like it. I am pretty fortunate (so far).\n\nI am kind of making my mind up to live the next 15-20 years the best I can, and to hell with the rest. My parents will not be around for much longer after that, and they are my support system - so there would be no point in continuing, and there would be nobody to take care of me in any case. My biggest problem is that I do not enjoy life enough - so maybe I can remedy that with this thought process.\n Micro-tears are the natural happenstance of gaining muscle for the average body. They are typically a positive thing -- but for MD patients it can be more detrimental than good. I am not a doctor so I cannot quite give any medical advice -- I also do not know which formulation of LGMD you have to research on PubMed to see the effect of micro-tears. Light exercise is good in any regard -- whatever we can do we should, and we need to just be careful. \n\nI hope you can find some good things. It sounds like you may enjoy facets of your life -- reading and writing seems to drive you. Exercise gives us endorphins. As we age we accumulate more knowledge and opportunities. Good luck. I got distracted by the bot and forgot to comment lol. I do not have any advice but I just got diagnosed at 21 last summer. If you ever want to talk, feel free to PM! &gt; reading and writing seems to drive you. Exercise gives us endorphins.\n\nI hope so too! I think I will. Talking to you has helped immensely; it is so cathartic talking to others who have been through the same thing. I cannot thank you enough, honestly. Thanks. I doubt I will do that - I tend to be a private person most of the time, but I will remember the offer. :) Hi, I was diagnosed last year with LGMD. Mine is a titinopathy. I am now 50. They think it started in my 20s. I was diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic (I live in MN). My case is mild. i have a brother who has a moderate case. \n\nI have had balance issues forever and was always kind of slow in sports. I used to be a triathlete and fitness fanatic. I cannot run anymore AT ALL and now have trouble with tripping even on smooth surfaces. My gait looks bad now. it was never great but now just watching me walk, you would be able to tell something is wrong. \n\nNo one will give me fitness guidance because they always say it is really specialized to the person. I am trying yoga because it is movement and range of motion without weight. I am hoping it helps my balance. \n\nDo not do anything with weights - no weightlifting. No running. Nothing with impact. These cause the micro-tears mentioned below. \n\nI second the advice to lose weight if you need to. I could stand to lose 20 to 25#. I have not really accepted that this is happening to me and consequently have not been diligent about losing weight. \n\nI wish you the best.  &gt; Do not do anything with weights - no weightlifting. No running. Nothing with impact.\n\nThanks. I will keep that in mind - although that should be easy to remember, since I cannot do them in any case. I have started to have some difficulty in walking. I am scared.\n\nAlthough I am underweight, I think I do need to lose some weight. I gained a few kilos recently, and I feel strangely heavy. Might just be because of the disease's progression, but I need to keep my weight controlled anyway. Everytime I get up from the bed or the chair, I feel like the fingers of my hand will break. It is terrifying. Could you recommend some other Facebook groups for someone with LGMD? I would like to recommend some to my mother. She does not really have any support group type things set up. Would love to her her started!  Of course!

Lots of forms of MD happen because the body cannot make a particular protein, and creatine does not support that.\n\nHaving said that, I guess it would be useful if you were training other muscles which may give you more support, although I would do it with the guidance of your specialist. I tried the creatine and albuturol, mehh.  Albuturol gets your heart going but that is about it. &gt; I think it is been debunked. Lots of forms of MD happen because the body cannot make a particular protein, and creatine does not support that.\n&gt; \n&gt; \nAh thanks for pointing that out. I should probably wait till I get a specialist and talk to them.", "Learn About Our Observational Becker Muscular Dystrophy Study \u201cMagnetic Resonance Imaging and Biomarkers for Muscular Dystrophy Research Study\u201d specific to Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) is a natural history study evaluating the disease progression in BMD via the use of MRI.

I am thinking about maybe getting one but with like a seat attachment. I am considering a 3 wheeled one but maybe 2 wheels is enough. Thoughts?  \n\n\nI cannot ride a bicycle and can barely get down from the side walk to road because the curb is too high. Just so you all know what my current ability is. Just trying to work out if it is a good idea because I do not really want to go FW (Full Wheelchair) yet. Was also looking at options.  Was considering a large base (the skateboard part) but they are still heavy if I had to bring it in somewhere especially during the winter.  No attached water garage. I have been considering this too for a while now! I have limb girdle and losing mobility progressively, would be great to have a scooter to easily get around on and especially to glide up hills. \n\nI recently hired one through those classic apps in Bristol. It was great once I was on and going, but I really struggled with the step up onto the scooter and pushing off. This might be something to consider as most of them require a small push to get going and they can be quite heavy and a high step. Hope you find a good fit for you! I am currently in that department as well, I am trying to get a scooter so I can be independent in college, I would love to help some of you with some that I liked. I think we can all agree, we all kind of want a stylish ride as we are going to use that to represent us outside. The first is Drive Easy Rider, Ewheels EW-72 Mobility Scooter 4-wheel, EV Rider SportRider Scooter, Drive Cobra GT4, and Drive Ventura 4 DLX. Hope this helps! Some of the three wheeled ones you can drag behind you like a food cart so maybe it is not so bad I was thinking this one maybe.  I am a manifesting carrier of Duchenne so similar, reduced levels of dystrophin, and I use a motorised scooter and honestly you should go for it. I could not survive without mine. And by using it, I save more energy for other things (I was using a wheeled Walker beforehand, and all my daily energy went on the school run). \n\nI would suggest very carefully choosing which type of mobility scooter you want. Eventually I ended up with two;\n\nA portable shopper, one that can be dismantled and put in the boot of a car, for days our and excursions. It goes 4mph, battery has about 8 mile range. It has small solid tyres. Usually good for shopping centres, museums, that sort of thing. \n\nI then have a large non portable road legal scooter. Mine goes 4mph (you can get ones which go up to 8mph) , it has a 30 mile range, and a more comfortable seat, as this can manage everyday journeys. This gives me the most freedom, and can manage a supermarket or museum, but is quite large and has a smaller turning circle and it is less built for navigating small spaces like my other one. \n\nThink about what you are likely to use it for most, if travelling from A to B, you are better off with a road legal one. If just for days out,  trips to your local nearby shop, or shopping centres then I would say a portable short range one will do the job. \n\nGetting a scooter was the best thing I ever did , and gives me so much independence, I say go for it, and your quality of life should improve tremendously like mine did. Good luck! Update us all with a snap of your new wheels if you do.\n\nEdit: looking back I think I have mistook you, and thought you meant a mobility scooter, and perhaps you could mean an electric scooter you stand on? \n\nI am talking about mobility scooters, I believe the stand up electric mobility scooters you require a driving license and cannot legally use on pavements. Mobility scooters you can use on pavements providing under 4mph, and you do not require a license but if using the road will have register with the DVLA. I do live in the England though cannot vouch for anywhere else. My mistake, I think I have misunderstood you, my bad. Either way above could be useful of no look with an electric scooter with a seat.

My question is this: Does MD affect the heart, since it is a muscle, or does it just affect the musculoskeletal (is that right?) muscles that one has conscious control over? Heart is affected. Cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of death related to DMD. That is about what I figured. I thought it might either be that or the diaphragm not letting people breath on their own. Respiratory problems are also a significant cause of death.", "My husband has MD, am looking for support/input from other MD couples Hi guys. My husband has emery dreifuss MD and I am curious to hear from other couples in similar situations. He is a sweet, wonderful guy and I want to be as supportive to him as possible. I do not know anyone else with MD, or even anyone in a marriage where one spouse is disabled, and we sometimes feel very alone. For a bit of backstory, my husband was diagnosed at around 3, repeatedly told he would die before puberty, and is confined to a wheelchair due to failed surgeries that resulted in an amputation. His mother is a narcissist who constantly guilt trips him, saying he \u201cowes her\u201d for all the time she spent nursing him and worrying. His health is stable now, but he has been close to death several times in the past. For all he has been through he is amazingly stable mentally, very unselfish, and very independent. I am extremely lucky to be with him.\n\nHowever, due to his past health scares, he is very paranoid about every ache and pain and gets panic attacks whenever we see a doctor. He is also afraid I will get fed up one day and leave, and worries that he is holding me back. He also accidentally let slip once that finds it hard to believe I really truly think he is sexually attractive, due to his muscle deterioration and severe scarring from said surgeries. I understand why he would think these things, but it still upsets me a lot. How do I convince him I am in for the long haul? How can I help calm him at the doctors without being demeaning? How do I convince him that I find him sexy as hell?\n\nAnyhow, thanks for reading my rant....I would love any and all input from you guys. Just sharing some of your stories would help me get some awesome perspective! My husband has Duchenne - I would rather not put too many details here but feel free to message me :)  Hey, I creeped a little and saw your post. I have too have muscular dystrophy (and epilepsy unfortunately). As well, a good friend had been working for Muscular Dystrophy Canada for 10 years as a youth advisor and I will be spending the weekend at another good friends place who has such a severe case she can only really move her face and her hand a little.\n\nI was diagnosed when I was about 4. Luckily, it is such a minor part of my life that unless I point it out nobody would notice. Tightened muscles in the legs, fatigue quicker etc. Growing up my parents were told it was myopathy type 2, but years later I talked to a doctor and he said there was no such thing. So I am not really sure what I have got. I used to swim competitively and was on track for the Paralympics. When I swam, I was classified the same as someone with an at the knee leg amputation. I would always just tell people I was on track for the Olympics though, it is less explaining...\n\nMy friend who I will be visiting is also in a very similar situation to your husband. She is wheelchair bound and was told she would not live a long life. She is now celebrating her 31st birthday this weekend with my friend who worked at the MD association, myself and her husband.\n\nI am afraid I may not be much help, but thought I would let you know your not alone in it all :) Oh wow thanks for sharing! I am really impressed by your pursuit in sports, you sound gutsy! It is awesome you are connected with the MD communitiy too. I keep bugging my husband to join online groups or something, but he prefers not to. (I think it is because he gets anxiety talking about his surgeries and stuff.) The whole myopathy type 2 thingie sounds confusing! Do you know if it is possible to get a blood test and see what you are actually dealing with? Technically my husband has a mutated form of emery dreifuss so we are going to have to get more specific tests done soon to see what we are dealing with, as far as genetics go. \n\nDo not worry about not helping much, as you put it...I am really happy you commented and do indeed feel a bit less alone in this! Best of luck to you and yours! :D My husband Has Becker's. He is also in a wheelchair, if you have questions or need to talk let me know! Speaking from the male perspective as someone with SMA, my fianc\u00e9e being my primary caretaker; to make it too long did not read my muscles have deteriorated to the point of needing help being fed. I myself echo everything that your husband has said and/or felt of what you have stated here, and honestly this is the hard part because you are already doing what you need to do for and that is standing by his side.\n\nFor a lot of us with this disease or these diseases I should say although most do not like to hear it it is OUR responsibility to pursue the proper mental health options available to us. It does not mean that we or our partner has felt either at any point but rather just as one must maintain their body as well as possible they must also maintain their mental stability and for people in my position the latter must be stressed all the more.", "Searching for a diagnosis For the last 2 years, I have been having weird symptoms that none of the nearly 15 doctors I have seen have been able to figure out. Do any of these sound like any form of MD?\n\n* Weak, shaky muscles\n* Visibly thinner arms, legs, and hands, especially my thighs just above my knees and my forearms/wrists\n* Extremely uncomfortable/ painful \"chaffed\" or rubbing feeling when I wear long sleeves or pants for extended periods. Almost like the hairs on my arms and legs are sore. Also happens in bed with sheets and blankets\n* Constant muscle twitching all over my body. It does not hurt, just small muscle twitches\n* Joint pain/discomfort, especially in my ankles and knees. Wrists and hands too\n* Tender hands/feet. It almost feels like they do not have any fat or muscle padding on them anymore and everything I do is uncomfortable because it is like I am touching the bone through the skin.\n* Hazy/foggy feeling in my head where it is hard to focus or think. This comes and goes for weeks/months at a time\n\nI have had 3 EMGs, all \"normal\" and a muscle biopsy two months ago that was also \"normal\" which is unbelievable to me because I can physically see that my legs and arms are so much thinner than they ever have been at any point in my life. The only test result I have had that is abnormal is my CK has been high on 2 occasions. I had one genetic test done that did show a variant for Emery Dreyfuss, but my neurologist seems convinced that that is not it. He did a stain for it on my biopsy and it was also negative. I am waiting to hear back from a whole exome test but I am getting desperate for an answer. I cannot get any joy out of my life currently because I do not know what is going on what the rest of my life is going to look like.\n\nDoes this sound like a typical experience in getting diagnosis for any form of MD? What could an alternative condition be? I have heard Lyme thrown around, and this did all start right  after a camping trip to Colorado two years ago, but I do not know. I was diagnosed with limb girdle md around 17 years old.   It is quite similar to what you are describing but each person develops into it differently.   Resembling symptoms of MD, Pompe disease is another similar diagnosis. Do any of your family members have similar symptoms? I have Myotonic Dystrophy type 2 but from what I am reading it doesnt sound like you have any myotonia so that likely rules out DM2 or DM1. Muscular dystrophy is inherited and doesnt just appear so if you have symptoms I would consult your family and see if anyone else does aswell. No, not that I know of. The exome testing is testing both my parents as well, so maybe we will find something out there. \n\nMaybe I am incorrectly using MD and should instead be asking about any myopathy. Similar in what ways, if you do not mind me asking? I have Emery-Dreifuss and some of your symptoms sound typical including elevated CK. The genome sequencing should confirm it. Are you a toe walker at all? Do you have weak biceps? Can you fully straighten your arm? Any cardiac involvement? While MD is \"inherited\" you can be the first person in your family with dominant gene MD. Mutations do occur on their own. I am very similar. Did you ever find anything out?", "Anecdotal reports about exon-skipping therapies? I now count 4 approved exon-skipping therapies, all contingent on still-to-be-demonstrated clinical benefits.\n\nWhen I search for hope on this question, I occasionally come across reports from the field insisting that the therapies have profound effects on the patients, well beyond placebo.\n\nDoes anyone have any personal experience with these therapies? I am curious about this too I also wish to know more My son is 5 and has been on exondys-51 for two years. It is difficult for me to say how effective it has been so far because of his age, and not really having anything to compare it to.

Included it in the title bluntly so people can avoid if they so wish. \n\nManifesting carrier here. I have struggled with my bowels for as long as I  an remember,  and as an adult was told I have IBS. Since my gallbladder removal however, I have gone from chronic diorhea, to chronic constipation that gets so bad I cannot move for pain as it starts pressing on various nerves, and even sitting upright becomes agony. It is really bad.\n\nUpon some reading turns out it becomes quite common in DMD and variations of. Some say because of the sedentary life we may live as it progresses  And also the lack of dystrophin on the digestive system. Starting to think I do not have IBS at all. It feels like my lower digestive system just pauses for a while and nothing happens, and its agonising. Theres growing research and some say theres an information gap here and it needs more research, but thus far research indicates theres very much a strong connection. \n\n\nAnyone else with severe constipation, or perhaps even things like crohns or gastroparesis/gastroparalysis? Personal question I know. Wondered if I am alone in this. \n\n Two sons with DMD and they both take a daily dose (about 1/2 the recommended) of PEG (polyethylene glycol) as advised by their neurologist. I have DMD and occasionally deal with constipation. My neurologist told me to drink lots of fluids (about 1 ounce per kg) every day and that I can increase the amount of laxative (polyethylene glycol) I take. Fruits and vegetables that you can tolerate, such as bananas, etc., should help.\n\nIf it is really severe, consider doing a bowel clean-out. 7 capfuls of MiraLax in 32 ounces of water drunk over 2-4 hours. You can also take up to 50 mg of Senna with it, which will help the intestines contract.\n\nGood luck! Yeah that is a thing.... Dystrophin is expressed in smooth muscle as well as cardiac and skeletal muscle, so intestinal function will likely be affected. Smooth muscle does not typically experience the raw contractile forces that skeletal muscle does, so might not be actively damaged by normal activity, but dystrophin fulfils just...a whole bunch of additional signalling roles, all of which might be impaired in the smooth muscle intestinal wall of a DMD patient or manifesting carrier.\n\nAlso worth asking which specific mutation you are a carrier for: there are multiple dystrophin isoforms, each starting from a different place in the gene but all ending the same. Mutations at the start of the dystrophin gene typically affect only the full length isoform (dp427), which is the muscle isoform, but mutations nearer the end can affect multiple isoforms, including dp71, which is expressed in epithelial cells of the gut. Appreciate this response a lot. Our deletion is exon 1,  if that helps. I believe from our neurologist its not a very common one. This was a really detailed and helpful response thanks so much. Glad we have people like you here! Our mutation is on paper at home (adhd  cant remember) but will look it up! Thanks again.  Hi, I have LGMD and have had similar issues due to inactivity.  Here is what is helped me.. I would recommend looking into a daily probiotic.  I have been taking one called Seed and it is supposed to be the best one on the market.  I have taken it for 2.5 months now and really notice a big difference in my bowels and daily consistency.  It also makes your skin glow and look healthy.  Check it out! :) Emily Yes my brother had DMD he used to have severe digestive problems and constipation also hit him very hard . He used to struggle a lot just to digest the food and sometimes because of that issue the food that he swallowed  used to come out and it was very difficult so he started eating less and less  .", "Unexplained muscle wasting - could this be muscular dystrophy?

I was wondering what avenues some of you guys have taken to find a caregiver(s). I am based out of california if that helps at all. I would preferably like to find someone close to my age that I can get along with if I am going to be spending a lot of time with them, any advice and suggestions are greatly appreciated! thank you Hi, I think you would have a great shot at finding this perhaps through some agencies. I would think that you are eligible for a home health aide, you can look into that. Also I would go to your neurologist, if you do not have one, you should find one, and ask them to refer you to home health aide/caregiver. Also if you have a rehab doctor that would be even better. I am just trying to help as best as I can. Feel free to message back. Thank you! Those are some great ideas No problem at all. We (UK) have used agencies and private carers. The local council funds care for my son (DMD). Private carers work out cheaper and we have found them with local ads and posting requests on local Facebook groups.

I was recently diagnosed and still have mobility and cannot decide if exercise will be good or not. Doctors have been iffy.\n\nI was diagnosed because I decided to become active ( take kick boxing classes) and kept spraining parts of my body so I have been hesitant I exercise by walking when I can but only short distances I find the more I use my muscles the faster they get weaker....but everyone is different. You need to try to find a happy medium if possible.  So I think it really depends on what type of dystrophy you have, what your current physical condition is, and the advice of your doctor and physio.\n\nMy physio has given me exercises to do, but these are just lifting my arms up and down, stretching, very low impact stuff.  The physio also said swimming is good if I take it easy, the general advice was do not do anything to the point that it hurts or aches.\n\nThe worry would be causing more damage, rather than being beneficial, and that is why (if you are in the U.K.) you should ask for a referral to one of the specialist centres where the Dr's and physios are specialists in MD and can give confident advice, rather than a general Neurologist's fuzzy thoughts. I go swimming on the occasion, but since it is winter I am not doing a whole lot of anything. I have found that when I do exercise I can only do it about once or twice a week -- the rest of the days I have to rest my body because the muscles feel super exhausted and heavy. If I do not exercise I can do a lot more through out the day -- like housework and walking in public. Meanwhile exercise just takes that completely out of me.\n\nI also was going to physical therapy at one point but it was doing the same thing -- causing massive exhaustion. I have decided to just do what I can do and accept it. \n\nIt all really depends on your strain. I am LGMD2A here. I have LGMD (titinopathy). I can still walk and if I walk every day, I feel like I am stronger. But if I exercise for real (bike the 8 miles home on a nice day), I am just exhausted.  My doctor is actually w specialist ( he actually has md too) and he said it might help, might not. He warned me to try not to be out of breath and I feel like excersice does not count till then? Like I get out of breath really easily so that is nothing. \n\nHe mentioned swimming. Guess it is time to learn.  8 miles is a lot!!!

I was just starting to enjoy kickboxing when I got diagnosed and I was still sad to leave. I still applaud you for being able to bike 8 miles! I am biased as I enjoy swimming, though I have slowly been able to do less and less, so I spend more time in the sauna than in the pool, which is not the worst trade-off.

For the best 4 years I have had very poor posture which I did on purpose basically sticking my neck super forward and rounding my shoulders  for some weird reason and I would also tense my hands, I do not know why I did it.\n\n I have lost 2 inches in height and my hands appear to be noticeably smaller as well as my arms and legs seemingly shorter.\n\nDo you guys think this super bad posture could have caused some type of early onset muscular dystrophy? My GP does not take this seriously saying my hands look fine but I know they are severely dystrophied. I have started to try and play sports again which has not been a great idea. MD is genetic. It is not caused by posture. Have you had an MD diagnosis? Find a new doctor. The doctor is able to assess clinical weakness. It does not sound like MD at all, but you would need a genetic test done to know I had scoliosis when I was a kid because the muscles in my back could not hold my spine straight. Leaning over to one side compressed my lung and it was a breeding ground for pneumonia. I had spinal fusion in '99 at the age of 13. I think I only had pneumonia once or twice since then. Getting my lung opened up was the most important thing. Genetic testing will confirm MD, but obtaining the tests can be problematic and expensive.\n\nSpeak with a neurology specialist, they can conduct preliminary tests, EMG and blood, to validate if genetic testing is appropriate. Go get the blood test so they can look for the mutation in your DNA. It is not hard for them to find.

We were referred to a geneticist when treatment was not going normally but he did not do any tests, just a family history, and said it is just clubfoot.  More surgery and still lots of difficulty and our orthopedist wrote him off basically as a lost cause. Our new doctor referred us to a neurologist who took one look at him and his other medical history and said ya there is more to it than clubbed foot. We are waiting to get approved for a gene panel to hopefully give us more answers. \n\nRight now he walks but gets super tired quite quickly, he gets spontaneous fractures in his feet, he wants to try to keep up with all the other kids but he just cannot. He is frustrated and I cannot blame him. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions for helping him cope now and as time goes on I would truly be grateful.  Delayney, \nI\u1e3f 16 with MD and my mother always informed me as a child of what was happening. I dont really deal with kids well but you can try to let him know what is happening and why so he doesnt get confused! Kids ask questions right? Give him answers. Let him know what you know when you think he can handle it. That\u015b the advice I can give to let him cope; Being different and not knowing why is rough. I hope he gets a diagnosis soon!

That helped me through my life, it was a struggle tho because I would always ask why to God when I was feeling down. But my mom and my grandma always taught me to be grateful for what I have and life in general. There are people who are pushing through tougher circumstances and I should be doing as much as I can with mine. \n\nBut if you are not religious,\nI loved sports, I wanted to be a quarterback in the NFL and it was my life and all I wanted to do ever. One thing that kept me going was the hope for a cure, everyone that I knew would talk about it and it kept my head up. Maybe back then it was no where near as close but now there are much more advances in research! BUT, that should be your last resort in my opinion because my hope for a cure and my idea as to what a cure would do for me got my hopes up too much and made it hard for me to deal with in the future\n\nThe MAIN thing that I think you should do part 1:\nHelp him develop a passion for something that does not require physical labor. I loved music and singing (even tho I could not sing for crap lol),  and just anything where I could create. I eventually developed a passion for arts, it keeps me going. I write stories, poems, songs, raps. I actually have a clothing company with a long time friend which brings me to my next point...\n\nPart 2:\nHe should find real genuine friends, this can be easy or hard depending on the school. My elementary school was great. They made the kids aware of my condition and why I am like this. My classmates were nice to me and helpful. My teacher even made everyone take turns using a wheelchair for a day so they could see what it was like.  I found my best friends for life in elementary school, I still talk to them almost everyday. I probably would have more friends if I was not so shy because people were genuinely interested in talking to me because of my situation. \nMDA helped a lot as well, I found friends there too at the camps and support groups. Some of the best times of my life there as well.\n\nYour son is special, although he may not feel like it, just like everyone else. He can inspire people and change the world more than most can because of the things he goes through. I wish that I had been more outspoken and could change the world for the better with my voice and writing but I am very shy. Help him to be comfortable with himself by being realistic and showing him that we are all different and that what makes us all special in our own ways.\n\nI hate to add another \u201cbut\u201d but I am lol \nBut you will learn along the way what to do, just be there for him and make sure he feels loved. It is going to be hard at times but the fact that you are putting in so much effort for your son, unlike some parents, shows me that you and your son will make it through those hard times. It is really great to see. \n\nOf course what I say is not always going to be right but I hope this helps and I will keep you and your son in my prayers, if you have any more questions or your son does, please let me know I would love to help.\n\n Thank you for writing this.

Beware of the online 'work from home' scams.  \n\nAny time you are asked to pay money upfront for *'employment services'* before they will help, be very suspicious.  or if they send you money and ask you to send a smaller amount back or to someone else That would be part of the information transfer needed to penetrate banking and/or credit card information. I work in IT. 99% of my work is online and you could probably find a remote IT Helpdesk or call center type job Yeah, i talked to someone who fell for it once.  They send you a check and ask you to send some of it back, a few days after you send some of the money in your account, the original funds that you thought were deposited in your account disappear (the bank bounces the check) and you are out the money.

I have LGMD 2d. I am 26 and have been progressing since 14. I was unable to walk entirely without assistance around 23. I am at a stage where I have no strength in my shoulders, and am being forced to use the ligaments in my hands/fingers to move my arms around if I want to move them at all. I am an artist so this is extremely taxing on me professionally and mentally. It is becoming very painful, and I find myself being unbearably uncomfortable about the ball of my shoulder not being in socket. Nothing I do fixes it unless I get drunk to forget its happening. It hurts. It makes me wonder if there is anything out there to help me or if this is really it. Im scared and do not want to feel this discomfort anymore. Oh I am so sorry you are going through this. I only have a mild form of LGMD, so I cannot imagine what you are going through.\n\nI am afraid I do not have any advice for you, and unfortunately I do not think this sub gets very much attention, much like LGMD itself.\n\nBest of luck....

My mom has myotonic muscular desease, and some people on her family have it too, but not has much. Im her only son, can i henherit it worse or not as bad ? \n(Sorry for the spelling, im not a native english speaker) Yes, you have a 50% chance to get it. Thanks for the reply. \nWould it be worse or not as bad? Myotonic MD varies wildly from person to person- unfortunately if you do in fact have it, you will not really know how much function you will lose until you lose it. As with every Neuromuscular condition, the best way to preserve what you have is to stay active. And, if you ever have access to testing, myotonic can be diagnosed with an EMG if you cannot access genetic testing. I would add if you are in the United States, it may not be wise to get tested for it. It would be considered a pre-existing condition for insurance purposes. That means you may not be able to receive treatment later on in life. My grandfather, dad, and I all have myotonic muscular dystrophy. \nSince muscular dystrophy is genetic, it can be passed from parent to child. \n\nIf it is available in your country, maybe try and seek genetic testing to verify whether or not you have myotonic dystrophy (if you do, it could be helpful to learn how many \"repeats\" you have to give yourself a vague timeline on how things progress) What about if it is just my parent\u2019s siblings who have it. What are my chances of developing it later in life? None, you can not get if neither of your parents have it ", "My brother is 20 with MD...we do not know much about it. But he seems ok so far. My younger brother is 20 and has LGMD...do not know what type. So far he has not experienced much difficulty. He makes money delivering food on his bicycle and recently bought a motorcycle to fix up and ride. He gets joint soreness but so do I (our family has bad knees and wrists, genetically) \n\nHe has not had any complications at all so far. He lives an EXTREMELY normal life, biking 3-4 hours a day most days, swimming, he can drive...he cannot run much but that also runs in our family because of the knees. He and I live together, I quite like being around him, do most people with LGMD make it to 20 like normal and then rapidly decline at some point or can I put the fears on hold for a few years? Or is it really unpredictable? He is seriously strong, beats my ass at wrestling and I work out...I cannot imagine him degenerating rapidly in the next 10 or even 20 years... I have LGMD. If he needs to get tested genetically to find out the subtype and get on the registry, I can help you with the resources. It is free.  It is really unpredictable and each case seems to be different. Mine is not severe. I started having symptoms at 16. Now I am 40 and I can still walk pretty well (not that fast though).  It takes me a long time on stairs and up hills. I have no involvement in my shoulders yet. I walk like a drunk penguin, but I am old enough not to care. \n\nI work from home, but I have never not had a job. I have been to more than 40 countries and all 50 states. It is not the best thing that can happen, but it does not ruin your life. It happens slowly enough that you get kind of used to the changes. He is still him no matter what happens to his body I think it is unpredictable, and may depend on the specific type. A relative and I have the same type (2i). She had a wheelchair at my age and I am largely quite capable,  but there are some things I do struggle with,  like lifting, carrying things, holding my arms up, running sometimes...

So many subtypes. So, so many.\n\nA lot of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies are caused by deficiencies in the pathways that stick sugars onto a protein called alpha dystroglycan: most of the proteins on the outside of your cells have sugars stuck onto them somewhere, but in the case of alphaDG, these sugars critically influence interactions with the surrounding extracellular matrix. The process of adding sugars to proteins is really, really elaborate, and it is even more elaborate in the case of alphaDG (seriously, the final protein is \\~65% sugar, by weight). There are 15+ steps that can go wrong, some of which can be subsequently compensated for, some of which cannot. Each one results in a different LGMD, and as a consequence, some LGMDs result in really severe disease (and often a brain phenotype too), while others can be quite mild.\n\nThis \\_sounds\\_ mild, given the description, but \"mild now\" can always turn into \"debilitating later\", and without a more concrete diagnosis, this is impossible to call. How, for example, do you know he has LGMD without knowing which type? Or do you mean \"he knows which type, but I, the OP, do not\"?\n\nA general rule of thumb is that if you make it to adulthood with only mild symptoms, you are looking at a slow progression, but that is no reason to be complacent: muscle wasting diseases are characterised by muscle wasting (obviously) and it is really difficult to recover muscle lost to this sort of disease. The earlier you find out exactly what type it is, and exactly what therapeutic interventions are available, the better.", "Survey on body image and sexual satisfaction for people with chronic illness and disability Hello,\n\nMy name is Shannon Hughes and I am a 2nd-year Master's student in the Applied Psychological Science program (MA) at Pacific University.

Greetings,\n\nIve been lifelong friends with a buddy who has Duchennes MD. Ive seen him get worse and worse. He is a fantastic human being to be around though. I havent seen him since COVID started because he is at risk but before COVID, all we were limited to was going to the movie theatres every once in awhile and one of his parents would have to come with him incase he needed to be cared for. That is fine. When we were younger all we could really do was play video games and watch movies. He can still talk, but his capabilities have definitely decreased. Im trying to figure out what else I can do with him besides just go to the movies? Is there anything besides movies and video games we can do? Any suggestions that are set up for Duchennes MD? He used to be able to bowl with special attachments, but I dont think he can anymore. Any suggestions would be great! Standing alone against an affliction that isolates one from the world is a lonely path to follow.  Most of us are not aware of the massively soothing effect a friendship can have to span the gap.\n\n&gt;*\"Kind words, kind looks, kind acts, and warm hand-shakes, these are means of \ngrace when men in trouble are fighting their unseen battles.\"* John Hall (1829-1898) This is tough with covid, but when things loosen up a bit, here is some things my friend and I would do witha buddy: outdoor bbq with close friends and family. Great to gather and everyone is just hanging out. We would also go for drives. We had a great wheelchair accessible van for this and would do drive by zoos, or parks. Another option could be visiting a restaurant that has live music. During Covid can you both play online video games together and talk through that? Or can he not play games any more?\n\nOutside of Covid, just hanging out together, even if it is just at home? I am sure he just wants a friend.\nOtherwise If he has a suitable wheelchair you could always get out to a park or something.... \nsorry I am not much help My buddy and I chat a lot over the internet, we have played board games through tabletop simulator, we record a podcast together, we have sat out in the garden just chatting from a distance, we have had dinner parties where the ones capable of cooking do it and then we all enjoy the food, we have gone for drives (he can drive his modded car), we have read the same books and discussed them, etc. You can do a lot, really, depending on your interests and what you consider to be worthwhile. At the end of the day, it is just about the company I think. My brother has MD and has always struggled with friendships. I just want to say thank you for being there for your friend. Even though you cannot do many \u201cfun\u201d things together, I am sure he appreciates the fact that you are there with him. And to give you some perspective; you are bummed because of the lack of activities when you are with him. Now think about how he feels every day, all the time. (Not saying you are not empathetic because you obviously seem like an AMAZING person, just offering another way to understand the depth of this situation.)\n\nTo answer your question though, what you are doing is awesome! Again, sure movies can be boring as doing the same thing all the time is boring, but for your friend, this is one thing he can do, so DO IT.\n\nA few things my brother does:\n\n-Play video games online, that way him and his friend are having a blast chatting and doing team-like things together that he does not get to do IRL. Video games are like an alternate reality for him where he can almost pretend to be running, driving, etc, things he cannot do.\n\n-Attend live music, although sometimes a difficult feat, has always been really rewarding for us.\n\n-Go for a walk somewhere that has an accessible, paved walkway. My brother spends a ton of time indoors so this is always great. Sometimes I walk the dogs and he comes with. For well-behaved dogs that are used to his chair, we have actually tied the leash to the chair so he got to feel like he was \u201cwalking\u201d my dog. Again, only if you know 100% the dog will be ok in that situation.\n\n-Go out to eat, try new restaurants and bars.\n\n-If possible, drive around. We have a specialty van. Drive somewhere scenic, check out holiday lights, etc.\n\n-Not for everyone but! We went to Vegas when my brother turned 21. The boys had a great time at the strip club, lol.\n\n-Any kind of play, show, sporting event, etc. Sometimes figuring out accessibility is tough, other times your handicap seats are the best in the house!\n\n-Also, swimming! Obviously this differs with everyone, but one thing my brother can do is swim. Well, he kind of just floats there but still. It is a pretty big undertaking to get him in the pool and everything (the pool has to have a lift) and we do not do it often, but it is an option for some people.\n\nObviously a ton of these are not possibly during Covid, but some day hopefully! And sorry, I know that got a bit long and a lot of my suggestions were said by others, but really I just want to say thanks for being such a good friend! I wish my brother had someone like you in his life. And honestly, sometimes just being around each other is all that matters.", "Bone popping? I (21M) am possibly looking at a diagnosis of a late-onset muscle disease to explain my symptoms. Mainly because my little sister (17F) is going through the diagnosis right now and has definite mutations in genes that relate to connective tissue and muscle production. She has horrible muscle spasms.\n\nAnyways, for the past 6 months or so I have been experiencing LOTS of random pops and cracks from just about every bone in my body. My elbows will pop sometimes just by gripping a door handle! Like this definitely seems beyond normal. Has anybody experienced something like this in the early stages of muscular conditions? I have been fairly scrawny my whole life but it is never limited my mobility/caused any pain until now. In addition my legs get tired very easy, I have been battling a chronic case of tendinitis for the past year, and I experience twitching muscles(no spasms yet fingers crossed). What do you guys think, any similar experiences? Or should I look more into a connective tissue disorder? the bone popping has been happening to me (18, dmd)mostly the hip joint and shoulder. I think since the last few months. i am not sure if this is common in distrophy eithern The bone popping yes, a bit more than normal but nothing crazy. But the recurrent tendinitis, always tired legs and scrawniness is basically me, although the tendinitis seems under control now after several years of self treatment (I am a physiotherapist). I am 34 now, got diagnosed with myotonic muscular dystrophy aged 27. Hopefully that is not the case with you. Best of luck! I am 19 now and was diagnosed about 2 years ago. For about 4 years I have always had knees popping, arms elbows fingers it is very weird. It does not really affect me or get any worse, but sometimes it does not crack correctly, although I would not even know how to explain that to anyone.\n\nI did not have a lot of mobility issues either until it progressed a lot, even now I can still walk and such. I think it is different for everyone, but If the weakness is in your thighs or biceps you might be looking at limb girdle\n\nTake it with a grain of salt, I have absolutely no medical experience whatsoever If you do not mind me asking, how would you rate your quality of breathing from 0%-100%? Absolutely normal but since I live a pretty sedentary lifestyle I will say like 92%. Why do you ask? Sounds like Elhers Danlos Exactly what I was going to say. ", "How can I best support my boyfriend as his disease progresses? He has Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. I have been with him for 2 years, and during that time his hands, feet, and ankles have become noticeably weaker. He can still walk and he can still use his hands, but there are a lot of things that he is starting to struggle with and it is making him kind of depressed. Things like he cannot stand on his toes, he has to use his non-dominant hand for certain tasks because his dominant hand is weaker, it is easy for him to lose his balance, and it is becoming more difficult for him to play his instrument. \n\n\nI love this guy so, so much. It kills me to see how much this is upsetting him. He is not sulking and I can tell he tries to have a positive attitude about it, but I am just frustrated because I have no idea how I can best support him. I always listen when he wants to talk about it, but I do not know what to say. All the words of comfort that pop into my head just do not seem appropriate. \u201cIt is going to get better\u201d - No it is not, it is probably going to get worse. \u201cYou are still independent\u201d - Well someday he might not be able to be completely independent, and I do not ever want to say anything that might imply that I would think less of him if he ends up in a wheelchair or needing help with some day-to-day tasks. \u201cYou could try to focus on your hobbies\u201d - That might not feel great to hear because someday he might not be able to play his instrument anymore if his hands get weak enough. \u201cI do not care if it gets worse, I want to spend the rest of my life with you\u201d - He already knows that, and he is very confident in our relationship. That does not really have anything to do with the things that are bothering him, so me saying it will not do anything to help him feel better. \n\n\nI would really appreciate some advice about how I can be the best girlfriend possible for him. And please let me know if anything I have said comes across as ableist. This is the first time in my life that I have ever been so close to someone with a progressive physical disability, and I am really trying to do my best. If this post is offensive at all I will take it down immediately. It is not offensive at all. I am glad he feels secure in your relationship, because that would be my biggest concern in his shoes. I think maybe brainstorm some activities you can do together that are more cerebral in nature so he does not have to worry losing them. For me, my feelings about MD kind of ebb and flow. Having some down moments is pretty normal and sometimes you just have to lean in and wait for it to pass. You sound like a good girlfriend. I am sure it is hard for you too. Like Julieta said it is good he feels secure in your relationship, feel down and having bad days is going to happen with anyone with any disease it is just about how you deal with it. Doing things together and just enjoying things in general. I feel the exact same as him sometimes and I can relate to a lot of the issues you have said, But there is plenty of things anyone can do no matter the condition. Just take one day at a time and enjoy things you guys do no point in looking at things that aint happened yet. Sorry if this is not the answer you was looking for :) *\"Kind words, kind looks, kind acts, and warm hand-shakes, - these are means of grace when men in trouble are fighting their unseen battles.\"* -John Hall It sounds as though you are already doing it really well! The fact you are thinking about him to this degree, and about how to support him going forward is already helping him so much, possibly more than you realize. \n\nI have got Becker's MD so I am in a similar boat to your boyfriend in terms of symptoms and progression, and it is hard to feel your physical faculties slip away (for example, only yesterday my leg folded under me when I stepped off a steep step in the park, and I needed help to actually stand up again) and there is nothing specific someone could say to really help with that, but you just being around and being willing to listen if he needs to sometimes get upset about it is doing plenty and he definitely appreciates it I am sure.\n\nPersonally I would suggest just keeping things as normal as possible and to focus on all the good bits in your lives, keeping the disease on the backburner as much as possible. I have CMT, was diagnosed at 27, I am 39 now. It has ended two long term relationships I have been in; one because I have decided not to bear biological children and risk passing this genetic disease down, and once because my partner decided being with a chronically ill person was too daunting. While the end of both relationships were hurtful, I do not blame either of them.\n\nYou are doing everything right. As someone with CMT, my biggest fears are loss of independence, and feeling like a burden - yes, I know logically that my loved ones do not see me as a burden, but that does not stop my heart from feeling that way, especially when I require help with basic things \u201cnormal\u201d people can easily do. Just try to make sure through word and action you let him know he is loved, and never a burden, and that you do not see him as less-than. xoxo\n\nPs. If you have Facebook there are some really great cmt groups, for both people that have cmt, and people that love people that have CMT. September is CMT Awareness month after all. :) Do you have any recommendations for activities? We play video games and Magic the Gathering together, but aside from that I cannot really think of much I will definitely look into those Facebook groups, thank you! Luckily we both agree that we do not want kids, so we are on the same page there. Please forgive me if this is too personal, but what made CMT too daunting for your ex-partner? I feel like I have a decent idea of what I should expect as he gets older, but none of that seems like it would be a dealbreaker for me. If you are not comfortable talking about it too much that is totally fine though, no pressure &lt;3 That is hard because everyone has different interests.  Since I was diagnosed, I have started photography and learned Italian.  Book club? Take a free class together? My teenage son has cmt.  My little one has a MD variant too.  Never thought about them having to make the decision you made.  The progression seems so far off for me, but I guess it is not.  Be well brother. If they are anything like me, when they get older their neurologist will likely refer them to see someone called a \u201cgenetic counselor\u201d. Sounds like some kind of wacky sci-fi job description but they calculate the likelihood of the CMT gene being passed on to biological children, and offer guidance and answer any questions you all might have.\n\nThere is so much hope though! Even in the decade since my diagnosis science has come so far with CRISPR technology, I would not be at all surprised if by the time your babies are thinking about having babies, genetic modification of fetuses will be a thing so no children grow up with inherited diseases anymore.", "a cats favourite place...

What sort of tests are they doing on your child to finally find a cause? Is it due to not walking? I am just so worried and wish someone could give me answers already :( she had a test done that they said was leaning towards a possible dystrophy or bone disease and she will be having an emg soon I was not officially diagnosed with LGMD until I was 13 or 14 I think. It came as no surprise really because my father and his entire family, except his dad, had it as well. \n\nThe LDMG did not start affecting me until I was around 16 really and by the time I was 18 I could not run anymore. From my understand, just watching all my aunts and uncles and cousins who have it. It affects us all sooooo differently. \n\nIf I remember right, we went to and got blood work done on us to determine if we had it or not. I do not remember it exactly because it was so long ago. \n\nI am sorry about your daughter, and I know how you must be feeling too. Try and stay positive - you never know how the future will hold for a cure! \n\nMuch love. Have them cut to the chase and and do a neuromuscular genetic panel. I was not diagnosed until age 5 because my symptoms were so mild, and were attributed to me being clumsy, before then that my parents had no reason to seek help. It was not until my kindergarten teacher mentioned seeing some problems that my mom took me to the doctor. It was a quick diagnosis but what took so long was acknowledging there is a problem.", "7 month old has muscular dystrophy and I do not know what limits to draw with my family\u2019s regular activities Obviously only being 7 months old, we do not really know much about her specifics yet, only that her signs, combined with her lab results were enough for the doctors to tell us it is for sure MD or a mitochondrial disorder (our specific tests are a year out). They have told us that so far it does not appear to be effecting her cognitive growth/abilities and that she looks on track to be able to walk at some point and not be wheelchair bound but of course that is impossible to fully know this early on. \n\nWith all of that aside, my main question is what my wife and I should be doing while we await further results? She recently got sick with a regular virus, but with her immune system being weaker, it was enough to need an ER visit due to breathing difficulties. This made us wonder what we should be avoiding. We also have an almost 2 year old, which adds a layer of concern, because she wants to be playing with friends and cousins and whatnot, but if she brought home an illness, it could be severe for her sister. Especially with winter months approaching and holiday gatherings, we felt that we should seek some advice on how others have navigated this sort of stuff. \n\nI know the MD spectrum is broad, so some people had to take more intense interventions, but in general, what are some universal tips that helped you feel more confident early on in your diagnosis? Did you still let your other kids have regular play dates? What boundaries did you set with family? Did you take a more hands off approach? Anything helps! Hugs to you. I do not know of any kind in particular that weakens the immune system. Some medication can, but that is secondary and known. \n\nMy advice is let her grow and experience life as normal, leaving room to be patient in areas that seem harder for her. \n\nMy mom was told that I might not live to see my teenage years. I was diagnosed at age 2.  This was decades ago. I laugh at the thought. I am happily married with a family. I do use a wheelchair full time now but that is a recent thing. Everyone will be different. \n\nI hope this community can help you feel supported. Please update us when you know an official diagnosis also!\n\nEdit: changed \u201cdismissed\u201d to \u201cdiagnosed\u201d I agree with Jolinar. I think letting your daughter experience growing up like other kids is very important. I was not diagnosed until 3, but I do not think my parents were concerned about shielding me from the world. \n\nI know it is scary seeing your child sick, but I do not think keeping her socially isolated is a fair trade. Babies and kids need to develop their immune systems, which they do so by interacting with others, playing outside, and just existing. \n\nI will say, you can ask family members and friends who come over to wash their hands upon arriving, coughing or sneezing in an elbow or tissue, not coming if they are sick, etc. When your daughter is older, you can instill in her good hygiene practices.\n\nOne of the tragedies of parenthood, I would imagine, is that you can shield your child from the world, but you cannot shield the world from her.\n\nGood luck.", "Could anti-fibrotic drugs aimed at reversing fibrosis in MD be effective at treating post-injury fibrosis? So I have been trying to research and understand more about this topic. In most Muscular Dystrophies, fibrosis is the main cause of most of the issues related to and eventually leading to the death of patients. To my knowledge there is no difference between the fibrosis from disease or injury as it both involves the deposition of ECM. This makes it possible for anti-fibrotic drugs developed to help these patients also benefit non-diseased individuals. I know of quite a few drugs being developed showing promise in pre-clinical studies and am interested to see which other types of condition they will be applicable to. Is this a readonable assumption to make or is it far-fetched? Upvoted  There is a trial going on currently for a drug called Givinostat which is an anti-inflammatory.  The idea is that if you reduce the inflammation associated with muscle damage, you reduce the fibrosis, which gives the muscles a chance to heal. Yes that is interesting. I think there are quite a few things that aim at reducing the fibrosis before it happens however, the idea of trying to reduce pre-existing fibrosis is the challenging part and which I think is the most important because many older patients need this kind of treatment, as well as people who suffer from post-injury fibrosis.", "How do we have any muscle at all?  I think it is a bit like baking; if you bake cake and miss one of the ingredients (like baking soda) it will still be *cake-like* once completed. \n\nMuscles are a great deal more complicated in their recipes, ingredients, baking times, etc - but there are similarities. If the necessary genetic ingredients are missing the body attempts to substitute or make a work-around, and these lead to failure at some point. \n\nAlso, those scientific folks are still learning so much about the body and it is workings! I think that our muscles grow and develop based off our genes. Its about how much muscle fibers we are stacked on with. We all have muscles, but due to an error we dont have as much muscles as another person would have it. \n\nHOWEVER, their has been some promising tests that can change muscular dystrophy in all its entirety.

I work until 4pm Central.", "FSH I attended the muscle clinic the other day and was told I do not have fibromyalgia it is all FSH. \nI am weaker than I was six months ago  and despite trying to be positive and focus on what I can do there have been so some very low days. I am trying to accept it.  \nI have a mobility scooter ordered which will give me freedom, I do drive but find once I have reached my destination I do not have the energy or strength to walk round! \nI am going swimming and my physio is sending me some exercise to do in the pool. \nDoes anyone have any tips for coping with fatigue?? How do you pace yourself? I seem to get very tired very quickly  If you have just started swimming, I think it will help with your fatigue if you give it some time.\n\nI read somewhere when I was first diagnosed that the best way to maintain walking endurance was to walk, so maybe incorporate some short walks into your routine.\n\nSince you mentioned fibromyalgia, you should ask your physio about some stretches for the sore areas if you have not already. The weak muscles tend to get stiff (( and cause some pain.\n\nAlso ( has some good info available on their website. the dr said I should never have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, all my symptoms are FSH. I am trying to keep walking, I can manage very short distances. \nI feel good when I have been swimming but think I do too much because I am exhausted after.  Maybe get a ride to the pool? \n\nMy whole life is about pacing and not expecting too much out of my body. And it is frustrating to have to struggle with the most menial tasks, but swimming (though exhausting) is the best way to keep myself in motion. I feel especially lucky because I attend an aqua-mobility class (modified led exercise) in a warm pool (32\u00baC - 34\u00baC) which seems to relieve my body during the workout, and certainly is lovely to float in.\n\nOn pool days I minimize my activity: I drive to class in the morning, (I avoid eating, but do not suggest it) I arrive with my suit on under my clothes (no undressing and then dressing again), during the class I do modified exercises (in the beginning I would take a lot of rests, now I just slow down to a snail's pace if it is a bad day), after class I float and relax until the lifeguard kicks me out, I get dressed in the easiest outfit to go home in, and drive home with no other plans for the day. Other than making myself some meals, I give myself the freedom to not schedule anything else for that day. And, I do not ever do it the next day, always at least day in between.\n\nSome days I feel so good and find myself bouncing around - I try to remind myself then to slow down to avoid future fatigue. Some days are just a slog, but getting to float at the end is a big payoff for me. Pacing is an art that can always be improved upon. What are your symptoms if u do not mind me asking?  Pain everywhere, fatigue, weakness in hips, arms, wrists and legs, shoulder blade winging, difficulties when walking ie loss of strength and balance, my feet do not lift properly so I trip and fall.  Any muscle twitching? How were your CK protein levels? Thank you.  Also, have you noticed your forearms getting smaller at all?  And finally,  does your back hurt?  I wear my swim stuff under my clothes, plan nothing else for the day and go home in easy to wear clothes. Floating is nice and relaxing. I think I have been struggling with doing to much in the water, easy to do I guess. Last session I did loads less and felt a little better Being able to move freely in the water can make one forget that they need to slow down - and it is the thing I have to work at most to control, myself! \n\nPain is the not-so-gentle reminder that kicks in later when that joy dissipates, I find I am constantly having to remind myself when I am 'up' to back off. You will find your happy medium :) Yes I get muscle twitching and cramps. Have not had my CK protein levels checked Yes the muscles either side of my spine spasm and cause me a lot if pain, I also get pain at the base of my spine Yup :( Ugh. Sorry internet stranger. CRISPR is looking really, really promising. Hang in there. Better days are coming. \n Interesting. Muscle twitching apparently does not show as a symptom in the things that I have read. Is it common, from your knowledge? Is the pain at the base of your spine more focused on one side or is it for both sides equally? :) Yeah, twitching, spasms and cramps are all things we seem to get. I have learned more from talking to others with FSH. The professionals are still learning about it. Until 10-15 yrs ago (I think) they did not know about type 2. Took my mum 30 yrs to get a diagnosis! Changeable  What about neck pain? Does it feel like your neck muscles are weak or something?  i get a lot of neck pain, my shoulders hurt too, My mum has difficulty holding her head up, she has to wear a neck brace. I am not that bad, my muscles are affected because I choke on food sometimes. \n", "Help. Dozens of tests and no answers. ", "Do you ask strangers for help? I am getting to the point where I need help from strangers for things like opening doors and taking my scooter out of my car. It hurts my pride a little bit because I used to be so independent, but I guess that is how it is got to be. On the plus side I live in the southern u.s., so people here are pretty helpful and friendly. I do not have personal experience with this but I encourage you to ask for help when you need it. My son has MD but is still young.  I am glad you have had good experiences so far with strangers willing to help. People have seen me need help a few times and have stepped in. I do not mind, unless it is a creepy man trying to touch me. People like to feel like they have done a good deed Try to see the role in reverse. If you were still fully able bodied, would you see someone as inferior for needing your assistance? If the answer is no, then in all likelihood others feel the same way about you when you ask so there is no need to feel embarrassed. \n\nI understand losing elements of independence will be ego denting for most but it absolutely does not make you any less of a person. Many people will see someone struggle but will fear offering in case of offending. But when they feel free to, most humans will actually get a feel good factor from helping someone, no matter how trivial the task. So while you probably worry about taking time out of their day, if anything you are probably helping them feel a bit better about themselves that they were able to assist someone in some small way.  :) Thank you. I am trying to forget about my ego because you made me realize that asking for help improves my quality of life. \ud83d\udc9c I had to ask a stranger for help recently pumping gas  I had to help my wife with her car and she drove straight home, and I had not realized how hard some of the new pumps are too operate.\n\nI asked a lady at the next pump and she helped. Was a pleasant interaction. I will not plan on pumping gas at that station again though, if I am by myself. Dude, I would say that you are much better off than me because I cannot even go to the bathroom or sit on my own. And I am only 17 years old. I have to ask for help from strangers as I do not have any other option. But I have a great family as well, so my life is not that difficult. I just want to tell you to not to lose hope. \u2665\ufe0f", "Capricor Therapeutics To Present Final HOPE-2 Trial CAP-1002 Data for Late-Stage Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) ", "My son was just diagnosed with DMD Today my wife and I got the results back from our son's genetics test and learned that our 5 year old son has DMD.  He is the most loving and happy child and it is breaking my heart right now. It has already been a tough year after my dad was diagnosed with dementia and now it is 1000x tougher. I am reaching out here for support and information. What should I expect? What can I do? Huge hugs for you. I have so much to say but do not want to overwhelm you. The medical care is so advanced and expectancy for every aspect of life is getting longer and longer. \n\nFind a neurologist that you really like and is knowledgeable with DMD. I have not had the best experience with the MDA clinics that I have been to, but you may have better luck. \n\nFor yourself, talk with your PCP about his diagnosis to monitor you for any symptoms as a carrier. \n\nYou are in my prayers. I am sorry to hear that. My five year old son was just diagnosed earlier this year as well. It sucks to say the least. My wife and I are trying to navigate this as we speak. PPMD has been helpful. Keep communication open with your support group. I would be lying if I said that makes it better but it makes it suck a little less. \n\nIf you have questions I would be happy to share what we are learning and planning for. Not going to give you a pep talk, anything about prayers, or even a \"you got this bro\", but what I will say is whatever happens just be there. I was diagnosed at 3, different type of muscular dystrophy. Mom described to me when they got the diagnosis from the doctor that my father turned his back that day. That was 33 years ago. It did not matter what form of support that I needed, or just the attention that a son gets from his father. It was not there, in any capacity. There is just something about certain grown men who cannot acknowledge or confront the side of them that things are not going to turn out exactly the way that they had expected. Expectations are dreams though, some people can get exactly what they want because they make it look that way, but then there is the rest of us living on earth that want to work for those things. I would get visits in the hospital, acknowledgement when I got home from school, graduated college, or even moved out on my own. There was never any interest or concern about how things were getting done, I guess it was good enough that it looked like they were getting done and he did not have to have his heart broken when things did not appear the way he expected. Luckily I filled that gap he created with mentors, friends and my wife...but I can honestly say that the part of growing up and not having the relationship with the person has left a missing piece my entire life. It may be for the better now, but it is not what I want. That close relationship that you are supposed to have whether it is playing catch, going fishing, whatever it is, it is not that we could not find something in common to bond over, it is that he did not want to. So I hope that is not something you will ever let it happen. He is going to have challenges, do not make yourself one of them. The best thing you can do in any relationship is just be there, regardless of what is going on. Being a parent to a child with a disability might appear more difficult right now, but you are just on the outside looking in. The first day of school, going to college, living away from home, and growing old as a family might appear different right now. But I assure you it will not be, unless you are not there. Thank you for this. I have a 13 year old son with duchenne and he is the happiest kid I know.  PPMD ( parent project muscular dystrophy ) is an excellent place for resources. Definitely try to find a good neurologist if possible. We live in Georgia and travel to Ohio for clinic. They have a certified care center for duchenne and are kind of at the center of a lot of the research going on right now. We see Dr. Mendell if you happen to be able to go there. They have several around the country though. I personally despise Facebook and deleted it entirely but then got back on it to connect with groups and individuals connected by Dmd. I am not even connected with family. Depending on if you are up to it emotionally. I did not connect with people for a few years for fears of seeing the future.  But there is not just 1 future. Medicine for duchenne is changing rapidly. You may just find support through friends online that no one else nearer to you can give. They will understand like no one else. It has been a great help for me.  I was so afraid that my son would be unhappy in life. Sad or depressed due to his condition. This has not been our case. He is happy as can be. He uses a wheelchair full time and his life is very challenging but his joy is still ever present.  Take it slowly and give yourself time to grieve. It changes everything in your life. Indefinitely. But it has become our new normal and our little family is basically pretty happy and \u201cnormal\u201d whatever that even is.  Take care of yourself too and love that little boy with everything you have.  Just to say that,  after our sons diagnosis, I ended up having to spend some time in a mental health facility for thoughts of self harm. I no longer felt connected to my son. It was like he was a different child all together. A stranger to me.  It was a very dark time. EVERYTHING was overwhelming. But it changes. You are in the hardest part right now so be kind to yourself and seek out any help you feel you need. The days will get brighter. I am so sorry for what you are going through right now. Glad to hear your boy is as happy as can be, that is all I have wanted for my son. Our neurologist is having us go to a cardiologist and to see some specialists at the Shriners hospital here in Tampa and they are supposed to be great, but I will find out soon. I do not, at this moment, feel less connected to him but only more protective but worried with a lot of anxiety.\n\nSince my father is dealing with his own issues (dementia) my uncle has been someone I have been talking to since my sons original appointment with the neurologist. His youngest son, my cousin, passed due to MS complications and he has been helping me quite a bit. He is actually coming down from NC in August to spend some time with us. Firstly, my heart goes out to you. This is possibly the worst thing that can happen to a parent and of course the child as well. \n\nIf you are located in the usa then reach out to ppmd. Pat, the ceo is a saint and she had 2 children who had dmd many years ago that have since passed. She and her team can help you navigate this new hellish reality. You will need help so reach out to her as well as the many other organizations that deal with dmd.\n\nChances are that there are some families in your area with dmd. Find them through ppmd or Facebook and link up with them. Build your community around this new reality.\n\nThe good news is that there are many drugs that are being tested now and the cure is probably something we will see in our life time. I know that this is not going to calm or console you but something to try and store in the back of your mind. \nFeel free to message me and I will try and connect you with local assets that can be helpful. \n\nStay strong. I second this. Dr Mendell is the best you can find in the duchenne world. If you can access him then do so. Not only a brilliant dr that had been involved in duchenne for decades but he is also a grandfather and has a heart. Father of two with DMD (12 &amp; 15).  Happy to answer any questions you have.  I think most  things have been touched on already (like PPMD being a great resource).\n\nA few things I will mention though:\n\n* Take some time to understand the diagnosis, what the accepted care standards are, etc.  You do not need to rush into treatment and trials.  Yes, starting treatment earlier is more beneficial, but we are talking months maybe even a year or two rather than days.  Take things at your pace.\n* Your future outlook will change from what you would envisioned to what your coming to terms with.  That is okay, you do not need to rush into any other decisions right now.  We made the mistake of moving shortly after the diagnosis, and we should not have.  It was not terrible, but it was not beneficial and it was more of a gut reaction than a properly planned thing.\n* It is okay for you to come first sometimes, the same is true for your wife.  Without getting into gender stereotypes, women, in my experience, are more prone to not doing enough self care, but its important for both parents.  Take time to do things you like.  Kids, especially those with complex health needs require more of our time and attention, but its important for you to find happiness in your life too.  Keep up with hobbies and friends.  The disease should not be the focal point of your every day life.\n* As with the above, take time for your marriage.  Make sure you and your wife are still doing the things that brought you together as a couple.  From what I have seen, divorce rates seem higher than average in these situations.  Communication is key.  Consider therapy, even if you do not feel like you need it, coming to terms with this diagnosis is not easy. Same here, with my son, back in January. I know how you feel. Welcome to the family no one wants to join. I am so sorry about your son\u2019s diagnosis. Take time to process this information and grieve, but know that this is not the end for your son and that we are here for you.\n\nDuchenne is hard, but we have come a long way since my DMD diagnosis at 3. I am now 25 and have lived a great life so far. I graduated from college, have a job, and plan to pursue living on my own soon (with aides). I have been able to do many things I wanted to in life, also including becoming an Eagle Scout, going to close to 100 concerts, going to Alaska, etc. If I have learned anything, it is that you have to take this disease one day at a time, celebrate the life we have, and do not forget to have fun. DMD is not my entire life and it will not be your son\u2019s entire life either.\n\nMany have already commented, but Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD) is a fantastic organization that can provide resources and information on what to do. They were a lifeline for my parents after I was diagnosed. They can help you get connected with doctors who are Duchenne experts and Certified Duchenne Care Centers, as well as clinical trials, if you were so inclined. I personally have been in one since I was 10 years-old.\n\nOne more thing. Corticosteroids are currently the standard of care for people with DMD, because they are anti-inflammatory drugs that help delay progression. I have been taking them since I was 6. Corticosteroids have significant side effects. However, a different type of steroid, vamoralone, is being studied as an alternative because there are far fewer side effects. I would ask your son\u2019s neurologist (preferably a DMD specialist) about vamorolone when they bring up steroids. I am hopeful that this will be an approved treatment soon.\n\nGood luck with everything. We are here for you and your son. Happy to answer any questions as well. Ugh I was where you were 4 months ago with my 6 year old and then a month ago I found out my 3 year old has it too. You are at the worst part right now, stay off google nothing good will come of it. Join those Facebook groups like duchenne and duchenne under 10. I have found there are many others just like us and all of them are willing to give advice and help with any questions. Take it easy on yourself right now, do what you can to calm yourself. As the others said PPMD is a lifesaver they will put you in contact with others with DMD in your area. Jett foundation is another good one. Just remember there is hope for our boys treatment is changing rapidly. Learn all you can about the medical research, there is some amazing work being done.

Apart from some joint weakness (like rolling my ankles all the time as a kid and some weakness in my knees when standing from a crouch) I have not noticed many symptoms in myself. \n\nHowever, recently I have been considering getting tested as I see my dad being affected more and more as he ages. My family does not communicate about it much and do not like the idea of me getting the tests done, as in their eyes there is nothing you can do to stop the progression anyway. I tend to disagree with that and think there are lifestyle changes I could make early that would help. \n\nWhat do you think? Was there a distinct benefit to getting a confirmed diagnosis? And does anyone have helpful information about Bethlam Myopathy? I have not been able to find much... My wife has Collagen VI CMD (Bethlem is on the spectrum). Here is a useful link for you. \n\nGetting genetically confirmed will be critical to participating in future clinical trials if that is of interest to you. Thank you for sharing, that really helps! The Penicillin wiki page states, \"*Alexander Fleming, who is credited with discovering penicillin in 1928.*\"  However, it was not until WWII, when its need became pronounced, that it was afforded attention.  Thirty years later the antibiotic industry was well seeded.  Now, thankfully, it is a robust global market. In the 1960s a Cancer diagnosis was a terminal declaration. Now, it is not.  Where an individual scientist, Fleming, conducted the research leading to the creation of the antibiotic literally revolutionizing the way infections are treated.  Now research departments are common.\n\nIn time advancements will be made in the understanding of Muscular Dystrophy and it too will become an addressed and corrected medical condition.\n\nIndividuals sharing their experiences will help bring that day closer.", "I do not know which type of MD I have. Should I? I was diagnosed around a year ago. Apparently, all my doctor told my parents was that I have a mild to moderate version of MD. At the time I could barely walk and was severely depressed, so I did not care enough to ask. Now, with physiotherapy I can walk a decent amount of distance before getting winded. I found out recently that it will get worse as time goes by. Should I try to find out which type I am? More importantly, how should I go about accomplishing that?", "I have type fshd. I just wanted to ask what are some of the experiences that you have had as far as having to deal with other people and their rude comments? I guess I just want to feel less alone. I am sorry to bring up such a sensitive subject but I deal with it on a daily basis because I live in such a large city and I use public transportation quite often and I do not always use my scooter if it is going to be a short trip and I have had to deal with the stares and the insensitive comments.\n\nSome of the worst have been, freak keep it in the circus, why are you walking like that, are you drunk? And this has been asked of Me by police officers who have basic medical training and should be able to tell the difference between an intoxicated person and somebody with a disability. I just want to know what kind of things do you deal with to see if it is common. Again I am sorry to bring up such a sensitive subject. Not me, but my husband has had his fair share of horrid comments. Some of the more memorable:\n\n\u201cYou are so skinny you look like a holocaust victim.\u201d\n\u201cSkeleton man!\u201d\n\u201cJesus CHRIST, would you look at that.\u201d\n\u201cWhatsamatter, do not know how to eat? (Loud laughter.)\u201d Similarly, \u201cTell your wife to feed you more!\u201d \n\u201cARE YOU OKAYYY? ARE YOU IN PAIN?!? YOU NEED JESUS TO HEAL YOU!\u201d\n\u201cHello sir, may I interest you in Doterra oils/whateverthehell health shit I am selling? You look like you could sure use it!\u201d\n\n\nThen there is the white knight dogooders who try to use my husband as a prop to make them look better. Usually a guy, dramatically swooping in and loudly yelling \u201clet me help you, bro!\u201d Usually \u201chelps\u201d despite us not needing any assistance, as the girl he is trying to impress watches fawningly. No, I am not bashing actual helpful people...we have dealt with both often enough to tell the difference. I feel for you guys having had that experience. I have had some of the same type of stuff said to me like you need to eat more, I am not going to watch you waste away and intentionally kill yourself. Also I have had people automatically assume that I am mentally slow just because I have a physical disability. Not that I am saying anything bad about people who are mentally slow I am just saying I wish that people would stop automatically assuming that. Also I have had people tell me I look like a skeleton and my personal favorite, not is you need Jesus to heal you. I understand that God is the great physician but I wish people would stop implying that it will just miraculously go away. I have also had people tell me I need to exercise more and that it will help. I have tried to no avail to explain to them that no amount of exercise is going to help because my muscles are weakening because my immune system is attacking them. Oh I just remembered the worst one. I explained to my ex what it was and how I had a compromised immune system and he actually asked me, I shit you not, so do you have something like AIDS? I got super pissed and I was like no! Just because I have a weakened immune system does not mean I have a communicable disease. I really shook my head on that one. But yeah I know what you mean about people fake helping. My mom also has it and her one supposed friend in particular Jackie will follow us around the store and around her house under the guise of trying to help us but at the same time we will be saying stuff like oh I wish I could afford what you are getting as in hint hint buy me something. It just makes me want to tell her to back the fuck up and leave us alone. I just thought of something funny about it though. The thing is I have muscular dystrophy but I am also goth and people have always said I am funny so I wanted to do a stand-up bit at open mic night at the bar and I just thought of a funny joke. I have seen other comedians who were also disabled and so I thought about the joke of okay I have muscular dystrophy which is an obvious disorder but I am also goth which means like freaky makeup and clothing so I never know which one I am being stared at for LOL. I would like to say it is a little bit of both LOL. At least that way I can find some humor in the situation. Duuude I am a goth too!!!!! LMAO this is hilarious! When my husband and I go out we joke that the people cannot chose which \u201cfreak\u201d to stare at! If you did a comedy routine on that I would watch it.\n\nOn a more serious note I am sorry you have to listen to idiots making idiotic assumptions.  Thanks. I think I am going to tweak it a little bit and say I would like to think that people are staring at me because I look so awesome but I am not sure which reason they are staring at me for LOL. I have had my fair share of comments. I run very hot and tend to wear shorts a lot, or used. I no longer do due to people saying things, and even had co workers thinking I had an eating disorder. \n\nUsually I try to laugh it off, but a couple weeks ago in a bar I had a guy come up to me in the next urinal trying to tell me my slumped shoulders were a sign I was not confident in myself and I should just stand up right and stop hating myself. I slightly lost it on that guy.  Wow I do not blame you. I get tired of people calling me lazy and saying that if I would just exercise more it would improve. I swear I am about ready to make flyers and pass them out explaining what it is and that it is not going to get better, only worse. This is a weird one I get a lot. I grew up exercising and I did not actually have any real symptoms until I was 25ish. When I was 24 I was running triathlons. I am still pretty active but I have to work around my limitations. There is no real heavy lifting and I ride my bike to work. I absolutely hate walking, but love to go hike. But when I hike there will be at least one time I trip and fall per 3 miles, so I do not do it much anymore. \n\nBecause I ride a bike to work and still pretty active, even my wife, forgets that I am slow and limp and have pains or exhaustion that comes out of nowhere. It becomes more difficult to explain to people that just doing some calf raises will change everything. Honestly the most tiring part of MD is having to explain to people MD. No lavender oil, more veggies, hitting the gym, and building a vision board wont fix it.  Exactly. Sometimes I forget I have it until I have people asking me what is wrong with me and why I walk the way I do. Then it reminds me that it is obvious. It is tiring having to explain it to so many people and having to explain to them that all their healing stuff is not going to help. Then they treat you like you are just lazy. I have gotten to where I try to ignore ignorant people but some days it is hard. My mom has it too and sometimes we will catch people staring at us like in Walmart and one time she actually stood up to a guy and said hey, we have a medical condition. Do not stare. Why do not you take a picture, it will last longer. I understand she was just frustrated. I just look at it as another card that I was dealt in life and I try to live as normally as I can but I have accepted my limitations although it is depressing because I am only 35 and sometimes I feel like I am trapped in the body of a much older person. But that is cool that you can still ride your bike and everything. I never learned how honestly because my balance was just too off. I thought about buying one of those 3-wheel bikes with the basket on it because I live a mile from the grocery store and the bus stop and everything without a car so I think it would be a good thing for me to have and plus the exercise could not hurt. But thank you for your comment. I just wanted to see what other people have to deal with on a daily basis so maybe I would feel less alone. Have a good day. My Mom also has it, thanks mom, she uses a tricycle to get around on nice short days. I think the only reason I am able to ride a bike is because I spent 5-25 riding pretty aggressively. People are rude about stuff they do not understand or that is not normal to them. It is tough to try to laugh it off, and sometimes overwhelmingly frustrating. Trust me you are not alone in that one.  Those officers need to hear from their bosses about your complaint. Lol. \n\n&amp;#x200B; Why do people wear goth style, beyond the aesthetic appeal? \\&gt; No lavender oil, more veggies, hitting the gym, and building a vision board wont fix it. \n\nPeople are so ignorant of health and science. It is scary. Biking was one of the ways I could move without discomfort. I could move fast, be elegant even. Biking and swimming! That is kind of hard to answer. I just like it. Yeah they do it to me all the time. I live down south in a city that is run by Republicans. They hate anything they see as abnormal. We got trolled hard down here by the police and pretty much everyone. Yeah I know that it is natural for people to stare at things that they are not used to. Things that are out of the ordinary but I mean come on. The police should be able to tell the difference between a drunk person and somebody who has a medical condition SMH. That culture is pathetic. Offense meant.  What makes it a lifestyle? Wow I did not know it was gang up on people day. I know this is may be hard for you to grasp but you can read something on the Internet that you disagree with and move on with your fucking life asshole. You are standing up for a culture that mocks and harasses people with disability. I do mean offense to people who take part in and like that culture. That is a shitty way to treat humans. My culture is trash.  Hiya I also have FSHD, I have dreadlocks and wear black a lot or band t-shirts, I am into thrash metal. So i get the odd look sometimes but I am ok with it. People do not expect to see someone with piercings and dreadlocks in a mobility scooter- good, I like to challenge stereo types :) \nAnyway just wanted to let you know you are not alone, there are a few of is out there :)  Awesome! You should check out this band osiah. They are awesome. I am just warning you that if you have a good system it is loud. I would turn it down a little bit until you get assimilated with it or it may shock you. Louder the better imo  Then you will like them Any particular track/album? I recommend perennial Agony, dethronement of God's featuring King gaz of Nexilva, humanimals and blood soaked meadows I have heard them before, thought the name sounded familiar! They are good :) have you been to any of their gigs?  No and it is definitely on my bucket list I have never heard someone that can get there metal scream to sound like that and someone who can get their voice that deep. It is awesome.

I am over 40 and still do not always know my limits.\n\nOne thing to worry about when doing regular workouts (which I learned the hard way) is kidney problems.  A muscle-building regime breaks down muscle tissue to build it up stronger than before but Becker Muscular Dystrophy means your muscles wear down a lot faster.  Broken-down proteins get carried into the bloodstream and if there is too much at once it can overwhelm the kidneys.  Dark brown urine is a warning sign to watch out for. I have been trying to make sure that I do not overdo it but sometimes it is a bit hard to tell because the pain could just be because I am getting tired and not because I am overdoing it but I try to keep a weight which I know is lighter than what I could do to keep the reps high. \n\nThe urine colour has probably been the only thing I keep an eye out for to check for muscle waste since I have got BMD because my doctor said a coke like colour usually means muscle is being wasted and to get checked immediately if that happens.\n\nHopefully this pain is just normal pain which comes with working out and nothing serious.

Ive been reading and her type of MD is rare and maybe only 60 registered individuals with this, and it is a mix of LGMD and congenital MD. \n\nIs there any personal stories of individuals who were diagnosed so young and how they have dealt with it? Or any parents that relate? Or any website resources or local in person support groups or any online groups you can direct me to? \n\nThank you for your time I very much appreciate it. My daughter has a rare form of MD and was diagnosed at age 3. The first while can be so daunting as a parent because you research everything and it so scary and so lonely. There is a great support group on Facebook called MD moms. I have found so much support over there and highly recommend it as a way to connect with other parents going through similar situations. Thank you for this. I know, I think she is smart she is not wanting to look at anything and has been crying just thinking about it. I would thought I would do some research and filter things out for her. The more I keep reading more and it looks like everyone get hit with it differently so I am holding hope that things will not be so severe. It is all so very different. When we found out my daughter's diagnosis, I wanted to know her subtype so I could know what to expect. Turns out her subtype is so rare (only 5-6 cases in the states) that they do not know enough about it and I still did not get answers. My biggest piece of advice is to focus on your own kid and where they are at in that moment. Having MD will be the least interesting thing about them. Try to focus on the good. I really liked \u201cMD will be the least interesting thing about them\u201d in your comment. I really agree with that and hope people would say that about me. Sounds like you are doing a good job Definitely recommend parent groups through Facebook or elsewhere. Most questions and worries they have were experienced by other families. Leaning on and using those shared experiences can he incredibly helpful emotionally and practically they can be useful guides to find things that help with things. \n\n Would also caution self guided research because the landscape for a lot of muscular/myotonic dystrophies is changing so even something that is only two years old may be outdated. Assuming they are connected to or connecting to a specialty clinic I would recommend asking them directly or asking them for where to do their own research. \n\nIf they are not connected or connecting to a specialty clinic then that would be a good thing to look into. With that level of rarity it is unlikely there will be a specialist for that condition specifically but there are centers around the country (if US) where neuromuscular conditions are their specialty and take a multidisciplinary approach to care. Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy (PPMD) focuses of Duchenne and Becket but they have a map of PPMD certified care centers in the country and list the criteria. That could still be useful if they need to find a more comprehensive care center. \n\nFor resources in general I would recommend looking into the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) which may have a local chapter that hosts events and can connect them to other families. \n\nI am not familiar with that diagnosis specifically but depending on its impact it would be worth looking into what is called Waiver services or Medicaid Waiver (different names for the same thing). It varies by state but generally waiver services help pay for things. Parental income is not consider for eligibility and services make Medicaid come into play as a secondary insurance of it is not primary and usually offer things like funds to pay for in home aides, respite, equipment, home modifications, etc. \n\nWaiver services are often facilitated either through the state developmental disability services office or councils on aging. The names of the offices vary by state but those terms should be enough to Google and add the state name to find any state's version of it. \n\nConnecting to local developmental disability services could be useful in general as there may be local programs that the family could benefit from. Should note that developmental disabilities are not exclusively cognitive or intellectual although some states do \"gatekeep\" eligibility behind intellectual disabilities. Arizona I know does not consider muscular dystrophies as an eligible condition for services, but that is fortunately rare.", "Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (CMD): Current state of research  Quick find for each subtype:\n1.

Not the robotic one, but a spring controlled arm support", "Working as a dishwasher/cook or chef, yes or no? As well as my background. A bit of background, before I head to the main question. A bit of a long journey leading into this. (M 27)\n\nI have been diagnosed with BMD (Becker Muscular Dystrophy) in 2020. \n\nIt is all started with a high CK back ranging from 2018-2020 (cretin kinase) level whenever I take anti depressants or go to gym (I had to go to the ER for really high CK levels, up to 40,000 and potential kidney damage). Also had another round in the ER for mental health issues (and had a potential heart issues, which turned out to be nothing), but had to stay in hospital for a few days to get my mental health straightened up. \n\nMy GP (general practitioner for short) sent me to a private rheumatologist and my psych sent me to some sport science medicine place to try and figure things out, which none of them worked out. Then my GP sent a fax to the public hospital rheumatologist, then a few months later I gotten a call out of the blue from the neuromusclar department saying that should I come in. \n\nThen another few months later I went into the neuromusclar department of a major public hospital (I am from Sydney, Australia), and ordered heaps of blood tests, heart ultrasound, MRI on the brain and legs and other random test and told me to come back like 6 months later. \n\nBut then I got a call like a month later telling me to come in sooner and cancel all other random tests (I have done my blood test, heart ultrasound and MRI by then). When I went in a month later, I was diagnosed with BMD though blood tests, which I was quite shocked. They said they could not do anything much apart from seeing them yearly.\n\nIn 2021, I went to see the neuromusclar team as part of my yearly thing, and also I said to them that I had been suffering significant soreness in the chest (I should have went to the ER tbh). Then they done the usual tests as well as to measure my blood pressure. My blood pressure was quite high so they gave me some meds to control the blood pressure and chest pains. Also done an heart MRI as well, which I have not gotten a response back, so I guess I am in the clear. \n\nBut then a few weeks ago, I gotten a phone call from the team, saying have you done your MRI or echodigram (heart ultrasound). I said I only done the heart MRI (they said they will chase up the MRI place) and I thought you can do 1 out of the 2 options, but then the team said I have to do both. That is on hold until covid restrictions go away, then I can do my heart ultrasound. \n\nAlso I have been suffering some serious mental health issues as well on top of all that which needs to be medicated as well. I have not been suffering too badly during the recent lockdowns. \n\nHere is the main question and the main topic. \n\nI work as a dishwasher, was planning to becoming a cook and eventually an higher up chef, but now that on hold since I have been suffering chest pains and high blood pressure (im on some blood pressure meds, its also control the chest pains as well). \n\nDo you guys think its suitable that I continue, or drop working in a physical job and find a more sedimentary (such as an office or IT) job? Or is there any other in between options? \n\nI did try an office job back when in my early 20's and I just could not cope with office stress. You seem to have been through the mill! Neuromuscular conditions often take a while to diagnose, sadly, which does not help with stress and mental health issues.\n\nAlthough my experience is primarily with DMD those people I have met with BMD tend to have issues with muscle strength and fatigue in due course, so I would tend to suggest more sedentary occupations if faced with the choice. Not all offices are stressful! That having been said, these conditions are highly variable, and you may manage well if your strength holds. Thanks.... \n\nI also been though the mill when I was younger as well..... with my eczema and also gotten a muscle biopsy, but they did not find anything out back then (its was late 90's)... Lucky when the hospital went though all my medical records, the stuff from my childhood was still there... despite it being a different network (I was treated in a different hospital when I was a kid). \n\nHmm, good point in terms of some office jobs not being as stressful.... I just have to find the right one.... I just do not want to exactly change careers later on down the track, and in some ways im actually struggling to stand up for long periods of time (and until my 2021 visit), i had some niggling chest pains whilst at work. \n\nMy plan is to study IT as soon I have the funds to do so, and hopefully get into an IT or data entry role. Even with DMD, which is much more rapidly apparent at an early age, from my work with a national DMD charity I am aware that diagnosis has frequently been documented to take a couple of years following the parents' first concerns. We were much more fortunate with my son's diagnosis. It definitely does. My brother had it and was not diagnosed until he was in like 1st or 2nd grade I believe. Hey, I have LGMD (23 y/o male) and have only ever worked in the restaurant industry. I went to culinary school after high school, then worked as a line cook in Manhattan. Eventually moved on to serving and bartending before taking a break when Covid hit. Recently, I started bartending on weekends again for money, but more so to stay active. I am not as familiar on BMD, because it is not what I have, but what I will say for me anyway is that working in a restaurant is getting harder by the day, BUT I am going to keep doing it until I truly feel I cannot anymore. The exercise is good for me, and it is a job I truly love. I am also a Food Journalist on the side, so that is what I will go full time into when my restaurant days are over. Like I said, I do not know your conditions as well as mine, but if you feel comfortable at work, enjoy doing it, and talked to your doctor about it, I think it is a great thing to do in the time being. It is hard work, and no one is stronger than us to push through our condition and do that work each day. If you have any more questions, specifically food industry related ones as it pertains to your condition, I am all ears and my DMs are open.\n\nEDIT: I want to add something I forgot that is really important in regards to work. If you do choose to continue this line of work, you must let your bosses at the very least know of your condition. For so long, I worked while keeping my condition a secret. As I got weaker, it got harder, but I was too embarrassed to come out about it. One day, I walked in and there were a load of boxes that had to be carried upstairs, and so I just pulled my boss aside and told him. Best work related decision i have ever made. He is understanding, he does not ask questions and let us me determine my limits. Since then, i have even began to open up to coworkers who are equally as kind about it. I used to feel like they all thought I was just lazy, and now that feeling is starting to fade although i would be lying if I said I still did not feel it from time to time. Let people know at work, especially those in charge\u2014 it will make it a much healthier environment for both your physical and mental health. I have decided to come up with a plan B, after speaking to my dad and he said to use the current lockdown (there a lockdown in where I live at the moment) to come up with a more sedimentary job option.... \n\nSo looks like I will not continue long term, but probs short or even medium term, depends on things go and I may consider telling my boss, if i decide to continue medium term. I do enjoy the work, but I am not hugely passionate with the career despite me studying for it. \n\nI spoken to both my GP and neuromusclar specialists in regards to this. This is what they have to say. \n\nGP: Work as long as you can, but do not work yourself till you cannot feel it anymore.\n\nSpecialists: Start having a plan B right away, hopefully by next year. \n\nSo the specialists seem a bit more blunt, but both are saying to find a plan B sooner rather than later. But as you pointed out the exercise is good... in which I agree. \n\nAlso some nights after I work, I am just soo sore where I have to take painkillers and drink copious amount of red bull before and during my shift (which is also against my specialist advice as well....), and i find myself drinking a can just to keep myself awake during the lockdown period... Sounds like a good plan. Honestly, if you are having to take painkillers, then it is probably too much on you. Stay healthy, and keep looking for that plan B.", "Types of Distal Muscular Dystrophy that start in the forearms? I am not sure what is going on with my forearms. For six weeks straight now, they are weak and painful when attempting lifting, carrying or holding something. I have maybe lost some 70% of my arm strength, and hand jars that need opening to my wife now (who used to hand them to me).\n\nSome background info: I am 50, male and have been strong enough my entire life. Once a month I do the Extended arm wrist curls ( and tendon gliding exercises ( (but with an extra 'e' step where I bend my wrist to the max and hold it there. I started doing that in 2002 feeling that some form of RSI would mean I would have t give up my keyboard-centric career. Luckily that is worked perfectly ever since. Including now (typing and mouse work is pain free). \n\nMy Genetics: So my \"23 and me\" has not highlighted any *known* genetic precondition to MD. It is not in my family either.  \n\nWhat I have read: I have read the notes for forms of distal MD (shortened to DD for some reason), and it seems that legs is where DD starts normally. That is not me as I have strong legs and have no pain there at all. Just my forearms. One form of DD starts in the index fingers. That is not me either. If felt like the tendons or main arteries themselves some 5 weeks ago. Now is us evenly spread over my forearms, and is maybe just starting in my triceps/biceps. \n\nI am in the UK presently, but flit to the US quite a bit (I have a green-card). I have access to both healthcare systems. I will pay for a consultation if I have to. \n\nWhat happens with GPs/primary care doctors when you go to them for you initial complaint. I know many progressive ailments like this come with a bunch of \"lets track this over the next year\" initial suggestions from GPs. I suspect too that MD does not have a \"reboot\" cure coming soon like MS has - ( - I know someone who is been essentially cured via this, though I sure that claim can start it is own arguments.\n\nBut anyway the **big question right now**, does anyone know of a presentation of MD that starts in the forearms as I describe?\n\n The only MD I know that starts in the arms or feet is Welander Myopathy, and that usually starts in the fingers or hands.\n\nGood luck. I hope it does not turn out to be MD at all. OK, so I would been eight months off my Testosterone treatment because of a big move. So I went back on it, AND renewed supplements including vitamin D, AND picked up on the two stretches above. Those last - formerly once a month, now every couple of days. I have also upped my electrolytes some. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings are greatly improved. I am not back to full strength, but it feels like the 70% loss of strength is not true, and that it is now 30% loss of strength I am facing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally with those four, I do not know which improved my symptoms. I do not even know whether I had a non-specific-virus (NSV) that has run its course and I am just in coincidence-land. I do not know whether things will improve further or not. I might try some mile exercise now the days are getting longer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is one measurable change. I have a backpack for my computer that I am fond of. If I put it on over an outer coat there is a marked difference. Taking it off three weeks ago was too painful without slipping out of the coat at the same time. Taking it off now can be done without taking my coat off. There is still mild pain in doing so, but I can easily mask the accompanying grimace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yes, I have not been to a doctor yet to talk about any of this. No discussion of a potential MD with any medical professional. I felt I should get back with prior prescription regimes before I do. How are you doing now?  When I read that you were having unexplained muscle weakness, I thought of ALS, which can start in the hands.  But if you are having improvement, I doubt it is ALS.  ALS is a one way street. OK, very small arm-pain improvements some 4 months later. I am more overweight than I was before and need to do something about that I guess. I have lost weight previously doing low-carb so could go back to that . I am more fatigued that I was before and take to take daytime naps on many days.

I am a 42 year old man that had no idea I had this. A lot of things now make sense like my cataracts, gall bladder issues, muscle stiffness and lessened hand strength and flexibility. I have an appointment tomorrow that I arranged through the MDA with a team of doctors and I was wondering if anyone had any idea on what I should expect and if there are any questions I should ask. Thanks in advance Interesting that you made it that far without discovering. Did you learn your DMD deletion? I am guessing it is a Becker deletion? Both of my sons have DMD, sort of a Becker/Duchenne hybrid, TBD as they grow. As far as questions to ask, I think you will have plenty as they explain your type of DMD. But you should ask about getting your heart tested because cardiomyopathy can be a silent complication. I have to get mine checked every 5 years because I am a female carrier. As for your upcoming baby, you will want to talk to a geneticist, but basically you cannot pass it on to your sons and all your daughters will be carriers who can pass it on to her children with 50-50 odds for each conception. Good luck to you and sorry for the diagnosis. Thanks for the reply. It is deletion 49-51. Not sure if anyone knows more about that or what it means but I am also thinking it is Beckers based on I have made it this far relatively symptom free. I do have plans to get some heart tests done as well. Yes, that is an in-frame deletion. Almost certainly Becker. I like PPMD as a resource (MDA is good too). Here is a ( that explains deletions. They have a lot of other great resources. Thanks again! Depending on how many doctors you are expecting to see, get ready to be overwhelmed with information and emotions. Comprehensive neuromuscular care can involve a LOT of disciplines. You will probably be following up with visits at least every year but do not hesitate to ask questions in between visits. You are going to need to be an advocate for your needs and your kid's needs. If you have burning questions, make a list to bring to the visit so you do not forget. \n\nIf you are open and ready to connect to other families for information or support, then I ditto Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy. They are probably the biggest grassroots community group in the DMD/BMD world in the US and they host conferences and other events. They also coordinate Connect Groups. Be wary of independent internet research overall, but PPMD tends to be a safe and more importantly up to date source for information. Reading something on DMD from even 5 years ago may already be a little out of date. \n\nLook into your state's department of disability services and think about applying for services. In particular ask about waiver or medicaid waiver services. All states should have those services, most do, but some are more robust than others and depending on the state DMD unfortunately gets left out of eligibility. If you want to PM me or respond with your state I could give a more specific overview. In general these services help pay for things that will be needed with your kid's care. Medicaid should come in and act as a secondary insurance to help. Parental income is waived from consideration for eligibility so there is no financial line. \n\nDuchenne Family Assistance Program is a broad assistance agency that can help with a lot. That includes parent connection and also helping you through the waiver process. They are staffed by people familiar with DMD which is invaluable in itself. \n\nConsider applying for SSI on behalf of your kid depending on your financial situation. \n\nAsk about or look into title V state benefit programs. Like with waiver, some states have better versions of it than others. It is possible it might not help too much but they are meant to help plug you into additional services and also ease the financial burden. \n\nIt might be a future concern, but think about and ask doctors about how to talk to your kid about the diagnosis. You are going to be a role model for how he should react to the diagnosis. If it is a closed subject then that just makes it feel taboo and it will not protect him from much except protect him from accurate information. It is his body and he is going to know if something is different than his peers. Not saying lay everything out at once, but a great starting point is to answer questions in age appropriate and honest ways when he starts asking questions. \n\nIf you have Medicaid, look into your plan's travel/visit reimbursement options. \n\nTake care of yourself. Especially starting out it is completely ok to focus on yourself and your own coping. The classic self care metaphor of securing your own oxygen mask before helping others applies here. Take note of what helps you cope, take note of your support system, and do not hesitate to get assistance where it is available. All good info except one confusing bit\u2014the part where you talk about his son and understanding his own body? He did not mention a son specifically, just \u201cbaby.\u201d And he cannot pass on the gene to a son because it is on the X chromosome. Men give their sons a Y chromosome and their daughters an X. Therefore they can only pass it along to their daughters, who will most likely be carriers and not exhibitors of Duchenne. Thanks for all this information. I am in Indiana but seeing doctors in Chicago. I still work full time, are you saying I should apply for social security and/or these other benefits now? (\n\nThis is a pretty useful page for a general overview of the dystrophin gene and the consequences of specific deletions. As you can see, removal of 49-51 leaves exon 48 being spliced to exon 52, which retains the reading frame (flat end to flat end), so when the mRNA is made into protein, the protein gets made all the way to the end.\n\nVastly simplified, dystrophin is like a barbell: big bit at one end, big bit at the other, long stick in between. The bits at the ends are the most important, because they bind to lots of important things, and dystrophin thus acts like a \"physical bridge\", bringing all those things together. \n\nIf you do not have one of those ends (because a mutation disrupted the reading frame, so the protein does not get made all the way to the end), your muscle cells cannot make that link, and you get the severe disease: DMD. \n\nIf you DO have both ends, but the stick between them is a little bit shorter (this is what del49-51 does) then the disease is usually a lot milder: BMD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a ton of modifier genes which can make your disease progress faster/slower or otherwise influence the progression, so every case is slightly different, but yes: this is a BMD mutation. It is also right in the major human hot-spot (lots of DMD/BMD mutations are in the region of exon 45-53, for some reason), so there should be a fair bit of information on other BMD patients with the same mutation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing to note with loss of exon 51 specifically is that this is where a shorter dystrophin isoform (dp140) starts being made into protein. I think it can use another start site further on, but losing that exon will produce a slightly truncated dp140.\n\nThis shorter isoform is expressed in the eyes (especially the lens) and the brain (especially the cerebellum), and is also expressed more widely during development, where it does...*things* we do not properly understand, so you might find you have a broader spectrum of symptoms unrelated to muscle specifically. Thanks for the comment. This baby is a boy so I guess I do not have to worry about passing on to him. I also have three older daughters 15-11 that I will get tested. SSI probably not if you are able to work. I mentioned that under the seemingly wrong impression that you had a kid who tested positive for DMD. \n\nTitle V would have also been for that. Based on my very limited impression from your age and being able to work full time, it does not sound like you are in need of a lot of assistance for activities of daily living. Waiver services are typically for very high need individuals who would otherwise need nursing home supports or frequent hospital admissions. \n\n It would be proactive but connecting to the Indiana Bureau of Developmental Disability Services (BDDS) could not hurt to see what could be available. Offices are organized regionally by districts based on county if you want to find the one for your country. \n\nA loooooot of what I went over was because I was in the mode of thinking you had a small child with DMD and your diagnosis was revealed as an aside. So that is my bad. If you are feeling stable then there is no need to second guess that. Thanks again for the reply and clearing that up!  \n\n\nlook into Duchene care centers so you can have a doctor who is experienced with DMD know you. From my experience as a person with DMD Cincinnati children hospital is a really great one, but many other DMD-specific clinics exist Also, advice for school.

I am stationed in a very tiny town that does not have a lot of resources. Our closest large towns are Lubbock, TX and Albuquerque, NM. I am assuming a doctor will need to order the test and read the results. Would I just go through my primary doctor or should I seek out a genetic counselor?\n\nThanks so much for the help you all! Invitae, a genetic testing company, just dropped their patient pay rate to $250.  While I do like to promote Invitae for situations like this (no I do not work for them), there are several other genetic testing labs in the U.S. who also offer commercial carrier testing (Emory, Prevention, MNG, University of Chicago to name a few).   \n\n\nIf your brother had confirmatory genetic testing, it would be ideal for you to provide that report when submitting for your own carrier testing.  That way they can test directly for your brother's x-linked mutation. If your brother was not genetically confirmed, or you do not have access to the genetic report, it is not likely an issue; the DMD gene has been well mapped.    \n\n\nSource: I manage the Congenital Muscle Disease International Registry (cmdir.org) and have a fair bit of experience in the diagnostics of neuromuscular disorders (I myself have an NMD).

Her sister got prenatal genetic testing done and found she is a carrier of DMD. She is having a girl. Their mom got genetic testing done and she does not carry DMD. My wife got prenatal genetic testing done and is also a carrier of DMD. We are having a boy.\n\nHow is it possible that both my wife and her sister are DMD carriers but their mom is not? I know there are other genetic mutations that can happen that are not inherited but are incredibly rare. This does not make sense to me.\n\nWe have an appointment with a genetic counselor on Friday to see what we do next. We would like to know for sure if the baby will have it so we can prepare, but we do hope and pray he does not.\n\nAnyone that can provide any feedback or suggestions on what to do next would be greatly appreciated. There are thousands of different mutations that could result in a DMD phenotype: it is a gene 2.3 million bases long, so the scope for mutations is huge.\n\nYou do not specific what the precise test was, nor how it was conducted, nor do you state whether your wife and her sister carry the \\_same\\_ mutation.\n\nDo not get me wrong: you are going about this the right way, and finding out exactly what mutation your wife carries will be important if your son inherits it (because many next-gen therapies for DMD are targeted to specific mutations), but at this point it is impossible to answer your question properly without more detail. A) The test is due to the second x-chromosome not very sensitive and may deliver a false negative result\n\nB) a game of chance and you wife and her sister are just unlucky. Some girls have Turner Syndrome and DMD add the same time despite the odds. \n\nC) the elephant in the room: the biological father of your wife and your sister in law had DMD So my wife and sisters mutation is the same.

We will have some testing done after he is born to find out. My wife is already 31 weeks. Doing an amnio adds risk for the selfish want of knowing a few weeks earlier, so we opted not to do it. Thanks for the reply.\n\nIf it is delta 49-51, then yes: this is a good outcome (as outcomes for DMD go). It is not a Duchenne mutation, it is a Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) mutation.\n\n(\n\nSee: deletion of those specific exons leaves the reading frame intact: dystrophin is still made, from beginning to end, it will just be missing a small amount of sequence in the middle. \n\nAs far as muscle health goes, the important bits are the beginning and the end, because dystrophin protein is sort of a \"physical bridge\" between the muscle cytoskeleton (which sticks to the beginning) and the support matrix outside the muscle fibre (which, via another protein called dystroglycan, sticks to the end). The middle portion does *some* stuff, but...stuff you can survive without. \n\nFor DMD boys, the end never gets made, so the physical bridge is lost, and the muscle suffers as a consequence. For patients with BMD (which deltaE49-51 mutation is), the end does get made, the bridge is preserved, and the prognosis is much, much better. Some BMD patients are almost asymptomatic.\n\nA lot of the cutting edge therapies current in trials are aimed at turning a DMD phenotype into a BMD phenotype: not \"fixing\" the dystrophin protein entirely, but converting an out-of-frame mutation that *does not* make the end...into an in-frame mutation that makes the beginning and end but lacks a bit in the middle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is absolutely, 100% worth getting this double and triple checked with a genetic counsellor, because I am just some guy on the internet, but from where I am sitting, this is, as you say, the best of the worst case scenarios.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs to the original question, there is no reason your wife's mother could not have had a mutation at some early developmental (pre-germline) stage that then went on to produce germline cells that carry a BMD mutation while the rest of her is non-BMD (all humans are mosaics to some extent), but if it IS a BMD mutation, which with the information you have provided, it appears to be, then it could have come from your wife's father. As noted, some BMD patients are almost asymptomatic. Thank you for your detailed reply. We did talk to a genetic counselor today and she confirmed what I found on the interwebs, but did mention that there have been reported cases of deleted 49-51 causing dull blown Deschennes. I think be said basically 80% BMD or just cardiomyapothy and 20% DMD. \n\nThe counselor also said that its likely her mother has gonadal mosaicism, but did say it could be the father. Her father is a very heavy man, probably 450lbs, so she thought near asymptomatic BMD was unlikely as she thought a 450lb man would likely be symptomatic where a 200lb man may be asymptomatic. Hope this makes sense. \n\nShe directed us to get a CK test a week after the baby was born. If the CK was in normal ranges, then consider assume no Deschenne's. I do think I want to get the full genetic test just so I know, but I also do not want to cause any OTHER worries if DMD/BMD is negative...", "New here I hope to one day be an anesthesiologist. I am an young adult growing up with Muscular Dystrophy and I hope to work as a doctor/researcher. I also had a follow-up question would I be able to be a researcher and a doctor at the same time? I hope to come up and help advance treatments for Muscular Dystrophy. I have Minicore Myopathy (non-progressive) , however my mutation is still unknown, I am having genetic sequencing done currently. Recently it was observed from my doctor, that I have an Marfanoid habitous so Im also being tested for connective tissue diseases, which puts my disease in question. I would love to receive treat myself with stem cell therapy. myostatin inhibition, and of course genetic engineering if possible. Hi, I definately share some similarities with you. I have myotonic muscular dystrophy, which unfortunately is progressive. I was diagnosed at 27, but first started having symptoms at 18. I am 34 now. I was actually diagnosed quite early as I recognised the symptoms myself when after 7 years of tests the docs could not figure me out. Luckily my first degree is genetics and I knew of the condition and demanded the genetic test which came back positive. Although I technically do not have marfans, I kind of also do - I do not have enough of the symptoms to pass the threshold of being considered to have the condition, but I have enough that it is pretty obvious I have a mild form.\n\nAs for being a doctor and researcher at the same time, I am not sure, but I doubt it. I worked in a genetic research lab for a year and the work is hardcore, I was easily doing 40+ hours per week, knowing how overworked doctors are I doubt the two would work together. It is definately possible to transition from one to the other, but would require retraining. I went back to uni after a did a post grad masters I physiotherapy, so I am a physiotherapist now.\n\nWith regards to the gym, I go twice a week to lift weights and do a body combat class once to twoc  a week also with no issues and have noticed myself get a lot more ripped in the past year. With myotonic DM it is advised to exercise in the early stages but not when the disease gets really bad, so I want to get as strong as I can whole I am still able. I do not know enough about your form to suggest, but I presume if it is non progressive exercise is unlikely to hurt it. Just start fairly easy and build up. Rememver to give yourself a nice rounded programme of cardio and weights and see how you get on.\n\nHope that helps and good luck! I am sorry to hear that you are finding out these things that are going to change your life. It is scary, at least it was for me. It can seem unfair, and it is, and that just happens but that is just the way it goes unfortunately. I do not have specific advise I can offer and I am sorry that I do not but hopefully this helps you. \n\n\nI do not have Minicore Myopathy I have something else, but I have had enough experiences getting bad news that will greatly change the course of my life. I feel like the best advice I could possibly offer is that you only fail when you stop trying. That concept is EVERYWHERE in the culture of our species through history. Live by it. The day I got my genetic results I listened to \"I Will not Back Down\" by Johnny Cash on repeat lol. Hell, I just had another one crop up and hit me in the feels while playing the new Star Wars game last night. \n&gt;Get up, try again.\n&gt;I just keep failing Master.\n&gt;Do you? Good, keep failing. Keep getting back up. That is the only way to succeed. Do not allow yourself to be weighed down by ego and pretense. Let go of what you fear to lose and rise up. \n\nIf you want to work out to gain some muscle where you can, do it. If you want to be a doctor/researcher go for it, you can btw. Take things day by day and find enjoyment in everything that you can, good and bad as best you can. You might be lucky enough to even experience that bad where others may never even be in a position to. Just keep getting back up and you will be fine Kash246. If it does come back that you have other connective tissue issues it is really important to enter a specialty that will allow you to continue on working.  Had a friend who was a top ranked plastic surgeon and did all these fellowships in hand surgery and breast reconstruction which she loved.  She had mild Elhers Danlos and her wrist gave up really early in her career and she could no longer do surgery.   Working in the non-medical field now, Thanks you so much you all. You guys are all like a family here and that is beautiful. Thank you so much for all your words of encouragement. It honestly means a lot. I have actually been looking into Stem Cells and Myostatin Inhibition a lot since I do not know the genetic mutation I have yet. And also I was wondering if you guys know about exoskeletons and exosuits such as Roam Robotics, Ekso Bionics, Harvard Biodesign lab exosuits, and Samsung gems? I really want to know your opinions on these Bc I want them lol. Thanks so much for your reply I actually was looking at this literature associating Marfan and some types of myopathies and stuff.

I am 16 years old suffering from Minicore Myopathy, a rare form of Muscular Dystrophy that is non-progressive. I am able to walk independently but I do suffer from dilated cardiomyopathy and lung difficulties. Im sure you guys get these feelings too. Like of frustration because your rare disease is getting any awareness. I have been dealing with these feelings for a long time and wanted to share. However, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy rightfully gets the attention it deserves because it is the most common and the most severe. But I would also appreciate if Minicore Myopathy gets some love in the research and gene department. I have Marfanoid Habitus and I am still being tested to see which gene mutation I have. All this motivated me to go into this field to hopefully cure this disease for me and many of you guys out there. Through stem cells, gene therapy, robotics via exosuits, we should see a drastic change in care for us, so keep fighting guys! However if any of you, for the time being, can raise awareness for this disease it would be much appreciated, as not enough research and funding go into it. Despite it probably being an easier fix than most muscle disease such as Becker's and Duchenne because the Dystrophin gene is the largest gene.  Thank you very much for your time, please help raise awareness and keep doing well! One of the genes that leads to MMC is called Titin. Titin is also the only gene amongst those that cause MMC to elaborate DCM. I would suggest you get tested for Titin. It is autosomal resseive so they will need to find two pathologic mutations to confirm diagnosis.\n\n(Source: My wife is the executive director of CureCMD, she does this for a living :) The above advice is hers, typed out by me)\n\nI hear what you are saying when it comes to not getting enough attention for the lesser known diseases, this is actually why the advocacy group CureCMD was formed.

I have a very hard time going up them. \n\nMy mother, uncle, grandmother, aunt, great-grandmother, etcetc all have FSHMD or multiple sclerosis. My grandmother uses a rollator and a wheelchair interchangeably  and my uncle uses a cane. My mother exercises extensively when exercise is painful for me, but I still try.\n\nMy mother does not want for me to get crutches. She says this is because the arms are the first to get weak with FSHMD. My arms may be weak but my legs are weaker. Does anyone here have experience using forearm crutches for their FSHMD? Do they help? I have been considering crutches, but my upper body is more effected and I have the same worries your mom does. I have some family members with FSHD. I personally do not have it. My wife was able to see a specialist, and that makes a big difference. Her regular physician does not know much about FSHD.\n\nAnyway, when foot drop started causing her to fall, she got Fetterman crutches. They really helped her for a few years. She also tried AFOs for foot drop. They were painful, but did let her stay active and continue working. Eventually she started using a walker. And now a power wheelchair for distances and the walker around the house.\n\nWe live in a two story house. We eventually put a stairlift in, as just thinking about falling on the stairs is bad news. We have three steps from the garage into the house, and eventually put a lift there as well. It seems like a good solution, except when one lift went out with a bad circuit board and when we had an extended power outage. (and when we were quoted several weeks before a technician could come out). We are still staying in the two story house, but a no-step ranch would really be the smartest solution. Especially when I think about fire risks, and only one way down from the second floor and only one way out of the house. A two story house with stair lifts is not a good long term solution.\n\nAlternatively, we have been considering building either a full bath downstairs, or even a bedroom/bath. That takes the steps out of the equation.\n\nIf you are falling, give a lot of consideration to arm crutches (my wife really liked Fetterman) and/or AFOs.  My wife fell, tore her hamstring and was in bed for six weeks. She still falls as she prefers walking over using the power chair - and that is completely understandable.

As, not to be a sad pumpkin here,  I am not really doing good in life right now, I know it is not curable disease but I just want a chance to improve, I am asking outside India because I do not want to stay with my family, (do not get me wrong please they are very kind and supporting) I just want to get away.  \nPlease let me know good rehab centres, I might need a surgery to release the knee contracture and I have scoliosis too.  \nAnd how much will all this cost me? I would look into UCLA healths medical field My fiance got lucky with his spinal surgery, granted he cannot lay down straight anymore since theres a rod holding his spine in place, but insurance paid for it. We are in the U.S. and he has Medicaid. Theres a Duchenne's Muscular Clinic in Birmingham, Alabama. You get a team of scientists like, Neurologists, Genetic Counselors, Nutritionists, Respatory therapists, Social workers, Physical and Occupational therapists, etc. They even have a counselor you can see for free to help you get through issues. They are really great and we love them. There are some stretches and exercises we do that help him out and keeps his muscles from weakening further. I can DM them to you if you would like. \n\n Now I do not know how old you are but unfortunately it will not get any easier. With surgery to correct your scoliosis it is a 50/50 chance that you will either be pain free or be in pain for the rest of your life. My fiance got the bad side of the coin but they do proscribe meds to help you out. Just be careful that you do not get addicted to them. Only take them if in excruciating pain or extreme discomfort. If you are a bit sore from just sitting up, stretch and take some advil. The meds they give you can be extremely addicting. In terms of your disease, you will continue to lose muscle strength if you do not keep up with activities. Either way you will lose strength but it will go slower if you continue to be active. It might help to get a more precise diagnosis. LGMD is a somewhat broad term to distinguish your condition from other types of muscular dystrophy, there are about 15 or so types of LGMD caused by different genes. Exome sequencing might identify the gene responsible for your condition and in some cases that also dictates specific therapies.

The doctors only realised that something was wrong when I kept falling over and getting into stupid accidents because I had no balance, they mesured me up for a wheelchair &amp; put loads of rails up in my house so I had something to hold onto when walking up stairs ect. \n\nTurns out I did not need all of that stuff, I actually got \"better\", personally I belive that my body sort of adapted itself as it was growing to cope with the activities I was doing growing up (I made a concious effort to either walk or cycle a few miles a day) which was great! However, it lead to me being in denial that I was suffering from FSHD for about 10 years, despite the fact that I have no biceps, a curved slightly back &amp; a bit of a funny walk. I actually stopped going to my yearly appointments with the clinc &amp; they said that was fine which I realise now was a mistake. \n\nI started running seriously about 16 months ago &amp; I am now getting quite good at it, I am also training alot &amp; I am more concious about my body because alot of people in my running club who do less miles than me &amp; do not have any obscure genetic conditions get injured so I am very aware of the dangers.\n\nI have snapped out of my denial now. One thing I have noticed is that my hamstrings are extreamly tight, I am sure that FSHD has something to do with it, I have read that it can have a knock on effect in the lower body, my question (finally right!?) is, should I be doing hamstring streaches ect or do I need to strengthen my shouders and upper body / core so that they can take some of the load? I am finding it hard to explain in an elequent way, but from what I understand, all of the muscles from shoulders / back / legs / anckles are connected so if my shoulders are weak surely that is having an impact on my hamstrings, so if my shoulders were stronger would it take the strain off my hamstrings? Or do I just need to do some hamstring work?\n\nAlso, which specific exersizes are good for this (streaches ect)?\n\nThanks in advance. \n\nTL;DR: FSHD sufferer with tight hamstrings, looking for excersizes + long winded backstory.  I would highly recommend the MD clinic. They can go into much more testing now then before including genetics. They can guide you better and offer therapy if hamstring tightness is a recurring issue that could lead you to tripping and hurting yourself. Best of luck to you brother. Thanks, is it the hamstrings that cause trips &amp; falls?

I do not know which type she has and I have not been in contact with her for about twenty years, so I am not going to ask. \n\nI have abnormally large calf muscles which I found out is a sign. I am also very weak. I have been lifting weights for a few years now and my strength has barely increased. I see people in the gym all the time who are smaller than me lifting weights that I dream of lifting. I also have a weird gait and I definitely walk on the balls of my feet which I read is also a sign. I have also been dealing with some annoying cramps in my hamstrings after walking for a while, but I chalked that up to tight calves. \n\nI have had a blood test recently and everything came back normal, but that was for some sleep problems that I am going through. My sleep specialist asked me about relatives with MD and I told him my mother has it and he said I should get tested.

I am 35 and have no symptoms (and my 4 siblings have no signs either). But, make sure to see your doctor to make sure. Do you think you will have children?  Already had 2.  There is no way of knowing without knowing her type I would see a neurologist that specializes in Muscular Dystrophy and neuromuscular diseases.

I walk normally to all my classes and can run for very short bursts before my legs start getting tired. I walk a lot in the night just around my campus and since it is in a city I can walk pretty far. \n\nBut I have been feeling down lately. Idk what it is, but I just get so anxious all the time. Me falling due to my legs giving out does not help, and just exacerbates it. I am doing okay in school, and have friends and such, and they are nice and we hang out, but I have not told any of them about it, mostly because I just met them and I am scared about what they might think of me\n\nI am not even sure why I am making this post, but I just want to be heard by some people without having them be people who I know personally. \n\nI think I will just start by listing my main worries in life. First, how can I start falling down less and start being able to walk better. Second, how can I walk better, my gait is a little awkward. Third, is it possible for me to ever have lots of friends who do not judge me? Fourth, will I ever be able to find a girlfriend or someone who genuinely loves me, despite the fact I am weak and cannot do many things easily?\n\n(Wow that was a lot. This is really hard for me to open up about, so please be nice. I know I am rambling but idk I just need to get some of this stuff of my chest.) \n\nAnd finally, how can I improve myself to make myself more confident and more open to talk to others? Walking better is not really something we can help you with probably.  Questions 3 and 4 I can tell you yes for sure.  All of your fears are completely normal, but most people with MD have pretty normal lives with friends, relationships, and jobs.  Develop your passions and you will attract people with similar interests.  Think about it from your own perspective.  Do you care how well your friends walk?  Would you care if a friend had a different disability?  It probably does not play a huge role in your relationships.  MD sucks for sure, but it does not have to ruin your life.  I have still been able to do most of the things I wanted to.  Virtual hug to you! Light attracts light. Confidence is sexy. Own it, be vocal about your condition. Nothing to be ashamed of here. Keep your chin up, walk into the room like you own the place... or if you have to, roll into the room like you own the place. College is an exciting and nerve wracking time... everything you are feeling is normal \u2665\ufe0f This may sound a little odd but...\n\nYou are entering a phase of life where leaders are created.  Those possessing a positive outlook and attitude tend to find themselves being looked to for answers.

Maybe that is your first step... fully accepting you have MD. Stand in the mirror and say outloud, hello my name is _____ and I have Muscular Dystrophy however I am an all around awesome dude! Repeat. \u2665\ufe0f Consult with your physician(s) and get into physical therapy. I am in my early forties and apparently have limb-girdle MD. My experience with odd gait, balance issues, and falling sounds very much like what you describe. Once I was diagnosed, I found physical therapy extremely beneficial in gaining what strength I can and working to adapt for what I have lost. So I have MD too (Collagen VIa Myopathy) and can definitely relate to how you are feeling. I am 34 now but when I was 18 I used to want nothing more than to hide it because I assumed people would judge me. I had a moved cities for college with a couple of friends from school who were really accepting but I was nervous about being in a new situation. I did find plenty of really accepting people at college and made some great friends - including my wife (this is her account - I do not have reddit). But I still worried a lot about fitting in. \n\nHonestly, the best thing I ever did was accept that I have MD, be open about it and put the onus on other people to deal with any prejudice they might have. Prejudice is real and while I have not encountered tons of really blatant examples, on balance I reckon the less room you make for people's assumptions about what having BMD means for you, the better things will be.\n\nAs for questions 1 and 2, get a good physiotherapist, get a good specialist who can help you understand how things might progress. They can also help inform your physio.  (this is my alt by the way lol)\n\nBefore I ask I just want to say thank you so much for telling me your story and about your adult life. That gives me so much more drive and desire to live than I had before, and I just want you to know that. I wallowed in self pity throughout high school and there was a point after senior year before collegewhere as I saw my entire family constantly do things so much easier and better than me that I felt like a burden and very nearly decided to end it all. Thank god I did not. Now I try to always look on the bright side, even if it is hard.\n\nBut I had a question. How do I navigate telling people about my condition? I have already made friends here, and they have not asked or noticed anything about me. Do you think I should tell them? Or do you think I should not? They are nice people and do not seem to care much about my condition but I just have trouble opening up about it. \n\nWhile we are on the subject, I hope you do not mind me asking, but how did you and your wife come to be? How was that relationship built? I would love to know because I am not a very easily sociable person and I often just do not know what to do in these situations. Btw the comment below is from me it is just from my alt. I would appreciate if you could give me some more advice, if it is not a bother. Thanks. 38M, wheelchair user since I was 30. Best change I ever made in my life. I have gotten places faster, been in less pain, had more dates and more sex and had better relationships. 10/10, would recommend. \n\nI was very stubborn about using any assistive tech out of stigma and embarrassment but would often fall and hurt myself, I needed stitches in my head multiple times. I started going out less because walking hurt and my life shrank. I eventually fell and shattered my kneecap and was forced to use a power chair. The thing I was dreading my whole life turned out to be the best thing to ever happen to me. \n\nSo yeah, it is progressive, but not walking is not as bad as you think it is atm. Please do not be stubborn about adapting, there are much better things ahead I promise. 20's can be a bit of an emotional shitshow though, in general, not related to disability. Life gets better at 30! Also try get as highly educated as you can afford to do. You sound exactly like me. I am just stating my senior year of college with BMD and I know exactly what you mean with the randomly falling down thing. I am in the marching band at my school (which is extremely demanding for someone with BMD) but what I have learned is everyone I have told is always extremely supportive. After all, what kind of friend is someone who does not support having a genetic disease that you cannot control?\n\nAnyways. On the walking thing. Stretch your calves as much as you can. My physical therapist has figured out most of the time I fall is from catching my toe which is a result of the calf being too tight and being unable to get my toe up high enough. (highly recommend seeing a specialized PT if you are not already. They are incredibly useful) \n\nThe gait thing you are stuck with I think. Do not worry about it though. I used to be self conscious about it, but then I realized it does not matter. It is just your body adjusting to the disease. \n\nThe other stuff you do not need to worry about, but send me a message if you want to talk about it. I would be happy to talk to someone who seems to be in exactly the same situation I am/was in. I have yet to meet someone as similar as me as you are, so feel free to send me a message if you want to talk some more. All good. Will PM you. I understand you bro, I am 20 with BMD in university and I get very anxious as well when I am doing everyday stuff such as walking and having to be careful with every step because I fear that my legs will give way because it happens to me out of nowhere without any warning.\n\nI would suggest some sort of exercise to you such as mild strength training and cardio exercises such as cycling and also swimming if you can because it really does help with improving strength and confidence. Also, do not stress too much over the condition but still try to research as much as you can to familiarise yourself so you can figure what can and cannot help. \n\nFor the falling down part I would recommend trying like knee braces as it supports the knee which is likely to reduce your sudden falls because it helped me and reduces the constant overthinking of suddenly falling. \n\nI cannot give much advice on the girlfriend part as I struggle myself with that but I guess just be yourself and be confident with who you are, we are all perfect in our own way and there will always be someone who will see the best in you so do not worry it will all work out. Gotcha gotcha. Yeah my school has a big gym so I have definitely started thinking about doing some cycling and swimming, so I will start doing that once I get adjusted. Thanks. Wow. That is amazing. I have always felt really alone with my struggles since no one in my family really seems to get it (they all get really sad and upset about it and are very supportive, but do not really know much about what it is like to live with it)\n\nSo for the stretching right, what were your reps? How many times did you do it? \n\nAnd yeah, about the falling thing, yeah that is exactly what happens. But what also happens is when I step on like a slight elevation change I get unbalanced and fall. or when I go down the stairs sometimes I buckle if I go a little too fast. I am pretty good about that not happening but it is just impossible to be consistent 24/7. Sorry for the delayed response...\n\nI know what you mean with the family not really getting it. My brother has it too but is really athletic unlike me so my parents took a while to understand that it effects us very differently.\n\nAs to stretching, the classic runner stretch with one leg back and applying pressure to a wall to get the back leg stretched is the perfect exercise. I usually do a minute or two on each leg every night before bed and also just randomly throughout the day. The more the better really. (also, my PT recommends a stretching thing called a stretch-ez which I got from Amazon and I love to use as I am in bed or on the couch watching TV. Makes stretching your legs really easy while sitting anywhere) \n\nI also have the same thing with the elevation change, especially if I am not actively prepared for it to happen. But yeah, it is impossible to be consistent. I just have mentally prepared myself for it to happen and when I am around people and to not care what they think. I mean it just sucks, that is about it, but it is just about working past it however possible. I have BMD and I am mid-30s. I have an amazing girlfriend who I have been dating for about a year.\n\nJust reading this and it sounds like you need to see a therapist and talk through this stuff. They usually have them at the universities. Have a good cry, get the emotions out and work out a plan on how you are going to tackle the rest of your life.\n\nI saw one when I was first diagnosed and it really helped me work through my issues with my disability as well as all the other shit that I had going on in my life at the time.\n\nAs for walking and gait, you always could get a walking stick (like a cool one with a sword in it \ud83d\ude09) maybe that might help you. Or maybe you should get some different shoes? Definitely go see someone about the walking because maybe they have some better suggestions for your feet.\n\nPeople judge people all the time, even you. Maybe these people are not even looking at you. Who knows? It is assumptions you are making. Does it really matter what strangers think? Anyway, this is where I think you really need to focus on with therapy because maybe you just need to learn some acceptance and how not make so many assumptions about what people think about you because at the end of the day it is just going to make you feel shit if you focus on other people's judgements of you or even your own judgements of other people.  \n\n\nAnd finally, you will definitely get a girlfriend. Just date. Just meet up with people and just get to know them. It does not even have to be the first person you meet. There is a tv show called 'Dating on the spectrum'. You will see that literally anyone regardless of their disability can get a date and/or a girlfriend if they have the right attitude towards it. Yeah you know as I have gone through college so far I have learned to not really care about how people might see me, and honestly since I have to walk a lot for classes my gait has kind of evened out a little bit as I have had to walk fast sometimes (rushing to class lol) and so I have been feeling better. And I have also only fallen once, and that was right at the beginning, which is a good sign.\n\nI think since I was way less active in high school I felt bad about myself, but now I am realizing that one month in I have been able to do 95 percent of things myself.\n\nAs for dating well you know it is college LOL. Super busy and I think really throwing myself into the work helps quite a bit with this stuff, and I automatically make friends with people who are in my major. And I think most of them have not really noticed anything odd about me besides maybe me taking my time to go up and down stairs, but even then I just say \"oh I just do not feel like rushing\" or something.\n\nI have been getting more confident and just comfortable with who I am, and I think I am happy right now. I think getting out and just being on my own helped a lot with the confidence boost. It helped me realize how normal I am and that my disability, while still present, has not taken that ability to just be normal.\n\nI still think though, that me being open about it to friends is hard, but I think that is mainly because college has just started, so that will inevitably take time.\n\nBut thanks to all of you here I have been able to realize how much people like us can still be great people, and that we can still be great partners and good supportive men/women to the people around us. That, by far and away, has made me happiest.", "Gift suggestion for my 7 yr old DMD cousin I was hoping you guys can help me out. I have a 7 yr old cousin who suffers from DMD. The disease has progressed to a level where he cannot walk anymore and uses an electric wheelchair to help him get around. I want to get him a nice present for Christmas, but I do not have a lot of ideas. \n\nLast Christmas I got him kinetic sand which he really liked, but he is overgrown that now. Based on what my mom tells me, his favorite activity is watching tv.\n\nAny help will be appreciated. I am willing to spend up to $50\n\nThanks Harmonica and holder.

We work in an office. He is mobile but no stairs, we bring him coffee, and it takes him 5 minutes to get up from his desk. He also works from home 2 out of 5 days a week . We have told him to take more but he wants to be present at work. I get that. So far so good.\n\nThe issues are really getting up from his desk. He has no special accommodations. If it goes well 5 minutes. If his hands slip he lands on his desk face first (there has been blood) and he cant get up without someone helping him. His schedule means that for the last 30 minutes there may be no one around to help him. We are worried, his cell is never far but we are a small team and there are times when he is alone.\n\nTo complicate matters (which in my opinion is the biggest \"obstacle\" for lack of a better term) he doesnt want help (EDIT: or at least he has never asked and has balked at suggestions.. but we dont really know wtf we are doing). He wants to remain independant. He only asks for help when he is truly fucked. I respect him. I respect his pride. We have all made it clear \"need help? name it.. anything\" \n\nThe real question amongst us is: Do we make the first move or wait for him (or for an incident bad enough we cant ignore anymore)? Mgmt has brought it up with HR and they are remarquably clueless as to who to ask? The dept in charge of desks/chairs etc are of the opinion until he asks we should stay out of it.\n\nWe have no idea.. he has worked here for 20 years. Loved by all. \n\nTLDR: Colleague has MD. Only asks for help when he falls but is obviously struggling with his current desk setup and we dont know what to do. Hmmm im completly new to the workforce, and i have a mild form of muscular dystrophy. \n\nBut isnt the workplace suppose to acocmodate disabilities? Maybe the workplace can add some railings, to or nesr the desk, or at least some form of grip on the desk so his hand wont slip. That would be beneficial to all parties. ", "Takings statins and Myotonic Dystrophy Hey folks!  I have myotonic muscular dystrophy and my PCP, who is not familiar with the disease prescribed statins because I have very high triglycerides.  I know that there is some issue with side effects and MD.  I just wondered if anyone had any experience taking statins. I do not know the answer but following as my partner has DM too. Trying to get info on it is pretty hard! My wife has congenital muscular dystrophy (Col VI). She was proscribed statins and they made her very lethargic. We called a doctor friend (Who is one of the more knowledgeable people about her disease) and we were told that she should not take statins.\n\nI would get a second or third opinion on this. Do you know about the myotonic dystrophy foundation? Thanks for your reply.  Yes, I am very familiar with the foundation.  I have been to a few conferences as well. It is my feeling that the less meds you can take, the better with this disease. Not a ton of research has been done on how specific medications interact with it. Can dietary changes help the triglycerides instead? ( I am familiar with triglycerides.  Not only did I inherit DM from my dad's side of the family, but I also inherited heart disease.  I have altered my diet, and it has not helped as much as it used to.  My experience is that meds have helped me in different ways. I would not be able to work if I was not on meds, but I do research them before I decide to take them.  Thanks for your reply! I have very high trigs and lovaza has had great results for me. 600s down to almost under 200.\n\nI cannot tolerate statins and I do not think I personally have heard of anyone with MD in my connections say that they can take them. Thanks for responding!  My cardiologist prescribed me fenofibrate instead of statins.  I also starting taking fish oil tablets as well.

She developed md in her 20s. She worked by herself to get her masters in education and never taught for the money. She was a special Ed teacher in a rule area and people would come from all over to have their child taught with her love and care. She never married, took care of her twin sister of whom did not have muscular dystrophy but had depression in an era when electro shock theory was the answer. These are the two women raised me. \n\nMy mother, being the special Ed teacher, gave me and every person around her, her everything. Often times she was too weak to walk down a hall way or long distances and used an electric wheelchair. \n\nNow, she has developed Alzheimer\u2019s as well. Over the last two years she has gone down hill at a fast pace. My other family took care of her mainly my mothers older sister. But at this point, my mother has digressed so far this is not Alzheimer\u2019s behavior. I am 1000 miles away trying to make it on my own with lots of potential in my job.

I spent around 5 years on medication(cellcept) and about a year on intravenous infusion treatments. I never got to the point of not being able to walk, but I struggled with lifting my head, getting out of bed, falling down a lot. I was super aware of low chairs because I literally could not get up sometimes. My myositis went into remission and I am a lot better in most ways. I do not take as good of care of myself as when I was weaker, I ate right, did not smoke and drink, stuff like that. My work is usually in food environments or basic labor. I get so frustrated sometimes because although I have come very far, I still feel very weak and have muscle imbalance. I struggle and feel embarrassed about not being able to lift heavy things at my job, open bottles and stuff like that. I do not have insurance and cannot afford it, so I do not really get check-ups concerning my former disability. \n\nAnyway, I wanted to list some very specific issues I have to see if anyone else has similar issues. One of my major limitations is core strength. Since I relied on distal muscles so much, proximal muscles are still weak. Even now when I try to activate certain muscles, it almost feels like some sort of mental/physical battle to even flex certain muscles in my upper back and shoulders. Another thing are shoulder rotations. \n\nMy shoulders pop sometimes(fairly often) when I attempt certain flexion/extension motions with my arms. I do not want to give up so I still attempt to do those motions with resistance bands. Certain motions like opening bags, squeezing still feel \"wrong\" somehow. It is like I am trying to remember how to properly perform these actions, but the muscles are either the wrong ones or not relying certain bigger muscles in my arms, back and shoulder at all and completely on smaller muscles. I am pretty sure that it is related to atrophied muscles. It is frustrating because it seems very hard to progress my strength at all and when my strength does increase, I do not notice it in the short term, only after long periods of time. Could also be due to remodelled innervation: when muscle fibres die, the nerve branches supplying them die back, and when the muscle tissue is replaced by new, regenerated muscle, these new fibres recruit nerves anew. And generally not the *same* nerves: usually just the closest. \n\nIn undamaged muscle you typically see a checkerboard of fibre types (fast and slow), all mixed together, but in muscle that has been damaged/regenerated (especially repeatedly, as in muscular dystrophies) you start to see fibre-type grouping, big clumps of fibres all of the same fibre type, and probably all controlled by the same nerve.\n\nLong story short, muscle atrophy can affect both muscle performance itself, and muscle innervation: movements that you now find difficult might not only depend on muscles that are weaker, but might also depend on nerve arrangements you have lost: in essence you not only have to practice these motions to strengthen the muscles, but you might need to literally 'relearn' how to do them, because your brain has not fully mapped the new connections yet. \n\nIt is a pretty plastic system, though, so while you will not get back the *original* nerve arrangement, you can develop a new one that works.\n\nKeep at it, basically.", "A Year After Getting Gene Therapy, Boys With Muscular Dystrophy Are Healthier and Stronger  This is amazing, I for one would be willing to take treatment (MMD1) at age 37 and not care about what future side effects there could be. Im with you.. I would try it. True guys the unfortunate thing about Duchenne is particular is that it will help them but it will not fully cure them because if you cannot put the whole dystrophin gene in an AAV because it is the biggest gene. However if you guys have other genetic mutations you might just be able to plug the whole thing in. Which means it might work much better for you guys than it even did on these Duchenne kids. So keep on going my guys we will get a significant change in care for us in the next 5-20 years. Take care of yourselves and in the end we will prevail! That is incredible!\n\nI feel sorry for the 2 it did not work on though. I wonder if they will turn out to have some DMD variant? \"Cure\" is sort of a loaded term here anyway. Virtually all DMD therapies are not cures, so much as turning Duchenne into a more Becker muscular dystrophy-like phenotype. \n\nDystrophin is huge, yes (and highly conserved between species), but a lot of it appears to be largely dispensable. There are people with BMD who are missing huge stretches of the dystrophin gene but who do not even manifest muscle weakness until later life. As long as you have the N and C termini, and some of the bits in the middle, it seems you can get almost normal muscle function (certainly enough for normal muscle activity). \n\nThere is clearly a reason why the dystrophin protein is so large, but for normal human activity it does not seem to be essential. Which is really good news. True this is great news for this community. If we can treat DMD we can hopefully cure every other Muscular Dystrophy. "]
