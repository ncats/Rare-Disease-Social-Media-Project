["Mr Rainbo's Suggestion List for Albion Hello all! I created a list of suggestions I feel would improve the game a bit. Feel free to leave feedback on the official forums! :)  \n\n\nIf more convenient, I can edit this post and copy paste the list here, although it is quite lengthy and I am not sure how it would format.", "Changing my major I thought going into technology would be a good choice  but it is not something I want as a career I only chose it because I am legally blind my vision is 20/200 and cannot be corrected,my real interest is health care I want to help people  but I am just terrified because being albino and then not having the best eyesight continues to give me awful anxiety about the whole thing  My advice is do not ever make decisions based on what you think other people are going to think about you. It is your life to live and it is your choice to study what you will. That is not to say it is not going to be difficult, but if you have the determination you can overcome anything.\n\nPersonally I have OA and given that I knew nothing about other people with OA or albinism in general I never really viewed it as a disability. I was just the pale kid with shaky eyes that could not see well and always wore sunglasses, but I still played sports, did well in school, got my degree and have a good paying career today. Learn to adapt rather than limit and your anxiety will begin to fade away.\n\nSidenote, out of curiosity what is the main reason your vision cannot be corrected? Mine is not perfect, but with some good attention from eye docs they can get me down to 20/40 from 20/200+ in both eyes. My eye doctor told me nothing can be done I cannot quote the exact way she put it though  And thank you for your words of kindness and advice  I am sure there are plenty of healthcare jobs out there that do not require you having good vision. I would go around and try to talk to any advisors or professors to help you find what is for you. You would be surprised how helpful people can be  Thank you so much I am going to try and do that ", "What types of jobs do others with albinism have? I am currently a student and have changed my major several times. I have wondered if my eye sight would be as much of an issue as it has been in school. This sub seems a bit dead, but hopefully there are still some of you out there. What is your line of work? What aspects have you found difficult, if any? What adversities have you faced on the job or in school?", "Just found out I have OCA2 aged 31!!  I got referred by my optician to an ophthalmologist at the hospital this month due to potential eye problems of optic nerve (already have reduced VA, high myopia &amp; astigmatism) and the doctor I saw told me I had reduced retinal pigment/blonde fundus and told me about Oculocutaneous albinism and explained how rare it is!\n\nI had no clue other than wondering why I had a lack of pigment to my body and also pretty transparent coloured hair. It feels pretty surreal but Google and Reddit is my best friend right now, so really thank you for this subreddit. Lovely! Better late than never.  jk Thanks for sharing, minaturegirl.  I learned just 3 years ago, at 47 years of age.  I had a scan of my retina done for an unrelated issue and the doctor told me how surprising it was not to see a fovial pit.  A little time on Google made me realize this was most likely from albinism, and a subsequent visit to a local specialist and VEP test confirmed it.  So much, especially from my childhood, suddenly made sense... I really hope your diagnosis is helpful and answers questions!\n\nIt can feel lonely to get a late diagnosis,  but you are not alone. I was diagnosed with OCA1b when I was 30! That is really kind of you to comment. It is made quite a lot of things from my childhood make sense way beyond my eyesight. \n\nps. Love your sweet username :) I am so glad you got a diagnosis too even though later on in life and it is made a lot of things make sense - I can really relate to this.", "What is it like living with albinism versus living without it?  I do not know.  I have never lived without it.   That may be true, you have very likely have lived a significant portion of your life surrounded by people who do not live with albinism. Your ability to gauge what life is like without albinism is much more potent than someone(like myself) else's ability to understand what life is like with albinism as most people have never met an albino person. So using \"I have never lived without it\" is an extremely weak excuse for explaining one's experience with a disease that does not disable their ability to empathize.", "Albinism in current society ", "When you are watching a movie with someone, do they come sit by the screen with you? If you are fully sighted and happen to be reading this, can you tell me honestly; is it a reasonable request? I would very much prefer it but I have heard people say it can give you headaches? Yea idk, how is he supposed to hold my hand from back there? lol :'( Nope. She says it is \u201ctoo close.\u201d I remember being a kid and playing split screen (back when video games had that) multiplayer, I would always take one of the bottom screens so my cousins sitting further back could still see their screens.\n\nNowadays I do not watch content simultaneously with other people. If I do it tends to be streamed, so we each have our own device. Or if it is in-person it is usually something I have seen before so I do not mind sitting far back and \u201cmissing\u201d the finer details. Likewise, for new content, I sit back with the sighted person and just cue in on the audio. I can always go back and rewatch to get the finer details or scenes I may have missed; movies that show people communicating via text (Looking at you, Fault in our Stars) are the worst! Same with subtitles for foreign languages.\n\nLPT: Just date someone who is also visually impaired, so you can both sit super close to the TV :P It is Alex!!! :) OMG you have a girly now? AW SO SWEET.", "Person first language? I have heard from other disabled/neurodivergent communities (specifically the autistic community) that person first language is essentially bullshit made up to  make able bodied/neurotypical people feel better. What is your take on this? Is it better for us to call you albino/albino people or person with albinism? I think lots of people consider the word \u201calbino\u201d to be a slur, which is often used by bullies or as a shorthand for \u201cweird\u201d In popular culture. This can be especially true in parts of East Africa where albino people are subject to a lot of poor treatment or violence. \n\nEveryone should describe themselves how they want! I personally am fine saying that I am blind, but that I am a person with albinism. I prefer person with albinism as opposed to albino. Thank you for the reply, I thought I might as well ask on this subreddit rather than accidentally offending someone. I was not aware it was a slur so thank you for telling me :) Thank you for the reply :) I think back to MTV True Life, like a decade ago. They did an episode on albinism called \u201cI am an albino.\u201d Of course things have changed since then, but I always found the title interesting.\n\nFor the lay person, I would play it safe and use the person-first phrasing. Yes that adds a degree of political correctness to it, but it is the best thing you can do to be inclusive and not accidentally piss people off. \u201cAlbino\u201d is considered derogatory by some, either because that is how we would commonly describe animals with albinism but also because it is used to bully people.\n\nWith all that laid out, it is very dependent on individual people. I personally have no problem with being called an albino. I had a friend who is nickname was albinosaurus rex. I had a different friend who recounted being a young adult and walking around when someone on their front lawn called inside \u201cBetty, come look, there is an albino!\u201d Subsequently, she cannot stand being called that. So it is an individual preference, but I would suggest using person-first all the time just to be safe. That is what I do in my AMAs. Thank you for the reply, I just wanted to ask because I know some groups do not like person first language because it makes them feel like other people are tip toeing around them. I guess it really is not and never will be a one size fits all issue Thanks for checking, it is always good to ask! Generally, I have never have a problem with any language as long as the person using it has been respectful and listened to what I had to say. It seems like that describes you, so I think you will be ok either way. ;) Yup, I use 'blind' and 'person with albinism'.  My son is autistic, and he prefers that over 'person with autism'.  To each their own.\n\nAt the end of the day, I prefer 'Dave' though..... Same. Person with Albinism is definitely the preferred term. You would have to be pretty close to someone to call them \u201calbino\u201d and even then you are pushing it. \n\nFor fun, here is a video I made with my kid who has ocular albinism.   I am a person with albinism.  When you do not use people first language in this case, you are labeling that condition. I get the question all the time: are you and albino? I say, no. I am a person who just so happen to have the condition of albinism.", "Watch my social experiment. As an albino, is this how you would expect strangers to react to me?  Just the other day I was walking along and two strangers shouted \"albino\", were laughing about it together and pointing at me. It did not really bother me but I just found it weird people think that is socially acceptable behaviour. Great video btw!  I know, it is odd, I used to get it regularly.

Would love for you to check it out here:\n (", "I just got diagnosed with what my doctor called \u201cpartial albinism\u201d, I was wondering if there is a more official name for it and what the biggest symptoms are? I am very pale, paler than all my family, my eyes are lighter than all my family(blueish green), and am curious about what else it may cause!  Go to a doctor who knows better than to call any diagnosis \u201cpartial albinism\u201d. Yikes.\n\nIf you really think you might have a form of albinism, go to a specialist on ophthalmology. Different types of albinism manifest in many different ways, but one thing most of us do have in common are eye conditions such as nystagmus, strabismus, etc. If you really want to follow up on this, check with a specialist. You would be shocked by what kind of misinformation a doctor can give you on this condition if they are not well educated in it. I was at a specialist of ophthalmology she diagnosed this issue, and I put partial albinism in quotes because I could not remember what she called it. Some big word followed by albinism, and when I asked what it meant she said it was basically partial albinism. Welcome to the club. :) The National Organization for Albinism &amp; Hypopigmentation (NOAH) is an excellent resource on all things albinism. Check them out as well as all the albinism-related social media groups. It is easy to feel alone with this condition, but there is a lot of support out there. \n\nAlso keep in mind that while an ophthalmologist can diagnose albinism in general, the only way to know your specific type of albinism (OCA1a, OCA1b, OCA2, etc.) is to get genetic testing done. There are also some rare types of albinism that have other medical complications so it is worth while getting the genetic tests done to find out what type you have.", "Cognitive effects of albinism Hi everyone! I have OCA1B and have been trying to find some research on the cognitive effects of albinism. Considering that the optic nerves are misrouted, I have been curious about how it affects our neurodevelopment. There is some research to support that there is something going on, but nothing really conclusive. \n\nI am 30 and have been diagnosed very recently with a ADHD and a learning disability. I had good grades and am generally smart, but as I grew older, I felt that at times I was not \"getting\" certain things as quickly as my peers or that I was not reaching my potential despite my best efforts. My difficulties were attributed to my low vision. It turns out I have slow processing speed and a poor working memory but I compensated it for it with my verbal reasoning and fluency and general hard work and motivation. Perhaps it has nothing to do with albinism, but again, not much research is done on this. \n\nDo any of you have any learning issues? Do you get the impression that you think or process information differently than others? \n\nThanks.\n\nResources:\n\n(\n\n(\n", "skincare for PWA Hi all, I just came across this sub today and have a question.\n\nI am a 25M with OCA Type 2 and was wondering about skincare products. I have found many products (moisturiser, face wash etc.) irritate my skin and was wondering if this could be due to my albino skin, and also what products have you guys used that you would recommend? I am from the UK if that helps.\n\nTIA Try use things that are gental on your skin but honestly as a genral stuff like germolene helps sooth and help with problem areas or sore patches. But as a whole it is genraly a case of just trying things to see what helps you because everyones skin reacts differently. I use a thing called target gel by skin academy you can pick it up from home bargims for less than a pound and personaly it helps wonders. Not sure if this is much use to you but hope it can be. I have albinism and have been on a skincare journey for quite some time. Used to have terrible acne in high school and now, almost 30y/o, I am getting it together. \nDaily I use St Ives Apricot Scrub, skip the toner, and moisturize with Cetaphil day cream, which has sunscreen in it. At night I have been using Cetaphil night cream. \n\nFor Xmas my wife got me the Rhianna Fenty skin care collection. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and my skin looks so good! No acne! So I may switch to this, though its much more expensive. This collection does use a toner though which tends to dry me out. We shall see. \n\nGood luck to you! Ok so I am very obsessed with skincare, have suuuuper sensitive skin, and have albinism - so I can definitely answer this question :)\n\nHere is my routine:\n1.\tla Roche posay caring wash (this is the name of this face wash in Canada, in the US it is called hydrating wash or something like that) \n2.\t the ordinary hyaluronic acid + Cos rx snail mucin serum mixed together (for extra moisture because the moisturizer I use is very light but heavy moisturizers break me out - if you only want one of these products I would recommend the cosrx one) \n3.\tla Roche posay tol\u00e9raine sensitive fluide moisturizer \n4.\tpure jojoba oil (adding jojoba oil is a lifesaver and is my holy grail product)\n5.\tElta MD UV clear sunscreen (this is expensive but it is the only sunscreen that does not break me out and, as a PWA def cannot forget the daily sunscreen - I only use this in the AM)\n\nI only wash my face in the PM too, which is something I would also recommend unless you have oily skin and/or sweat at night. \n\nI use a few other more specialized products for my acne and acne scarring but the routine above is mostly just if you want a simple everyday skincare routine for sensitive skin. PM me if you have anymore questions :) Hi! Just a heads up, the st Ives apricot scrub is actually known to be very harsh on skin, especially if you have acne. If you are looking for a more gentle exfoliant try something with salicylic acid or lactic acid. I would recommend first aid beauty salicylic acid pads or the ordinary lactic acid serum. The lactic acid 5% could be used everyday and the first aid beauty pads could be used every other day (maaaaybe every day depending on your skin) but I would recommend starting at once a week and working your way up to see if your skin can handle it.  I know you were not looking for advice haha but just want to help :) happy to answer any skincare questions!! Ive had acne since in turned 18 (am 26 now) and have fiiiiiinally cleared my skin completely so I understand the struggle I want to eventually do a skin care routine on my channel! I will see the one product that has made the most difference in my skin has been the inky list Q10 serum - extremely soothing and nourishing. Oh but to answer your question, honestly I do not think so. I do not think that albinism makes your skin sensitive, outside of to UV light. If melanin was protective past UV protection, then you prob wouldnt see as much darker skin people with sensitive skin - but as far as I know, they have just as much sensitive skin and skin issues. I have sun damage, so I like to use soothing ingredients for that aesthetic reason. It lessens the appearance. But not all people who have albinism have sun damage, it is not inherent in the condition. Do not expose yourself under sun for a long time.\n\nThis is the only way.\n\nThus, no need for any kind of skincare or sunscreen.", "Me, as an albino. ", "Albino: social experiment - watch free  ", "How come people we are bullied for being albinos? I think albinos are so cool ngl. was there any specific reason?  You can thank the motion picture industry for vilifying people with Albinism.  And before that, the freak shows and circuses.  Because they are different, and people feel a need to make fun of someone or ostracize someone because they look different or have a disability. It is very sad, but that is just how it is in some places, unfortunately. I do not understand why people would do that?\nI guess there is some pretty messed out people out there.  I have never saw an albino personally but I think there pretty cool non the less :)\n ? That is a good point  That too. Little kids are jerks that is why.  In school, I used to get made fun of because of my Albinism. It got to be so much that my mom had to start homeschooling me. \n\nNow in high school, no one really cares nor pays much attention to me (probably because I go to a blind school), and in some occasions, I get people in public asking about my Albinism, and a lot compliment my hair, which is nice. :)\n\nAnyways, the reason I think we get bullied is, yeah, we are different....  My son is 17 and has never been bullied by other kids , but has issues with adults.\n\nBecause of his albinism , he has severe light sensitivity and wear sunglasses inside,  outside and a night. Lots of comments that he is being rude. Similarly , lots of \"he does not look blind!\"\nI was trying to explain his visual impairments to one of his teachers who said \"that is curious because he can see his phone.\" Lots of visually impaired kids are on their phones like every other teen.\n\nMost of the time, simple information helps.", "White Canes Hello all, I have some questions that I listed below regarding long canes. I was hoping you all would be able to help me answer my questions, or share experiences using or not using a long cane. \n\nMy name is Caelin, I live in Nova Scotia, and I have oculocutaneous albinism. My corrected visual acuity is 20/200. I have recently been doing some research about canes, unsure whether they would be a useful tool for me or not. \n\nHow do you use your cane? How did you get training to use it?  \n\n (in Nova Scotia, all the students are taught O &amp; M skills based on what the APSEA  O &amp; M teachers say is needed. Currently, I know how to use an ID cane, but that is not much good for mobility.) \n\nI have gone my whole life without using a cane most of the time because I live in a small town where I am driven everywhere.  How would I be able to advocate to get this training, and articulate the ways it could benefit me? How do I convince my family that this would be a useful skill?  \n\n How does it help despite having a lot of usable vision?  \n\nWhere I live, I would be the only one in the visually impaired community with my levels of vision to use a long cane, should I pursue it. Do these norms make it difficult in any way?  \n\n Is there anything else you can tell me or you think would be important for me to know with regards to canes? From my own research, most people who use canes are often profoundly visually impaired. They primarily use canes to help identify surfaces in front of them as they move about. You ever wonder why intersections have those big bumpy squares before the crosswalks? They are for blind people. So when I did O&amp;M training I was taught how to sweep (or also tap) from side to side to help discern what the sidewalk surface was like in front of me.\n\nWith the exception of the depth perception issue, I would wager most people with albinism have good enough vision to be able to navigate without needing a cane. We can see where intersections are, identify possible bumps and obstacles on a sidewalk; though random unmarked steps can be troublesome I would suppose.\n\nI do know there is a small subset of people with albinism who use canes strictly for identification. The vast majority of the general public does not really know what albinism is or that it involves visual impairment, but the vast majority of the world does know that white cane = blind. So having it for ID purposes helps, I am assuming, at stop sign controlled intersections. I *hate* that song and dance where you and a car arrive at the intersection at the same time and it is a game of who goes first. If you had a cane, the driver would probably relax and let me do my thing. Really, crossing streets is the only tangible benefit I can think of. My O&amp;M instructor did tell me a funny story about someone using one to get through a crowd easily since people just naturally want to move out of a blind person\u2019s way.\n\nSo like I said I got my training through O&amp;M and I figured it is something you could get if you really advocated for it. Personally, I really hated it. Using a cane was embarrassing and I refused to do it outside of O&amp;M training. It does not accurately reflect my actual abilities, and ultimately I just do not need it. But if you feel you need it, even at least for identification purposes, then you could definitely make your case. I am in a similar situation. I grew up in a small town and my vision is also near 20/200. I do not use a white cane day-to-day, but I do have one and use it when I am somewhere new or very busy (like an airport) or somewhere where I think making others aware of my vision will be necessary. I also find it can be useful but also annoying when hiking (all those shadows and uneven surfaces) or at night when the lighting is not suitable. \n\nI received O&amp;M training when I was young, though, and I am glad of it. If you want justification to tell others, the go-to reasons are independence, safety, and \"just-in-case you need to use it\" scenarios. \n\nAlso, TBH, feeling like I am \"in-between\" is really tricky and annoying and most people just will not get it, so it does feel like you have to pick a side of passing or being blind. It is not really for the right reasons, but I find the inconvenience of the cane to outweigh the benefits most times, as it takes up a hand, it is clunky to carry when not in use, and I like to do things like listen to music with headphones and ride a bike and do not want to deal with all the people who think those activities are mutually exclusive to using a cane or being blind. My vision is a bit worse than some have mentioned here, correctable to 20/400 indoors but not so good outside. I have pretty severe Photophobia and horrible depth perception. I grew up in a small town as well where driving is required to get anywhere. I learned around age 18 or 19 that I could use a white cane. I researched, ordered one, and learned the basics of using it. I even flew for the first time using a white cane. \n\nIdentification: It is a huge help in identification. The general public knows a white cane means blindness, even if they do not realize that blindness is a huge spectrum. So when people see it, they are willing to help. I got help finding my terminal as I traveled. It is also helpful for when you may ask what seems like a dumb question to someone with good vision. \n\nOutdoors/Photophobia: I have horrible Photophobia, so my vision is severely impacted by the sun and even on some overcast days (as many of you can understand). If I am traveling independently, a cane is a must for me due to Photophobia.\n\nDepth perception: Because of my poor acuity and depth perception, I will often not see stairs or unlevel ground, holes, and more. So, again, if I am traveling independently, it is extremely helpful. \n\nI have yet to get proper O&amp;M training because I live in a rural area. I am supposed to this year, but with everything that is going on, I have not been able to yet. I highly recommend advocating to get training, because there may come a day where you will want to travel independently, and the cane will help you with the areas I have listed above. I find that organizing my thoughts as I have done here can be helpful for making a case in advocating or just informing others. \n\nHaving said all that, I do not use my cane all the time because I am almost always traveling with someone else, because driving is such a requirement here. It is perfectly normal to feel stuck \"in-between\" the blind and sighted worlds. Many of us feel that way. I have written an article on the topic as well if you are interested. I have been working on information on my website and my YouTube channel about the white cane as well and my struggles with using it and the process of getting my own training. I will link the article below. You can find my YouTube channel on my website as well. Hope this was helpful.\n\n", "Hey there! Please fill out this poll. I am very curious about it.  I am curious about why you are curious! I did not study computer science,  but learnt to code for my job. I did study computer science, but also am curious what inspired this poll I made an assumption that we as a group tend to heavily rely on technology, and cs is one of those careers that has a lot of flexibility for people with relatively poor vision if they enjoy daily problem solving.\n\nI also believe that we tend to struggle more than average in consuming class material due to the nature of how they are formatted (Reading from distance) This probably has forced many of us to come up with creative solutions to such problems through tail and error, which could probably make us better problem solvers /debuggers (lmao) and cs is filled with that.\n\nMaybe I should have asked a more general question (Ex: Do you enjoy research and critical thinking) which is less specific and there are many other majors besides cs that rely on hardcore critical thinking and analysis.\n\nHonestly I would love to make another poll regarding the most common career pathways that we take as a group. While a lot of people with albinism I know do go into CS and stuff, I know far more that go into psychology/social work\u2014tying back into the critical thinking aspect of what you are thinking about. I think your thought process has some truth in it! I do think I am a better problem-solver because of albinism. We have to solve a lot of extra problems compared to the \u201cwild type\u201d people, so we have a lot more practice ;) I do not do CS, but I have always ended up having jobs where I had to learn code for research in bioinformatics or use servers to train others..... not intentional as someone who is a PWA!

It started when I was 12 years old. I am 32 now and still have faint scars from years of picking. I still a pimple here and there depending on what I eat. Just give it time. Thanks for the reply,\nYeah I guess I will let the acne do it is thing.  Most of the time it does not cause problems.  As much as I know, even people who is has no albinism (I mean almoat any person) can have some acnes in their older ages like 40 even 50. It is very related with what you eat. mood and dirt can effect it too (mood can effect more) like stress and sadness can cause some of them to occur in almost any age.  Not every albinos has many acne problem either. My suggestion is, care what you eat (as less fat and carbohydrates as possible) try to be happy almost every time ( is also my motto in life) and  wash your face at least 3 times a day. You will see a different.\nI had some too many acnes between 5th grade and 3th year of highcshool. My friends were asking if I have a medical skin condition or something or did I ever went to a doctor for this :) but after highschool my skin got normal and become a rather handsome fella :)  Hey, thanks for the reply. \nYeah that is true mood can affect acne and I try to keep happy, also I do try and wash my face 2 times a day. \nYou are right about my diet haha it is not the best. But it has changed for 10 years but my acne has not gone. I made an appointment with the doctor just to be safe haha It is always good to see the doc. My funny story was; I asked my mum who is also a biologist when will these acnes will go away and she said 3 years. Then I literally counted that three years almost day by day. After it passed I asked why do I still have this \"curse\" when she said it can still take 2 years or more :D then it sarted to fade when I stop caring them. Getting used to living with them is best thing you can do, in worst case scenario you will be happy  with or withouth them. Yeah true. I am not too angry about my acne but it causes pain sometimes so i thought maybe i should try and fix it.\n\nHaha yeah my mum said it will go...that was when i was 13..now im almost 23 and its still here \ud83d\ude02 I am albino and started getting really bad acne when I was about 14. I used a combination of topical creams and antibiotics and my face cleared up by the time I was 16. Unfortunately, when I was about 18 it came back even worse. I tried creams and antibiotics again and they did not work so well. I decided to go on accutane when I was 20 (or whatever the legal version of it is nowadays lol). That cleared up my face in about 5 months. I have got some scarring on my face from picking but it is not even noticable compared to the acne that was there before.\n\nIf nothing else is working, you might want to check out Accutane. I do not really recommend unless it is your very last resort. Accutane is one harsh drug and unless you are prepared to spend 6 months with skin and lips as dry as the desert, it sucks. Also if you are physically active, it will give you some joint discomfort. That being said though, it will get rid of your acne so it is ultimately up to you.\n\n  \n Hey, Sethseib, just a quick heads-up:  \n**noticable** is actually spelled **noticeable**. You can remember it by **remember the middle e**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. Hey, Mr. Bot! You advise people to **remember the middle e** in this word (which is correct), but you are ignoring a lot of words which should not contain a middle E at all, including many words with **-cate**, like `delicate`, `indicate`, `educated`, `duplicate` and `allocate`. Stop \"educateing\" people about remembering the middle E as a general rule, because there are a lot of cases where it does not apply.\n\nThe bot above likes to give structurally useless spelling advice, and it is my job to stop that from happening.

Hi so I am not sure if this is where I should be posting this, but I do not have albinism and I am writing about a character with albinism in a fantasy setting. I have been doing a lot of research and yesterday I made a draft of the character's design on a character creator thing I found, and I wanted to get input about whether there was anything inaccurate about the design or that I should know. \n\n( is what the character looks like (the hat is a stand in for a hood like ( which the character uses for sun protection, but the only other head covering option in the character creator was a cowboy hat). She also usually has a version of sunglasses, but that was not in the character creator either. Sorry again if this is not the right place to post this; I am new to reddit.

I also have a lot of mental health issues that have not helped.  Long story short, I have been a bit of a failure-to-launch in my life.  I dropped out of college, have a really spotty employment history, and I am getting old enough that it looks ridiculous to have only worked about 10% of the time I have been an adult.  It is a story, I am sure, that many of you are familiar with.  I do not drive, so I have a hard time getting to work, and I live in an area with almost no jobs other than manufacturing.  Transportation is a HUGE issue for me.\n\nMy last major job ended in a lay-off in 2016.  I have been making a concerted effort lately to get back to work.  I returned to school.  I will be graduating in December if all goes well with a computer science BS. \n\nI have been looking for entry-level tech jobs (pre-covid as well) and I have been having absolutely no luck.  I really think it is my job history that is doing it.\n\nSo, my question is, have any of you ever found a way to explain to an employer that albinism has affected your lifestyle and employment?  I do not really feel like it is an easy topic to bring up in a naturally-flowing conversation, and I also worry that it will result in discrimination anyway.  \n\nI also feel like my inability to make eye contact really throws people off, even in zoom interviews where people are not really looking into your \"eyes\" anyway.  I am really sick of feeling like this is holding me back.  \n\nThanks I feel like bringing up the topic during the interview when they ask about job history. Tell them you know your job history is sparse but that is not due to your lack of trying. Explain you are a dedicated worked but albinism has caused difficulty in your employment history. You could also put a little blurb about this in a cover letter. \n\nBest of luck to you I would either mention it in a cover letter, or get my references to mention it.  (When I was applying for jobs I mean).", "Celebrating son\u2019s albinism or to keep disorder to myself for now? Hi,\n\nMy son was born with AROA. This means that he does have pigmentation in his hair and skin (albeit it is very light) He is almost a year old.\n\nHe has nystagmus. People tend to notice upon meeting him. So we get questions about his eyes and ive been weary of announcing his albinism to others. He is also blonde haired and blue eyed and my partner and I both have dark hair and eyes. So this also stands out.\n\nPart of me thinks I should keep this under wraps and only let him disclose it, should he choose to.\n\nAnother part of me thinks that since he has a visible condition, maybe we should embrace it publicly? It feels like if we do not tell anyone it almost seems like we are hiding it, and I do not want my son to feel shamed or different.\n\nI am probably over thinking things. What do you guys think? What my parents did was not tell people about my albinism, but my nystagmus. I only found out at the age of 15 that I had oculacutaneous albinism. Before then I only knew about my nystagmus. Thanks for the input! Do you like the way they handled things? Would you rather have known earlier on, or do you like that they waited? I have known I was albino since I was diagnosed at ~4-5, but of course did not really comprehend what it meant beyond \u201cyou have to wear glasses and avoid the sun now\u201d until later. It is not visibly obvious and I can pass for a typical pale, blond, and blue eyed north European. I never saw it as a very big deal, just the way I happened to be born because I got a bad roll of the genetics dice. I have never hid it before, but I also do not really talk about it unless asked Gotcha. If given the choice, would you have preferred to tell others you have albinism on your own or were/are you alright with your parents telling others?\n\nWe get a lot of \u201che does not look like either of you\u201d and then the comments with the eyes so just wondering if others with albinism find it inappropriate to disclose it without his permission My parents handled things really well in regards to my albinism - particularly because 2 of my 3 older siblings had it before me. \n\nI knew about my nystagmus from a young age, and I did not know about my albinism. To me this was a good choice as nystagmus was the condition that effected me the most. It was not the albinism that was causing the involuntary movement of my eyes - it was the nystagmus. There is a major difference, you know?\n\nPeople tend to have a very general view of what albinism looks like. They think of people with white hair and red eyes. Most people do not even realize that albinism commonly results in blondeish / redish hair and blue eyes - and I think that is the reason my parents did not tell anyone, or even me about my albinism. \n\nI found out about my oculacutaneous albinism at 15. When I was 15, I underwent eye surgery for my nystagmus. Since I missed school for a few days I had to hand in a doctor\u2019s note. On the doctor\u2019s note it mentioned that I had oculacutaneous albinism. I was surprised, but I did some research and it made sense. It was not until me finding it out on my own that my parents told me. My mom was reluctant in admitting it tho as....well...people view albinism in a certain light - and my mom never saw me in that light. Nonetheless I think 15 was the perfect age for me to find out about my albinism. If I found out any earlier I might have been self conscious about it, and if I found out any later I may have been mad that I did not know sooner. \n\nBefore your child is mature enough to understand his albinism, you can just tell him about his nystagmus - I feel that is a great strategy. Now, when you feel your child has reached the level of maturity to become aware of his albinism, will be entirely up to you. \n\nThe only things you can really do in regards to albinism is make sure that accommodations are met in regards to nystagmus. My parents made sure that by the time I was in school, I was given some help due to my bad vision. Another thing my parents did that I am thankful for was taking me to get the surgery done to tone down the intensity of my nystagmus. After the surgery proper started pointing out my nystagmus way less.\n\nYour son is lucky to be born in a time where nystagmus is a well researched-upon condition with some options available to treat his condition to make his life easier. Surgery has improved over the years and is a great option to help treat nystagmus.\n\nLike many things in life when it comes to raising a kid, it is all a learning experience. You will learn how to talk about your child\u2019s condition on your own terms, and eventually you will be an expert on the subject. I wish you the best of luck in the future!\n\n(sorry for the long response lol) Yea id publicly embrace it. \nOf course there is a way to be excessive with that, so you know do not go buck wild LOL but yes I agree that that would foster shame", "Just saying hi, and I love you all!

I do not meet that many other people with albinism on a regular basis, but I have met people with significantly better and worse eyesight than me. \n\n\nAlso a note on language.

Ideally, we would record the conversation and include it in our presentation, but it does not have to be. We would then have a simple conversation and I would ask a few questions.\n\nI would be very happy if someone would get in touch, just write me if you have any questions.\n\nStay healthy", "albino or person with albinism? which do you prefer?\n\n( I am fine with both. Depends. Instead of \"he is albino\" I prefer he has albinism. The former sounds like I am another species. I really hated being called Albino as if it was my name. It depends on how it is said really - when I was younger people used to call me albino in a joking manner, which I did not really like - but if it is being said with no bad intention I do not really mind. More often than not tho, I prefer person with albinism. thank you for telling me what u think! thanks, i appreciate your opinion :D thanks for your opinion!

I am just a normal guy, and one of my dreams is to marry an albino girl, but of course, it is a very rare ocurring event... so I wonder, if I can know some of your stories,\n\nIf you are not married the story of how you met bf / gf will do the trick :D What do you mean by normal?  We people with albinism are people not a condition.  And 3 STFU. We are about 1 in 20,000 people, so your odds of meeting a woman with albinism just randomly are pretty low. Let us say that you have a large metro area with 6 million people. (1/20,000)\\*6,000,000=300 people with albinism in that metro area. Roughly 150 of those will be female. Then you have to consider what percentage of those 150 will be in your age range, heterosexual, single, and meeting any other criteria that you may have (common interests, body type, life goals, etc). \n\nPeople with albinism tend to be visually impaired or legally blind. Are you okay with having a blind partner? There is also nystagmus. Sighted people often get freaked out by that - basically, our eyes move constantly and involuntarily. There are also the effects of institutionalized discrimination against people with disabilities, so your potential fair lady may not have a great education or a great job. She may also have a trauma history - children with disabilities are victimized at much higher rates than nondisabled children, and adults with disabilities are more likely to be victims of crime. It is also not unusual for parents to reject, neglect, and/or abuse disabled children. Then there is bullying, harassment, and discrimination in the workforce. \n\nLet us say you get married and have kids. Your odds of having a child with albinism are much higher if your partner has albinism, so if you are thinking of long-term plans, those may have to include genetic counseling and your ability to raise a child with a disability. \n\nIf you are just after a fair-haired lady, you might want to look in the direction of Norway. If you are comfortable with disabilities and the accompanying  baggage, your best bet may be to check out disability dating sites, and to be open about your preference. Some women will be uncomfortable with that - those women probably would not be a good match for you. Some women may be okay with that, and there is where you are mostly likely to meet the lady you are looking for. Sorry if I offended you, I meant \"regular\" or \"non-special in any way\",  \nI really never expected such a reaction   \nnot normal does not necessarily mean \"bad\", something unique, special or extraordinary is not normal by definition   \nmaybe you thought I mean it in an offensive way, but that is not the case  \n\n\nmaybe is my mistake, i should have used \"regular guy\" instead. 1.

Yes, I am okay to have a blind partner and I know about the nystagmus, im not afraid of involuntary eye movement.\n3. yes, I am aware that they could have had a bad life or bad experiences just because of their appearance; I am unofficially (aka not a degree) learning about therapy (and how to help people in general)\n4. yes, I am okay to have a child with a disability, but I will (in this hypothetical case) have a wife that already had a life with that problems, even if I do not know something she would help too\n5. I do not know if the disability dating sites is a good option, considering that most albinos do not see themselves as disabled, like a person in a wheelchair would,(i mean, how many of the albinos here try using them?) but I might give it a try\n6. here I just wanted to read some wholesome stories, but people keep judging me for what I posted instead.  \n\n\nEDIT: Grammar Dude, I am not judging you. I apologize for coming across that way. I do not think there is anything wrong with being attracted to people with albinism. But a lot of people who are do not know about the disability that comes with it. I sincerely wish you the best of luck in finding the right partner for you. Thanks mate No worries, but I will give you a heads up: You probably want to avoid the word \"albino\" - a lot of people consider it a slur. I am not personally bothered by it, but some people really do not like it. The preferred term is \"people with albinism.\" The reason is that some people believe \"albino\" reduces someone to their diagnosis, whereas \"person with albinism\" emphasizes their personhood.\n\nI do not know if it is that way outside of the US, but you are going to be interacting with a lot of Americans on reddit.\n\nEdit: To clarify, I am American, but I am from the south. Being called \"albino\" down here is similar to being called \"homosexual\" or \"handicapped\" - you have to consider the age, accent, and apparent intent of the person involved. If a 30 year old dude from Atlanta is talking about \"homosexuals\", he is probably the type to be holding picket signs at pride parades. If your 80 year old Alabama granny says it, she might very well be saying \"It is so sweet that them two homosexual boys found love. The good Lord made somebody for everybody.\" Generally down here, if somebody calls you \"albino\", they do not mean anything by it - that is just the term that they know. Hence, I am not bothered by it, but some other people are. Wow, i did not know that...  \nim a spanish speaker and here we say \"un albino\"(male) or \"una albina\"(female) or \"gente albina\"( \u0336a\u0336l\u0336b\u0336i\u0336n\u0336o\u0336s\u0336  *people with albinism* as a group) and is not offensive...  \nand when i try to translate it with google it only gives me \"albino\"  \n   \nto me is as weird as saying \"people who is hair color is kind of orange\" instead of redhead\n\nbut anyway, thanks for the advice.  \n\n\nbtw...\n\n&gt; I am not personally bothered by it \n\n...are you an  \u0336a\u0336l\u0336b\u0336i\u0336n\u0336o\u0336  *person with albinism*? I am. I added an edit to my previous post to clarify the language. I am from the south, and down here \"albino\" usually is not used as a term of abuse. It is just the word that most people know for us. \n\nI am afraid I cannot offer any heartwarming partner stories though. I am asexual/aromantic. I consider that to be a stroke of luck - a lot of people with disabilities are perceived as asexual. I just happen to actually be that way.

I am sure she is consenting, but why the fuck did you post porn on a family subreddit?\n\nYou dirty, disgusting fetishist.

How does that prove your point?\n\n3. still have not justified why you called me a pedophile and keep avoiding aswering the question I called you a nonce, not a pedophile. You went on here asking about wholesome stories. but turns out you are an alibino fetishist who compared people with alibinism to a glitch in Pokemon (fucking seriously??). Work it out.\n\nYou are no longer welcome in this space with your albino fetish. get out. 1.So what does \"nonce\" means to you?  \nfrom what i know, you called me a pedophile in a UK slang  \nor an \"arbitrary number\" In cryptography   \nim neither of those so please explain what do you mean with that word.  \n\n\n2. Is having a fetish inherently bad?  \ni did not ask at any point for nsfw shit, only wholesome stories, nothing more.  \ni also moderate (   \ndoes that make me a bookworm?  \ni do not even like books that much, but i have an specific taste  \nis having an specific taste in books something bad?   \nexactly, neither is having a specific taste in porn\n\n3. i am comparing the rarity of events to happen  \ndo you know how rare is that a glitch becomes a functional part of a game without breaking it?  \nis not very often, neither albinism\n\ni am comparing probability, not value  \nalso, have you realize how often genetic conditions are deadly or life threatening?  \nmayor problems with albinism are social, not something like a sudden heart attack\n\n  \ni admire both for that.  \n\n\nbut you do not care because already have make the narrative in your mind that im a bad person in some way  \nyou hate me and do not even know why, you just do it, and find any excuse  \n\n\nso again; what does \"nonce\" means to you? &gt; 1.So what does \"nonce\" means to you?\n\na pervert who gets off on fetishing people with alibinism - although based on your username, probably a 'gato' as well?\n\nseriously what the fuck is wrong with you, why do not you just come out and say what you want, which is a nice albina who you can fuck, perhaps when you are not in a gay albino threesome (i saw your post history).\n\nyou should be ashamed of all this lol You pathetic ignorant,   \ncannot even admit that does not know the meaning of a word that just used  \n\n\nI do not want to fuck an albina, as i said earlier; sex is not relevant to me  \n\n\nAnd, you tried to insult me by calling me gay?  \nReally? now you are homophobic?  \n\n\n&gt; You dirty, disgusting fetishist. You are obsessed with sex which is probably because you are not getting any.\n\nAlso very contradictory saying i do not have sex, and then saying i have treesomes.  \n\n\nbtw; \"gato\" means \"cat\" in spanish Yes, I know exactly what gato means.

I have been reading up, and learned (for instance) that vision issues are implicit in the diagnosis, should we be prepared for any ADA accommodations? As a rule, my office is very tolerant/accepting/professional so I am not worried about anyone making tacky comments about their appearance, but I also want to make sure we do not inadvertently say/do anything offensive/upsetting, and that we maintain an accessible space. Any tips/recommendations? \n\nThank you! Personally, I would prefer to be treated as if I was a perfectly normal person, unless I stated otherwise.\n\nFor example, I work off of coloured paper and larger text for schoolwork, but aside from that, I like to be treated as if I am the same as others.\n\nI hope that helps a little, BUT, bear in mind that some people may have a different stance or a different opinion. Yo, OCA office worker here. Most vision loss associated with the diagnosis is correctable. In my case I have other things going on so I had to speak to tech support to get a screen reader approved for installation.\n\nA good way to handle this is simply to ask if there is anything they need to work. That opens the floor for them to talk about anything else that might help that is not directly related to albinism. For example, I have a bad back too, so raising my desk height helped a lot.\n\nGlare is a huge problem for us so find a desk for them in the darkest corner you can and face them away from the light. Do not give them reflective screens either.\n\nThanks for being a non gender specific bro. :) Nanny for four years of an 8yr old with OCA. What I have noticed is that she does not mind people saying things like, \u201cwow your hair is beautiful!\u201d, but she does not seek out the attention. It seems like she would rather not have people point out her physical differences. She wants to be treated like she can see just as well as anyone else, but is really thankful when I see her struggling to see something and I make a suggestion that might help her situation. For example-sitting at the kitchen table (in front of six windows) trying to do homework, but her face is nearly touching the paper because it is too bright and she cannot see well, I ask her if it would help if I close the shades. \nOr when we were sorting pennies by date, I suggested that she get one of her hand held magnification devices to see the dates more clearly. \n\nI am guessing that an adult will probably be more equipped to ask for what they need and to be more willing to ask for help when they need it, but things like closing shades on a sunny day, increasing the font on flyers around the office, and keeping communal supplies in the same place as to avoid confusion and frustration will all be helpful. I fully intend on treating them like anyone else, I just want to be mindful of what accommodations might be appropriate, or things I might not think of that would be inappropriate. Or should I not act any differently unless they mention something specifically? Just trying to be mindful The thing with OCA is that symptoms vary widely and what one person struggles with may not be an issue for another. Also, people with OCA often \"do not look albino \" so (quietly and respectfully ) being prepared and aware is probably very appreciated.\n\nMy son has has OCA . His visual acuity is ok but his light sensitivity is such that he has to wear sunglasses all the time , even indoors.  I think for  him, the most socially difficult thing has been people assuming he is trying to \"look cool\" by wearing sunglasses indoors . He has struggled with this with teachers in school and from security guards who assume he is trying to hide his identity! I would recommend just asking if they would appreciate anything that you could do to help them with their eyesight, but I would recommend making sure that you have a positive relationship with them first, as to ensure that they feel comfortable talking about the matter. Also, if/when you ask them, I would recommend not asking in front of everybody else so that it is not embarrassing for them, as different people will be more or less comfortable talking about it.\n\nHope that helps! My advice is not to make and explicit (or implicit) assumptions about how well your new coworker can see. I have OCA, and I am a cocktail waitress, ride my bike around the city, and I read normal font, though it does strain my eyes. Other people with OCA have to use text to speech software, large print, and use a marker cane. Just let this person tell you what they need, and do your best to find a balance between not offering over-the-top assistance, and not being careless about what they need. For instance, only provide large print materials if they say they need it. They might be able to see normal font just fine, or they might have a magnifier or some other technology that they prefer over large print. They know best what works best. \n\nHowever, there are some small things that might help. For instance, do not assume that they can see something very far away that you are pointing at. Making a small effort to describe something in the distance can be very helpful. For example, rather than simply pointing at a stapler across the room, just say \"it is on the table next to the big potted plant.\"\n\nAnother thing to consider - if you are showing them a paper or a computer screen that you are both looking at, they might not be able to see it as well as you can from a distance. Offering to provide another copy or for them to scoot a bit closer might be welcome.\n\nOf course, all of these things are best done discreetly, and you should always try to find out what they need rather than assuming. I can personally say that over-compensating can be just as unhelpful and embarrassing as neglecting my needs. For instance, I have had a number of professors, who I know had only the best intentions, make a production out of presenting me with giant, over-sized xeroxes of notes or readings, sometimes in front of other students. Not only do I not need giant copies of notes, they are embarrassing and I had no where to put them. I had already arranged for what I needed, and I would have been much happier if they had trusted me to obtain what I needed or if they had asked ahead of time.\n\nAgain, it comes down to finding a line between making your office accommodating and being intrusive. Even as an adult with a great deal of experience advocating for myself, it is sometimes hard for me to speak up and ask for what I need. Sometimes I choose to deal with a certain level of inconvenience and discomfort because I would rather do that than go through the hassle of making different arrangements or dealing with sometimes condescending or unhelpful people. Everyone has their own set of needs, and their own experiences and comfort with advocating for themselves. Ultimately, though, your best bet is to make it known that you are here to help, and let them take the lead in deciding what they need.", "I need advice about vision effecting work and assistive technology ", "Sharing my experiences growing up with albinism in a YouTube short.  Great video, thanks for making this! Amd thank you for watching this! If i could give you a billion likes I would. \u2764\ufe0f", "Post Secondary Navigation Hey everyone! My name is Ravneet and I will soon be going to university. I am really nervous regarding how I will navigate. I just want to know your experiences as people with albinism. How do you guys deal with things like transportation, getting accommodations and even maybe living on your own? I am not sure where you will be going to university, but, where I live (Canada) there is a disability service office (or another name) at every university.  They help with stuff like that.\n\nSo, they will help you if you need maybe extra time on tests, or maybe a note taker, or something like that.\n\nTransportation, well, I take the bus to work, but when I was going to school I took the bus.  I also ride a bike.  \n\nSource me, I am a prof, and I have albinism. I agree with the other commenter. At least in the states, most universities have an office for accommodations. All of my class syllabi had the information for the office on them, but you can always ask your professors. I also always liked to let the professor know of my accommodations too instead of relying on the office to communicate the information. \n\nAs far as transportation, I walked everywhere but I had a small campus. Though most large campuses my friends went to had a really good bus system that most students used. Some campuses, like mine, had a transportation service that you could request a ride from. They could take you into town to go grocery shopping or to the bank. Mine was through our campus safety department but I think this was because we were a small college. \n\nAs far as living on my own, I thought it was pretty easy/was not a difficult adjustment. Is there anything you are specifically wondering about living on your own? Thank you so much. I live in Canada as well. This does help a lot. I am allways scared of the unknown so having this information is for sure a help. Also do you tell the univercity before you apply of after you apply and get accepted regarding your vision problems? Thanks a lot for replying. This really does help. Regards to living on my own there is this whole concept of safety. It is already hard for anyone to navigate things in a new city so being visually impared makes it harder for sure. I guess the whole getting from place to place is the thing that really scares me as I will have to do everything on my own. Even going place to place during the night when it is hard for me to see. Does getting around just take time to get use to? You do that after acceptance.  They are not going to care one way or the other about your disability as far as acceptance.  They will accommodate you.  They have to, and, honestly, they will be happy to.\n\nDuring orientation week you will get all kinds of info about this.  You will get the help you need.  Depending on where you go to school you may have academic advising to pick courses and stuff before the year starts.  You can tell your advisor about your vision, they will know what to do.\n\nI used to go up to profs after the first class and tell them about my vision.  People often come and tell me about accommodations.  However, you do not have to, that will be handled by disability services, they will tell your profs.\n\nYou could always take psychology at Algoma University in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and be taught by someone with albinism....\n\n\n\n(Shameless plug).\n\nIn all honesty, if you want to PM me I can give you my email and you can ask any more in depth questions. If you have a phone, you have a GPS.  That does wonders.\n\nNow when I was your age, which was, well, umm the 1980s, we did not carry computers in our pockets, it was much harder.\n\nYou will meet a lot of people in first year, university rocks.  People will be happy to help you out.  You will be amazed at how much people grow up between oh 17 and 18. I had struggled to find my way around during my first few days and I had mentioned it to the person in charge of our accommodations, and she was then able to meet me a few days before each semester to show me where my classes, professors's offices, etc were, which I find really helpful.\n\nWhenever I go off campus, I will usually try to find a friend willing to go with me. Yeah for sure tech is big! Thanks for your support Thank you that for sure helps. Thank you very much. It is very cool that you teach physiology! I would love to learn more. :) To put my answer into context, I am almost 50 years old now. I left home for university at 18 and studied in both the United States and Europe. I married at 29. I have traveled around the U.S. and internationally both on my own and with my family. Throughout the years navigating a university campus, a grocery store, shopping center, airport, train station, or large city like New York, Dublin, or Berlin, I find my approach to be relatively the same.\n\nFor about the last 40 years I have relied very extensively on a monocular telescope with extra-short focus. I currently use one with 8 power magnification and 30mm field of view. With its extra-short focus (12 inches or 30cm), I can read all manner of signs, I can see presentations and whiteboards in classrooms, I can read printed maps, schedules, and forms, and I can find things in shops. It is an essential tool; without it, I would be in serious trouble, so, needless to say, I have a couple of backups lying around.\n\nThe other skill I found to be invaluable is the ability to read maps. Campus maps, train maps, public transport maps\u2014does not matter. I learned to read printed maps before GPS was available, and that monocular I mentioned above made it possible. With that I could plan road trips for the family, spanning hundreds or thousands of kilometers, or get myself from the U.S. to where I was living in Europe. Whether we are going to the rural, mountainous parts of our state, traveling for a day trip to someplace like New York, or traveling cross-country, I always plan ahead: how do we get there, start to finish. These days, GPS units/apps and the Internet make it **so much easier** to explore an area and to plan ahead before going there.\n\nJust keep in mind that you will not be the only one trying to figure out how to navigate a university and university life. You will share that in common with all other new students when you arrive. They will be just as lost and confused as you are, whether they have good vision or not. Many will be on their own for the first time, too, so you can bond over those new adventures and help each other out. So do not be afraid to ask for help!\n\nI always recommend approaching professors and telling them first-hand what your visual issues are, what you will be doing to address limitations, and what you require of them. At my university, professors appreciated self-advocacy, especially if it spared them a visit from the office of accommodations. Hopefully those offices are better today than they were in my day, but, regardless, I still promote self-advocacy. I still do this today in the workplace, whether I have a new supervisor or I have a new junior employee reporting to me. On some rare occasions I have had teachers/professors who were very unsupportive or actually refused to let me be in their classes. Given how illegal that was/is, there were swift and immediate consequences for them.\n\nI also strongly recommend that you always bring your own accommodations. Magnification aids, like that monocular I keep talking about. When you run into limitations\u2014and you will\u2014find ways to overcome it. It could be an issue with magnification, perhaps with light sensitivity. Get creative. Brainstorm, ask around online, talk with a low vision specialist, do whatever you can to overcome it, understanding that sometimes there just is no viable solution because the laws of physics limit what can be done with optics. I have done electrical work, plumbing, woodworking, minor construction projects on the family farm, computer repair, network installations. I work on cars with my son. I have always been able to find ways to make those things accessible to me. One thing I have never been able to make work is welding because we cannot add magnification to a welder's mask that would let me see what I am doing at a safe distance. It just does not work. So I gave up and let my son do it instead. It can be hard to admit that something is just not possible, but just keep all other accomplishments in mind, and it will be fine.

I will be going for my masters in Uk \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 I am really nervous I do not know what to expect when I get to Uk \nIt was a real struggle for me while I was in University! Albino in Nigeria(Africa) generally are treated like trash Universities here in Nigeria do not have other provisions for albinos like me so I struggled so much. Glasses given to me by doctors had no effect what so ever but fortunately for me, we do more of materials/handout so I was able to read on my own anyhow I want it.  After I graduate I could not get a job!\nTo get a job in Nigeria as an albino is very very difficult! I am sure they do not even employ an albino herein Nigeria\nso I decided to further my education in a more accepting environment even though I am scared I do not know what to expect, questions like\ud83d\udc47\nHow do I cope in a new environment?\nWill people want to be friends with me?\nCan I get a job?\nHow do I concentrate in school with my low vision?\nCan you guys advise me\ud83d\ude4f honestly no one understands me, this is the only community I think understands", "Need advice. niece/grand daughter with albinism (I am helping post this on behalf of my mom)\n\nI have a niece/ grand daughter (under a year old) who has Albinism. While she has great parents and doctor, I was wondering if there was anything from your own childhoods growing up that you would suggest we either do or avoid. \n\nWe are keeping her protected from the sun while we are outside, and we do not know how blurred her vision is. But we want to set her up to have a childhood where she does not develop a complex about being born \u2018different\u2019. \n\nWe are be thankful for any insight or recommendations you guys might have. Thank you! I think keeping her out of the sun is a great start so long as it is what she wants. It is important that she understands that keeping her skin healthy will really help in the long run. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do that will make her not realize that she is different. It is best if you rip that bandaid off sooner rather than later and try to show her ways she can embrace her albinism. As a 23 year old male with albinism, I wish I got to look more into fashion and cosmetics that can help me stand out even more than I already do. I also wish I could have seen a dermatologist growing up as a kid to teach me and my parents ways to take even better care of my skin. Finally just be a great family member, ask her how is she is feeling and make sure she does not feel alone (: These days there are all kinds of products to help us albinos like UV clothes, sunscreen, prescription sunglasses, widebrim hats, etc. With these, I never let my albinism hold me back from living normally. The best thing you can do for her is stop the sun from damaging her skin before it happens. I did not do as good a job as I should have, and now at 20 I am already starting to pay the price That is a really good idea! \n\nI know my brother had said they would be okay helping her use henna to dye her hair if she asked as a kid, but I do not think either of them would really think to use fashion and make up help highlight her features like that! (They are both very plain dressers lol) \n\nOf course! Thank you so much! \ud83d\ude01 30 year old male with Albinism here. She is going to realize very young that she is different, the best suggestion I would give is to teach her to be confident and accepting of herself and that being different from others does not have to be a negative thing. Ingrain in her the mindset that she can be independent and live a fulfilling life despite the challenges she will face because of her Albinism. Most of all foster a strong sense of community and support in her life, this will be very important in keeping her from allowing the feeling of being different from affecting her mentally in a negative way as she gets older. From the perspective of an adult with Albinism who now teaches children with Albinism:  \n\n\nListen to your child when they say \"it is too bright.\" They are not lying to you.  \nAlways offer alternatives to white paper for crafts. Off-white and even manila colored paper works just fine for a lot of craft related work.  \n\n\nDo not assume she cannot because a parent does not let their child with a similar condition do something. I draw, paint, sculpt, teach, and even rollerblade with homemade accommodations.  \n\n\nBe her advocate, always-- but teach her the language, when she is older, to use so she can advocate for herself later.  \n\n\nThere are books and even dolls framed those with albinism. Different is a word that is tricky, because are all different: the condition just adds some precautions to consider when going about the day. That is great to hear that you do not let it hold you back because that is what we want to teach her. I hope you have a speedy recovery! Is there a community for people with Albinism for the visually impaired? So that she can know people like her?\n\nBut if there is not, we already have a strong family support for her, we will tell my brother to enroll her in after school activities to meet and befriend more kids to help kick start her to have friends and integrate her into those local communities. Thank you! That is so interesting that the brightness of the paper is something to consider! \n\nThat mentality of not letting something hold you back is what we want to teach her \n\nRight now we plan on teaching her to say recessive genes if someone asked her why she looks different than us, which is not wrong technically but it gives her some privacy.  But that definitely makes sense to give her guidance on how to live life to the fullest while staying safe. Thank you!", "Capturing The Hypnotizing Beauty Of Albino People  This is creepy and gross and, at the very least, condescending and patronizing.

I use zoomtext so the size is not an issue, although I suspect I use too small a level of magnification in order to see more of a page and read faster. I turn down the brightness and invert colours. But I still find that there is something about computer use that is really straining my eyes.\n\nI know about the techniques for preventing general computer vision syndrome. I am particularly interested in whether any of you experience issues due to computer use or ideas anyone has to make them easier on the eyes.\n\nThanks", "ISO youtube editor and social media manager So i have a Youtube channel all about living with albinism. I have a few videos up, and I had a lot of fun researching and filming them. I have a vision of making the channel really amazing, a great resource for anybody with our condition to live happy and healthy. I want to make the channel that would have helped me so much when I was an adolescent and young adult. I needed to learn how to take really good care of myself, how to understand my condition and navigate my world with it. I honestly think that the channel has potential to be financially lucrative and draw in sponsorships, but the quality of the content needs to be improved. I am realizing I cannot do it alone.\n\nThe big hurdle I have is that I am not much of a social media person. Actually I do not love sitting in front of the computer for long periods of time. I would love for the videos to be really engaging and that requires editing skills that I do not have. So realistically For the channel to be what I am envisioning, I really have to outsource some aspects of the job. It would be ideal to partner up with somebody who has a similar vision.\n\nSo if youd like to be a part of the team, please DM me all about yourself.

Speaking of someone who is not albino but stumbled in here, it is unlikely that you will be able to cure vision problems in the manner you are thinking. You cannot edit an organ the way you are implying by changing its genes. They are a blueprint and a set of operating instructions, but once the organ - in this case eyes - are fully grown, there is only so much you can do.\n\nThat said, there are likely to be other methods of dealing with albinism related vision problems. Hell, outright cloning of replacement organs might even become an option.\n\nWho knows? I am firmly in the no cure category, for a few reasons. \n1) this is how I am. If I did not have albinism and have the lived experiences I do, I would be a fundamentally different person. From this experience - good and bad, I am a better person. \n2) my hair is very pretty, and I look better in glasses. \n3) this is most important. If you are focused on cure, it is easy to lose sight of how things are.

I have been with my girlfriend (now Fianc\u00e9) for over 5 years and things are amazing. We are both 22 and from the UK.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has albinism. She has trouble with vision, she cannot drive and has to rely on public transport. She loves to draw, write stories and general creative stuff. \n\nRecently she has quit her job and is looking for something new to do. She wants a career, something she can go up in, and something full time. She is socially shy and would prefer to not do retail again but will if she has to. \n\nAll answers and suggestions are appreciated as this is a stressful time for us :) It is really up to what career she personally wants or finds interesting, and if she can get there reliably with public transit.\n\nOf course there are some careers that people with albinism will never be able to have. Surgeon, pilot, astronaut. However, I have met doctors with albinism\u2014they went through medical school and rotations and had to draw blood and everything. Computer programmers, photographers, physical therapists, musicians, entrepreneurs, etc. As long as it does not require 20/20 vision, she can probably do it.\n\nOf course, eye strain and photosensitivity are other considerations. It is very individualized so it is hard to really give others advice, but the advice I can give is that people with albinism are more capable than we would think they are. I still remember how shocked I was meeting a doctor with albinism. I thought there was no way someone with low vision could handle the rigors of medical school, much less do well during clinical rotations like surgery where you have to be very hands on. I have a similar disposition as your girlfriend, visually, and work was a struggle for a long time. However, I now work in HR, but I\"m also not shy :-) Here are a few suggestions:\n\nWhen you say she is socially shy, do you mean she gets anxious around people or she does not like being around people? I think IT is a good field if you do not want to be around other people much because there are many careers in that field that allow you to work alone a lot. There are also a lot of opportunities for remote work so that you do not have to worry about how to get to work. I have been remote since the pandemic started and I love not having to worry about getting to work, as that makes me anxious. This work (in the US) is also salaried or exempt, which I do not know about in the UK, but here that is more desirable if you have a disability because your work is not about the hours you put in as much as the projects that you complete. Moving up in this field does not always mean you have to become a manager, either, which is nice. They usually have some nice technical career ladders. I think engineering would offer some of these things as well.\n\nIf she does not mind interactions with others over the phone or online, there are a lot of great customer service opportunities like call centers or e-chat that companies need. I would say right now the collections field is a good one to go into because of the economy, but that is a challenge if you are sensitive or like a slower pace. However, the nice thing about being on the phone or at a computer is that the customer cannot see you, and I think that takes some social pressure off. The room to grow is harder if you do not like people, though, because usually moving up a lot means management.", "New Coming of Age Film about teen with albinism Hey! I am a part of the crew of a film called Jasmine Star and wanted to share it with you guys. It is all about a teenage girl who wants to become a model, living in her hometown of Minneapolis. \n\nHere is the concept trailer/crowdfunding page if you want to watch/show your support: ( Cool concept, definitely long overdue. I do wish it was not something as vapid as modelling but you cannot have everything in life.\n\nBut the really important question, the one that makes the difference on whether I will donate: does your lead actually have albinism?\n\nRemember back when people of colour could not be actors so if they wanted a black guy they would just paint a white guy up?\n\nOr remember how as many as 60% of visually impaired people (including those with albinism) are chronically unemployed?\n\nI do not mean to come off as combative, I am genuinely interested and I want to be excited for this. But representation is not really representation if you are just painting a white guy. I do not think you are coming off as combative at all. The lead really has albinism. Her name is Iyana and she is a model and actress who is super excited to play the part. There are actually two people with albinism (and they actually have albinism) starring in this film. There is a concept trailer on the indiegogo page that shows the leading actress. Hope to see you support it! :D Thanks for your response! I am super psyched for this. :D Thank you! Also super psyched! wait can all albinos be models \ud83d\ude02 very excited for a movie that represents albinos for once btw! I feel as if our condition is underrepresented.

Thanks for saying this! :D", "Why people with albinism have a particular eye shape? Have you noticed that people who happen to have the condition own very small eyes? Do you have small eyes? If so, let me know, and also if you have a scientific explanation for that, you can leave it too.  I have never heard a claim of people with albinism having physically atrophied eyes\u2014anecdotally or empirically. Sure our eyes have lots of problems, but they are the same size as anyone else\u2019s as far as I am aware. Hey Alex! The shape of the eyes of people with albinism tends to be small compared to those who do not have the condition. It is something I had not noticed until relatively recently. In detail it seems that we do not have the shape of the eyes well developed and I would like to ask an ophthalmologist to see what he thinks. In a few weeks I will go and I will consult my concerns.  \n\nIn addition, I leave a ( with a collection of people with albinism for you to detail the shape of the eyes and the similarities they have. It is quite impressive.  Could it be because people with albinism tend to have astigmatism? Seems to me that astigmatism can make eyeballs look smaller because  they are squished rather than typically rounded. Interesting thought. I think this picture would only make sense if you show us their parents or siblings. There is plenty of variation in eye shape and size between all humans. I have albinism and I have quite small eyes,  but so do my dad and my sister who do not have albinism, to the extent that it is a family joke. Indeed my other sister who does have albinism has \u201cnormal\u201d/large eyes. \n\nThere might be some truth in what you are saying, but I think you would need to do a big controlled experiment to see if this were true. It is not a feature of albinism that is documented by doctors, though in fairness that does not mean anything as most doctors know next to nothing about albinism.  I am not sure if I have small eyes but in my eye that is pointed up and out I have a droopy eyelid. It is rather annoying because when combined with my exotropia it limits my field of view in that eye.", "Opinion?  Ik it still needs a lot of work but I wondered what your opinion was? I like it! ", "Link to my albinism awareness video. ", "Hello there! I was roaming the internet late at night tonight when I came across the absolutely beautiful work of Gustavo Lacerda's albinism collection. It made me realize how little I actually ever thought about or considered albinism and how it might effect people's everyday lives. I then tried hopping onto YouTube to see if there were any vlogs or interviews with people who had albinism. I was looking for stories that explored them and who they are as people. I was not able to find much, just an albino guy who does beer reviews. \n\nAnyway, long story short, I am a creative type (specifically video production) and now I have a vague idea for a mini-documentary series I might want to try and pursue where people with various genetic conditions are interviewed in a storytelling format in a way to get viewers to enjoy connecting with the interviewee on a human to human level. I dunno, something along those lines, like I said, it is really vague.\n\nI also do not know when/if I would ever get around to it as I am in the process of trying to immigrate from the US to Iceland and transferring employment and all that stuff, which eats up pretty much all my time. Also, I do not know anyone who has albinism. \n\nSo...in retrospect I guess this was a pretty useless post. I did not really say much did I?

And sorry for the late night pointless ramble post.", "Does anyone else ever feel like their visual impairment makes others look down on them?

(Not meant to be offensive, genuinely curious) Hi,\nI just wanted to preface by saying that I was born with white hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, and body hair. My skin is very pale and burns VERY easily. My dad is also like me and has completely white body hair. My mom is a natural dirty blonde, but my brother was also born with white body hair. My dad\u2019s family does not have the extent of blondeness that he has\u2014they are mostly all dirty blondes. I have never had vision issues or been diagnosed with Albinism, but I have always been genuinely curious if I have some form. My parents get very offended when I ask them/bring up the thought, so they have not been much help. Is this something I would have known when I was born? Obviously cannot give you a medical diagnosis, but if you have white hair (including body hair) and pale skin then you could have Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). OCA is a recessive genetic trait so based on your description it sounds like your dad also has OCA and your mom is a carrier.  Though you would need a proper diagnosis from an optometrist, opthalmologist, genetic counselor, or any number of doctors.\n\n&gt;I have never had vision issues\n\nHave you gotten an eye exam? An optometrist or opthalmologist would be able to diagnose you pretty easily. Albinism usually affects vision (though to varying degrees) so if you have not had a thorough vision exam it would be useful both to get a diagnosis and to figure out if you have any vision problems you may not have noticed.\n\n&gt;My parents get very offended when I ask them/bring up the thought\n\nThat is a weird reaction. Having albinism is nothing to be ashamed of or offended by. And knowing whether or not you have albinism is valuable if for no other reason than it is a genetic trait which could get passed to your kids (if you choose to have any). \n\n&gt;Is this something I would have known when I was born?\n\nHonestly that depends. From what you have said, the rest of your family is already light skinned so it is possible that (if you have albinism) the doctors missed it. Albinism is rare enough that doctors will not always recognize it unless it is obvious. When I was born (granted this was in a more rural area before you could just Google anything), the pediatrician did not know anything about albinism - they gave my parents a whole bunch of incorrect information and lively would not have noticed it except my parents are Indian. Some parents do not tell their kids because they worry kids knowing -  at a young age will affect their development adversely; I do not agree with this, but I suppose it works for some families. What is your ethnicity? \n\nIf you are of European descent and do not have any issues with your vision, you might still have a form of albinism.  But as the top post says, you need to see an ophthalmologist but a genetic test would more likely be able to tell you. \n\nDo you still have white lashes?  ;just curious) \n\nIf you do not have any vision issues, count yourself lucky because almost people with albinism have a visual Impairement. \n\nAlso are you sensitive to light? \n\nAnyway, first step is to see an ophthalmologist . I do not know how genetic testing works in your country, but that would also be an option. There are many different genetic mutations. \n\n(wwe.albinism.org)is a pretty good resource I would get a genetic test, I have met a handful of girls who glorify and romanticize albinism to the point of self-diagnosis. As someone who is grew up with OCA1 this always comes off as a form of genetic appropriation. OOC why do they glorify having OCA? I have never met someone who glorified having Albinism before. Sounds like it come's from people associating blonde hair and fair skin to an angelic appearance. Albinism is rare and unique, these girls I knew were pretty introverted, sometimes people get stirred into associative identities while in search for their own I suppose", "Driving with Low Vision  Thanks for sharing. Do you have albinism ? Yes I do! Good idea creating a low vision group !", "Hello! I am doing a biology project on albinism and would appreciate it if anyone could answer a few questions for me! As stated in the title, I just need to ask a few questions, all of which are related to how albinism has affected your life, in order to understand better how it could affect me, if I were to have it. Feel free to skip any questions you do not want to answer for whatever reason.\n\n1. How has albinism affected your social life and/or relationships?\n2. If you suffer from poor vision, how has that affected your life? (Transport, daily life?)\n3. Has having to cover up in the sun affected your life in any significant way? If so, how?\n4. How has albinism affected your self-esteem, especially when you were a teen?\n5. How has albinism affected your education? (If it has)\n6. Growing up, how did albinism affect your ability to participate in outdoor activities that your peers participated in? If it negatively affected your ability, what did you do instead, or what hobbies and skills did you develop as a result?\n7. Has albinism affected your family in any way? (For example, maybe it caused them more stress)\n8. Has your albinism caused you to be anxious/worried about anything related to your condition, such as staying out in the sun for too long with no protection?\n9. Do you find people staring at you when in public if the symptoms are noticeable? Or do you feel like people are staring?\n10. Did you fit into a specific \"social group\" in high school//Did you have a friend group? If no, do you believe it was caused by your albinism?\n\nThank you for answering these 10 questions. Once again, feel no pressure to respond to them if you so choose it. Thank you! Every person with albinism can have a completely different experience from one another. This is how albinism affected my life: \n\n1. Albinism has affected my social life and relationships in a very weird way. People seem to be on complete opposite ends of the spectrum. My closest friends do not really care that I have albinism, and often \"forget\" about it (until I mention something like, \"I cannot see what you are talking about,\"). Like, in those relationships it does not get mentioned or talked about. Sometimes there are the casual jokes about me being super pale, but that is pretty much it. With other people, however, it is completely opposite. I have met people that I got along with, but as soon as I mention that I am albino, they back off and refrain from interacting with me. I have also told people (like classmates) and then the bullying will usually start. So it can be difficult to make friends, but when you find the right people, it is pretty nice. Finding romantic relationships can go the same way. Most commonly, I have had the parents of significant others mention that their child should not date me because I will \"need to be taken care of\" and our children would have albinism, too. I understand how the latter is not ideal, but it is not the worst thing that could happen to a child.\n2. I do have a visual impairment, and my vision has declined in life. Decreased acuity is not the only thing that impacts my daily though. The increased visual sensitivity to light, lack of depth perception, difficulty to control the muscles in the eye, etc. are more troublesome in my experience.  As far as transport, I will not ever be able to drive. Navigating in public can be quite difficult as maps can be too small, signs can be too far away, and the glare on things can be pretty bad, too. I currently live in a super rural area without public transportation/taxis/uber/etc., so I rely on friends and family to take me places. Other aspects of daily life are pretty easy to adapt to. For example, I sit closer to a TV, carry around a magnifier to be able to read directions on packaging, and use adaptive technology. There are some things that I just cannot figure out how to do. I do not watch action movies or play certain video games because the graphics move too quickly and are hard to distinguish what characters are doing from the background. If you have any specific questions/examples in mind, I am more than happy to tell you how I adapt to them!\n3. Covering up in the sun has not really impacted my life in any significant way. I just put on more sunscreen, apply it more frequently, and wear sunglasses everywhere outside. I have noticed as I have gotten older that long exposure to sunlight will actually make me sick (like vomit and stomach issue level sick). It is kind of weird, because it is the actual act of looking at sunlight that will make me feel sick more so than having my skin exposed to sunlight. To remedy this, I just limit my time in the sun.\n4. My albinism has negatively impacted my self-esteem quite a bit, especially when I was a teen. In high school, I was bullied so bad that I would go home \"sick\" because I could not take it anymore. Also, looking back on everything, there were some relationships and friendships that I had where I was treated pretty horribly, and I think albinism did have some role in that. I also believe that having albinism makes people more likely to underestimate what all I can do and achieve. \n5. Albinism has not really impacted my access to education, but did affect how I operated in the classroom. I always sat at the front of the class, had the teacher send me the PowerPoint they had/copy classroom notes, used massive large print books/worksheets, used adaptive technology like a personal laptop, a bioptic, and a magnifying glass. Sometimes I would have extended time for tests if they involved a lot of reading. Oh, standardized tests were awful. In order to use a magnifier or have large print tests, you need to fill out copious amounts of paperwork, get doctors to fill out forms, and provide proof that you are visually impaired. \n6. When I was a kid, I actually did not know that I had albinism. My parents did not tell me because they wanted me to play sports/do things with other kids, and felt that if I knew I might limit myself. So when I was younger, I played outside all the time. I played soccer, basketball, swam, climbed trees, etc. The only thing I remembered being different about me compared to other kids is that I wore sunglasses and that teachers/coaches/parents would call me over to reapply sunscreen more often. I was just told that this was because my skin was lighter than others, and that was pretty much all I knew. Now, I still love to be outside. But I do limit my time in open spaces because I will get sick. I do not play many sports because my depth perception and such has gotten worse. I have picked up some \"indoor\" hobbies like working out inside, painting, reading, fashion, etc.\n7. Albinism has impacted my family significantly. When I was born, no one in my family knew that I had albinism. My mom had very fair skin and super blonde hair like mine when she was born, so that did not raise any questions. But I would apparently cry and scream all day (which ended up being from the bright light). One day, my aunt noticed that my eyes were purple/pink in certain lighting so she thought my issues stemmed from my eyes. Sure enough, I had albinism. My dad's family was really upset about this, and blamed my mom for it (which obviously is not how genetics of albinism works). So for a long time, it was \"all my mom's fault\". My dad did not take care of me much because of it, so my mom had to figure out a lot on her own. My parents had originally planned to have more kids, but decided not to after they found out I had albinism. There are other little actions that my family does that make it obvious that I am treated differently for having albinism. Currently, my dad does not do much to support my visual needs, but my mom does a lot for me.\n8. Typically, albinism has not caused me to worry about anything specific to my condition. I have started to think more about skin cancer and take preventive measures. Otherwise, I approach it from a \"it is what it is\" mentality.\n9. In public, I noticed that other girls stare, and sometimes people with darker skin tones/hair will stare. I think girls stare though because of my hair, and not really because of my albinism. I think people with darker skin/hair stare because I am very pale (part of my skin is \"translucent\") and it is probably something that they do not see every day.\n10. In high school, I did have a friend group. But for other parts of my life, like college, I hung around the outside of groups and did not really \"make it in\". I think albinism had an effect on this, but maybe not directly.\n\nI know I probably did not answer your questions fully, so feel free to ask any additional questions. I am an open book, and I am glad you are asking these kinds of questions. I think it sheds light onto something that not many people think or care about. If you have any questions about the biology of albinism, I can also help with that as I have done a lot of research on the matter.\n\nGood luck with your project! Send me a message to respond to this tomorrow if I forget. It is quite late right now and should probably just sleep, but I am happy to answer! Hello thank you for taking the time to answer! You answered the questions very fully much more than I expected honestly especially because some of the questions are phrased weirdly. But I thank you a lot I am sorry to hear about the bullying and your dad I have never understood attitudes like it is not like you care 24/7 and even then I mean it is still your child. I do not know I have always felt that no matter what my child is like I would always love them unless of course we assume the worst case and they are a murderer etc. But I really do appreciate all of this not just for the project but for myself too.\n\nThank you a bunch again! Very true on the self esteem part! I am happy enough with how I look now, but as a teenager I was very self conscious (like all teens). That is pretty strange about getting sick to the stomach when looking at the sun, or pretty much anything bright I develop a headache. 1: I always had a few friends, most do not really seem to care. As far as relationships go, I was never really confident enough to approach women until my senior year of high school or so. Hey, if they will not date you because of how you look, they are not worth it.\n2: I own a vintage VW Rabbit and am allowed to drive as long as I use a set of bioptic glasses.\n3: Yes and no. I live in the deep South and make sure to apply and carry sunscreen, I also try to limit my time in the sun. I enjoy nature and I take precautions.\n4: I suppose it replaced the normal teenage insecurities. Every teenager tries to change the way they look in one way or another, since Albinos  cannot tan in the sun and it is extremely dangerous to try, I found out that we can get spray tans. I did and it looks awful. By highschool I did not have problems with bullies since they had grown up, but I did get a couple of nicknames. Nobody meant it in a rude way though.\n5: nah, I am got a normal education.", "Hello to you all Hi, I am 16 and I have oculocutaneous albinism, I was diagnosed with this when I was only a couple days old, when I was originally diagnosed they said that I would be legally blind by the time I was 16, here I am now and my vision is around 20/70, just on the edge of being able to drive during the day, I haves an astigmatism and nystagmus in both eyes and have a good bit of light sensitivity yet I prefer phone and laptop screens at full brightness.

Otherwise people might call me a fake. Well I was just trying to see if theres anyone I could relate with. Smart.. Might have to one day being like a vampire with the sun lmfao. All the time, is so bad. I am always profiled. Me too.. People also are like do you use gel or how long does it take to do your hair. But I do not even do my hair lmfao. Luckily for me, I have transition lenses in my glasses and they are AMAZING!\n\nThe only problem is when not so nice people approach you and say \u201cnice shades\u201d in a really condescending tone, knowing full well that they are my normal glasses.

Screw them though you can laugh at how stupid they are. Yeah... I agree. The main thing is that none of those people were my friends or are my friends either... luckily For me some \u201cfriends\u201d call me a crackhead cause my skin tone and probably how I look from so sun.

Most likely a special place in hell for them so now I just laugh at them, but sometimes its hard not to say something back. Only way to make it better really is to laugh at them and if they say something explain your scenario, explain their racist and say you feel bad for them, that makes it better because you get them in a bad spot especially if their friends are around lmfao.

I am 28 years old. What are my next steps? There was a LOT of stuff that led up to this conclusion but, long story short, I have done a tremendous amount of research, personal testing and record taking, discussion and I have appointments set with a dermatologist and an ophthalmologist.\n\nI believe I have just ignored this for my life by avoiding the outdoors frequently and, once I became an adult, began drinking as it nulled the sensitivity of my skin frying to a crisp when outside or under intense uv.\n\nSymptoms include: sensitivity to uv light, I must wear polarized, 100% uv sunglasses at all times even indoors, the sun burns my skin practically instantaneously (at least I can sense it roasting and redness is very apparent) and any part of my body that is not covered with sunscreen or uv protective is very tender and sore and feels sunburnt.\n\nI have never been so confused in my life. I am not in denial but I am just unsure of how to live my life appropriately so that I am protected and safe as well as not in pain. Any advice would be highly appreciated. Also, I mean to clarify, by drinking, I mean constantly drinking at least 2 to 3 glasses of heavy pours of whiskey for almost 8 years until I began to reduce my alcohol consumption to zero. Then I began to notice my symptoms more Really I think you have taken the correct first steps. Meet with an ophthalmologist and a dermatologist. My husband has OCA1 and was diagnosed at birth. I LOVE the outdoors, and he, not so much. So it is been a fun couple of decades of compromise. He wears long sleeves year round normally. There is also some amazing clothes now that have the UV protection built right in, as some fabrics he still can get sunburns with. Big floppy hats (he calls them his goofy hats) and SPF 100. \n\nHave you noticed any other eye abnormalities? Low vision? Dancing eyes? High astigmatism? Low peripheral I have noticed and since very young age I have always sat close to tvs, blackboards, anything I need to focus. I have to pick up a lot of objects and bring them close to me to see fine details even with corrective lenses. Yes, I have decent astigmatism as well. Nobody ever diagnosed me with dancing eyes but I am pretty sure I have them. My cerebellum is probably just constantly compensating.\n\nOh and I recently got spf 100 and it is night and day difference. Pain significantly reduced. And I totally feel your pain friend, I know my wife loves the outdoors and I wish I could do more but this just makes it that much more difficult. Heck yes! That SPF is hard to find. But luckily we can still go hiking now that I buy nearly every bottle I find haha. Good luck! I hope you get some answers at your doctors' appointments. Once you know the root of the issue, it is easier to find ways to make life easier. Just got lucky! I am currently in Hawaii and that is how I finally confirmed my suspicions. Gradually increasing spf confirmed that I am likely OCA and thankfully the island I am on has plenty of 100 spf sunscreen. Thank you so much for your help and advice. It is been extremely helpful! Sounds like you are already on the path to doing the right things but I am frankly flabbergasted that you went this far in life with those symptoms without someone pointing it out?! Best of luck with your appointments, btw the correct name for \"dancing eyes\" if you are interested is nystagmus :) It is weird, nobody ever questioned I had a problem because I was so dedicated in school. Sure I was socially awkward (for good reason it seems now, my body was under constant pressure and stress from florescence lights for almost 20 years throughout k-12 and college) but nobody thought I had a genetic disease. I think it is because genetic testing was new back in '92 and my parents were dirt poor when they had me (ages 17 and 19). Do not blame them at all, what could they do, but man what a wild ride, right? \n\nAnd thank you for the proper term for Nystagmus! That will make me look much more credible with the ophthalmologist! Because I think even he will be suspicious of my claim I suppose for many of us it is fairly \"obvious\" from an early age due to being so pale/blonde - imo one of the biggest giveaways is blonde eyebrows/eyelashes as well as hair but I appreciate this is not always visible in all variations. Have you considered sending off for an actual genetic diagnoses? I have never actually looked into this myself but that does sound interesting, plus it might help add a bit of extra data to whatever pool of research is happening around the condition.\n\nReally sorry to hear about your struggles growing up, I was incredibly lucky to get the recognition/help I needed - for example being unable to read the blackboard/whiteboard as a teacher wrote on it at a young age made me easily distracted, which I am sure a few decades earlier would have been written off as a behavioural issue/ADHD or something, but they fortunately realised that it is hard to keep a student engaged if they cannot even see what you are doing and provided help for that sort of thing. Oh I wanted to add one other thing - not sure what things are like where you are, but many places have local fellowships/groups which you might find helpful - the UK branch organises meetups (pre-2020 of course) etc, believe this is the US branch  Thank you for the link! I will definitely look into it! I am located in Florida but I was born and raised in Utah. Yeah I was super blonde when I was a kid but I am more satin blonde now. I have thought about doing a 23 and me but I do not really trust those types of diagnoses and with my other concomitant conditions (possible autism and synethesia as a result of this never being diagnosed and treated, plus the use of alcohol as a medication for so long), i probably need an MD and a psychiatrist to look at me.\n\nBut it would be very interesting to see if they would detect it! Maybe after I get the true diagnosis I will see how good they are! Right.  Can you tell me how you got pass the doctors at birth?  I mean perhaps you are alergic to the sun.  Do you have nystagmus?  Are you legally blind?   I was officially diagnosed at the age of 1. They registered my partially sighted after tests, no idea how you test a one year old, but yes u also have nystagmus I was not questioning you but the OP. sorry about the confusion I am not legally blind, I have difficulty taking off my sunglasses at any time. When I do, I feel like my eyes are literally drying out immediately and they begin to burn. Without any sunscreen, it is impossible for me to sleep with any light in my bedroom. I do not know how, I do not know why, but the data is there and I am experiencing everything that points to OCA 2. I do not need criticism, I just need advice. Not here for a diagnosis, that is what a doctor is for. As for the doctors, idk. See my post below for my theory/explanation. Either way, I hope someone can figure out something. I have a dermatologist appointment next week and I will give an update if possible! you are asking people with albinism for advice but when you hear their (our) experiences, you get offended.   I hope you find an answer to you problem soon. I am sorry, I am on a lot of drugs I do not think I need and my mind is just being drained from my taxing experience. My apologies for snapping. I really am just confused scared. As far as diagnosis, the ophthalmologist is who you need to see. Seeing a dermatologist is still a good idea but they will not diagnose you with albinism. You have got to have your eyes examined for that.\n\nDo you need advice in any particular area? Sunscreen, glasses, etc?

Well my family is black so right away they knew something was up lol albinism is also way more common for black people. I ask chz if dirty blonde isnt far off from the normal coloration of your family then probably not. i am white, all my family have dark hair but maybe it is genes down the line, when they looked at the back of my eyes they have always said they are fine, i do have white spots on my iris i think it is called brush field spots and not sure if that is a sign of albinism Huh, yeah I think looking at your eyes is how they would diagnose it. I think its that your macula wouldnt have much, if any, pigmentation. There are rare forms of albinism that are associated with more pigmentation in the macula, and more vision. its possible just statistically unlikely. Most of us know from birth because it is usually  significantly life altering. I was diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. Parts of the eye will be structured differently in people with albinism. It is also possible to have nystagmus without having albinism. My guess is that if it has not been brought to your attention before (and if you have had a more thorough eye exam), you likely do not have it. But you could always ask the next time you go in! I was diagnosed at birth. Mind you, I was more of a textbook case in that my eyes and hair were (and still are) completely white, my eyes were red, and my vision was very very poor. However, I know plenty of people who have albinism that is not as severe, or they have ocular albinism, which only affects the eyes. The only real way to know is to ask a doctor and/or get testing done. For me, my parents where told when my older brother was born.

I have a few things being treated now, and I am the healthiest I have ever been. It is amazing!  \nSo now I am looking at my more external health (skin, hair etc) and wondering if getting this investigated makes a difference at all to quality of health or life?

Dad's side are all Scots.):*\n\n* *I am the only one of 11 cousins, 4 siblings, Aunts/uncles/grandparents etc (UK/Euro descent) that cannot tan. At all. I used to try when I was younger and would either burn to a crisp, or get permanent thumbprint-sized light brown spots (pigmented lentigines). They are on my face, so I am glad for makeup*\n* *When I do burn, there are large areas of skin on my back that stay pure white and do not even turn red, so I look blotchy. I have been told they are birthmarks*\n* *All my family's hair is either brown or beach blonde. Mine is an off-white (like a light dishwater grey) with the consistency of spiderwebs. It also tends to burn in the sun. All my body hair and eyelashes are the same colour*\n* *My eyes are green instead of blue or brown like everyone else - but I have a limbal ring that is stayed strong my whole life*\n* *My vision is not the worst, but it is never been amazing (astigmatism: I cannot see distance). It deteriorates a bit more every year and I have to get new glasses. I cannot handle bright lights/strong sunlight; I cannot seem to adjust at all and end up with a headache.* \n* *When I was born the doctor said I was the palest baby he would ever seen and my hair was sheet white. Since my eyes were green though, he said I could not have albinism*\n* *My skin does not absorb sunlight properly. Most Australians (even the sun-conscious) have VitD levels between 70-80.

OCA usually goes hand in hand with vision loss and photophobia.\n\nAs for getting tested, the value will depend entirely on whether or not you want to access assistance from the NDIS, Vision Australia or similar. As a Kiwi I am unable to access help from any of these organisations, but if you are an Aussie citizen with a diagnosed disability you qualify automatically.\n\nIf you do not care much for the help, there is not really a good reason to get diagnosed. Albinism does not interact with other illnesses much and there is only a small chance of you passing it on to any children you might have.\n\nSome ideas of help you might want/need:\n\n* Prescriptions for sunglasses to combat photophobia, especially if you are like me and lose or break them regularly.\n* Reduced cost of prescription glasses (if you do not already get this from Vision Aus)\n* Sometimes you can get prescription sunblock, but not always\n* Assistance getting adjustments for work/study, funding for your school/workplace to make better arrangements for you, i.e. adjusting lighting\n* Funding for any assistive equipment like canes, screen readers, audiobooks, magnification devices and the like.

Are there any people with albinism here that have been able to get laser eye surgery? If so, what were your experiences before, during and afterwards? Not sure if it changes anything but I am UK based I have not had laser eye surgery but I do know a fair bit about it. But first it would help to know what your current eyesight is and what you would be expecting to achieve with laser eye surgery. \n\nBtw in America it is often called by the brand name LASIK, which might help with googling! Hi. Thank you for the speedy response.\nAny information you can give would be great.\nI believe my eyesight it at 20/80 with glasses and has been consistently around there for years. I also have astigmatism and a nystagmus in my eyes. As well as that, I have cone dystrophy which also makes me light sensitive - however, only mildly since I can still see outside pretty well.\nAs for expectations, I would hope to get good enough eyesight to be able to drive at least. Here in the UK that means 20/40 or better with glasses. I full expect to still need to wear glasses even if I can get surgery as I do not believe it will correct the nystagmus or come dystrophy but that is fine with me.\nAgain, any information you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you Ok so there is good news and bad news. The good news is, there is nothing medical stopping you form getting laser eye surgery, and it could mean that you do not have to wear glasses anymore. The bad news is that, it will not change your vision past 20/80. All it would do is take you to the point of with-glasses correction. \n\nThe reason for this is that laser eye surgery can only correct refractive error. Our eyes are really different from most people\u2019s eyes; actually the main thing that causes our vision issues is not refractive error at all, but a combination of a few things. We have a combination of come atrophy, actually just fewer cones, and retinal nerve dysplasia. What this means is, we see in low resolution. It would be like the difference between looking at the original version of a photo vs the same photo printed in a newspaper. The colours are the same in the newspaper, it does not look blurry, but lots of the detail is missing because the resolution is lower. There is currently no treatment for these aspects of reduced vision.*\n\nI realise that this is not what you probably what you want to read. It sucks. One small piece of good news is that it looks like they are really close to the first fully self driving cars, which we will probably be able to use! \n\n*(it is actually a bit more complicated than this even, as we also have neurological differences which can not be treated with current technology either) You can have it as far as I know.  I have OC albinism and had a visual acuity of 20/70 with astigmatism prior to Lasik this past year.  Surgery was easy, with little pain and no complications.  I have not had an acuity test since my follow-up, but it was at 20/50 then.  Despite what the other poster said (which is mostly correct) it is possible to get a LITTLE improvement, but it is best to keep your expectations incredibly low.   Some side effects for me include a higher light sensitivity than before.  It was really bad for about a month after surgery, but now it is just a nuisance.  I have always needed sunglasses, but now it is a must-have for going anywhere.  My eyes also get a little dry at the end of the day, but no worse than they did when I wore contacts.\n\nThat said, I am happy I did it.  My vision is great and I do not have to fuss with contacts.  I noticed recently that my astigmatism is still there (I only notice it when looking at a pinpoint bright light at night).  I would do it all over again in an instant, but I was a little annoyed when I did discover the astigmatism was still there.  I was told that fitting for contacts will be much more difficult after surgery should they be necessary, so I am a little paranoid of vision changes.

I must admit that I have always loved the idea and whenever I am a passenger I feel as though I can see and assess the risks appropriately given the aforementioned difference between my eyesight and someone who needs correction. I cannot read numberplates or signs at a distance (nystagnus also) but I can definitely see a car 100+ metres away ready to pull out, usually the indicator signal as well.\n\nI put this into practice for a very short period of time on holiday in a rental car. I felt confident enough to see what I was doing and safely drove around for a bit. Nobody died and I do not believe at any point I was in any danger (other than being a learner driver!) for my eyesight. Obviously reading the speedometer was a bit of an issue but I could see exactly where it was and once I had an idea of what the numbers said I knew where the dial was pointing.\n\nI have come to accept that I will never be legally allowed to drive in my home country of the UK, but it is entirely possible elsewhere in the world, either through purchasing a license in sketchier countries or by obtaining some bioptic system in certain U.S. states.\n\nHas anyone had any experience with this/what are your opinions on this?\n\nI am asking in this subreddit because ordinarily visually impaired people I do not think fully relate to the type of eyesight those with ocular albinism have. I can see objects, people, dogs running into the road, traffic lights etc etc - I just cannot read signs or meet the UK requirements for numberplate distance reading.", "Questions About Villains With Albinism A quick disclaimer that I do not have albinism. However, I am a member of multiple minority groups, and was thinking about some questions about portrayal of people with albinism and other minorities in the media, especially as villains. \n\nIn my opinion, the problem with minorities being portrayed as villains in fiction is that their villainy is too often tied to, or a direct result of, their minority status. For example, I have seen some works where a villain is gay or LGBT-coded, and acts \u2018villainously\u2019 as a means to woo the same sex protagonist against their will - and that is the main or even only element of their character. \n\nNow, if the \u2018unrequited love turns sour\u2019 plot is just one aspect of the villain\u2019s character, and not the central or only element, I think that portraying an LGBT person as a villain is acceptable. I even think that linking their LGBT status to their backstory as a villain would be okay, as long as it is presented respectfully and not in a stereotypical or anti-LGBT way. For example, the villain was cast out of their town for being gay and grew to resent society for its inability to accept them, facilitating their fall to darkness. Note that being gay does not make them resentful; the way society *treats* them for being gay does. \n\n**But I was wondering: does this principle, in your opinion, also apply to albinism?** \n\nIn other words, is it acceptable to portray a person with albinism as a villain, as long as their albinism is not the root of their villainy, and the issues and stigmas surrounding albinism are addressed respectfully? \n\nI think there is a difference between LGBT and albinistic representation because while large actions have been taken to bring awareness and change to LGBT struggles and LGBT coding of villains, the same has not been done for albinism on a widespread scale. \n\nWhat do you think? IMO one of the biggest issues with portrayals of villains with albinism is that the albinism is pretty much an excuse for the villain to be  \"unnaturally pale\" and have \"crimson eyes\" - eg it is there to make the villain appear scary, menacing, unnatural, etc. And that is not limited to villains - TV shows like Friends, Brooklyn 99, and 30 Rock throw \"albino\" around a lot when they want to add an extra air of creepiness to an insult or character.\n\nThat is not to say that anything you are saying is incorrect. Having a villain with albinism where the albinism is treated with respect would be great. But IMO a bigger issue is that there are very few positive depictions of albinism in popular media. So I would love to see more protagonists with albinism before we get to making villains with albinism more nuanced. 100% agreed. How do you feel about anti heroes? That is an interesting thought. At the end of the day so long as the albinism is treated with respect and not as a prop I am OK with the character with albinism playing any role. As I mentioned above I would love to see more explicitly positive portrayals of people with albinism which can be done with an antihero. However, IMO the antihero thing is a tough needle to thread properly and I can imagine it could be really easy to accidentally fall into the old tropes while writing one with albinism.

I play music live and i personally had a hard time getting comfortable with myself but i do it often now. ", "Is it \"okay\" for me to write a character with albinism when I do not have albinism? Hi everyone,\n\nI know my initial question seems like a strange one, but let me explain. It is a bit long as a heads up! (There will be a TL;DR summary at the bottom)\n\nI originally wrote my novel with my main character (MC) having albinism, more specifically Oculocutaneous Albinism Type 4. The novel is a fantasy story where the MC\u2019s story arc is not related to albinism/overcoming albinism/overcoming ableism or anything like that. His story arc is about coming to terms of his ignorance to his country having been raised as a prince in the palace, falling in love, etc. My thought was it would be great to have more representation of albinism where the character is living a cool fantasy life just like characters without albinism we see all the time in media.\n\nThe novel is told through multiple points of view, and the MC sits at approximately 55% of the novel. I have spoken to multiple people with albinism in regards to my novel (paying everyone for their time), and I currently have someone with Oculocutaneous Albinism reading it over (once again, paying them for their time). I was hoping to have someone else with Oculocutaneous Albinism read it over as well after the initial persons returns with their comments.\n\nMy initial impressions were that it was okay for me to write a character with albinism as long as I: \n\na) Made sure to represent the condition accurately, sensitively, consult with people of the community and listen to their feedback\n\nb) Tell stories about people with albinism, not stories that belong to people with albinism (e.g. dealing with bullying, ableism, etc. which are not my stories to tell)\n\nHowever, recently, there has been a movement in the writing community on Twitter of people of colour (POC) authors saying they do not want white authors to write POC point of view characters, regardless if the stories are dealing with racism.\n\nThe reason is because traditional publishing (a publishing house like Penguin Random House publishing the novel and the novel ends up in bookstores) is not a zero sum. They only buy a certain amount of books a year, and if they buy and publish 3 books with Black characters, they may not want to buy anymore for that year. The issue is that the amount of POC authors is underrepresented in traditional publishing \u2013 if all 3 books with Black characters are written by white authors, then Black authors and their voices are being neglected. Stats are showing that since 2016, while the amount of books with diverse characters have increased, the amount of diverse authors have stayed the same.\n\nI have not seen anyone talk about what this means for the disabled community (recognizing that albinism itself is not a disability, however there are health issues that many people with albinism have), but there are parallels. There are not a lot of books written about disabled characters BY disabled authors. Every traditionally published book on albinism that I have been able to find has not been written by someone with albinism. I realized I may be doing the same thing with my writing. Hurting a community when my intentions were to help them, and taking away a slot for an author with albinism. Especially since if I were to succeed in traditional publishing, I would be making money and profiting off a main character with albinism when I do not have the condition myself.\n\nMy thoughts of how to proceed for my novel is the follow:\n\n1) Continue editing my novel as it is and continue engaging with members of the albinism community so I can make sure my novel is the best it can be for representation\n\n2) Rewrite the novel so that while the MC has albinism, his role in the story is reduced (maybe from 55% down to 35%)\n\n3) Rewrite the novel making the MC does not have albinism and just has fantasy white hair (tbh this option feels gross to me and I would rather not)\n\n4) Rewrite the novel so the MC does not have albinism\n\nI know that everyone can only speak for themselves and not for the albinism community as a whole, but I feel like I cannot continue with my novel without first consulting with members of the community.\n\nThank you everyone for reading so far!\n\nTL;DR: I am worried that by writing my novel with a main character that has albinism and trying to traditionally publish it, I am taking away a slot for actual people with albinism to tell their stories, and I am hurting rather than helping the albinism community. First of all, thank you for your consideration. This post seems very well written and researched and I really appreciate that especially as a person that does social justice work and a person with albinism. So does it hurt the story if the person the main character does not have albinism?   I mean, if it is not mentioned at all in the story and the main character is not changed or influence anyway by their condition, then why put it in the story.   For me, I say go for it especially since you have persons with albinism (PwAs) to read it for you. Thank you so much for your reply!\n\nTo answer your question, his albinism does not have any bearing on the overall plot (finding buried secrets and corruption in his country, falling in love, etc.). He does have photosensitivity, nystagmus, and low vision, which there are small details throughout the book (needing sunscreen, bright lights, sunlight hurting his eyes, headaches, some characters he meets commenting on his nystagmus, etc.). There is some subtle impacts on his characterization as well. I would need to do some heavy rewriting, but the core story/plot could remain mostly the same.\n\nOnce again, thank you, and I really appreciate that you took the time to reply! Cool, very cool. Oscar Wilde:\n\u201cThe only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\u201d I say go for it! Thank you for your feedback! :) Thank you. I just want to make sure that the conversation talked about is one that the albinism community wants instead of shouting over everyone. Thanks to Hollywood:  Ugh, yes, those stereotypes are so awful and so harmful. Hollywood has done so much damage.  \n\n\nI have edited my post with my final decision - I am going to change it so my main character does not have albinism. But I do want to write a future major character (but not main character) in a later novel with albinism. I hope this way I can raise awareness about albinism and have a relatable character for the albinism community without taking a spot away form an author with albinism. To keep it short. Yes. People who do not have hearing defections or autism write characters with those things all the time. This indeed is acceptable.", "Piebaldism - I have almost zero pigment on my entire body, but have patches of pigmented skin. Anyone else?

I have no clue if I am posting this in the right place but it seemed like an okay place to start, so here it goes:\n\nI am currently working on my first novel, and I am considering including a character with albinism. I do not have albinism and I do not know anyone with albinism, so I am pretty lost. It would not be the main character, as I am not in a position to write about the experience first hand. My novel would also have a fantasy/magic setting. I have researched the medical aspect of albinism, but not the cultural. \n\nSo, what I am asking for is:\nWhat are some stereotypes I should definitely avoid?\nWhat are some things I should include to make the character realistic? \nIf you could create a spell/magical object/potion to help you cope with the effects of albinism, what would it be? \nWhat would you look to see in a character with albinism that a lot of people do not know about? \nAny other advise on writing this character? \n\nPlease feel free to redirect my post if this is not the place for it. If it is in any way offensive at all, I will gladly take it down, as I do not want to create any problems. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to leave a reply, no matter how long or short it is. Hi! Commenting here to remind myself to come back in a bit when I have time to give my thoughts as someone with albinism :) A few things to avoid:\n\nDefinitely avoid the whole \"albinos are evil\" stereotype, it is definitely been prominent in media/literature and can lead to a lot of stigma and stereotype. \n\nThere is a lot of misconception about eye color, especially in media portrayal. A lot of people think people with albinism have to have pink/red eyes, but in most cases our eyes are only that color in certain lighting. Most of the time they are blue or pale versions of the colors they would be in the absence of albinism. \n\nProbably do not refer to the character as \"an albino,\" but instead use \"person with albinism\" or \"x with albinism.\" The former term may be offensive to some.\n\nAs far as spells, alteration of light could be interesting. For example, if the character could \"darken\" an area to alter the opponent's ability to see. \n\nIf you have other/follow-up questions, feel free to message me! Thank you! This is really helpful\nI was not planning on using the evil trope at all, I did not even know it existed. I am leaning more towards cottagecore lesbian, or at least I am getting inspiration from it. \nI will take the spell thing about light into consideration, as it would match the cottagecore vibes too (you know, cause growing plants needs light).\nYour response is very helpful, thanks for taking your time to write this Of course, I am happy to help! Best of luck in writing! Thank you! Everything already stated in the top comment! But if I could make a magic potion, it would be like an internal sun block. I hate sun block, but I really love my complexion, so I would not want to change that. Magical sun protection ftw! My son has albinism. He would probably pick his superpower to not have to put sunscreen on everyday or to have normal vision. People with albinism have \u201clow-vision\u201d. They just do not see as clear as others because of their smaller optic nerves and lack of pigment in the eyes. \n\nMy son is still young enough to not realize he is different from the other kids.  He loves his platinum blonde hair. He also loves his sunglasses. I hope he stays this way with all the confidence he has now. People with albinism are sometimes portrayed as shy. I would love to see or read about a character with albinism that loved the way he looked. Missing: Elric of Melnibone.  I swear I have answered this question quite a few times but cannot find the comments so I will just rewrite what I write every time this question gets asked.\n\nWhy does your character have albinism? What character or narrative purpose does it serve? How would the story be different if they did not have albinism? Ask yourself these questions, and if you cannot come up with good answers then your character should not have albinism.\n\nYou can apply this rule to practically anything to determine what value something adds to your story. Consider the movie Cars: what is the point of having the characters \\*be\\* cars? If they were people competing in a foot race, would it change anything fundamental about the plot or the characters? Spoiler: the answer is no. The fact that they are cars is mostly a gimmick. With something this innocuous it hardly matters whether or not they are cars, but we are talking about a genetic condition whose media representation amounts to a creepy flagellating monk, a religious suicide bomber, and that torturer from the Princess Bride. I still love that movie though.\n\nPoint being, this can \\*not\\* just be a gimmick that you give your character because you think it makes them sound cool or unique or whatever. Give some care and consideration to why it is important that this character has albinism and how it impacts who they have become. How did their parents react to their strange looking child? How do their peers respond to them? Are they held in contempt because of their appearance and/or vision loss, or are they seen as blessed?\n\nDifferent cultures have responded differently to albinism. In some African cultures, we are literally hunted because they believe our body parts can be used in magic rituals. In others, we are not given much significance but are generally bullied for being different. In Panama we are seen as lucky.\n\nAlso give some thought to what has gone in to this character overcoming the barriers associated with albinism. How do they deal with sunny days? Glare? What tricks have they learned to overcome being visually impaired? What funny little habits have they developed to cope with unfamiliar situations?\n\nPart of the story of anyone with any sort of disability is the battle to overcome. Either a battle of strength to overcome something that can be defeated (think physio to help someone get stronger), a battle of cunning and innovation to overcome something that must be worked around (clever little tricks like sticking your pinkie over the rim of a glass so you know when it is full), or a battle of friendship to overcome something that must be worked through (loneliness, stigmatization, cultural misconceptions or leaning on friends to get through the emotional impact of difficult times).\n\nI think a lot of the time what is missing from stories about people with disabilities is that whatever they have \\*is\\* a disability - they have a distinct disadvantage that they must work hard, smart and long to do stuff that others just do without thinking. Able bodied people love their inspiration porn of the kid with no legs who ran a marathon or the blind guy who climbed Everest and those stories are fantastic, but if all you are looking for is the uplifting side of things you are missing like 99% of the story. The cameras were not there when that kid with no legs was crying because someone at school stole his prosthetic and ran away with it. Or when he tackled stairs for the first time and could barely make his new legs bend.\n\nThat is not to say that people with disabilities are or should be defined by their struggles, but that those struggles are real and often difficult to navigate. They are part of us and help to make us who we are. It might just be my opinion, but if you can negate all of that with a magic potion then that is not an authentic portrayal of anything, really.\n\nNote that I do not believe that all stories with disabled characters have to be about overcoming disability, just that it is a present feature of being disabled.\n\nLet us do a hypothetical (but ultimately terrible) example. The world of Middle-Earth is bright and sunny and Frodo has Albinism. He needs to get to Mordor to destroy the ring but he cannot travel overland for long periods of time, so this leads them into the Mines of Moria where his friend and mentor Gandalf perishes. Frodo feels guilty because it was he who required them to take this dark and dangerous route in the first place, but after seeing the loyalty of his friend Samwise, he realises that he is not a burden to others and is able to move forward to continue his journey.\n\nThe story is still about a little Hobbit working against overwhelming odds to destroy an evil ring. The story is not about Frodo having albinism, but it includes an example of his needing to do things differently (travel through Moria) and as a result his character changes and grows through his experiences. Frodo's disability breakthrough is not the main point of the plot, but it is present and provides a new framing for the narrative.\n\nI hope this has been helpful to you. Good luck. Totally agree! Sunscreen is horrible! Hey, as a person with albinism, something you might be able to use is the character tripping over small changes on uneven flooring, like a tiny step down, or something. Also, if the character does not have sunglasses on outside, get them to tilt there head away from the sun or look at there feet. When I am outside without sunglasses that is what I do, I can only see about half a meter of floor surrounding me the rest is just bright white light. \nHope this helps! I entered this post because I want to write a character with albinism too. She does not \"need\" to have albinism in the story, but she just have it. She acts like any other person but her vision is worse and also she is away from the sun and use sunglasses. She also gets bullied by it and its an edgy teenager. Do you think I should erase the fact that she has albinism? &gt; Why does your character have albinism? What character or narrative purpose does it serve? How would the story be different if they did not have albinism? Ask yourself these questions, and if you cannot come up with good answers then your character should not have albinism.\n\nAs a wannabe writer, I cannot help but feel that this is really bad advice.  If you followed it to the letter in all situations, it means you would end up with very little character deviation.  Why is this character a woman?  Is there a reason why it has to be a woman?  If not then just write a man instead.  Why is that character foreign?  Is there a reason why they have to be foreign?  Etc etc.  \n\nA better approach is to do your research and figure out how to include characters in your stories who are not like you in an informed and sensitive way.  For example, it does not take much research to learn that most of us do not have red eyes, yet red eyes are ridiculously common in fictional portrayals of people with albinism, because the writer was too lazy to do any research into the condition.  And let us not even get into the hilarity that is the albino sniper! The only advice I can really give as both a (really crappy) writer and as a person with albinism: Write your characters to be people first.  You are not writing an albino character, you are writing a character whom happens to have albinism.  \n\nFigure out who your character is, then start figuring out how that character may be impacted by their condition.  For example, you might decide that your character is a musician.  How does having albinism affect that?  They would either need enlarged sheet music, or learn to play their repertoire from memory, as reading sheet music could be a struggle.  Are they an artist?  If so, maybe they favour impressionism over realism because it is closer to how they see the world.  Are they cheerful?  Grumpy?  Clever?  Dumb?  Optimistic?  Pessimistic?  What are their friends and family like?  Are they nice?  Nasty?  Are they unapproachable at first but not so bad once you get to know them?\n\nAll most of us want to see regarding characters with albinism is well-developed and fleshed-out characters.  Such characters with albinism are sadly few and far between, many writers do not even bother giving such characters a proper name! Would you like that reminder now? \ud83d\ude04 Hello I am also a writer who does not have albinism who has referred to this subreddit for some advice. Because I am bored I decided to come back to this subreddit and see if anyone else asked the same question. I will give you the advice I heard from others and what I did writing my character. Like OP, if anything I say in here is wrong or offensive at all I will gladly edit/ take it down. This was posted like 3 months ago though so I would not be shocked if I get no response. \n\n1) anything that is said in here by someone who actually has this condition immediately overrides anything I say here. \n\n2) I was told not to make my character have any superpowers. In my story the characters sister can do something magic involved, but this sister does not have albinism. \n\n3) I was told that it should have an impact on the character and their actions. Someone else I believe said this. It should not be there just to be there, but it also should not define the character. For example: My character sits close to the TV or paints looking at the canvas very closely. In the sequel to my story which I am currently writing, a kid bullies CWA and CWA beats the bully up and her parents buy her a Nintendo. She overcomes the condition and will not let it stop her from doing what she wants. \n\n4) I was told not to make the character evil, which I did not plan on doing anyway. With my character, she can be bossy to her younger sister, misbehave a bit, and that is it (she is like 8). Otherwise she is just a happy and optimistic kid. \n\n5) I finished a draft of my story, but if there is one thing I think I failed with when writing my character and will likely change, it is the impaired eyesight factor. My character is incredibly good at painting (her dads a painter) and can make nearly photorealistic paintings being a child prodigy. Chances are I will say she is a good painter but not a photorealistic prodigy at age 8. Most child painters with 20/20 eyesight probably cannot do that anyway. \n\n\nGood luck writing your story, and I hope my advice comes in handy as someone who has asked this same question on this subreddit before.", "I have Piebaldism rather than Albinism but the constantly hair dye struggle is real!

Is there a way I can help her live a better life? Are there any treatments for the eye conditions? What type of sunscreen should she wear?

Thank you very much \ud83d\udc4b Perhaps the best you can do for her eyes is to take her to an ophthalmologist who specializes in low vision. He or she can best determine if there are glasses, such as telescopic ones, or other aids that can help.

As for sunscreen, I tend to use sun-protective clothing (UPF-50+, a different scale than SPF) whenever possible because it is more reliable and its effectiveness is better understood.", "Can Albinos see the future?

It is much harder to find in the stores, but I definitely prefer it. The softer tone looks much less dramatic on my eyes. I also wear a light liquid eye shadow that is greyish and slate eyeliner. My look is pretty minimal but it works for me.  For me I enjoy the look of bright colors against my skin.

Will see if that helps.\n\nI am starting to wonder if I would be better off with a slightly smaller screen or perhaps an ultrawide. In person retail is closed because we are in lockdown where I live. It is not really possible to try anything in person before buying at the moment. I only know one other visually impaired person personally and he uses a screen reader, which does not really work for me.\n\nWhat is your setup like? Hey, I do a lot of visual design and digital learning development. My acuity is 3/60 (1/20 in the US I think?) and I have very limited peripheral vision. I have a dual monitor setup with two 22' monitors, each on one arm of a stand that raises them to my natural eye level. Personally I just use my computer with dark mode and I increased the icon and font sizes by a few, other than that I just lean in closer if I have to, I have issues with strabismus in addition to my ocular albinism and nystagmus so sometimes I cover my bad eye and that helps too. I have had a VERY similar journey to you. I see 20/80, and for a long time used a 49\u201d 4K TV for my monitor. Had the same issues as you getting to all the corners at times. This meant I could not multitask super well, I did not feel like I could effectively have two windows up side by side since it would be hard to see the outer edges\n\nI switched jobs to something that required more multitasking, and I now use 2x 32\u201d 1440p monitors. Basically a less cool/functional ultra wide. I have to keep them closer to me on monitor arms for sure, and also find myself using the Windows built in magnifier a lot (I have it tied to an extra button on my mouse) so it is not as easy to read as the 4K setup was, but it functions better with a lot of information  for sure. My monitor is like 29in I think. But I mostly use dark modes or use the CNTRL +  shortcut on the keyboard to enlarge text when I need to. I also have my display settings at a large resolution. In a very similar boat to you, also a software engineer. I live in the UK so companies here have a responsibility to provide adjustments etc, as such I have been through quite a few iterations on this very topic. \n\nOften people assume that bigger diagonal = better for VI but this only works if it scales normally. I have tried some super wide ones over the year and I have never been more frustrated with an adjustment. What I have found to be the absolutely perfect middle ground is the reasonably new range of Dell 43\" 4k multi-client (well they are designed to be used as 4 x monitor corners but you can use it as 1 giant one).\n\nI always explain this to the adjustment people at work as \"I need context when writing code\". Wider means I can read more per line, but I need to be able to see more lines vertically when writing code as do all my non VI colleagues. \n\nI would highly recommend looking into this sort of monitor or similar as they are also designed to be used at such short distance/such prolonged periods whereas TVs are designed to be viewed at a greater distance therefore can lead to greater discomfort in both sharpness, colours, heat etc.\n\nThis is the one I use - they are pricey but you can often find significant discounts often online. It is also worth looking into whether your workplace can offer any sort of assistance/reimbursement for remote work adjustments. I would also of course highly recommend pushing your workplace to provide this in office as I have successfully done at my past 3 jobs.\n\n Good advice. Thanks. I will look into that 43\u201d.  One thing I have not liked in the past is being able to have code and docs side by side on separate monitors. There is a balancing act there and I am not sure what exactly the right answer is. Maybe a 43\u201d and 27\u201d vertical.\n\nMy boss has said I can either expense whatever I need and the company will reimburse me, or send him links to whatever I want and he will get it. So far I have done this to get a sit-stand desk and a new chair.

I was lucky enough to get my testing done for free, but I certainly would not pay for it.\n\nThere really is no medical benefit to knowing your exact OCA type.

Hey you all, so I am 20 years old going on 21 and I have ocular albinism.  I have been driving since I was 17 with a bioptic telescope, having to go renew my license every one to two years (it varies every time based on what the examiner\u2019s discretion).  For context in my state (CA), every time I have to renew my license I have to go get a vision exam done, then schedule a behind the wheel drive test.  Every time my doctor has written that my vision is more than adequate to drive at night and that I in fact see better at night.  Furthermore, every time after I passed the drive test the examiner said they would make sure that there would be no daylight restriction on my license.  Thus, since then I have been driving at all hours of the day and night (since I was 17).  I am in the process of renewing my license for the 2rd time  (3rd time actually having to actually get my license) and I find out that for some reason there was a daylight restriction on my license for the past two years despite what the examiner said.  I have been pulled over driving home at night form work and have not had an issue, but it is on my license.  My question is has anyone else had this issue?  It is so frustrating being told I cannot do things that I have been doing for the past 3 almost 4 years now, especially after being approved by both my doctor and my driving examiner.  I need to be able to drive at night, and apparently I have been doing so for the past two years not knowing that my license said daylight restricted.  Any suggestions as to how to make the DMV remove this resection on this go around of renewing my license? This exact situation has not happened to me, but the last time I went to renew my license I explicitly told them I wanted to drive at night and had to take my behind the wheel test at night (or at least around sunset). \n\nI am also an albino driver in CA - been driving for around 8 years. Feel free to PM me any questions.  Hey! I am so happy for you guys!\nYou are so lucky to be able to drive. I have ocular albinism, and do not use a cane or anything.

What sort of light bulbs do you purchase. I notice after having switched that LED light bulbs are a much more bright, white light, rather harsh on the eyes. Go with warm toned LED that makes mode better. I am also considering getting Hue lights that I can set brightness and colors in the rooms that matter most. \n\nCool toned LED can be very bright and harder on the eyes if you are that sensitive. I try to avoid them if I can. I would also speculate that, it is also about the light being covered to help scatter the source and dampen the brightness a bit. The light being less direct helps me. Sometimes those big covers over light bulbs are not pretty, but it can be worth it. Two things to consider:\n\n- Smart lights: I use Phillips Hue myself, have them all connected etc. It is much better to distribute more, dimmer light than have a single, bright source. They also give you a lot more control over temperature/brightness etc\n\n- Use uplighting instead of overhead, e.g. lamps with the martini glass sort of shape diffuser on top, so you are never looking directly at a bulb Where possible, I have replaced light switches with dimmable light switches. Where that is not an option we have switched to Philips Hue bulbs. We have also installed either black-out blinds in our bedroom and fairly-dark blinds in other rooms, since our house faces a southern direction. I am also a huge fan of the indirect lighting, mentioned earlier; it is made a huge difference in our kitchen, where above-cabinet lights illuminate the ceiling. There are cheaper alternatives that are reliable. I use LifX and love them. They also do not require a hub and work with Google Home and Alexa. Should also work with Apple, but I do not own any Apple products at the moment. Awesome options in here. I agree with the warm LED lights. Also, light coverings and lamps are a better option than huge overhead lighting. I have a lamp in my room with smart lights. I use the LifX brand. It is a bit cheaper than Hue and does not require a hub. I highly recommend them. \nDimmable switches are also an epic option.

Hi I am 15 F and I am from the U.S.A just for a bit of context. \n\n1.I did not experience bullying until 5th grade which is where middle school starts where I live. It was to the extent where people would threaten me so it was pretty severe. I have luckily switched schools and I am now in high school I have not experienced any bullying in my new schools the closest I have gotten to being bullied in my new school is a few comments. \n\n2.I have a little brother who also has albinism. He is 11 and our condition has given us a very special bond. There is 1 other albino at my school who has albinism a year or two adobe me but we have never really talked.Not having many others with my condition does not really effect me. When I was being bullied I really hated and despised being different but over a few years I have grown to embrace my differences and show them off.\n\n3.On the news they only talk about the horrible things that happen to albinos in Africa. While I think they should shine light on this I do not think they should portray all Africans like this. The only other media coverage is one episode of American horror story where there was an albino character. Which obviously does not show what we are like but it is a horror series so that is expected. I wish they would talk more about the albino people who are doing good in our world but the media does not really shine much light on the good of any situation.\n\nI am very sorry if this is poorly written or if any of it is repetitive. Thank you for responding! I am sorry to hear you were bullied and glad you were able to get to a better situation. You are the first person who has said they had a family member with albinism too. I can see how that would bring you both closer together in understanding. I really appreciate your comments on the media portrayal and wanting to see people living well, it was very comprehensive. \n\nAlso, everything was well written and fresh. \n\nThanks again for taking time out to respond!", "Anyone else here that does not \"look like\" they have albinism?

Mine was definitely a few weeks ago when I was getting my hair cut. Another stylist at the salon asked me if my hair was naturally that blond and I said yeah. She absolutely freaked out and started showering me with compliments calling my hair beautiful and what not. People have commented on how blond it is before but I would never been prouder than in that moment. I take more pride in my skin, if we are going by the way we look outwardly. I hated my yellow hair so much because people would grab me. I do have some tyrosinase so my hair,is dark blonde now, but I am still very pale. I am proud of some things I have been able to do despite my vision impairment, like photography, gaming, and makeup. me too, my vision helped photography rather than impaired it because I naturally get super close to my 'subjects' - making each portrait so much more intimate :)  When I saw the guy that plays Tobias on Black Lightning and my son (who does not have albinism) excitedly said Mama why is uncle on TV?! My brother has it as do I and besides us my son does not see many people with it. \n\nI think having a parent with a disability has taught my son compassion and that just bc people are different does not make them bad people.

(UK) I am very pale and regularly get a lot of comments about just how pale I am with the very light hair and everything . I seem to display a lot of the symptoms of ocular albinism except I can look at computer screens without having to turn down the brightness or anything (in fact I am studying a computer science degree and spend a lot of time looking at screens with no trouble). \n\nAs far as I am aware I am not legally allowed to drive since I struggle reading things like number plates from a certain distance but I have never checked properly. I am a licensed skydiver and although I suffer quite a bit from lack of depth perception I have never really had any issues being involved in the sport.\n\nI have recently found this sub and I have spent the 18 years of my life thinking I am albino but I see people here talking about it like a disability but I have never felt of it as such so I am now wondering if I am actually albino or not since people seem to talk about albinism affecting them a lot more than it ever has for me. \n\n Albinism is not a cookie cutter condition. Every person with albinism will have a different experience, especially the degree to which albinism affects them (physically, socially, career-wise, etc.) With respect to vision, there are actually people with albinism who have 20/20 vision. We still are not sure as to why, but they exist. Like you, I can stare at bright computer screens for hours and hours without issue. Meanwhile, my friend with albinism always has to turn the brightness down on my phone before he can use it. We have identified that this is because I have pigment in my irides which block a lot of the light (and also makes them hazel, as opposed to the light blue seen in most people with albinism). Two diagnosis, vastly different experiences.\n\nThe best way to determine if you have albinism is a DNA test. The second best way is to see an eye doctor (optometrist or ophthalmologist, preferably one that specializes in patients with low vision) and be evaluated. Some people with albinism can drive and handle bright lights, others cannot do either. Notwithstanding, pretty much all people with albinism will have at least some of the telltale malformations of the eye: foveal hypoplasia, iris transillumination, reduced stereoacuity, abnormal decussation at the optic chiasm, and of course reduced visual acuity. Eye doctors can identify these things, but only if they know what they are looking for. Sadly, a lot of eye doctors are unfamiliar with albinism, and most have probably never seen a patient with albinism. I am sure your question has already been answered but I just wanted to put my 2 cents lol. Not all albino have visual impairments. I have an ex who is albino and he can legally drive. I also have my phone and computer bright. The sun is very hrassh to me but I manage it. Albinism varies by person. There is a lot of different types of albinism. There are some cases where people just have albinism strictly in the eyes. I did not know that was a thing until I went to a NOAH convention.  My eyes are a deeper blue with white specks, but my retinas do not have pigment. I do not have iris transillumination. I do have nystagmus and all that stuff...and cannot stand light for too long. I found out I have a copy for OCA1A, but I also have a tiny change that is common in people of my ethnicity, so I present more like OCA1b and OCA2. I suspected it for so long, but was not confirmed until I was 30! Great comments here, especially the 'cookie cutter' comment. Very true. Personally, I favour a super bright screen on all devices, and prolonged use is not a problem. Ironically, similar to someone else's comment, I do prefer a less bright sun :))  PS. where in the UK are you?

About to teach a  class that includes a student with significant visual impairment related to their albinism. I have gotten some paperwork from the office of accessibility and I have already spoken briefly to the student. They wanted to give me a heads up and started by apologizing. Seemed insistent on not putting me out but I want to make the class as accessible as possible. \n\n Intend to have a more in depth conversation with the student but would appreciate any tips you may have for an instructor delivering a class online. Anything in particular work especially well for you? Thanks so much. Any and all ideas appreciated. I mean if it is an online class I would bet that said student has accessibility stuff already set up on their end. The thing with ocular albinism is that it varies in severity so someone with it could be legally blind or someone else with it could just have 20/40 vision and photophobia, it is kind of on a spectrum and the amount of accessibility needed depends on the person.\n\nI would imagine making text and images on PowerPoint slides larger would help and if you need to do math maybe take it a tad slower, I know for me math was a big struggle because it took a bit longer for me to properly comprehend what the teacher was writing on the board as math requires more analyzing than regular reading does and it can be hard for someone with OA to keep up with complex equations because it takes them a bit longer to see what is going on on the board than for someone with normal vision, usually someone with OA will have issues with their optic nerve and so sometimes it might take longer for what their eyes are seeing to rely with their brain The only thing I would add is to not force that student to have the camera on (at all times at least). For me this was important because I was always so close to the screen that the only thing others could see on my facecam was my foreheaf and, due to photophobia, my room would be almost completly dark, which would make having the camera on pointless in the first place.\n\nMy teachers would check on me every ten minutes or so to make up for not being able to see me, and would eventually ask me to turn the camera on when the task at hand was an oral presentation or a test (so they were sure I was not cheating or simply reading it from somewhere) but this would force me to stay further from the webcam and to lighten the room I was in a bit more, both of which made me a bit unconfortable and not being able to see what was on the screen during that time.\n\nIf I had to have it turned on all of the time I would be in a position where I would have a bit more trouble to keep up with what was going on during the lesson so I would recommend putting him at ease by considering this.\n\nIf he feels the same way I did about this he might even be relieved that someone understood him at first and has not made him explain his whole situation all over again and how he is not being uncooperative but rather just trying to facilitate his life.\n\nEdit: word order in the beginning of the last paragraph was wrong Let them record the class.", "Vision getting worse with age My husband has albinism. We have been friends for over 15 years and together for 8. Years ago his eye specialist told him that his vision had leveled off and he did not believe it would deteriorate any more. However, lately my husband and I have been talking and he is concerned that his vision is beginning to get worse. (We are in our mid-30's) We have looked for research online, but have not been able to find much. And of course we live in a small community and there are not a lot of others with albinism we can talk to as a comparison.\n\nHe is wondering if Albinism affects early-onset vision loss. (I hope I am explaining this correctly) Like how older people can start to lose their vision due to aging, does this happen earlier among those with albinism. I have asked him to call and talk to his eye doctor about this, but his number one concern is that if he admits his eye sight is getting worse, he may lose his drivers license. And that would mean his job. But my argument is I do not want to lose him due to a vehicle accident. Quite possibly the simple answer could be a new prescription. But I also know how much the unknown scares him.\n\nSorry so long. But any input is appreciated.  I am 31. I feel like my vision is getting worse, but in an aging kind of way not in a going blind way.  Thanks for the reply. That is the way he describes it too. Like it is just gradually getting worse. He is a worrier though. I try to help ease his mind by telling him it is totally normal. I am 33 and just got my first pair of glasses too lol. As we age, Albinism or not, gravity distorts our corneas. Some of us get cataracts. Our corneas get more rigid. Also, it is important to have good wraparound sunglasses to keep sunlight from coming in from the sides. Make sure the sunglasses have UV protection. Go to Lenscrafters; they have machines that accurately measure the eyes for things like astigmatism. Get a new script. Keep on driving. Lenscrafters is not going to tattletale on your husband. Eat foods that are good for the eyes, and take suppliments if you feel they are helpful. I wish you both the best of luck, and just remember...self-driving cars are just a few years away. :) Thanks so much! We have got an appointment for him to get his eyes checked. We live in a rural area, so his normal doctor is an almost 2 hour drive. But luckily another doctor was willing to do a regular checkup of his eye pressure and such. And yes, we are cheering for those self-driving cars! I cannot wait to see what the future holds :) I am happy for you guys!  The self-driving cars are being tested here where I live:  Depending on his acuity and what state you live in, he could still be eligible to drive with bioptics.  Have there been any updates within the month? Yes! We have got him a new pair of regular glasses which have helped, and we are saving some money to get him a new pair of bioptics. He also had an MRI and they found  a cyst in a sinus cavity that could be adding to the headaches. We are hoping to move by the end of the year, and from what I have read the state we are going to will be easier to deal with the drivers license bureau. Right now he has to do a yearly vision test, driving test after dark, get a letter from his doctor, and jump through a burning hoop to get a license that expires every year. With the state we are looking at moving to he will not have to do as much to drive.

I will say, it does get easier when you get older because people do not care as much to notice or say anything.\n\nBut I know that does not change what happened or how you feel. My two biggest pieces of advice are to be comfortable in your own skin and to learn how to look to yourself to define your worth and identity and not let others define it for you. If being comfortable in your own skin means dying your hair and dressing a certain way, then that is okay. But only do if YOU want to. Remember too, you are not defined by the things kids say when they do not understand something.\n\nI know it can be hard right now and that my advice is not an overnight thing, but I hope it somewhat helps. Either way, be you and be proud to be you. Hair dye will not take in my hair.  I feel prettiest when I shave my head.  It also makes it easier to apply sunblock to my scalp.  Maybe get a wig? In High School, kids are required to go - because it is school. If you decide to go to college/university, the difference is that adults are not required to go; they are there because they choose to be there. It is been my experience that higher education filters out nasty people - because they are paying to be there, and do not have time for nastiness or disruptions. Keep your chin up, and learn to love who you are. At 51, I do not care what people think anymore. I take the trash out without a shirt on (because I look and feel great). You will get through high school just fine. Make the most of what comes, and the least of what goes. Life is too short to let stuff bug you.

Hang in there. Check out NOAH, it is a support group. But the easiest thing to do is get help and learn to love yourself I second this. Albinism.org\n\nI would also suggest clothes that flatter you. Clothes that make YOU feel good about yourself. \n\nI am sorry you are having such a hard time. It sounds really tough. I remember having a similar experience in elementary and middle school. just like in your experience, high school was not nearly as bad. I suppose teenagers start to become more absorbed with their own lives than trying to tear down those of others. Like others are saying it does get easier as you get older and you learn to accept yourself and your situation. Find some good friends that treat you like everyone else and surround yourself with them. I did not really have a good group of friends until becoming involved in the local music scene after I had graduated. Stay strong! I would like to add that you cannot change people, but you can change the way you respond/react to them. I am not trying to be mean when I say this, but shaving off your beautiful hair gives THEM power over you. \n\nBy all means, if you feel like changing up the way you look, and it helps you feel better, go for it, but do it for yourself. Hi, I completely understand the feeling. Having Albinism is not easy. But that difficulty is where your strength lies. You are built tough and that will give you the strength to achieve a lot if you set your mind to it. \n\nI have been bullied fairly a lot throughout school. It did get marginally better in high school but it was still pretty bad. Kids would make fun of my skin, hair, and my eyes (because of the Nystagmus). \n\nIt is tough but like others have said it gets better as you get older. When I started college the bullying was non-existent, never dealt with it sense. \n\nWhat I did to cope with Albinism was to strive to achieve goals as a way of building my self-confidence. Eventually I came to the realization that even with Albinism it is very possible to live a completely normal life.\n\nI have come to realize the biggest limitations I have faced due to Albinism have been more mental than actual physical. Once you have overcome the mental challenges with having Albanian you will be perfectly fine. \n\nThese are my thoughts\u2026.

I do not have any instances of albinism in my family, so we took our chances. We are aware, however, that our child is a carrier of the recessive gene. There is no way around it genetically. We have one son and my brother-in-law (also has albinism) has two sons, none of which have albinism. There is always the chance that we have a grandchild or great-grandchild with albinism, but luckily they will have some badass older family members to be there for them and answer questions. I have not but I wish I could. I am pregnant and have albinism. My number one wonder is if my baby will have albinism. Cannot wait to find out (I will love them either way). We had genetic counselling.  It just seemed sensible.  As far as we ould tell there was nothing in her line to be concerned about, and nothing, other than the albinism, in mine.\n\nI have OCA1, which is a pretty 'common' (if we can consider ourselves common) form.  It is recessive, as most albinism variants are.  This means both parents must be carriers of the allele for the condition.\n\nBoth my parents were phenotypically normal.  However, both were carriers, so I have albinism.  My brother and sister are phenotypically normal, but they may be carriers.  None of their kids have albinism.  Again, they may be carriers as well.  \n\nBoth of my kids are phenotypically normal as is my wife.  She likely does not carry the allele.  (At least as far as the genetic counsellor could determine).\n\nIf you and your partner have albinism, your kid will.  If one of you does, there is an elevated chance, but, your partner has to be a career.  If your partner is a carrier the chance is 1 in 2.  If your partner is not a carrier the chance is 0. very very helpful, thanks for taking the time to write this, much appreciated No problem!

As he gets older, he wants more independence. \n\nThe biggest challenge seems to be light sensitivity.  He wears prescription glasses indoors, outdoors,  and at night.  While it helps with light sensitivity and pain, it greatly impacts acuity.  He had to quit the track team because he could not see when running after dark. He has 3 glasses , each with a different level of tint. \n\nHow do you manage your light sensitivity? I have albinism, too, with an extreme sensitivity to light. I usually just wear sunglasses during the day, or avoid being in certain lighting environments on my days when I am more sensitive. \n\nAs far as helping with acuity issues, I have not quite figured it out. I know when things are usually too dark for me to see, light markers actually help quite a bit. (It does sometimes add some really weird shadowing though.) Maybe it is possible that can help your son for track? I am not quite sure what he has issues seeing in track after dark, but if it is, say, the lane he should be running in, he could try reflective tape on the lane. That way as he approaches the tape, he has a marker of where to stay, but it is not a continuous source of light. \n\nCan I ask what he has trouble seeing specifically? I might be able to give more adaptability ideas if you would like!  Thanks!\nAs far as what he cannot see...just about anything. His measured optimal acuity is ok (better than mine , and I am able to drive and read with glasses) . However,  wearing sunglasses in the dark would make anyone unable to see.  He has a lower level of shade for night , but it has impacted him getting around safely , too.  He uses a cane.\n\nHe used to have orientation and mobility services through school. We moved states and because he is not legally blind,  he does not qualify in our new state. We live in a place with rain and darkness most of the year.\n\nHe also deals with people thinking he is rude for wearing sunglasses indoors. My light sensitivity is not too bad, but as a kid, I remember using transition lenses. Those seemed to help in the evening. You might want to see if you can test out the lenses first to see if they would help before going for a prescription.  Thanks for your thoughtful reply. Transition lenses do not help because they transition in the dark and he still needs the protection . Street lights,  for example are painful.  I will preface this by saying that I do not have the light sensitivity issues with normal lighting/streetlights etc, for me it is just direct exposure to sunlight that is painful. \n\nI played football and ran track in high school. As I said above I do not have normal light sensitivity problems so in track I would just switch between sunglasses and regular glasses as needed, but when I played football it was quite a bit harder to adapt. Until my doc told me about sunglasses contacts that are made by Nike and they were perfect. They could be worn all day, They were tinted enough that I was comfortable in the sunlight and I was also able to see and function just fine indoors as well as underneath the well lit fields during night games. \n\nThey may not be the solution for your sun, but it might be worth investigating if you have not heard about them before That is a great idea,  thanks! Any other info on those specific contacts? Well the ones I had before were made specifically by Nike and have since been discontinued. But it looks like there may be other options out there.  Hello\n\nChiming in a little late. \n\nI prefer hats with a visor, baseball or wide brim hats work great. This takes the sunshine directly off of my eyeballs.  \n\n Also I vary my sunglasses shade 3 in winter Shade 4 in summer with the occasional shade 5 (torch cutting goggles) during the worst times of summer when I absolutely must be out but my eyes need darkness.\n\nHonestly the biggest issues  I have with too much light are getting flashed by reflected sunlight (off of glass or chrome, like in traffic) or while driving in spring on a sunny day with lots of trees the constant flicker of sun/shade at fast speeds can give me a headache.  \n\nI do not wear prescription glasses for distance.  I have tried many times, just never seems to work.  But use Rx glasses for computer and reading.  \n\nI would encourage him to start using public transportation and exploring his area.  \n\nWhere do you live? PNW?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B; Hi \n\nHe uses public transportation just fine with no problems during the day. His problem is at night.  He wears sunglasses at night and cannot get around because he cannot see anything . Any luck with the yellow glasses? high contrast types.  \nMy big challenge with night time is streetlights/headlights.  So again visor but not glasses.  \nIts great that you are reaching out to ask for advice for him. I imagine there is an element of trying to fit in somewhere in all of this.  Good luck :) \n(also a mom of a 17yo).\n Thanks! He has rose tint,  yellow tint and gray tint. All three are stylish aviators..he wears a hat, but street lights are just so painful.  He wants to be independent,  work,  take the bus home after dark , and he does , but with great difficulty.  He has been injured and lost. He had to quit the track team because he could not see the track after dark with his glasses.\n\nI do not think fitting in is related . He has great peer relationships and kids have never given him problems . We have only had problems with adults.  For example,  teachers who think he is rude for wearing glasses indoors. One teacher told me he is lying about his visual impairment because she has seen him use his cell phone.  He was in a school okay once and the teacher said he could not wear his glasses . I;m glad to hear he has great peer relationships.  I feel like this generation is far more empathic towards each other.  \nSo how hard would it be if he bought cheap colored lights from harbor freight and made a lane for himself around the track?  Or even those little fake LED votive candles?  Just some ways to work around the obstacle.  \nThe teachers who do not think he is blind enough, yep that is a challenge too.  Oddly you just cannot win sometimes.  But it goes to show you that he is SO resilient that he passes for sighted.  \nI was an avid cyclist for 20years and I remember how hard it was to let go of something so empowering.  \nBest of luck;) Thanks.  It would not be hard to light a track for personal use , but we cannot alter competitive events that impact other athletes.  \n\nMy biggest concern is him getting around at night and being able to see. We have not found anyone who can help with this and it is very frustrating as he nears adulthood . Huh, I would think that there would be some type of ADA consideration for his competitions.  He can still practice tho\"?  \nAlso, has he considered the seeing eye dog?  I know Oregon Guide dogs will offer them to people with visual disabilities.  This of course has up/down side as he would need to take the dog along everywhere.  And I would imagine that could be a challenge as he considers college and/or work opportunities.  \nAlso there is the cane option.  One I employ only in extreme circumstance (alone in airports or extreme sun and migraine coming on).    I find them super inconvenient (too bulky and oddly makes one a target)  But I have known a few guys that use a plain cane (not red and white collapsing) or walking stick just to use for curbs and sidewalk obstacles like chairs.  \nOne trick I find works well in larger cities, is to sort of follow the crowd watch their feet and trust that the sidewalk will be there.  Works well for annoying things like glass doors and finding the restroom.  Its sort of an unconscious mechanism almost just working on intuition.  And of course its not foolproof, have lots of scars/bumps and embarrassing anecdotes but I am still alive.  \nResilience, its a hard skill to pick up, but one that will serve him for a lifetime \"We have not found anyone who can help with this and it is very frustrating as he nears adulthood .\"\nGenerally there are organizations for the blind/visually impaired that would help teach mobility skills.  I have lived in many places and that is generally a service that is offered either through state organization or a low vision center esp if its connected to a hospital. Thanks again for another thoughtful reply.\n\nHe uses a cane already and is involved with Guide Dogs (though,  not Guide Dogs Oregon , specifically,  will explain below). Guide dogs has an annual camp for teens with visual impairments that he attended last year and will attend this year. It is a great program,  the kids learn to work with a dog and get cool opportunities they never would at other camps. Last year they went white water rafting. \n\nRe ADA accommodations... we used to live in Hawaii and he got excellent services . The school gave him accommodations (access to books through BARD, orientation &amp; mobility , accommodations at school, etc) , he qualified for a reduced fee bus pass, and qualified for Guide Dogs Hawaii . Not only did they have great activities for teens with visual impairments,  they gave him really nice glasses , and even gave him a new iPad loaded with accessibility apps. He qualified for a dog (training and expenses covered) but they rarely give them to anyone under 18. Life was good, he had the support he needed to transition into an independent adult. He even had a part time retail job.\n\nIn Oregon , he qualifies for absolutely nothing because he is not legally blind . That is the threshold . Denied services at school. No O&amp;M. Also, guide dogs Oregon and other programs for people with visual impairment require legal blindness.  He went from a high level of independence,  to having severe difficulty with tasks of daily living.  We are grateful he is not legally blind,  but vision measurement is reported with optimum circumstances,  and so his acuity in the dark with glasses has been entirely ignored. \n\nOHSU is one of the best hospitals in the area, and they are no help with resources. They have outright refused to report his acuity with shades.  Their social worker said there is nothing she can do if he is not legally blind. \n\nWe hired a special education advocate to go after the school for resources and that has also not worked. \n\nRight now,  I am just trying to figure out how he can get around in the dark.  Your suggestion of following the crowd is a great one. Most of his problems are at night in the dark, though when others are not around.  He does great in the day and when out with friends. He does not qualify because he is not legally blind . Acuity is measured in an optimal environment.  Since moving to Oregon,  he has lost all services for which he qualified in our last state .\n\nI also meant I cannot seem to communicate the specific problem.  Even posting here , I have not been able to find an answer.  Low vision specialists have not been able to give an answer. The three levels of shades he does have is better than nothing,  but we have not been able to get him to optimal acuity in the dark.", "Man born with albinism fights for rights in Kenya ", "A yeah ", "I have always been really pale despite only having OA, not OCA.

I have never really done all that much here. So, my older brother and I both have albinism, but we do not really look anything like people of albinism that I have seen in pictures. I searched up people of albinism on google images and went pretty far down, but none of them had similar hair colour to me or my brother (I have golden-ish blonde hair that somehow looks brown when it is wet and my brother has dirty blonde hair). We both have blue eyes, and I saw a lot of those, but that makes sense because those are like the most common eye colour for people with albinism, I think??\nAlso, I did not really look into it at all, but sometimes I feel less valid as a person with albinism because I barely experience any vision issues or issues with the sun or light in general? Like yeah, I burn easier than most people, and sometimes I feel like the sun wants to harm me with all of its light, but it is nothing debilitating. And yeah, bright lights hurt, but they do not cause issues if I do not focus on them. As for vision, I think the worst of it is some minor difficulty with stuff that is far away, as well as a lack of depth perception, but neither of those cause me many problems. \nI just want reassurance that there are indeed other people of albinism that look similar to me and my brother, and others who have the same experience as me. There probably are, I just... feel the need to confirm it. Hello! Sounds like me :)\n\nBoth my brother and I also have albinism and it sounds very much like what you have described. My vision is very good for someone with albinism (20/40 - which is still considered visually impaired in my country) and I have golden/yellow hair and blue eyes. (Though it is actually a misconception that people with albinism have pink eyes!)\n\nI definitely do not do so well in the sun though and am conscious about wearing sunscreen everyday and limiting sun exposure, but I live in a cold country so that is not an issue most of the year. \n\nMost people have no idea that I have albinism and I understand the feeling of feeling a bit secluded, especially because I am not significantly impacted by my albinism in my day-to-day life. \n\nAnyways, just know you are definitely not alone, and there many different types of albinism that present in different ways. And feel free to PM me if you ever want to chat! :) You sound like me (22f) and my brother (17m)! \n\nBoth of us have skin that is a little bit lighter than the rest of my family\u2019s (we are white). My hair is strawberry blonde and my brothers is dirty blonde. We both have blue eyes. Our vision does cause some issues but we are both able to drive. \n\nOne thing I struggle with is people saving I do not look like I have albinism. Like wtf does a person with albinism look like then mf? I have learned to love my skin and my vision (though do not get me wrong I still struggle with self confidence issues). And I try to educate people when I can. That is such a good point. When people do not believe me when I tell them I have albinism.... I am like... why would I lie about that?? Lol Yeah it is so odd for people to say that. I usually respond with \u201cwell what does a person with albinism look like?\u201d, or \u201cwhy would I lie about having albinism? That is rude to assume I would\u201d\n\nIf someone is being rude it is ok to question them. Try to educate them. So they do not say the same thing to someone else. I am darker than what most people consider when they picture someone with Albinism. I have got brown/gold/red hair and green eyes. I still struggle with some typical vision problems like nystagmus, but not nearly as bad as some other people with the condition. \n\nTurns out, the type of Albinism I have (Brown OCA) is specific to West Africa -I am 28F Black, so even though I am darker than people with other types of Albinism, I look normal for that type of Albinism I have.\n\nThis condition exists on a spectrum, you are not less valid for not being what they show in the media. Hello! I am 16 and I feel like I do not generally look how most people would expect someone with albinism to look. I have gold/blond hair and blue/green eyes and my skin is pretty light, but not all that much lighter than the average white person. I experience visual and light sensitivity problems, mainly with eye strain and as migraine triggers, but my visual impairment is fairly mild. This is all to say that you are not alone and I relate :)", "I do not have a diagnosis I have always been extra pale with pale eyes and hair.  I burn easily and do not tan.  I have photosensitivity, severe nearsightedness, and astigmatism.  I am legally blind without my glasses.  But I have developed patches of skin that will tan instead of burn and I have grown some hairs that are black, brown, or even red.  As a kid all the hairs I looked at on my head were white or blonde.  (I used to pull my hair out and play with it.) What is your question? If you are wanting to be diagnosed with albinism, get an appointment with a specialist (like an ophthalmologist), preferably someone who has experience with this condition. They will be able to tell by looking at your eyes - skin and hair symptoms are less important as far as a diagnosis. My question is if I sound albino or someone recognizes a different condition.  I do not have dermatologists who take my insurance here.  Is that who you see for diagnosis? All of the things you have described can happen to people with albinism as they grow older. As advised look for an opthalmologist in your area with experience with albinism.

I never had any bullying experiences, but this one kid decided to cross the line on me. So he asked questions, nothing wrong about that. But then, I saw him go over to his friends, and told them. So his friends laughed and insulted me. I felt bad, I was like 8 at the time. People know about albinos, but tend to ask if i am black. I am a white person with Albinism, so basically any living thing can have Albinism. So any race or animal can have Albinism. But I found friends (I still have them but more) at a support group in a different city. The community was called NOAH, (Google it if your interested.) I found lots of kids with Albinism. At school, there is only 1 other kid with Albinism in my school. I am 21, and I still have Albinism, but I love it. It makes me unique. My daughter with albinism is 5 so she does not really understand yet that she is different than anyone else. I worry a little about bullying, or just the unconscious desire to \u201cfit in\u201d as she gets older.  I am happy that you are doing so well. Thank you! I hope your daughter is doing fine. I did not really have to \u201cFit In\u201d to have friends. I hope you and your daughter have a great day. Tell her I said hi and with the same condition!

The vision problems do not specifically blind you, but we Albinos have poor vision. I got glasses, and it helped a little. Without my glasses, I have problems with an object in distance, so yeah.

I have had white hair and skin my entire life, I have always just brushed it off as part of my German heritage. One day, however I wondered if there was a reason behind it all. I was never really aware of albinism before I looked it up but it made me wonder if I had it. \n\nI have white hair and skin that easily gets sunburnt. I do have generally good eyesight though, which makes me wonder if I have albinism at all. I cant find any evidence of people with white hair not prescribed with albinism, so I do not know if those two go hand in hand or if there is a difference. Doctors have never told me anything about having albinism, however have warned me about it being easier for me to get skin cancer. When you go out in the sun, does it hurt your eyes? Has anyone ever made any comments about your eyes?\n\nThere is genetic testing that can be done to find out if you have albinism. There are a few different variants of oculocutaneous albinism; if you are curious, you can always have the testing done. Go to anywhere in Scandinavia, you will find loads of people with light skin and blonde or light blonde hair but no albinism.\n\nThe best way to diagnose albinism without a genetic test is to be evaluated by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. There are certain key eye characteristics (reduced vision acuity, reduced steroacuity, foveal hypoplasia, iris transillumination, nystagmus, etc.) that are the hallmark of all types of albinism. An eye doctor who knows what they are doing can spot these. There are albinos without white hair. The medical definition is if you suffer from an eye condition called nystagmus. The thing is I have white hair but good eyes, I was wondering if there is a form of albinism like that or if it was all on the eyes. Nope, if you have good eyes you do not have albinism. as OP said, the diagnosis ultimately comes from eyesight, not pigmentation. Sorry friend, you are just really pale. You probably should ask a doctor.... It is possible to have albinism and not have \u201cwhite hair\u201d.  There are also several different types of albinism.  Pigmentation varies from person to person.  I have albinism and my hair is more platinum blond than white.   I have friends who have either red or ash blond hair.  Eye sight also varies from person to person.  Usually most people with albinism will have nystagmus (rapid eye movements), strabismus (lazy eye), and/or photophobia (sensitivity to light) with some reduced visual acuity. hmm, do you have eyesight problems? I would suggest getting a diagnosis from a doctor. I have a form of albinism where I gain pigment over time, dirty blonde hair and freckles so people do not think I have Albinism but I do, from what you said it certainly sounds like you might have it but the thing is that if you do have it your doctor should of noticed that and discussed that with you, none the less you should definitely discuss this with a medical professional.", "Happy Cakeday, r/Albinism!

Thanks for understanding. Mine are yellow, green and blue &gt; A common myth is that people with albinism have red eyes. Although lighting conditions can allow the blood vessels at the back of the eye to be seen, which can cause the eyes to look reddish or violet, most people with albinism have blue eyes, and some have hazel or brown eyes. There are different types of albinism and the amount of pigment in the eyes varies.\n\n(\n\nTldr eye color in people with Albinism can vary - there is no reason to assume that PWAs cannot have green eyes. That Is a super pretty combo. Is it like hazel or like central heterochromia? More like central heterochromia. The center is yellow, then a little bit of green the rest is light blue and a ring of dark blue around the iris. Just for reference, blue and gray are the most common eye colors for albinos. Mine are blue, but (to me at least) sometimes look gray. If the light hits then right, they apparently turn violet too, but I have never seen that, only heard about it from others who tell me not to move because it is cool looking! \ud83d\ude0a I have green eyes.

Personally I find it helpful to talk about my experiences with my friends. Helps me better understand myself and the world. I feel the same way about shaky cam! I occasionally get an odd one, I also have nystagnus which I believe is fairly common amongst those with occular albinism and it can mean that occasionally in very low light scenarios, especially those lit very poorly by just low powered LEDs, everything in my vision starts to shake.\n\nPeople find it quite off that my eyes wobble but by default I see everything as steady, however this is the rare exception I have found. Yeah my eyes shake too. For me I know it is happening when I have trouble focusing but it does not look like my eyes are shaking just that they cannot focus on one thing. So when that happens on tv it bothers me. Mine really is not bad to be honest, but I notice it every now and again and I never really comment on it.

I used to live in Florida and the transition was kind of ok i guess but the place was too wild for me even for a city Washington D.C. and New York City come to mind. I am fond of cities that have good subway/light rail systems as they run pretty frequently and are not affected by traffic. Seattle and San Francisco are pretty pedestrian friendly with decent public transit. Los Angeles is just too sprawled out to be effectively served by public transit.\n\nI have also heard good things about Boston, Atlanta, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Detroit but have no experience with their systems. I live in Dallas and public transit here is decent. It can definitely get me where I want to go but does not run as often as I would like, so there can be lots of waiting between transfers.\n\nYou can also use Uber to fill in the gaps. It is a hard question to answer and a hard decision to make. Ultimately, big city = good public transit. If you just want decent public transit to get you to work, museums, airport, etc. then any mid-size city would do.

Resources or groups for parents of kiddos with albinism (I have checked out NOAH) that are helpful?\n\nI am the parent of a 22 month-old girl with OCA albinism. She has not had genetic tests yet, so I am not sure which type, but she has some pigment to her eyes and while I assume she has light sensitivity, she does not seem bothered and loves being outside. She has horizontal nystagmus, probably astigmatism in one eye, and may need glasses, though so far her vision has been so so so much better than we could have dreamed--honestly aside from slathering her in sunscreen and hats, I hardly think about her albinism. (She has been to the eye doc a few times, just too young to tell about glasses so far, and as far as depth perception, it seems pretty dang good, although hard to tell with a toddler who is not exactly coordinated and still figuring her body out.)\n\nI am wondering about an outdoor preschool (way in advance--wait-list galore over here) for her because she absolutely loves being outside and we live in a wonderful place to explore--ocean, mountains, parks, etc. The schools are generally 8 am--12pm and change location thru the week. She always seems most relaxed and happiest when we are playing outside. But I also live in fear of sunburns and other adults not taking her sunscreen needs seriously (though I would tell them it is medically necessary, which is totally true!). \n\nI suppose, since I do not know anyone aside from my daughter with albinism, let alone many other parents of toddlers in general, I am trying to gauge the positive/negs of this idea. Does good sunscreen, hat, and (if she deigns to keep them on) sunglasses make 4 hours of outdoor time safe for a kid with albinism? Will it be too hard/tiring for her low vision, however good it seems to me? Am I way overthinking and overwriting this message? (Yes, probably.)\n\nI know that no one knows the exact right answer because everyone is different, always. I would just love hear thoughts from people with more experience than I have, whether they have albinism or kids with the condition. (Also, is it correct to saw 'with albinism' rather than 'is albino'?)\n\nThanks for any thoughts. I think if you are diligent about her sun protection and she is enjoying being outside then an outdoor preschool is fine for her. Some preschools can be weird about applying sunscreen and may want a medical note so they are covered when applying it. Also, NOAH does have parent connections where they may be able to connect you with someone who has gone through a similar situation to help guide you :) I have albinism, I am a mom (2 grown) and I have worked preschool\n\nSo here is my .02cents....\n\nIf you are insisting that the preschool provider put sunscreen on your child daily or multiple times daily, it might be a challenge.  On the best days wrangling many 6-12 kids and making sure all of their needs are met is hard but sunscreen is messy if it needs to be put on at a certain time....it might get delayed or forgotten.  OR they may be the best preschool in the world and do it faithfully on time, everytime.  Just be aware that this might be tough for them. But like any medication they are trained and should be able to accommodate.\n\nAlso depending on where you are (how strong the sun, amount of trees/clouds covered shelter?  Outdoors is a broad term. Will she have down time from super bright sun?  Personally I have done a good bit of outdoor summer with pre K and we like to mix it up... gives them a sense of indoor (calmer quiet book reading) and outdoor fun games play excitement.  \n\nI do not think you are overthinking at all.  Yes if she is in bright outdoor sunlight for 4 hours a day her eyes could be strained and she may very well get headaches or not.  My sister also has albinism and never gets eye strain headaches.  However I have struggled with them my whole life.  Everyone is different.\n\nSorry long story short...try it out.  see if she like it.  See if the people are a good fit and it works for your family.  its all just try see what works and take the best and move on.  \n\nyou can pm me or chat if you have more questions....best of luck to you Can confirm.   While I hate facebook...   My wife is one of the moderators of the NOAH/Parent connections facebook group.   It is kept to invite only and moderated to keep things informative and also keep out would be spammers etc.   Lots of good info there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have been through this with our son.   He is 10 now.   In early K-1st they spent lots of time outside.   Our teachers were excellent at helping him re-do his sunscreen often.   Also for him sunglasses were a huge help.   We bought packs of 10 and 20 of inexpensive sunglasses and sent them to school so the teachers always had extras.   Loosing them was a daily exercise in futility.   Now at age 10 he has very nice prescription sunglasses and no longer looses them (hurray!).   He became very self sufficient with sunscreen and sunglasses in 2nd grade.    \n\nWe are also fortunate that the school he is attending, he is the 3rd child with albinism to come through in the last 5 years.   The school had already done much to put in sunshades on the windows, dim the lights, safety painting of the stairs, etc etc.    He has a visio, and an iPad linked to an electronic whiteboard in the classrooms.   His teachers have the routine down very well. Thanks so much for your response and offer to pm. It is so helpful just hearing about other folks's experiences. You make a great point about the flow of the outdoor time--are they seeking shade, having down time, etc. It is fairly warm where we live (southern CA) so it could be too much...or she could love it...I think it is at least an option. Oh thanks so much for brining up the parent connect option--I would totally missed that!! And good to know about the preschool/sunscreen issue. On the one hand I totally get it, it would be hard to apply sunscreen to a bunch of toddlers all day. And on the other, everyone should be wearing it, pretty much regardless of albinism or not. All that sensitive baby skin! Self-sufficient with sunglasses and sunscreen is the DREAM. And how amazing about your son's school. That is so wonderful that they knew how to help him and all those measures were in place. It is reminding me of what is to come in the future--the hard parts, but also that there is help. I deleted my facebook but that group may convince me to go back. My son just got done with pre-k at our local school. The nurse had to apply his sunscreen. We had a doctors note. He was probably outside for 30 min- 60 min on warm days. 4 hours is a lot of time outside. As long as the sunscreen is applied every 2 hrs and your child has shade to play in, it should be fine. \n\nThe best things are those hats with flaps for neck protection and sunglasses with polarized protection. \n\nAnd the albinism community, I have come to find out, prefer to be called person with albinism. \n\nGood luck on your decision!", "Eye pain I am 25M with OCA. Around the time I graduated from high school I began having acute eye pain. Vision has not declined any more than would be expected with aging. No additional concerns from eye report. I do have a pretty ugly astygmatism and nystagmus as is often the case with OCA. I am at the point where I do not want to look at much of anything due to eye pain. Very sensitive to computer screens to the point that I can only look anti-glare screens and even then there is still some pain. \n\nIs this just par for the course with our condition? Has anyone had similar experiences. I hope the eye pain ends quickly. I rarely have eye pain. I would go see an ophthalmologist if I were you.  \n\nI have only ever had that when I had a (really nasty viral) eye infection a couple of years back. Pain is not the term I would use but I do experience discomfort, strain, and dryness after focusing on something for a long period of time. As others have mentioned, it might be worth chatting with an ophthalmologist about. I had a similar thing but mine ended up having to do with allergies. My OCA only causes some light sensitivity I get fatigued in the eyes which creates some discomfort when using technology too much.  4K television has saved me when watching programs or playing games.  \n\nHope you find relief soon!  Def check with your specialist though. I know I am late, but I hope you have been able to make an eye appointment. I have pretty severe photophobia but like others have said I would not usually describe it as painful. Best wishes and I hope your pain goes away soon. I have dealt with eye pain or strain for most of my life. An ophthalmologist did diagnose me with dry eyes, and prescription medication and nightly warm eye compresses do help with that. The pain/strain sets in if I am squinting at something for too long, possibly due to too much light or insufficient magnification. For computer work (I am a software engineer, so there is a lot of this) I use an earlier version of the ( telescopic glasses system.

Hello, I am 16M and do not have albinism, however I have been working on a novel/story that is for around a middle school age group. I have a character with albinism in it. I just had a few questions regarding this character and if I should change her or how I write her. Any response is greatly appreciated and should this book ever get published, any responses to this post will be credited. \n\nThe character is about 8-9. She is not a main character. She is very energetic, nice, and also very smart. Her main talent, however is that she is an absolute prodigy at painting/art, something she learned from her father. She is friends with one of the main characters\u2019 little sisters. \n\nThe frequency that her albinism is referenced really comes down to when she is initially described to the reader. She does things related to her conditon sometimes like putting sunglasses on in a bright environment (hibachi grill fire) or squinting when something is too far away, (if either of these is something unnecessary, please tell me) but it is not shoved in the readers face every five words that the character has albinism. \n\nOne of the biggest things troubling me is that I do not know what it is like to be albino, and therefore it is a little difficult for me to write a character like this accurately. I know that not every single person with albinism has the same exact experiences, but I just want to write a character that when it is necessary to reference it can portray this condition accurately. The last thing that I want to do is upset someone. \n\nHere are some other questions that I have. \n1) could someone with albinism paint well and/or play sports?\n2) Should I be referencing albinism more or less in this character? I do not want the condition to be the entire character. \n3) Am I worrying too much, am I worrying just enough, or should I consider not giving this character albinism?  \n4) is there anything else I should consider or do? \n\nThank you for taking your time to read this post. You are right that albinism is not a cookie cutter condition and everyone will have a different experience. With that said, I think you are on the right track of getting a sense of what it is like to have albinism. Most people with albinism are fairly photosensitive, but I do not think I have ever seen that to the point of wearing sunglasses indoors, even with bright fluorescent lights. The squinting at far away things is 100% spot on, though.\n\n&gt; 1) could someone with albinism paint well and/or play sports? \n\nI am not 100% sure on painting but I do not see why not. As long as they could lean very close to the canvas or whatever art medium they are using, painting is absolutely possible. One could even use reading glasses or powerful magnifiers to hone in those tiny details. I do know a photographer with albinism, do not think I have met an artist with albinism but it is certainly possible. Sports tend to be off the table for lots of people with albinism due to the depth perception issues, but I do know of one guy who played football and actually played at the college level, with no accommodations, so albinism and sports are a possibility. Often, they will be adapted (using brightly colored balls, using a tee during baseball, etc.)\n\n&gt; 2) Should I be referencing albinism more or less in this character? I do not want the condition to be the entire character. \n\nThat is really a personal, creative choice. In the same way that you have to balance discussing the character\u2019s actions and story with talking about their physical appearance, quirks, etc. I used to write fiction (before I started graduate school and, you know, had free time) and I was terrible at character development. What if the character did not have albinism? How much would you discuss their behaviors, appearance, etc. v. just their place in the story?\n\n&gt; 3) Am I worrying too much, am I worrying just enough, or should I consider not giving this character albinism?\n\nI think you will be fine, no one\u2019s going to come out and criticize that your character had green eyes instead of blue eyes or really nitpick, and the fact that you are checking with the community helps. The only time we detest a character with albinism is when they feature traits of the \u201cevil albino.\u201d Just do not make the character evil with red eyes and you will be fine. I think it is admirable that you want to try something different, rather than writing all the characters to be normal.\n\n&gt; 4) is there anything else I should consider or do?\n\nTry to look up some videos on YouTube of people with albinism talking about their experiences. Ashley Montes had a really good series if I recall, but most videos should do. Feel free to either post here or just message me anytime to double check if something you have written is accurate. It is hard to give generic advice or generic guidelines for albinism experiences because everyone is different. Rather, it is better to avoid common albinism misconceptions. We do not have red eyes, we are not evil, we do not sunburn in a nanosecond, and we are capable of a lot more than you would expect. I know someone with albinism who holds both an M.D. and a Ph.D., musicians with albinism, computer programmers, etc. I do not personally know any people with albinism who paint, but I am sure they are out there! You might mention how she has to bring her face closer to her canvas more so than someone with normal vision would. As far as sports go, like the comment above, it is an iffy subject. I personally have very poor depth perception, even though my acuity is not that bad, so being able to catch a fast moving object has never been an option for me. But! I do have a black belt in taekwondo, and I am not bad at archery or axe throwing either! Mostly because they do not involve catching anything coming in from a far distance. But that is just me.\n\nI also do not think people with albinism would use sun glasses at a hibachi grill fire. I am assuming this is a specific reference to a scene in the book, but I do not think that would be a case when they would be used. I agree with the comment above, that most PWA do not use sun glasses indoors. I have light sensitivity glasses that I take when I know I am going to stores with really bright fluorescent lights, but I can sit in front of a fire just fine, generally speaking.\n\nAnd a big one that the comment above already addresses, we do not have red eyes! I super appreciate you coming to this community to ask us how we would like to be represented in media. Most media depositions of albinism still spread hurtful or inaccurate stereotypes of albinism, and I am glad you have come to set the record straight.  Okay. Thanks a lot! This really helps. I will likely keep writing the character as I have, But I will likely come back and reference this again. The absolute closest my character has gotten to \u201cevil albino\u201d is playing a prank or two on the main character to be funny, or being a little bossy with her younger sister, but she is far from evil. That is just her making mistakes, nobody\u2019s perfect. Also the eye color thing confused me too, but I always went with a lighter blue eye color.  Once again, thank you so much for the response! If I need anything else, I will be sure to come back and ask. Thank you for the response! Perhaps I will change the hibachi grill part so that she does not need glasses, or tells her mom she does not need them. \nWriting about the character\u2019s eyes and what she can/cannot see was something I struggled/was confused with. Also, the character does not have red eyes or is evil. (Worst sins: 1) teasing main character a little, who is much older anyway. 2) bossing her sister around a bit.) once again thank you a lot for the response! I can only speak for myself here. I have albinism and my eyesight is pretty bad however I do enjoy drawing (not painting, but I\u2018m sure that\u2018d be possible). Maybe your character needs a magnifying glass when painting (that\u2018s what I use) or does digital art which is very much possible as you can zoom in. :)\n\nAs for sports, it is a little complicated and probably different for different people, but things like swimming usually aren\u2018t a problem and even scuba diving is possible. Things that involve balls (football, basketball etc) aren\u2018t possible for me (that is strange to say as a Football fan...) Thanks a lot for the response! With respect to the sports thing, I just came back from a 20 km bike ride, I have done 141 km this week.  I played football in high school and I played hockey as a kid (I am Canadian, we have to....)  I played pick up baseball with friends, basketball too.\n\nMy vision is 20/200.\n\nSunscreen, you should mention sunscreen. 20 km is 12.43 miles Ok thank you for the response! To the people on this sub, who are people with albinism,write and create your own character with albinism.  To the person without albinism writing characters with albinism, just do not.  Anything your write will be gratuitous.  Just do not. Oh and also congratulations with that bike ride! I do not think I could ride a bike for that long. Thanks!   I ride between 2000 and 2500 km each summer.  I am 55, so I have to stay in shape and all that Thank you for the response. Hey, I really appreciate you taking the time to portray your character accurately.  I think the same thing goes for any character who is experience you cannot totally relate to -  do your research !\n\nIf the girl is gong to be a visual artist, she is probably working on more abstract stuff.  Unless, of course, her vision is fairly good for someone with albinism.  What she is able to do just depends on whatever you decide her experience is.  Just keep what she does consistent with her level of vision.  \n\nMost people with albinism do not have very good depth perception, but many can still play sports.  I played ball-sports when I was younger, but was never very good at any of them.  I ended up gravitating towards things that I could excel at without depth perception, like running.  I do other things like skiing, and enjoy them, but my vision limits me to some extent.  I do not think there a ton of great albino tennis or badminton players out there :). I race on a ski team, but am not super great.  Having poor vision creates unique challenges, but usually does not mean that someone just cannot do something.  It just takes extra effort or creativity. \n\nThere should definitely be a balance in how much you mention it.  Albinism is going to be a big part of the character, but I think it is easy to get carried away.  After the initial explanation definitely let the reader draw their own conclusions about why the character is putting on sunglasses or leaning in to read something.  \n\nNo need to worry!  It is nice to be included.  I think you seeking information shows that you will portray the character well.  All the best books are in some way true to life, or at least well thought out.\n\nI am a 15F so I can definitely relate to your character and her fictitious experience.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  I would love to see your book when it is done. I dunno.  With that logic, authors would only be able to write about their own experiences.  Books would kind of suck at that point.\n\nIt is a very specific condition though, which is why he is here! Thanks a lot for the response! I was working while you sent this so I just fully read it now. \n\u2014\u2014-I like to imagine my character has impaired vision, but she is not completely blind from it. She can still paint very well but may look extra close at the canvas. If something is far away, she may squint. \n\u2014\u2014- In regards to sports, In the current copy of my story she is looking into playing basketball, and tells her babysitter (the main character) that she is able to play the sport in phys Ed in school.  because a lot of it is up close and personal and because one team is wearing pinnies which makes it easier for her to tell who is or is not on her side. If this sounds unrealistic than please tell me how I can change it. \n\u2014\u2014-In regards to the frequency that her albinism is referenced, her babysitter sees a photo of her and her sister and the main character notices it, and when his father meets her when dropping the  main character off, he later refers to her as \u201cthe perky one with albinism\u201d but this is actually the only time it is explicitly stated. I heard that calling someone with albinism \u201calbino\u201d is slightly offensive so I will avoid that. Afterward it is exactly what you said. If she squints or puts sunglasses on it just happens and \u201calbinism\u201d is never really used as a word. \n\u2014\u2014-This character is a complicated one for me that I worried about a lot in correctly representing. From what I read, the two biggest no-nos that will upset the majority of people with albinism is making the character evil or giving her red eyes, both of which are not at all traits of my character. I will definitely take this response and any other ones I get into consideration when I write this character and you and everyone else will definitely get credit. Thank you a lot for sharing your experiences with me! It means a lot. EDIT: iPhone does not let me type paragraphs so I put dashes for where the paragraphs should be split. I actually played basketball for a year or so when I was 8 or 9.  I was not very good at passing or shooting in game, but I could shoot free throws because I threw from that same place every time.  I was pretty decent on defense too.  People got better and I just got hit in the face too much for it to be fun.   It is like everything I see is flat.  There is very little difference between a movie and real life in regards to seeing how far away something is.  The pennies thing is definitely accurate!  I absolutely have passed the ball to the wrong person in a casual game.  \n\nI think the red eyes idea comes from how we look in pictures, my eyes are a light purple.   Thought I would mention also that there are two kinds of albinism, one for just the eyes, and one that affects the hair, skin, and eyes.  So, your character could have albinism without platinum hair and fair skin.  I hope this was not too much information. Thank you for the response. I always thought that people thought the red eyes thing because animals with albinism can have red eyes and people who do not do the research assume that they have red eyes. My character has oculocutaneous albinism (I think that is the one with the platinum hair and fair skin). Once again thanks a lot for the responses! They help a lot! The only way he should write about experiences of a group he is not apart of is if he actually has relationships with people within that group.  Example he is a relative, a good friend .  Perhaps you have not heard about the white women who wrote such a shit show of a book about Latinx people that was full of stereotypical harmful tropes.  The fact that she profited off of another group is just ..... When I was little I would wear my sunglasses inside sometimes. Now that I am older it feels weird so I just deal with it. :/ I agree with almost everything else you said though. Especially about sports, at least for me - although OP, there definitely have been athletes with albinism. I vaguely recall an article about a skier in one of NOAH\u2019s magazines a long time ago.\n\nBut yeah. Please do not make your character have red eyes. Make that rule #1. So, I agree with what most have said here. You seem to be on the right track. Do not overthink it too much. \n\nYou have seen that people with Albinism can play sports. I know many with Albinism who draw, paint, do spray paint art, digital art, photography, and more, so this is very possible.\n\nThe visual acuity of those with Albinism can vary somewhere between 20/60-20/1000 along with additional conditions. You seem to have addressed Photophobia. That is one of the biggest ones. We also deal with Nystagmus and resulting eye strain, so you can choose whether or not to incorporate that into your writing. Since she is not a main character, you obviously have the choice of how much detail to include about her and Albinism. \n\nI run a project called Albinism Up Close with some articles about experiences from my perspective along with resources. If you want to check it out or contact me, feel free. It is AlbinismUpClose dot com. Thanks for including Albinism in your story and not as a villain or super powered person. Keep doing what you do. I am with you on this one. I support the author and his search for accurate knowledge. That alone means a lot. Thanks for the response! I appreciate it. Hello, I have albinism and would like to help, just remember there are loads of different types.\n\nYes, I can paint and play sports,\n\nWhen I was 8-9, I did not really care much about my condition, and no one really discriminated against me (except for a few bullies, of course)\n\nWhen I was at school I had an Ipad, which I would use an app called \"JoinMe\" to connect to the teacher's whiteboard. Also, everything had to be in a bigger print, so when other kids were reading small books, I had to read an A4 Book.

To this day (I am 25) I still have a very negative reaction, even though at this point it is just people using the only word they know. I also find that it bothers me because people do not often know what albino actually means, they just see that I have blond hair and fair skin and put a label on me that they understand nothing about.  I definitely had it more in a derogatory way but I have come to accept it  With age, you tend to not get so offended about it, which has been my experience. It is just a clinical term. It is the only term people know. \"Person with Albinism\" is seven syllables, and is not part of the common street vernacular. To be fair, it is a audibly sharp word: AL-BIIIIIIIII-NO. I hear in the U.K., it is pronounced al-beano (beano is a fart regulator), but it has less of a sharp sound to it. Thank goodness for earbuds and noise-cancelling headphones.  haha, I love your reply. Yes, I agree with everything you say, with age, you get less bothered by it.

Thoughts? Hello everyone! I apologize for crashing your sub-Reddit but thought that this would be the best community to ask. I am currently writing a fantasy novel and one of the main characters is meant to have albinism, with lore behind it. I just want to make sure the portrayal is not problematic and is accurate, as I know that Hollywood has not been particularly good at that.\n\nIn the novel, different magics have been given to different peoples by different gods that have since faded into the background. The magic continues to be passed down through bloodlines. Healers are the exception, as well as people with the ability to see into the future and the past. They can come from any race. However, the way healers are regarded depends on the people they are born to. Some exalt the healers, some say they have demon's magic and treat them harshly. There are good and bad healers, just as there are good and bad people in every group. I do not have any specific bad healers planned yet.\n\nThe lore is that in exchange for the gift of healing, the god paints them in his/her likeness and marks them out as healers. It is sort of like the cost of their magic. The form the god has when choosing to be seen is someone with albinism. This god is sort of keeping the balance of the world. When one healer dies, another is born. \n\nHealers often have photosensitivity and their skin is sensitive to the sun. I am thinking of maybe creating some kind of special glasses/sunglasses for healers. Strabismus is also not unusual among healers, though I will need to research more on how to write about it properly.\n\nI imagine my main character with albinism to be similar to Thando Hopa in appearance. She works in a place where healers, and other people with magic, are heavily controlled by the nobility (only nobility really have access to healers). Any male healers who are born within the kingdom are sworn to the King's service. Female healers are disregarded and never trained because having a woman hold the same station as a man is viewed poorly. She was born outside of the kingdom, was trained and is very good at what she does. She essentially operates in a healing black market. She heals commoners and is open to many more clients, including members of a rebellion that is forming in the belly of the kingdom. She also secretly trains female healers in the kingdom who want to learn.\n\nHer story will intertwine with other characters to try to bring the kingdom down, in the hopes to build one where people with magic, women and commoners are free to live as they wish.\n\nI was mostly hoping to get some input on whether or not my character seems problematic for the community, or if there is anything problematic with the lore or culture, but really, any input would be helpful.", "UK participants with albinism wanted to test self-help appearance app Hi, my name is Fabio, I am a researcher at the Centre for Appearance Research at UWE Bristol, UK. \n\nWe have created a prototype mobile app called *ACT It Out* for **UK-**based adults who have any condition that affects your appearance, including albinism.

One of the questions we have pertaining to college is this; are individuals with albinism/low vision, eligible for special scholarships or financial aid for studies? With the rising cost of college we are trying to figure out how we might can find help!\n\nThanks in advance!", "A desperate albinism man in China? It is me. I am an albinism in China, 27 years old, male. \n\nI am single for 27 years, no girlfriend, no wife. Almost all of my friends are married, most of them has raised a child. also I have very few friends. Once they had their own family, relationships between us are looser and losser. Now I have almost no friends at all.\n\nIn China, the skin color between the albinisms and the normal people differences significantly, I suffer lots of discrimination from almost all aspects of my life. Is there still a discrimination of albinism in Euro or NA, I do not know...\n\nI do not like my current job, I want to find another one. BUT finding a job is too difficult to me, I spent a lot of time for this job, due to the freak monster look rather than the job abilities, I dare not find one right now, COVID-19 still affects the job markets. BTW, I am a coder, programmer, and I trust my coding skills, but it does not matter.\n\nI wished to go to a white people based country to try a new life, but my English is very poor(you knew it from these paragraphs). AND I do not know anybody out of China. These thoughts are just an wish, anyone who could teach me English just by simple communications??\n\nI am unhappy and desperate every day. Unknown future makes me scared. Hey! Your English is actually pretty good. I live in Australia where we get a lot of immigrants from south-east and central Asia and many of them only know a few words. You are doing fantastic.\n\nI lived in New Zealand until 2 years ago when I moved to Australia because I got a job over here. Both are English-speaking countries and the culture is very similar so there was not a big culture shock. But it is still a different country. I did not know anyone when I moved here and I am legally blind so it was very scary.\n\nIn NZ and Aus having albinism does make you stand out, but that is sort of a good thing in our culture. It makes you unique and interesting. People often want to talk to me about it and ask me questions. One time a little girl walked up to me and asked me if I was a snow queen! I could not help but chuckle, it was very cute.\n\nThere is still some discrimination, but I would be willing to bet it is a lot less than what you experience in China. The discrimination I get is very low-key and infrequent and does not really bother me.\n\nIt is obviously not a good time to be looking for a new job, I think you are wise to stay where you are until all of this blows over. I can tell you that in order to move to Aus or NZ you need to either have a family member already here or be a skilled worker with enough money to sustain yourself. It helps if you are sponsored by an employer. I do not know how it is in other countries or where you might like to end up, but I think it would be similar. You could start looking at job opportunities in some other countries and put a good resume together. You never know unless you try, right?\n\nGood luck! So sorry you are going through hard times. I have struggled with accepting my physical appearance due to albinism in the past. I truly believe albinism is beautiful! There are so many unique looking models with albinism who have learned how to own their look and that is amazing.\n\nHave you tried freelance work? I use UpWork to do some side projects, and I know a lot of coders and programmers use it as well. I have had good experience with it so far, you might consider giving it a try.\n\nOn another note, if you are looking for friends, our group likes participating in game jams! If you are familiar with the engine Unity and would like to join us, just let me know! Thanks for your reply. \n\nWhat a pity that Unity or gaming development is not on my tech stacks.\n\nBut I will check the UpWork seriously. Actually there are some Upwork-like websites in China. Someone can publish a demand, someone can accept the task. But there are a lot of tiny companies or teams specially concentrating on this sort of money-way, they have all kinds of template projects in order to quickly build a new product to fit the demands. Due to the competition, the price turns very low. Thanks for your encouragement and advice.\n\nBecause of the long terms of depressed life, I have lost confidence, thus I dare not try anything. Repicking the confidence is not easy....... Interesting post! I lived in Hong Kong with Albinism. All of my coworkers told me they wished they could be as fair as me.

Hello.\n\nI am 38 years old man. Since birth I have been diagnosed with a set of the following symptoms:\npoor eyesight (short-sightedness), astigmatism, horizontal nystagmus\n\nI also have photophobia (need sunglasses often, especially when being nervous) and sometimes I am squinting.\n\nI can read books, use cellphones and actually I have been working as a software engineer for last 10 years. But I have to put my face close to the items I read or use a magnifying glass.\n\nI had suspicions that my symptoms might be somehow related and caused by some root condition but I had no idea how and whom to ask about it. There was no Internet when I was growing up and I come from a small Eastern European country where medicine has been out-of-sync with the rest of the world for many years.\n\nOnly recently I discovered the conditions called ocular albinism and optic nerve hypoplasia. \n\nI understand that knowing about the root cause will not help me much, but at least I would like to have some \"label\" to assign to myself, to find people with similar conditions.\n\nI am curious, are there any very specific features of an eye that can be immediately associated with ocular albinism to determine that I for sure have it, or on the contrary - to be sure that I do not have it and my issues have some different root cause?\n\nSo, I am adding links to photos of my eye. I took them at different lighting conditions, but I am not sure if that will be enough:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional info about my general health. \nI think I am not albino. I have been blond most of my life with almost invisible eyebrows. My skin is pale, but still I can get some suntan, although not brown; more like bronze. But during last 15 years my hair has turned from blond to something like hay. I have some hair on my arms and also some beard, and that is also hay-color, darker than my hair. My elder brother also has similar colored hair and body hair, but he has no problems to get brown suntan.\n\nAlso, I have had some physical development problems, I am thin and somewhat underweight, when compared to my physically strong and healthy elder brother. In childhood it was really bad, but at my teenage years I grew taller and now am 173cm and weigh 50kg. Although I have somewhat slowed-down mental processes, that might be because I am an introvert and not because some mental development issues. But still it might be related.\n\nI often feel that my eye nystagmus displays my inner neural sensitivity. I am too sensitive. My hands are often shaking at even slight stress and I have to strain myself to keep them steady, I have very vivid dreams all night long and I have to sleep at least 10 hours to feel good and avoid bags under my eyes. So, it all might be related, but I just do not know how exactly and it would be nice to find out, if possible.\n\nThanks for any ideas. So I have ocular albinism, Recently an eye doctor assistant actually showed me the difference between my eye and others. When you take a picture of the back of a normal person eye you can not see much. There is too much pigment and you barely make out veins. In my eye you can see all the veins and arteries since there is no pigment behind there.  I will also add ocular albinism does not present the same as albinism. I have dark red brown hair and can get the ever so slightest tan. My eye color differs from my whole family in terms of mine are gray while my family has a strong bright blue trend If you can tan than probably not, it is possible you could be less sever like I am I have blonde hair but I still cannot tan", "1st International Albinism Awareness Day - June 13 ", "Albinism and appearance - do you dye your hair/wear makeup? Hi all,\nI recently discovered this subreddit and wanted to know if there are other people here with Albinism who have altered their appearance in the past. \nI have Ocular Albinism and I used to dye my hair dark colours and basically hide the fact I had albinism out of fear of getting bullied. When I was in uni I grew my hair out and let it be natural and did not care if people knew it was natural. I still wear makeup to enhance my features since I think everything blends together when I do not have any colour on my face. The most basic thing I do is use mascara and eyebrow pencil, but of course I like to experiment with eyeliners and contours. \nRegardless of gender, has anyone here ever tried to alter their appearance in any way like this? Why did you do it? How do you feel about it? \nI find it empowering that I am comfortable looking natural the past few ears, I have definitely become way more confident since I stopped dying my hair and I recieve compliments almost every day on it haha \nIf you cannot relate, I hope you at least take away the this: Do not be ashamed of who you are and what others may say or think about you.

I have albinism and I am so confused and never can seem to find anyone to talk to about this. It is been giving me bad anxiety lately because I really want to go to college I have wasted enough time  You would be amazed at the careers people with albinism have. There are doctors, musicians, and computer programmers with albinism.\n\nYou most definitely will not be a surgeon, a pilot, an astronaut, pretty much anything in the military, or anything requiring 20/20 vision. However, careers that have such strict requirements are few and far between. There are many career options out there.\n\nGoing back to your question, it is a tough one to answer. There is no list of careers that people with albinism have had or can have. You are better off figuring out what you love, what *your* dream career is, and then seeking out others with albinism who have that career. I really appreciate your response because I have been having a really hard time and just gives me bad anxiety when it comes to me finding a career   Some resources that can help if you are in the US, your state vocational rehabilitation services can do a career assessment and sometimes help with job training and job seeking things.

(Canada) My eye doctor has told me that I have occular albinism. However, after looking into this, it seems very unlikely since I am a female. Supposedly, based on the genetics, women with occular albinism do not have the typical symptoms of albinism, though I do. I have a vision impairment and nystagmus, though both are quite mild. Additionally, I am significantly paler than my sister and have blonde hair/blue eyes while she is a brunette with green eyes. I also cannot tan. To me this seems more like OCA type 2 but I would love to know more. I have tried looking online but I am not sure what I would have to do to get tested, where to go, how much it would cost, etc. Thank you in advance for any info! Did your eye doctor obsrve transillumination of the iris? In the U.S. it has recently become much easier and more affordable to get a genetic test for albinism. I might suggest asking you eye doctor for a referral to a genetic couselor. Let me know if you have any questions as I have been through the process myself :) Hmmm I am not sure. What exactly is Iris transillumination? He said, though, when he shines a light in my eye, that it kind of reflects back. Not sure if that is what that is? And thank you! I will definitely ask him at my next appointment! Was it easy for you, personally, to get tested? Around how much did it cost if you do not mind me asking?  Testing is sent out to the US. Did it a few years ago when doing family planning stuff because I wanted to know if my significant other was a carrier.  Thank you!!", "While we are discussing potential cures\u2026  I have spoken to the research team behind this study many times. First off, they are extremely hesitant about labeling this as a \u201ccure\u201d for albinism. While the pilot study was small, it was enough to reveal that nitisinone administration likely would not make much of a difference in adults. Instead, the best approach may be to give it to infants and young children, and that is the next step in their research.\n\nI did inquire about taking nitisinone off label, for the pigmentation benefits, but they explained that nitisinone has a variety of side effects. The study participants required dietician consults and had to avoid certain foods (I think it was something like they had to avoid eating excess chicken or something). Additionally, melanin can actually be toxic if it gets into the wrong parts of the cells. The NIH team actually sequenced my DNA in anticipation of enrolling me in this study, but ultimately my type of OCA (OCA 4) was excluded for safety and efficacy reasons.\n\nEDIT: Checked for fun, increased protein intake leads to more side effects. Study participants had to limit protein intake for the *year* that this study went on. Hmm fix my albinism but give up excess amounts of chicken? Guess I am sticking with the sunscreen!

I rarely notice my nystagmus unless I am in a dark room and focusing on something like the light from an alarm clock. How does you nystagmus impact your work? I never notice my nystagmus, and it does not affect my functioning in any way. Obviously it does affect my vision, but not in a way I notice on a daily basis.\n\nAre you sure it is not just photosensitivity? My eyes definitely get tired super easily when staring at a bright white screen for a while. It is such a noticeable difference when I invert the colors so it is white text on a black background. My eyes stop squinting, I stop straining, and I can read for *hours*. Which makes me thankful for the recent dark mode trend. It benefits us more than anyone may think. Almost every device I use has inverted colors. hi, thank's you for your reply, yes it is, i think i was wrong, i have all in dark mode on my working desk but it is not the same for my office that has a really bright light, i think it is for that.. my fault it depends of my office bright lights, i have my PC in dark mode but around it it is so bright that are going to get my eye tired after some hours Wearing a hat indoors makes it a lot better. I know in most cultures it is considered rude. Also if you wear glasses having a thicker frame will block some light. I had a friend with albinism and she had them put blue \u201ctents\u201d over the fluorescent lighting to help with the glare. Not sure what the disability rights are like in Japan (I know the workplace environments are brutal), but there is really not much that can be done beyond turning down the lights, wearing a hat, maybe wear sunglasses indoors?\n\nI always keep my work environment as dark as possible (unless I am in a Zoom meeting). Even having a desk lamp on while I am looking at a computer screen bothers me so much, so I know your pain. yeah, that it is not possible in japan.. i will find a different way, maybe as you suggest i should try a different glasses no..wear hat or sunglasses are not possible here ,maybe i can find some glasses to cut out some lights, i have to check it out I have noticed my nystagmus far less during the pandemic because I have worked from home the whole time and I can control the lighting here. What I have found works best for me is\n-\ta darkened room with some ambient light (in my case, a couple of light bars pointing at the wall behind the screen but lamps would work fine too)\n-\tdark mode on my computer\n-\tdark (but not quite black background) themes in my editors and terminal.\n-\ta programming-specific font set to a large size.\n-\ta large monitor on an arm.\n-\ttake lots of breaks. Even if it is just looking at something further away than screen for a minute every 20 minutes or so. I have had to set a reminder for myself to do this because it is very easy to get in the zone and forget.\n\nI can understand how not all of that will be possible in a shared office.", "some advice? Since I can remember I have been writing down 'albinism' on the 'other medical conditions' blank in school forms. However, I discovered recently that while my mom's *pretty sure* I have it, seeing as they and my sister are all brown-skinned and brown-haired and I have much fairer skin and hair than all of them, my dad's never brought it up and my mom at least is not actually sure which type I have. (...Actually, when I tried to obliquely ask her about it I got the impression she did not even know there were different types.) \n\nAs far as I know, they do not actually have a diagnosis. As far as I know, when I was a baby they got as far as 'yeah, probably albinism, but nothing that comes with serious symptoms' and that was it. (I mean, fair enough, those analyses cost money.)\n\nAnd I *guess* I fit the bill? My skin is pale and my hair and eyes are lighter than anyone would expect, but my sister and I look as similar as any other siblings might. I have needed glasses since I was maybe four, but not older than six. On the other hand, my eyes are grey or greyish-blue, and my hair (at least the hair on my scalp) started out bright gold, is now some sort of mousyish blond, and will probably darken more with age. My vision problems could just as easily be attributed to things I inherited from my parents, both of whom need glasses (though my dad only really needs his to drive). \n\nI want to push, but I myself am not sure why I want answers so badly. I have never been mistreated or ostracized. My appearance has not really impacted my life (that said, I am only sixteen; no guarantees about adulthood yet). I do not really need to know, and I do not want to give my parents the idea that someone is made me feel bad about it, because nobody has, ever. \n\nShould I keep asking? Who else could I ask, besides my parents? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. Does the wibbly eye thing happen to you guys too? People have told me my eyes wobble even if I try to look at something straight on. My eye doctor has not commented on it, though, and it is gotten less severe as I got older. I am aware it could be completely unrelated, but I remember a guy in a documentary demonstrating the wibbly eye thing in a mirror, and I remember it because it was one of the first times I would seen it on someone else, and because the guy also had albinism. The first best option is genetics. Consulting a geneticist and getting DNA tested to definitely identify albinism and even figure out exactly which type. Though DNA tests are quite expensive.\n\nThe second best option is an eye exam. Albinism causes vision problems and there are a multitude of hallmarks: foveal hypoplasia, reduced visual acuity, reduced stereoacuity, iris transillumination, nystagmus, etc. The problem here is finding an eye doctor who actually knows what to look for, which is why I recommend someone who specializes in low vision.\n\nThese two options can be difficult to find depending on where you live. Though even in my small town they knew what albinism was and diagnosed it right away. I did not actually undergo a genetics consult until I was 2, and we had to drive an hour and a half away to find good ophthalmologists for my eye care.\n\nI have met a couple people who always knew something was up but did not really understand what albinism was or get formally diagnosed until like their late 30\u2019s, so you would not be the first. I would say there is absolutely no benefit to getting genetic testing, but if you do suspect albinism I would at least pay a visit to the eye doctor. Not only can they diagnose but, like I said, albinism causes a lot of problems with the eyes. Not a big priority, so potentially I could wait until I saved up enough for a DNA test. I will keep that in mind. \n\nIt would, would not it? I admit I had not thought about that before. It is starting to look like I am going to have to talk to my ophthalmologist if I want to figure it out now. (That will mean letting my mom at least in on it, since they are friends, and I would need my mom's permission and backup if another ophthalmologist needed to be brought in. So much for not pushing.) Any suggestions for how to broach the topic? My eye problems have never given me much grief, beyond some bothersome headaches from too much exposure to brightness, and the mundane frustration of being very nearsighted.\n\nThank you very much for your informative comment! It was very helpful. &gt;Does the wibbly eye thing happen to you guys too? People have told me my eyes wobble even if I try to look at something straight on\n\nYup that is called ( - it is common in people with albinism, but there are a bunch of potential other causes. \n\nI would recommend getting a confirmed diagnosis from an eye doctor or genetic counselor. You may be able to get by without a diagnosis, but knowing whether or not you have albinism could help you contextualize and deal with specific issues both with vision and things like photophobia. It may also be useful to know if you want to have kids. Oh, so that is what the nystagmus I read about is. Whatever's going on with me was mild even when I was in single digits. Makes sense it was never mentioned to me medically.\n\nI have been fine so far, but I am a bit more worried about later. Taking public transportation alone, except for trains, is just about impossible for me, for instance, but I doubt I could drive even with my glasses. And you are also right about the having kids thing. That is another for 'talk to the eye doctor'.\n\nThanks a lot for the comment! It clarified quite a few things I could bring up if I need to convince my parents to help me. Another point since you brought up public transportation. If your vision is bad enough that you cannot drive (even with your regular glasses) you may want to look into doing some Orientation and Mobility training. Usually that is something that you get through your school (via an IEP). You can also look into bioptic lenses which may allow you to drive depending on how good your vision is and that state you live in.", "Albinism and beauty Am I the only person that thinks albino people are absolutely gorgeous? The hair and skin and eyes are sooooo pretty. I am not trying to glamorize it bc I know it sucks having vision problems and having to put on sunscreen every time you go outside, but I think albino people are some of the most gorgeous people on the planet We have heard that sentiment. \n\nMaybe some people with Albinism find this kind of praise uplifting. I know you mean well. \n\nPersonally, I have had several men tell me that my Albinism makes me beautiful. It always makes me uncomfortable. I would rather just be seen as an attractive woman who has super blonde hair, blah blah.\n\nBy the same token, people have told me that despite my Albinism, I am still good looking. I find that just as distasteful. \n\nTelling me that my Albinism makes me beautiful makes me feel fetishized. It is true that Albinism gives people striking looks. We all have our own way of working with that, but most people in general do not enjoy having no choice but to stand out in a crowd. \n\nUltimately, I think that most people with Albinism have heard that it makes us pretty or cool looking, and we have also heard that it makes us look weird, or worse. Personally, I am now pretty sensitive to any comment, good or bad, about how Albinism affects my appearance. \n\nHowever, I can only speak for myself, and go off of what others with the condition have said to me. \ud83c\udf7b I was just trying to give a compliment ://// I heard it quite frequently growing up in southern Europe. Nowadays I work for a rather culturally diverse company, and I get it there sometimes, too, from certain cultures\u2014from the women, especially, while the men have often treated me with an uncomfortable degree of deference, even long before I was part of the senior staff. I understand that. I am not sure what you wanted to hear back, though, hon. Would you rather everyone just say thank you and keep any other thoughts to themselves? That is a rhetorical question for you to consider, not me picking a fight. I was just trying to give a compliment and you go off on about your bad experiences and all this shit. Like I am sorry you went thru that but i did not mean anything bad and your comment just sounds really bitter and bitchy. Do you do that in real life too when someone compliments your hair or eyes? Like just say thank you and move on. No need to be so pissy To be fair you did not really give a compliment, considering that you started off qualifying your statement with \"Am I the only person who thinks they are gorgeous?\", as if to say \"I know it is unpopular to think you are attractive, but I do anyway\".\n\nI personally do not have albinism, but one of my close friends does, and the most important thing I have learned from my friendship with her is that - like all individuals who stand out - she would rather you appreciate her as a human being, rather than focusing on what is unique or \"exotic\". If you want to say someone is pretty, just say they are pretty, not because you want to make them feel \"accepted\". &gt;Am I the only person that thinks albino people are absolutely gorgeous?\n\nWhy would you even ask that? The subtext of this question implies that you think you are making a shocking or controversial statement. It is insulting, in my view.\n\nAgain, I do not think you meant harm. However, I think it would be nice if you stopped to think about how your words affect others rather than snapping back at the person who told you how your words made them feel.\n\nUnfortunately, many people think that Albinism makes people look unattractive. I had a friend in middle school who watched a documentary on Albinism, and decided to tell me that Albinism looks \"really ugly\" in people who had African decent, but I looked nice with it. My whole life, people have commented on how my eyes can glow red under the right lighting. I have been told I look creepy or like a vampire many times. I have had men tell me that it makes me beautiful, too. I really wish people would keep these thoughts to themselves. No one needs to hear that someone thinks a whole group of people are unappealing, and if you are going to give a compliment, why not focus on the person and not their condition. \n\nAnd just in general, try to take responsibility for your actions. Everyone has said something offensive by accident at some point. An not everyone will feel the same way about it.

Vision has to be correctable to like 20/20 or 20/40 or so to join the military. I do not recall the exact number, just that vision problems need to be correctible with glasses or contacts to be eligible.\n\nHard to list alternative careers because \u201cmilitary\u201d is such a broad career path. What exactly did you want to do?", "Nitisinone ? First I have hard of it. I like many others with Ocular albinsim and I am sure every other form of it, long for perfect or at least better vision than we have now.  \nI am 20/200 and yet enjoy things that really should be done with perfect vision.  \nI always imagined that I would be replacing my eyes with robotic ones before a real cure came out but then heard about Nitisinone and how it can increase melanin in patients.   Does anyone know how this has been going ?  All the info I can find on it is just clinical trials from 2014 and old stuff. \nAny other recent treatments or things I might find related that is interesting.  The NIH nitisinone trial ended about a year ago (N = 8), but they are still in the process of writing up the research report. In short, none of the participants had significant gains in visual acuity. They did experience increased eye and skin pigmentation\u2014as expected\u2014which led to decreased photosensitivity. Notwithstanding, there was no significant visual acuity improvement.\n\nAt this time, researchers are trying to decide which treatment strategy to try next. Nitisinone and L-DOPA have not worked, but they could at higher doses, or perhaps there are other treatments. The idea was that because albinism is, at its core, a lack of pigmentation\u2014if you put the pigment back then maybe you can fix things. However, it seems once ocular malformation occurs in the womb, it is permanent. It is widely agreed that gene therapy is the most likely and most promising therapy for albinism in the future, but they are still looking for solutions for children and adults with albinism. For now, glasses are the only effective solution (if they work for that patient). Thanks for the very informative reply.  It is a shame that nothing new seems to be working but for now it seems at least that many tech companies are investing in visual impairment aids such as with smart glasses etc that use digital zoom to help.

Ok so like in my name I am albino and I live in Florida I never go in the sun because I am terrified I will get skin cancer  but today I went with my mom to the flea market and while i spent most of it inside the walk to the park and some parts were outside I did find shade but I am scared that I might of been out in it to long my face is kind of red I cannot really tell maybe it is my mind seeing it I took pics of my face I swear I look slightly pink and I am so scared that I will develop skin cancer now  People with albinism (like myself) can spend a decent amount of time outside in the sun as long as you take proper precautions. Every morning I put on an SPF 50 moisturizer and, if I know I will be spending time outside, I apply a stronger sunscreen and re-apply pretty frequently. A hat, long sleeves etc is also a good idea. There is really no need to be anxious about sun exposure, just protect yourself and know your limits :)  Thank you can I have the name of the moisturizer? I did not have any on yesterday and I was outside for maybe 30 minutes yesterday not all together I just kept going in and outdoors because I have developed such a fear of being in the sun  Hello GamingGurl904. You are correct about having feelings of anxiety. I live farther south in Miami Beach. Trust me... It is scary. I had my first melanoma surgery at age 20, and my second at age 41. You do not want me to describe what I went through. The sun is intense at this latitude. Protect yourself. I am fortunate that I live in a city with a great nightlife. I limit my time in the sun very carefully. Feel free to reach out in private. I do not mind sharing my experiences.  Will one sun burn cause skin cancer ?  Getting sunburns as a kid increases the likelihood of getting melanomas as an adult. It is best to always be careful-  at any age- of sun exposure. Even on cloudy days, a person can get a sunburn. See a Dermatologist every six months. If you have had a melanoma, see a dermatologist more frequently.  The shorter answer is - most likely, no; one sunburn will not cause melanoma. Cumulative exposure to the sun will cause melanoma.  My husband uses my daily Mary Kay SPF moisturizer. He is not a fan of the normal greasy after-feel of regular sunscreen. But he has worked extensively outdoors, and does well. He is also a fan of hats that have the brim all the way around. As a woman, you can find some really cute hats that will provide good sun shade! I think you will be ok, but feel free to meet with a dermatologist if you see any spots appear, or even if you just want to ease your mind. I am an anxious person as well, so I feel ya. Hello Gamergurl\n\nI lived in FL for 11 years during my 30's.  Hardly ever wore sunscreen but did use long sleeves (white) and big hats.  I would cling to the shady areas but with 2 kids running about I spent a fair amount of time in sun.  I felt like protecting my face, shoulders and neck were most important but I forgot backs of my hands....so consequently I have to have a few spots burned off my hands and forearms every couple of years.  \n\nNow I have found a nice daily moisturiser DeVita Solar Body Moisturizer 30spf.  Still I wear the long sleeves and hat but as I am getting older I still protect, even tho' I live in PNW now.  \n\nI am more cautious of too bright sunshine and reflections....migraines suck.  \n\nOne sunburn is unlikely to cause cancer....good luck ", "Driving? Hey, it looks like I am going to be able to drive so I was hoping to hear about other people\u2019s experiences.  If you are able to drive, could you tell me a little about how you learned, what aids you use, and any other tips you have being a driver with albinism?  Stories, tips, and anything else would be greatly appreciated! Congratulations. This group tends to be quiet but check out the Facebook groups. Adults with albinism or Albinism Community I have specific times where I feel comfortable driving, primarily before and after dark- and also not during those times where the sun sits right in your face. Around 5:30-7pm in my region So I barely passed the vision test to be able to drive in daylight hours only. To be honest having bad vision has never really affected me when driving, especially when I am driving in a place that I am familiar with. The one issue that I do have is driving towards the sun during sunrise/sunset. I have a pair of prescription sunglasses but it only helps so much. I have had my license for 6 years and have kept a clean driving record. My only word of advice on the eye test is that if they try to test your eyes with a machine and you cannot see the letter well enough, ask them to do the test on an old fashioned chart. It helped a lot for me, but I am pretty sure it is because I am monocular.", "Any other albinos out there? ", "Ocular albinism and LASIK I have ocular albinism and was wondering if it would be a good idea or even possible to get LASIK since I have nystagmus and my vision is not fully correctable with glasses. Does anyone know if it would correct my vision more so than glasses would? Waiting for someone to answer this because my 14 year old brother also has nystagmus and I was wondering if LASIK could correct his vision. It would depend on the type of nystagmus, and the severity. I am looking forward to a bionic contact lens with augmented reality, also. Also, get your astigmatism corrected as young as possible to help your optic nerves develop/get stronger. So I have looked into this as someone with Ocular Albinism and a Nystagmus. No matter what doctor I went to they all told me it would never be safe enough with current technology. Mostly the problem is the nystagmus. I do not want to risk losing the vision I already have. Glasses may suck but I can be a solid 20/50 when everything is going my way and lasik would probably never get me past that anyway Thanks so much!", "New Vision Assistive Technology App Hi All! My name is Rebecca and I have low vision and albinism. I am a graduate student in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins and am also working on developing assistive technologies for people like us! The latest is a smartphone app called the ReBokeh app and it is currently in beta testing. It is meant to be a more portable, less expensive, and more customizable type of assistive technology that lets you make adjustments to the environment you are seeing through your smartphone camera (kind of like a photo editing app for real life!). This technology has been designed specifically to aid in the independence of people with good functional vision.\n\nI am looking for people to test it out and let me know what they think!

This seems like a very intuitive solution to the \"ridiculously expensive and oversized visual aids\" problem. My only concern is: how will this app work for cellphones with subpar/outdated camera systems? This seems like an ideal solution for people with newer phones, but considering most users are on older Android models, is not the software limited by bad camera hardware? \n\nThanks! Hey! This is some great design thinking, I can already tell you are going to be a fantastic engineer! You are definitely correct that no matter how good the software is, it will always be limited by the hardware.

Hi fellas,\n\nI have always been the whitest coloured person in my Family, although my family is without a doubt very white already (Northern European :)). But I have always stood out. In the beginning of my childhood, my sister was also very white, but still not as white as me and she later began to have a bit more blonde hair and generally her skin just turned a 'normal' colour. For me this did not happen, I have white eyelashes, white eyebrows, very white hair, very pale skin and generally, when I look at pictures of people with albinism, especially people with a Caucasian look, they look very much like me. I even knew someone with albinism and my hair and skin was even more pale than hers. I also have photo phobia, but not like sight problems, and I do not get darker skin after laying in the sun and get sunburns very easily. \n\nMy family has always always said that I did not have albinism and that I was just 'born this way', but could it be that I have albinism but that it went undiagnosed at birth, because my sister was also looked pale back then and I did not have eye problems. Or am I just in some way 'born this way'? If you really want to put it to rest, I would recommend finding an eye doctor who specializes in albinism. It is possible that some of the eye problems are there, but very minor. \n\nThat being said, I have come across people who are just super pale but do not have albinism, so it is truly possible that you fall into this category. Not that I am well studied in this area, but I have yet to meet a person with albinism who does not have some degree of the eye problems associated with the condition, such as nystagmus or strabismus. Based on this anecdotal evidence, I would guess it is highly unlikely. But who knows! Good luck finding out! I have met a PWA who was not diagnosed until she was in her 40\u2019s, it does happen, particularly in people of European descent who may not look markedly different than the rest of their family. My adopted daughter who has albinism could have very easily gone undetected I suspect. Her birth family had no idea (and still do not entirely believe it I think), she also has relatively good eyesight (6/18 corrected) and is very intelligent so finds her own coping mechanisms easily; most people do not realise she is vision impaired until they are told (and sometimes not even then). I was not diagnosed until I was 47.  I have fairly pigmented irises, resulting in mild photo phobia, and a some fundus pigmentation where the foveal pit would normally be.  As such, I have close to 20/20 vision and no nystagmus.  It was not until I had a retinal scan that I was told that I did not have a foveal pit, which (after searching Google) made me suspect possible albinism for the first time.  A subsequent VEP test confirmed.  Like you, I do not tan and sunburn quickly.  I agree with advice already posted here, to get a retinal scan to see if you have a foveal pit, or not.  (That is one of 2 conditions that all albinism types share, as well as misrouted optical pathways, as determined by a VEP test.) If you have 0 trouble with vision, I HIGHLY  doubt you are albino. My audiologist is doing testing for Waardenburg Syndrome, which is related to Albinism. I am 44 years old and things are starting to make all kinds of sense. My hair turning 100% grayish white in high school. I have been coloring it al this time. My skin is absurdly pale, no matter my iron levels. \nMy eyes are pale blue.\n\nInstead of significant vision issues, I have significant hearing loss in one ear. The hearing loss was blamed on loud music ten years ago by a different audiologist. My new one, who is investigating vestibular issues, is having my ENT order an MRI for retrocochlear damage.\n\nI do not have a firm diagnosis, but things related to this are adding up for the first time in my life. As with many things in life, it can manifest itself on somewhat of a spectrum. For example, I have low vision and pale skin etc but I certainly have a bit more of a \"blonde\" than \"white\" hair colour, which I can say on some fairly good ground given I have attended a few events with others exhibiting the latter.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the majority of issues surrounding it are to do with vision, if you have had no lifelong visual impairment but are suspicious of the paleness of your skin it might be that you are on the very upper end of the \"spectrum\" as to how much it is imapcted you, if it is there at all.\n\nBest bet is to see an opthalmologist or perhaps a DNA sampling thing like 23andme (although I have no idea if they tell you about albinism!)", "Going to demo these special glasses next month.
