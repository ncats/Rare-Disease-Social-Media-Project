["Anyone have experience with CROS hearing aids? I know this is not strictly a coronavirus question but I wondered if anyone else had experience using a CROS hearing set? I have been offered them by a government agency because the person I saw says they are better quality and suited for someone with hearing on only one side. Anyone received them, perhaps due to hearing loss from cholesteatoma? I have been using cross aids since 2015 due to loosing all of my hearing in one ear from my cholesteatoma. I definitely think they work fairly well, I chose to have volume control versus choosing the room type you are in, and I have found it very useful, although if you turn down the volume too much its not as effective which is to be expected.\n\nI just recently had another surgery to remove a regrowth and my surgeon suggested looking into the cochlear osia system that just came out. Its the newest BAHA implant that actually works for single sided deafness, and I am going to be switching to it later this year. \n\nOne thing I have not liked about the cross aids system is the need to use two hearing aids, they are slightly uncomfortable for me to wear, but my ears are very small. I have talked to other people who have not had the same issues with them as I have.\n\nI hope this helps you out. Thanks for the reply. I hardly wear my current hearing aids as I do not go out much and only put them on when I have an important appointment. I have no trouble with it and I have big ears.", "First surgery recovery - will I be ok to have family over the next day for dinner (not cooking)? Ok to return to teaching the following week?  Hey there, each surgery is different but I have had two surgeries and was bed bound for a week each time. Second surgery was a lot more extensive but even for my first I had two weeks off work. Make sure you rest and recover fully it is a bit op Hi! I have got my surgery on thursday and have be told you will need someone looking after you for the first 24hours then you need two weeks off.\n\nI hope this helps Not sure what others are talking about, I was told 4-5 day recovery before you can go back to an office job setting. I have not  be as my surgery but that is what I am expecting. \n\nMy surgery is on a Friday so I will hopefully be back to work on Thursday, if not in office then WFH. It depends on how invasive your surgery is. I had endoscopic ear surgery and I honestly felt good to go as soon as I woke up and was back at work in a week. I work remote and most of my work is done on a laptop, the only real challenge was the loss of hearing and having to navigate that a bit. I did have pain in my ear for that first week but nothing some over the counter meds cannot help!\n\nI think you are good to have guests over, def take it easy though and give yourself a week before going back to work.", "How much does surgery to remove the growth cost in the uk?  Should not it be free with the NHS?", "Question for ones who have had the surgery... Is it unusual that my surgeon is not requesting blood work prior to my surgery?  I am scheduled for Oct 14th.  I called yesterday and asked what I needed to do to prepare, their reply, \"Just be here at 6am. No blood work needed, no food after 10pm night before.\". Paperwork I got during my appointment also mentioned no aspirin or Motrin 2 weeks prior.  The surgeon is supposed to be one of the best here in the Seattle area.  Just wondering if anyone else went through the same thing. Quite odd that your doctor did not ordered blood workouts... Most surgery under general anesthesia will order simple tests like checking your blood electrolytes, kidney status... I didnt have blood work either. Had two surgeries, no blood work on either of them. Same here - no blood tests done.  In fact, the only tests I had done was a CT scan and a hearing test.  From this, the surgeon scheduled me in for the procedure (I think there were 3 done at the same time) which was a mastoidectomy/meatoplasty/myringoplasty.  Also had to fast, and they also measured my height and weight on the day of the surgery which I think is standard for any procedure involving anesthesia.  Had the same requirements of fasting for 24 hours, but was told no aspirin for 3 weeks prior (and 3 weeks post surgery).  It was all surprisingly easy with the only discomfort being how tight the head bandage was when I woke up!  Now just waiting for the second stage surgery where hopefully they can restore my hearing. No bloodwork for any of 4 canal wall down or for the canal wall up. Also in the US. Thanks. Good to know. Were you completely deaf after the surgery? Hey! I do not know if you had your surgery yet but hope it went well. I had this surgery in May 2019, and I am also a nurse :). \n\nWhen yo do not have any known health complications. They do not do any blood work up.   If complications occur with blood loss. They give blood type O, which is a universal donor/recipient.\n\nHope this answered your question. It does! I am having the surgery Monday 14th, so I will post updates. Thanks \ud83d\ude0a Wishing you the best !", "Surgery yesterday Went in mentally prepared for my surgeon to cut in behind my ear and cut out part of my skull. Woke up after surgery and was lucky they were able to go the less invasive route through the ear drum itself. \n\nSurgery was about 3-4 hours.

Standing up is mostly ok, when I sit down it happens way to fast though. \n\nWas not prepared for the whole being intubated thing.

I am really not sure where it is on this one I went down a rabbit hole this morning looking them up on the Internet. I believe it is the white dot. I will look at the video and the other images to see because I have been looking too and I have no idea haha you might be right though. Either way, this sucks and I am not looking forward to having multiple surgeries for two ears that have done nothing but riddle me with infections\ud83d\ude12 I am on the second one for my right ear... it gets so much better after you get those suckers out. The second surgery for me was in and out and better by day two. I think you mentioned it gets easier in the conversation we had, I messaged you in September when I was more apprehensive about all this. You really helped me to be more optimistic about it. That is right!! \ud83e\udd23 I am the worst! Omg you are totally not hahaha it was months ago, I do not blame you lol", "Symptoms prior to diagnosis? What kind of things did you notice before getting diagnosed? And how long was it before you had surgery? I am terrified and the stories here (while super informative) have not made me feel a whole lot better. I worry how far gone I am and I am having a hard time being patient for the ct scan.\n\nI am a 29yr old Male, and I have had a history of anxiety and ocd, as well as ear problems throughout childhood. In high school 12 years ago I had an ear drum burst while swimming. I never had anything done about and just assumed everything healed alright.  Fast forward to 2017 I started noticing a occasional noise in my ear like popping and a slight bit of vertigo when laying flat on my back. Whenever my allergies acted up I would have a good bit of pressure. I just kind of got used to it, I did not have insurance at the time so I didnt do anything until this year. About 2 weeks ago I had a weird ear infection experience. I had a lot more fullness and drainage than normal. Very sharp pains occasionally and muffled hearing. The GP told me I had a hole in my eardrum and she referred me to an ENT.\n\nSo today at the ent, I assumed I may have menieres, but after the audio test and looking in my ear he believes it to be a cholesteatoma. Most of the stories I have read talk more about negative pressure as the cause. But considering I have such a huge hole in my eardrum is that still possible? I am so scared it is going to be way to far along. Although I realize I have a tendency to overreact sometimes. My pure tone hearing test was scored moderate hearing loss but I was told the conductive test was better and that means it had not effected my nerves yet. How good of a sign is that? Thanks for taking the time to read this and sorry for all the questions I am just terrified. Hi!  Firstly, welcome to the discussion!  Secondly, please relax, as there is nothing to fear with the condition.  Yes, you will need to take the required action to address it, but it is a very straight forward procedure.  So let us start.\n\nYour hearing test is positive - if your nerve is not affected, then yes, that is a good sign.  This means there is a great chance of restoring your hearing to an excellent level.  The CT scan should give some visual indication of the size of the mass, however the only way to properly assess and remove it is via surgery.  So rule #1 ... do not panic.  If you need surgery (and it sounds like you do, as have most of the people here), it may seem like a huge deal, but its really straight forward.\n\nSo as a recap of your first stage ... you have had a hearing test done, and a CT scan too.  Your ENT will provide you a diagnosis from these tests, and guidance on what you need to do to address it (i.e. if it is cholesteatoma, then surgery is required to remove it).\n\nOnce you have this diagnosis, then you should find a surgeon you are happy with to perform the surgery.  If your ENT can do it, and you are happy with them, then book it in as soon as you can to get on the road to recovery.  If you would like to \"shop around\" for another medical professional to assist you and/or give you a second opinion, then do that.  But please, do whatever you can to get to a positive mindset about this. Remain positive and optimistic along your journey - it really will help :-)  Keep us updated too.\n\n\u201cNever put off till tomorrow what may be done day after tomorrow just as well.\u201d \u2015 Mark Twain Thanks for you response. It was nice to wake up too. When I was diagnosed I was 19, this was about a year ago. Before I was diagnosed I had noticed muffled hearing in my affected ear, and closer to the diagnosis it began to hurt a lot. I thought I may have an ear infection so I went and got antibiotics, those didnt work so i tried two or three different kinds of AB. I then was able to see my ENT but it was too swollen inside my ear for them to get a proper look. So they put me on ear drops for awhile and i came back, which is when they diagnosed me. I had surgery about two or three months later and the cholesteatoma was the about size of a kidney bean. I think I had this for years prior to it even hurting. Looking back, certain things went on that I should have noticed. My left ear would hurt if I wore headphones for a long period of time. Sharp pain too, not just a dull ache. I also always had equilibrium issues along with other things.    \n\nYou arent too late and this is going to go smoothly, just keep a positive mindset and you will be golden. \nEven after I had the cholesteatoma removed,  my hearing is still pretty good. It is not what it used to be, I have about a 35% reduction I would say, but not too bad considering. You may experience some hearing loss post surgery but getting the cholesteatoma removed makes a huge difference and you will feel so much better. I hope this alleviates some of your anxiety, know that you will be fine and this will all go smoothly. Thank you so much. That did help.\ud83d\udc9a I have had 3 of these. Severe degradation in hearing, hearing your pulse way more often than you should and a pretty intense pressure are things you should be looking out for. Well that is alarming. My hearing seems to be ok right now but somedays when I am rushing around at work I hear/feel my pulse in my ear for a few minutes at a time. And I have pressure/headaches everyday, I would not say it was intense though. I get my CT scan tomorrow though so I will find out something.", "Taste buds I know sense of taste can and is often affected by the surgery but does anyone else find it is not consistent?\n\nI have some days where things mostly taste OK and I think things are back to normal.  Then there is today where everything I have tried so far tastes wonky.\n\nAnyone else go through this? Yes. I used to love PINOT Noir - now it tastes like burned rubber sometimes. Yeah, the other day basically everything I ate tasted bitter and off.  Then the next day things were mostly normal again.\n\nI have hear of the surgery messing up sense of taste but not on an intermittent basis like that. My nerve was cut so my taste is gonep, but numbness comes and goes: sometimes use like I am licking a salt block /", "Post op bouts of dizzyness I had my operation last Friday and still get bouts of dizzyness and the occasional headache. Is this normal? I have a dissolvable packing in my ear and am spraying it three times  day as per instructions.\n\nI am not getting that much discharge. Yeah, unfortunately it happens to me off and on. Hang in there friend! I felt dizzy for about 1-2 months after surgery and still get headaches here and there. Hope you feel better soon !", "Do you have any tips on what type of food to eat for the weeks following surgery? I know that chewing directly affects the ears... I know it is going to be painful... What kinds of food did you eat or prepare after surgery? Just curious as I am about to have my procedure this Tuesday and this is the last detail that I have not figured out. I was able to chew pretty comfortably by just chewing with the right side of my face (had surgery on the left), and I ate anything for which I did not need to open my jaw too wide. For me opening my jaw was more painful than chewing. Right now I am two weeks post op, the pain when chewing went away after about a week, and the jaw pain is mostly gone, I barely feel it.\n\nIf you are worried about it I would just recommend something you do not have to chew at all for the first day(s) like some yoghurt or anything similar. I had surgery a week ago. Chewing is not too bad if you chew on the other side. Your jaw might be stiff. Buy a pack of chewing gum to get your jaw moving post surgery. I started chewing gum while I was still at the hospital, I felt it helped! My ear hurt pretty bad when I tried to eat. I stuck with soup and applesauce the first week. Hang in there! Thank you! Soup is a great idea! Great advice! Thank you Thank you for this timeline on your chewing experience :)  Currently 5 hours post op, can confirm that chewing is bit weird but totally manageable !", "Just had surgery a week ago Just had surgery a week ago, dressing/cup on head was removed two days after and overall I feel good.  \n\nOne concern is the super muffled hearing/pulsating sound in the ear I got operated on.  The doctor said they were able to remove all the cholesteatoma and save the hearing bones but I am barely able to hear on that side.\n\nIs that normal?  Also not getting any crackling sounds or anything just muffled hearing and a pulsating sound from that ear.. Do you still have the gauze packed in your ear? The easiest way to describe it is that it is basically tampon looking thing packed in the ear that was operated on. My surgery was 4 years ago but if I remember right I had a follow up a week or two after surgery and the removed the gauze from inside my ear and it cleared that up.", "Surgery check up. Info in comments  So my mom posted this pick to Facebook and I took a screen shot of it because it is the best one right after my surgery. I loved the doctors I had they even let me take in my stuff dog and gave it a pink bow like me. Actually it is the day of the surgery but u keep forgetting cause I had taken a nap when I got home. Overall it went great a two hour long surgery they redid the eardrum and prothesis (sp)? \n\nStill a bit dizzy if you feel like you are going to be sick before the surgery or not you usually get sick after you can request a patch for behind the ear and a mixture to be added to your iv to help counter act the sick feeling.\n\nIt does not hurt a lot but right after the surgery I was really emotional hence the somewhat odd expression as I was crying a bit not from pain just emotion I kept saying I love you to my parents and thank you to everyone who passed by my bed while I was recovering and also crying\n\nOther than the emotion it all went great if anyone has any questions please ask and I will try my best to answer I love you too!\n\n\n\n\n\n^I ^am ^a ^bot ^trying ^to ^spread ^a ^little ^peace, ^love, ^and ^unity ^around ^Reddit. ^Please ^send ^me ^a ^message ^if ^you ^have ^any ^feedback. Aw good bot Get well soon.  My first surgery wasnt easy either. Take good care of the surgery area, just stay in bed and watch Netflix. Aw thanks are you going to be having a follow-up surgery? Oh my first surgery was 5 years ago. Yeah I had follow up appointments and all that. Keep water out of your ear even when you are healed. Block your ear with a small cotton ball when you shower etc. Careful when you go swimming.  I have had 3 surgeries so far. I have cholesteatoma in both ears. I am having another surgery in a month. I hope your surgery will go well and you will have a quick recovery. I am just wandering how soon were you able to get the back of the ear wet. I know for me my past few surgeries I had wait for about a month before getting the go ahead sign from doctors that I could get the back of the ear wet. Thanks. Appreciate it. I do not remember exactly but I think it was at least 3 weeks. I either had someone washing my hair or I did it in the sink. Ya that what happened to me I was so excited Everytime when I was able to take a shower", "wet ear canal today, paranoid I am 33, had cholesteatoma when I was 5, 2 stage surgery sorta deal. Lost a good amount of hearing but kept more than most it seems. \n\nToday my ear had a wet feeling inside when I woke up. Not thick discharge, just felt a bit oily and even the outside of the ear felt very moist. I have had this happen before, and my right ear now that I think about it just always has had more moist earwax in general. I only noticed this when I woke up. Kind Of reminded me when I rub my ear (the outside) sometimes I will not notice it but then it will get sorta wet, i guess a reaction from me scratching it. Kind Of feels the same as well when I hear earbuds, the ear canal gets \"wet\"\n\nAnyone else get this? Maybe I am just overthinking it. I was laying on the ear as well, about a 4 hour nap. my bad ear occasionally itches like crazy and I rub and scratch it. A thin film of liquid covers the outer ear and makes it red and scaly. I am unsure if my rubbing causes the liquid or vice versa. yeah but its in my canal as well, its night time and still a \"bit\" wet. Cannot explain it, maybe because i am thinking about it, but yeah feels way more \"moist\" in there than my left ear. But yeah rubbing the outside of the ear, same thing, thin liquid, it gets sore pretty quick as well, then you scratch more and more liquid. I get it at least somewhat in the canal as well (assuming that is what is going on). \n\nI notice this after wearing headphones as well too. Maybe it will just take a day or two for the earwax in there to dry out. I just started getting paranoid sorta thinking like, oh shit its come back after almost 30 years. I think its fair to say my right ear always has more \"moist\" ness to it than my left. Not sure if its due to issues as a child or what, maybe its just how it is. I have doubted the liquid is related to my cholesteatoma as it is not in the middle ear or ear canal. Wax seems to grow very quickly though, in both ears. It is only a few months before my hearing becomes blocked by wax. Just curious when did you have your surgery? I have yet to have my surgery. My Ctoma is an extremely rare type and must be done in another state. Interstate travel is banned and the doctor shopping my case has been unable to meet with specialists to come up with a plan of action. oh wow , man best of luck, i had mine at 5 and it never bothered me again except for causing paranoia when something happens or i get a bunch of wax etc. \n\nOnce done hopefully its over for good for you I sort of wish I would had the surgery at 5. My understanding is I have always had the ctoma. It was not until 2019 that someone actually noticed it in a ct scan. I see damn , yeah i had it done at 5, and another surgery the next year to give me my hearing more in that ear, then another surgery to check for it again the following year. Since about the age of 7 has never gave me an issue. I hope yours goes well. This is my life now post-cholesteatoma surgery. My surgery was 12 years ago, but this wet ear canal got worse and worse over the years. It was about 2 times a year that I had to go for cleaning, then 3, then 4, and now is like it does not make sense going for the cleaning checkup. The debris and wet feeling is beyond what I can handle. Similarly, in the morning, after wearing headphones, or after a nap etc. My ear is wet every morning, during the day I can feel the discharge of this itchy and nasty thing I have to clean superficially with q-tips because otherwise it will just accumulate. It is disrupting my normal day life, I wish there was a solution to this, it is frustrating. I am considering talking to another specialist, the one I go always prescribes the same drops and keeps telling me going there a few times a year for cleaning as that is part of the post-surgery living, but it comes back after a few weeks after the cleaning. I can say mine only happens maybe once every few months, no often, it does suck though for sure.", "Sleeping Positions Post Surgery Hello again all, \n\nI removed my last post because I felt it was questions better left for my PA, but I feel this is not. \n\nAfter I had my surgery, and even before, i started to have difficulty sleeping. I sleep on my left side which also happens to be the ear that had the Cholesteatoma in it. I dont like lying on that side now because of the pressure caused by lying on it. I was just wondering if there were any ways that you guys slept differently post surgery. Or ways that you slept to navigate not sleeping directly on your ear. I have tried sleeping on my back but it is not quite as comfortable. I maybe just have to get used to sleeping on my right side. Right after my surgeries I always slept in a recliner chair with a whole lot of pillows and such other than after the bandage was off I had to sleep on my other side which I eventually got used to (I have had to switch sides several times because I have had surgeries on both sides) other than I can only suggest sleep on your stomach though not really recommended.", "Post surgery experience? Just recently got diagnosed for my left ear. According to my ENT we are onto it really early so he is actually giving me a few months before needing the surgery. The thing I am most concerned about is the prospect of hearing loss. Just wanted to ask people\u2019s experience on the topic, obviously everyone is different but just wanted to hear people\u2019s stories. Also due to being early I have not actually lost any hearing, all I have is a faint ringing right now. Lastly just wanted to ask how long it took for you guys to recover and whether you need a hearing aid or not. My cholesteatoma is on my right side and completely ate the nerve and ossicles. Unbeknownst to me the cholesteatoma was responsible for hearing loss in my ear my whole life so when I went completely deaf on that side I made no mention of it. It was only discovered when I sought treatment for loss of equilibrium. I was diagnosed nearly two years ago but have not managed to have any treatment yet, although I was given a new set of hearing aides to counter being deaf on one side. I had a prosthetic put in to replace the bones I lost. I had some hearing loss and it is a little worse now but I can still hear most things normally e.g. can take phone calls and listen to music through the affected ear. \n\n I had my surgery Feb 26th this year and saw my surgeon at the start of August and he says it is 99% healed. He is really pleased with the results and how quickly I got my hearing back. I was also back to working in an office exactly a week after my surgery (do not recommend). If you are young you will recover quickly. I would take two weeks off post op as I found that getting back to work so quickly made me really tired in week 2 of recovery. \n\nI was really scared and nervous for how I would recover but honestly I managed on paracetamol, lots of movies and a good angled pillow. I did not feel like I was struggling to do anything strenuous, I was just really tired. \n\nI do not need hearing aids but in future if I ever did, apparently I would be a perfect candidate. I also have an early stage left ear cholesteatoma!! So, twinsies yea? Party!! I have not actually gotten my surgery yet either, but I will tell you what my ENT told me; This is such a commonplace operation, these drs have been saving ppls ears for decades!! Trust in the surgeon, and trust in your self! \nPre-surgery anxiety is killer hell and I feel it too, but we have to look forward to the months and years ahead of us that *do not* involve words like tympanomastoidectomy/cholesteatoma/etcetcectomy. My heart goes out to you!! Good luck to us both &lt; 3 Prior to my surgery, my hearing was good in both ears. After my surgery, I lost hearing in that ear. My surgeon said it is a very rare occurrence for that to happen. I had surgery two weeks ago, my Cholesteatoma was around 4cm in size. It has eroded two of my bones so I have a prosthesis put in. My hearing is around the same as before the surgery, but my surgeon said my hearing will improve to further as the inflammation settles. \n\nThe surgery I had was a combined approach typamomastoidectomy. \n\nI am sure you will be fine, I was nervous fo about 6 months before the surgery, and the waiting was far worse than the event itself. I had a cholesteatoma in my left ear that had damaged the incus bone. I had hearing loss in that ear most of my life but from about September 2020 until my surgery in March 2021 I quickly lost almost all my hearing in that ear. If I plugged my other ear, it sounded as if I was underwater. There was soft noise but absolutely nothing comprehensible. \nI had a tympanomastoidectomy and during the same surgery I had an implant placed to replace the incus, as well as part of the cartilage removed from my tragus to rebuild my eardrum. The implant is not titanium, it is some other material that more closely mimics real bone. My hearing improved over the course of 2-3 months after the surgery. The way I describe it now is that I can hear perfectly fine out of my left ear, but it is as if I am listening to a low quality speaker. I can hear and comprehend everything, but sound just is not quite as rich as it is in my other ear. \nOther than that, my ear feels mostly normal. It still feels a little more \u201cdamp\u201d than my other ear but I have no pain or discomfort. For the mastoidectomy portion of the surgery, part of my mastoid was obviously obliterated. I have seen some surgeons replace the mastoid shavings in the area they obliterated but mine did not. So as a result I have about a penny sized spot directly behind my ear that does not have any bone. It is a soft spot in my skull sort of like soft spots on a baby\u2019s head. When I sleep on that side for the whole night I can be a little sore in the morning. \nI can answer any other questions you have! I did lots of research about cholesteatomas before my surgery! You caught it early and that is key towards preventing hearing loss and reducing the intensity of the surgery. Hey I have a question, is it possible to swim after some period of time from the surgery? I am still curious if I could swim again in my life. Thank you Fuck, I am so sorry. Could you benefit from a hearing aid or is it completely gone?", "Worth keeping on trying to get help? Hello all, I am hoping to see if anyone can relate at all as I am tapped out with going to doctors and getting no where. \n\nOn my left side I have some hearing issues, I am not sure what you would call them but certain sounds will cause my hearing on that side to become really distorted and almost painful. That problem has been ongoing for quite some time, years I would say. \n\nI also have chronically itchy and inflamed ear canals that I try not to scratch, but I end up doing it in my sleep. My ears produce a LOT of excess skin as a result. \n\nAbout six, seven months ago I started having a smelly clear discharge coming from that ear and I noticed that my mastoid bone on that side was painful to touch and larger (by a lot) than the other side. As a poker and picker I was surprised I would never noticed it before. The pain and discharge went away after a few days. \n\nSince then I have had ongoing issues with pain in my skull that radiates down my neck and into my collarbone and weirdly, a sensation of having something stuck in my throat very high up on the left hand side. \n\nI have seen an ENT and he did look at my throat via a scope in the nose but did not look into my ear or touch my mastoid bone. My primary doctor dismisses me as having anxiety, after I have repeatedly stated I do not feel as though I am anxious. No one has taken my concern with my mastoid bone hurting/my hearing issue or the pain in my head and neck seriously or offered any sort of explanation or reassurance. \n\nWhen I have searched a lot of things seem to ding up for cholesteatoma side effects. I am really not shopping for a serious diagnosis at all I just want to know what is wrong with me. \n\nDo any of my symptoms sound similar to things people who have actually been diagnosed experience? Hello, my advice would be to continue to push for a referral or if possible, directly book with a specialist. In my personal experience I was misdiagnosed with just a minor ear infection when I saw my GP. I had to push to be able to see a specialist and within 5 minutes I was diagnosed on site with a visible cholesteatoma. Had I not pushed I could of potentially died as cholesteatomas have often eat into the bone sperating your brain cavity and the mastoid cavity. Whether you have the disease or not is not up for me to say but, your symptoms are concerning and are similar to the ones I experienced when I dealt with this disease. Best case scenario you do not have it and you have a minor infection, worst case scenario you leave it and have further complications down the line from delaying a needed operation. If you have any questions feel free to PM me. Good luck. Thank you, I will go back. Booking privately is not an option for me as I am in the UK and currently cannot afford a private doctor. But I will try my NHS GP again. My GP has looked in my ears but as I understand it with that kind of scope they would not see past the drum if it was intact? Glad to hear that you will try again. My tumour was only visible as it had protruded past my ear drum which is not the case with many other cholesteatomas. They will often send you in for a CT scan to check for the tumour. I have not had all those symptoms, but did have a cholesteatoma. Plus, usual disclaimer I am not a doctor, and you should always seek specialist advice ... and this comment is just from some unqualified random person on the internet, so please treat it as such.\n\nPlease do not let your symptoms to cause you stress - just be methodical and logical about how you approach it, and the advice to always seek a second opinion is recommended. When you discuss with your doctor, start with your symptoms, let your doctor know they are causing you grief, and request further testing to check for their source. If they say \"its just your anxiety\", then let them know that testing would help alleviate any anxiety you may have.\n\nThe itchy ear and excess skin could be ( which is usually treated through ear drops. As for the painful mastoid area, swelling and ear discharge, they sound like symptoms of ( (bacterial infection in the mastoid cells in the bone) for which you would need other tests done such as a CT/MRI or blood tests, and treatment is usually antibiotics.  Its also possible you did have these conditions, and your body has already fought off (or is in the process of clearing) the infection.\n\nAs for the possibility of a cholesteatoma, getting imaging scans like a CT/MRI is usually required to confirm that diagnosis.  Keep us updated with how you go.", "How likely is it that I will be able to ride rollercoasters at the 5 week point? Of course I am going to ask my doctor and make sure everything is okay before I go, I just want to have hope.

I will be skipping Hulk and anything with over the shoulder restraints that can cause head banging.", "What is a Cholesteatoma?  This appears to regard an acquired cholesteatoma. In a congenital case like mine the cholesteatoma forms in the bone. I had a canal wall down surgery almost 15 years ago. After surgery I have had to go to my ENT for regular cleaning, at least every 3 months. With time it became unbearable and a chore and it affects many aspects of my life since my ear is wet now every single day multiple times a day that I have to dry out. It has a fool odour. What can be done? My ENT is not suggesting anything other than continuing visiting him with regular cleanings. This does not help much as my ear stays dry just for a day or two. Try scheduling a visit to a chinese medicine doctor, they should be able to help you reduce the problem.\n\nAlso, were you checked for reccurence?", "My situation Hello everyone. \n\nIn February 2020 I started to feel clogged ear. I had ringing in my right ear also (it was little). After going to an audiologist, she sent me to an ENT doctor and it turns out my turbinates were too swollen. The doctor did not look at my ears even though that was the main reason for the problem. He did surgery on my nose so that I could breathe easily. He then recommended using Eustachi to open my eustachian tubes and put the ventilation tube in my right eardrum.\n\nA few weeks later, at the checkup, he noticed that a small cholesteatoma was starting to form. He cleaned me out and gave me drops to treat it. We thought it had stopped. \n\nThis year (Feb21) I came to Korea to study (I am from Honduras) and the doctor recommended that I visit a specialist to see the tube situation. The tube came out of my eardrum and the doctor removed it (Ap 21). \n\nBut guess what? The cholesteatoma has grown back. The new doctor told me that I will probably need surgery although he did not tell me when. I am on ear drops and was sent to take pills today.\n\nThe hearing level in my right ear is low and the ringing is very loud. After the doctor cleans, it is worse.\n\nAh, and I believe the eardrum is slowly closing...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have some questions I would like to ask for those of you who have suffered this situation:\n\n\\- Does the hearing improve after surgery?\n\n\\- How much should I prepare approximately for the surgery? I am hoping and assuming that student insurance will be able to help me cover some costs.\n\n\\- I do not want to miss classes so I would wait until the end of July to have the surgery (when the doctor tells me the definitive yes), although if he tells me sooner I think I would do it, since this problem was detected since August 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is difficult to be away from my family at this time. Thank you for reading and for your help. Hey, sorry to hear that.\n\nTo answer your questions,\nMy hearing did improve, but I now have a titanium implant inside my ear.\nI am not sure of the cost, but i believe Korea has universal healthcare. Try to find resources for you being a student.\nYou should go to the doctors office again and ask for a CT scan or MRI to see the extent of the damage.\n\nWishing you the best. Did the titanium implants restore hearing ok? I had a plastic implant but the quality was never as good as I hoped. It was removed in a follow up surgery. Ohh the tube you got is for Eustachian tube dysfunction. It is not to improve hearing. The titanium implant did improve my hearing, although I have some hearing loss, but better than before. This had to happen because the cholesteatoma ate up/Damaged my hearing bone. That is why having a CT or MRI (whatever your doctor orders) is important. Sorry you are going through this. \n\nEvery situation is different.  In my case, hearing was about the same after the first surgery.  But the first week or two was really difficult to understand some sounds, especially in loud rooms. Hearing gradually improved after the ear healed.\n\nMy Cholesteatoma came back which destroyed most of my hearing in one ear.  My doctor said his priority was my safety, with maintaining hearing being the second priority. My second surgery was required to remove middle ear bones.\n\nThe first week after surgery is not fun but healing was faster than I expected.\n\nI have noticed ringing in my ear gets worse if I touch my ear, such as cleaning. I try to keep hands off as much as possible.\n\nWishing best of luck in your situation. thank you for the advice, next time I see the doctor I will ask for it Thank you! Yes, sadly for 6 months I am on private insurance (mar-aug)... hopefully that would work, because if not I would have to wait until september or more to be on the National Health Insurance Thank you! That is another of my fears, if the cholesteatoma comes back :/ That is a totally understandable concern.  In my case, I have had 3 surgeries.  Audio work is a big part of my job, so I requested to try a conservative surgery first to minimize hearing loss.  Unfortunately, the cholesteatoma was still problematic a year later which led to a second surgery.  This time my middle ear bones and implant needed to be removed.  The third surgery was less invasive and an attempt to restore some hearing. Unfortunately, it was a wasted effort.  I am grateful I only have cholesteatoma in one ear.\n\nHope you have better success.  It feels like a lonely condition because of its obscurity, but reading the shared experiences on Reddit have helped me cope.  Best of luck to you on any surgery. Thank you! Damn cholesteatoma, I wish no one had to live this problem /:\n\nYou know the funny thing, two days ago I went to the doctor again and I tried two request for more information about surgery. I am summary he told me one thing I still cannot process: \u201cwe need to wait until the cholesteatoma destroys your inner ear so we can do surgery\u201d. For me, there is no logic at all in that statement. He was barely speaking in English so I cannot be sure if I listened correctly. But that was what I understood. Another thing he told me is that my eardrum needs to close in order to do surgery. \n\nI will have to visit another hospital in a bigger city and get more info on this. It is helpful to get opinions from multiple doctors, especially since it is not a common issue.  I met with a few doctors before I found one I trusted.  \n\nI had the opposite problem. The first doctor wanted to immediately do an aggressive surgery.  I eventually found one that worked with me to discuss a suitable treatment and timeline.\n\nI was told it is possible for cholesteatoma to cause brain damage, so it is important to understand if it is ok to wait or if it is important to get surgery sooner. I agree with you. What I have decided is to keep the treatment and wait until September when I will have Korean Insurance. These months I will try to visit other doctors and hospitals and try to get scans to check how is my situation. Thank you!", "3 weeks post op but sensitive to storms Anyone else feel more pressure than normal during recovery when it is storming outside??. It is almost painful. I had a tympanoplastymastoidectomy plus ossicular reconstruction.", "Walk me through your recovery and taking care of yourself after the surgery. So I have have my mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty last friday and currently in recovery.\n\nCan you just guys walk me through on your recovery journey?\nI am currently on mefenamic acid for pain and sultamicillin.\n\nAnd what are you doing in preventing having cholesteatoma again? I, too, would like to know as well as I will be having my surgery soon-ish. How are you feeling currently? 2 weeks ago i had a tympanoplasty, it was my second cholesteatoma related surgery. I just rested for 2 weeks, took paracetamol, ibuprofen and tramadol for pain, i got some sofradex ear drops today at my follow up appointment too. Recovery wasnt so bad, just take it slow and easy and if you get too dizzy the drs can give you stuff to help settle it down. I dont think theres anything you can do to prevent it coming back, just keep getting regular check ups. I had my surgery a week ago today. It was my first. They were hoping to put in a hearing implant while in there but I was too inflamed so they could not...\n\nHad stronger pain meds for the first 3 days and now on Tylenol. Also did a round of steroids to address the inflammation. Today was the first day that I was not counting the minutes until I could take Tylenol again, but that is not to say the pain has been very bad. Overall I would say it is kind of like being punched in the head (which thankfully has not happened to me since my teen years). The ear, but moreso the neck and jaw around the ear, feels swollen and bruised, but visibly it is not bruised and only minor swelling. Overall though the pain is not as bad as I thought it was going to be, which is nice I guess.\n\nThe day of the surgery I felt better than expected for sure. I am fortunate to not have had any major side effects... dizziness being the one I was most afraid of.\n\nI have been eating plenty, my sore jaw the only thing that slows me down.\n\nYawning is very uncomfortable and I had to sneeze once which was terrifying but fine just let the sneeze go do not try to stop it.\n\nI slept on a recliner the first 5 days and it worked well (besides waking up with a sore neck and searching for the pain meds.... but slept through the nights). I switched over to my bed now with pillows for a incline, and I have not been able to get a deep sleep. Not sure if it is from discomfort or fear of rolling over... but I might go back to the recliner for a few more days.\n\nIf I try to do too much, walking around, work on the computer, etc I do get a little \u201cwobbly\u201d. Happened yesterday when I went out for lunch for the first time and today when trying to do some work/conference calls. I am anticipation that will be back to normal within a few days.\n\nI am in my 30s, bit the bullet and stayed at my moms for the week. My girlfriend stayed most of the week as well except for going to work. Having people here to cook for me primarily, and also just for piece of mind, definitely went a long way and I recommend not being alone if you do not have to be. But if you are not fortunate enough to have that option, I think I would have been able to do it myself, just would not have been as easy.\n\nRight now it feels a little wet inside my ear, it is driving me nuts. Did not feel like that until today. \n\nI have my post-op doctor appointment in 10 hours, I will let you know how that goes!\n\nI know this was a little bit all over the place but figured I would share my thoughts for anyone curious about what other people are experiencing! Hope this helps someone somehow. Post op appointment went well. Adding ibuprofen and heating pad to help with the minor inflammation in the neck and jaw (but it feels a lot better today regardless). And a round of ear drops for a week. Need to clean the incision daily with hydrogen peroxide. Doctor said everything looked as expected. Going back in 4 weeks for a hearing test (not sure why) and then will look to have hearing bone implants in about 6 months, and he said he would have to open the ear for that he could do it through an incision in the ear drum? \n\nOverall feeling pretty good considering they cut me open a week ago.", "Can a cholesteatoma come back? Guys I have had my surgery 5 months ago and it was a open radical surgery. I have been told it was completely removed, now after 5 months have passed I can feel something again in my ear and it started leaking, when I press on that ear I can feel there is some liquid stucked inside :(.\nSo does that mean I would need a second surgery? It can come back, especially if one continues to be prone to ear infections. Can you smell the discharge? I do not know about you, but I have had zits in my ears before that popped and leaked, mimicking an ear infection. Regardless, it is probably best to have it looked at either way. It would probably be better to have surgery than to lose your hearing, or worse. You will almost certainly need it, unfortunately, if it is come back \ud83d\ude14 I am sorry, hopefully that is not the case though I had a cholesteatoma removed 4 times. It can definitely come back, some time fast, sometime after years. Better to check it out with the doctor. Thanks for letting me know, actually I arleady accepted the fact that I might be dear when I get older but I still have one ear left. Will have to quit my passion for music or to protect my self better but that is not a big deal, health is my priority :) One of my doctor claimed 40% return rate during a recent remision diagnosis :/", "Some questions while waiting for my CT results. So, I am in the process of assessing whether I have a cholesteatoma or not and my friend told me there is  a subreddit for that, so here I am with an account and a few questions cause I am getting a bit scared. I hope that is ok.\n\nI have been having hearing loss for a few years now and my ear feels full and clogged. No discharge. Only mild tinnitus and pain. These are the symptoms that prompted my ENT to order a CT scan. Also my hearing becomes somewhat better if I press my ear on my shoulder or if I hold my nose closed and blow. This last part seems a bit weird to me. Has anyone else experienced this? Also did any of you have an absence of discharge? If anything my ear is more dry than the other and it feels like there is some sticky thing inside even though there is a complete absence of ear wax.  Could this be caused by an advanced cholesteatoma? \n\nAnd if I do have a cholesteatoma is surgery urgent or necessary? How difficult did you find the procedure? Any post op complications?\n\nThank you all in advance! No expert, but sounds like you have Eustachian tube dysfunction. I had this as well as a Cholesteatoma. To put your mind at ease, I was very worried before surgery. I had a Combined approach typanoplasty and a mastoidectomy. 2 bones removed from my inner ear and a prosthesis added. 4 weeks after surgery I have a improved hearing and fingers crossed a Cholesteatoma free ear. Good luck and remember that sometimes the worrying is the worst bit! \n\n:) Thank you for your answer!! Good luck to you too!I hope your ear remains Cholesteatoma free. The only thing that prompted a visit to the ENT for me was foul discharge. That is it! I did not really have any other noticeable symptoms other than that. It was years of foul discharge before I decided to do something about it.\n\nFollowing a scan, I got a diagnosis, and was scheduled for surgery the following week because it had already started to eat through my skull? and coupled with my recurring ear infection, and fear of it spreading to my brain, it was somewhat urgent. I think if you have a cholesteatoma, the urgency will depend on how big the cyst is, the location and/or if you have an infection. Surgery is necessary, but not always urgent.  \n\nI had to stay in the hospital 3 days following my first surgery which took about 9 hours. But to be fair, it was because I had ongoing infection that they needed to keep an eye on. The worst part about it was having to avoid getting water on my ear while showering when I got back home. Everything went really well both times. I had another surgery some years later to reconstruct my ear canal. I am one of the lucky few who has little to no tinnitus, and my hearing is pretty decent despite the ordeal. I have a slight paralysis of my lip on the affected side but that is about it! \n\nAlso fun fact: I had severe motion sicness before I got diagnosed. Every car ride was a nightmare. After they did the surgery, I have hardly experienced any motion sickness :) Thank you for your reply!! These info are useful. I will wait for the results tomorrow and I will talk again with my ENT.", "Some advice and different perspective So I was born with twisted ear canals which resulted in ear wax not being able to get out which resulted in build up and later on a cholesteatoma. I had my first surgery at 5 years old and have since then had quite a few more. I figured for those of you with younger kids going through this ordeal I would tell my experience with surgeries and advice\n\n1) try your best to make it a positive experience \nThis is literally number one I remeber going in for surgery hungry (you cannot eat some hours before so that your stomach is empty at the time of the surgery) and scared but excited because my parents were there with me and were smiling and talking almost joking after the surgery I remember waking up to stuff animals and people around my bed smiling and such hardly recall anything else but this can help since after the first surgery to get rid of it they go back in some months later (in my experience) to see if it is all truly gone and the previous positive experience can help them to feel less nervous or scared. Overall just being they before and after really help I know I felt pretty emotional and still do when it comes to surgeries so simply hanging around them and even sleeping in the same room will help\n\n2) they are probably going to be sick (throwing up quite a bit keep a bowl nearby) after for a day or so if it goes on any longer go in to the er or something of that sort and get it checked out, I once was sick for almost a week until my parents went in drank some stuff and had a shot and it went away, \n\nAlong with above mention there might be some ache and soreness swelling and or trouble opening the mouth and chewing (that only happened on a pretty major one) and dizyness sometime after try to keep them off their feet and or away from doing anything major (even if they feel perfectly fine) for at the very least a week two weeks is better also after the surgery for the next day or so keep the food light and easy otherwise they are good to move around walk, running or jumping or picking up anything heavy (nothing above 5 pounds for the first week goes up by five or so for the weeks to come) is not a good idea. I actually went into the dentist for a teeth cleaning the day after one of my surgeries and was fine but it was hard to open my mouth \n\n3) they should have another surgery after in about half a year or so to make sure it is all gone at least that is what they did for me\n\n4) make sure to have wide neck shirts or button ups as they will have a bulky bandage around their head in my experience it did not hurt only ached and made me feel lopsided though the more major the surgery the more after math it is a in and out surgery so they should be home before the day is out\n\n5) this is if you suspect anything that it could be a cholesteatoma go in and get it checked out especially if they have a history of ear issues cholesteatoma usually results in draniage (bloody clear yellow foul) can have sensation of fullness or hearing loss and often has no pain so all because there is no pain do not put it off ever this can result in permanent hearing damage (I had a few of my bones in my ear eaten away and had to get fake ones) \n\n* Major warning the surgery can be extended I have had that happen to me two times once by an hour another by 3 both I came out fine it also unlikely to happen but if it does just be as calm as possible\n\nOtherwise be calm and supportive this is a pretty standard surgery I have had it about 5 times along with some other surgeries (cholesteatoma once in both ears and again in my right having the follow up surgery the day before Thanksgiving wish me luck!)  Never encountered anything worse then some nausea swelling and some trouble chewing if you have any questions just ask below \n\nSorry for how long it is, hope it helps! Great post. I wish my parents had realized or had taken me to a specialist when I was a kid. Ya looked at your post I cannot imagine the type of damage that a cholesteatoma not treated for so long can do. Your recovery looks like it is going well wish you good luck with further recovery. If you had any bones eaten away by the cholesteatoma replacements help a lot. Great advice, thank you!  One question though ... what caused your surgery to be extended?  Do you mean the surgery was delayed, or were there complications during the surgery? Well on one the doctor did not like how the back of ear looked (previous doctor did a bad job) and do reconstructed it which was really nice of her as before there was huge duvet behind my ear. The second time it was the same doctor and it was originally a exploratory surgery but she went a little further a found my mastoid riddled with cholesteatoma and that extended the surgery some that one was actually my most recent all the same I woke up just dandy the surgery went as well as it could", "Second surgery tomorrow Tomorrow I have my mastoid obliteration - I am nervous but keen to get it over and done with! \nWanted to say a massive thank you to this group and for the people that have been so helpful answering questions and sharing their stories \u263a\ufe0f I am very grateful! All the best /u/bethanyhearn \\- not that you need any luck, as it will all go well. Just remain positive as it will help with the success and your recovery. Personally,  I found the recovery for my second surgery easier and faster due to the things I learnt after the first one.  Let us all know how you go.", "Had cholesteatoma removed and mastoid obliteration with Bonalive Granules, here to answer questions Last week I received surgery to remove a recurrent cholesteatoma, the ENT also performed a mastoid cavity obliteration with Bonalive Granules. ( ( ) So far, the recovery is going pretty well. The ENT has also stated that there is a two in three chances of achieving a so called 'dry ear' thanks to the mastoid obliteration. This would also allow me to get a hearing aid and hear normally in the cholesteatoma ear.\n\nI can answer any questions that anyone has about the procedure itself (I am a 4th year medical student in a European country) and about the recovery. Thanks for that. I have a congenital cholesteatoma in my right temporal bone so the bone has been eroded. I assumed I would have to have a metal plate or similar on my skull to replace the eroded bone. It depends on your specific situation, but Bonalive has been getting very popular in the last fifteen years to replace eroded bone. You should ask you ENT if it would be an option, and if so what the risks would be. I am waiting on surgeons to decide what to do. They are in another state but I think I will probably have a consult before the actual surgery. What is the operation like? Do they go through the ear canal or do they have to remove the ear? Do you have to have a healthy ear going into the operation with no reoccurring ear infections? *What is the operation like?*\n\nI was nervous when I went to the hospital, but I told my anesthesiologist about what I was afraid of. One of my main worries was that I would have postoperative pain in my bladder/genitals from the catheter that I would have during the surgery, since a catheter was required for the surgery. The anesthesiologist assured me that I would be fine, and she was right. The catheter was placed when I was already under anesthesia and it was removed before I woke up. I did not notice anything of it having been there when I woke up. The same goes for the endotracheal tube. In total the surgery takes about four hours, but the anesthesia made it feel like one second. Apparently I also fell asleep immediately after the anesthesia was over, since I had a dream in the recovery room(dreaming during anesthesia itself is impossible). This made it feel like I slept during the surgery, although in reality I was 'gone' during the surgery itself and I slept for a short while in the recovery room.\n\n*Do they go through the ear canal or do they have to remove the ear?*\n\nA cut is made behind the ear, after which they flip it over. This is the best way to perform surgery on the mastoid. When the surgery is over they flip it back and suture it. A bandage is also put inside your ear canal to catch any postoperative bleeding and a pressure bandage is tied around your head for the first 24 hours. Right now, my operated ear is standing in a different position than my normal ear. This is normal after this type of surgery. My ear might remain in a bit of a different position for the rest of my life, but this is really a minor inconvenience. Stephen Colbert has this too, since he was also treated for cholesteatoma during childhood. (\n\n*Do you have to have a healthy ear going into the operation with no reoccurring ear infections?*\n\nI have had recurring painless ear infection in my cholesteatoma ear for the last three or four years. This was because of the mastoid cavity that I received during the cholesteatoma extraction surgery ten years ago. It was very annoying and a sign that the cholesteatoma might be back. As I have stated in my OP, this surgery has a two in three chance of no more recurring ear infections. This would decrease the chances of another recurrence of cholesteatoma and would allow me to get a hearing aid to hear like a normal person. Thanks for the advice. Thinking about getting the surgery as I have a mastoid cavity and chronic ear infections as a result. I have had previous surgeries where they had to fold over the ear and stitch it back in place. It looked out of place and stuck out the first few months after the surgeries but then it slowly started to shift back into place and looks just like my other ear now. Another possible benefit from the surgery; swimming will probably be safe because the mastoid cavity is gone. The dizziness from water in the ear has been reported to have stopped in a lot of patients who received this surgery. Also wind, cold weather, etc. into the mastoid cavity can affect balance/dizziness as you already stated. Has your ear started to look back to normal yet? Has the swelling gone down? Also how long is the recovery? My ear looks more normal than a week ago, swelling has gone down. Today I started working again, after 3 weeks. I am not allowed to lift heavy objects or sneeze yet. Apparently not many surgeons perform this procedure in the United States. At least none in my area. Such a shame Do you mean mastoid obliteration itself or using BonAlive Granules during the surgery? Mastoid obliteration itself. How is the recovery going? Very well up to this point, I will get a hearing test and an ENT-consult in a few days. So far my ear is dry and I am not in any pain, the ear itself is also looking pretty good right now. Glad to hear it! How does the ear look and feel? Has the swelling gone down? Has this procedure helped you hear better? I am contemplating getting this procedure done **How does the ear look and feel?**   \nThe ear looks like a normal ear, the only person who has noticed it being at a slightly different angle without prior knowledge of my condition and surgery is a physician from my job, who has 20 years of medical experience at a highly regarded academic hospital in detecting symptoms of patients. It also feels completely normal.\n\n**Has the swelling gone down?** \n\nAbsolutely, it looks like a normal ear now.\n\n**Has this procedure helped you hear better?**   \nI have had a hearing test done last month. The conclusion was that I am able to hear a bit better post-surgery than pre-surgery. This also means that I am still pretty deaf in that ear though. On the upside; the ear has not had any leakage of fluid or other signs of painless ear infections since the surgery, which means that there is a big chance that I will be able to receive a hearing aid that would restore my hearing.  \n\n\nMy conclusion as of 4 months post-surgery: I would recommend the procedure to you. Awesome! Thanks again! Has the procedure given you the perception of better hearing or statistically shown better hearing on an audio gram? Statistically better hearing according to a hearing test, and I can wear a hearing aid now thanks to my ear being dry.", "I (22 female) have a titanium prosthesis in my right ear that I had implanted in 2019.

Well I received a phone call to go interstate for an MRI, but the radiologist who called to tell me when it was did not know if it was just an MRI, or if I would have the surgery afterwards. She said she would page the doctor and get back to us. We were wondering why I had to go interstate when I would had plenty of MRIs here. Not hearing anything we called them back because with the situation at the moment we\u2018d have to quarantine away from home for two weeks and the children are being home schooled by us at the moment. I have been waiting for about 10 months with no idea what is happening except ct and mri scans just before the quarantine. I was assured it took time because in my case the specialists had to confer. When we called back we discovered that despite the fact I told the initial consultant I had private insurance It in fact turned out I was on a public list. I think they did not even know I was in another state. So I\u2018ve made an appointment to see my gp who can refer me to somewhere that might know what to do. Who referred you to get the CT and MRI scans?  Have you been referred to an ENT specialist? Disappointing you got lost in the system, but I guess it happens. Hopefully your GP can help you through it all.\n\nIn my case, my GP referred me to an ENT, and the ENT sent me off for the CT scan (and hearing test) to confirm the condition, and then the ENT booked me in for (and performed) the surgery. Well, my GP ordered MRI/CT. That detected the Cholesteatoma. He then referred me to the ENT. The ENT ordered further MRI/CT. Nobody in my state is qualified to do the surgery so my ENTs colleague ( who I have never met) liasoned with experts in another state. They supposedly conferred to decide what to do. Someone ordered more MRI/CT. Then yesterday I get a call to travel to another state for another MRI. I had another CT at the ER a week after the ones ordered by who knows. The one at the ER was said to show no sign of the Cholesteatoma ( which my GP said he would send an angry letter to complain about). Now tomorrow morning I see my GP again to get a new referral ( which funnily enough my sister, a radiologist, kept telling me to do anyway). Sorry to hear about the run around - not fair on you. Strange you have been asked to get multiple MRI &amp; CT scans too. Hopefully your GP will refer you to an ENT who is in a position to surgically treat cholesteatoma if it is found, but it sounds like you will need to go out of state anyway. Keep us updated with how you go. I thought all the scans were to keep track of how it is growing. It is not a normal cholesteatoma and there just is not anyone skilled enough to remove it here in Tasmania. Well I saw my GP. He thinks they might want the MRI interstate as they have a big wall screen to compare and examine the scans to the smallest detail, although he agrees they could do the scans here. We theorise my case has been put on a public list because they need to gather so many experts in one place like the hospital there. He is going to write a referral ( I think) to the ENT\u2019s colleague handling the case so I can discuss it with him personally.\n\nAlso, there is been no growth in the last 10 months so it does not look like it is urgent. That is a positive sign then if there is been no growth, although these things can grow very slowly.", "How do you guys deal with going back to work and looking weird? (Hairstyles? Bandanas?

My sugestion would be you do not have to give a Fuck about what your colleagues or anyone else thinks of you, this is first.\nBut if you are really concerned about it, just make a short cut on sides and that is it I think it looks really cool and always go for a genuinely dad's ice breaker like \"you should see the other guy\" or \"yeah it was a sword duel and I won\" or \"lobotomies, right?\"\n\nDo not waste your opportunity to look different and feel amazing! Oh, and if you feel like it is controlling your life, I would try therapy. We all can benefit from a little more self acceptance.\nHope you feel better and wish a fine recovery! Thank you so much for your replies. I think you guys are right. Screw what people think I am going back and making light of the situation. \ud83d\ude0a As per therapy I have been in therapy for about 8 months. I have not really discussed my diagnosis in my sessions. Perhaps I should discuss it more. \n\nIn terms of what I find worrying it is more the fear of anaesthetic. I think it is pretty normal to be worried about not waking up. I have had surgery before for pretty minor things (I was under for like less than 30 minutes). I know rationally a young and fit person in there mid 20\u2019s who does not drink or smoke has basically nothing to worry about but still, I am feeling scared.\n\nI guess having your head operated on is going to be scary right? \n\nIn some ways I am quite lucky in that  I have acquired Cholesteatoma rather than congenital. My ct scan showed erosion to my ossicles but they think that my stapes is still intact. If so, the reconstruction could preserve more hearing damage in the future, provided the disease is cleared post second surgery and that it does not come back.\n\nI have been told to expect a hearing reduction post surgery (reconstruction is never as good as the real thing) but my surgeon said that my inner ear and skull plate are not affected. \n\nI am hoping after a couple of surgeries, my ear will stabilise and I can live a long and happy life albeit with some hearing loss. Is this realistic? Or am I being naive? You are very correct! I was unlucky enough to have the congenital one and I cannot hear a thing from one ear since I was 15. And after a short time it made no difference, except for some specific situations (like someone speaking really low in your affected side). I understand you worry about surgery, but that is part of the process (and kind of what we ate here for). There are many specifics about each type of cholesteatoma but yeah, an ENT professor once told me that acquired cholesteatomas usually come out in one piece and do not bother you again.", "How to clean earwax? Hello,\n\nSo when I was a kid I had 2 surgeries: one to clean and another one to reconstruction the inside.\n\nI am now an adult and sometimes with the help of my mum using qtips, I get some earwax out. This earwax is like a grain of rice or maybe bigger. Due to the cholesteatoma, the inside of my ear got bigger so that makes it dirty easily and I cannot have water in it neither.\n\nHere healthcare is free but this make waiting lists longer so if I want to get my ear checked and cleaned, it may take 5 months or so. Due to this, I am looking for a private doctor, but  int the meantime is there a better way to clean it? I would only let an ENT put something solid inside my ear to try and clear out excess wax. So throw those q-tips away.\n\nHowever I am not an ENT, so take my comments as just some random internet person commenting on your post ... but if I was unable to see an ENT or a GP for a long time, and it was really getting to me, then I would first try over the counter purchased ear wax softening drops.  Then a few days later, I might also try to encourage the wax to move by warm water in the shower or bath, but only very gently.\n\nI thought I had any infection or damage to my ear drum, I would not try any of this.  Just my $0.02", "1 day post op question about ear drops So I picked up my ofloxacin 0.3% ear drops from the pharmacy and it has been 24 since my surgery. It says to take twice a day in my operated ear. I still have a cotton ball at the bowl of my ear to catch blood and discharge. Am I supposed to take the cotton ball out to do the drops? Should I replace the cotton ball when done? \n\nDo I put the cotton ball on after the drops, trapping them in there, or do I keep the drops in for 3 minutes and then tilt my head to pour them out like I have used them in the past?\n\nI am honestly scared of putting the drops in. Does it affect the packing at all? Should I take the cotton ball out of my ear and let things drain? You can remove the cotton ball, you just have to avoid disturbing the packing. \n\nPlace the drops in the ear on top of the packing - it may not really soak in much because of the clotted blood, you can try to wipe off some of it with hydrogen peroxide on cotton swabs. Obviously be very gentle and try your best not to disturb the packing/wound. (Best to have someone else do all this for you.)\n\nAfter lying on your side to let the drops soak in as much as possible, put a fresh cotton ball on top and you are good to go! Hope everything heals nicely \ud83d\udc4d One warning - the dried blood kept getting stuck to my cotton wool and every time I tried to remove the cotton wool I was peeling off dried blood from my ear and it was quite sore!", "Can it appear and go away on its own? I had a cholesteatoma removed when I was a kid, around 16 years ago now. Around 3 years ago, the same ear became blocked with wax so I could not hear out it, followed by an infection. The infection was noteable because the discharge had the same foul odour I remember coming from the infection I had as a kid. I went to see an ENT who prescribed me some drops for the infection and to get another check up (I was moving cities in between these two events, so that might have complicated things). After a few weeks, the drops cleared the infection up (no more smell), and I went to get the ear wax removed and then my hearing came back! So all good. Once I moved to the new city, I saw an ENT who spent about 2 minutes with me; looked in my ear, told me everything looked okay, and to go to emergency if I had any sudden hearing loss. That was all.\n\nThat was 3 years ago now and over the past few months I have had some intermittent sharp pain in that ear. I went to see a GP about this the other week and am now on a waiting list to see an ENT (we have free healthcare in my country but the waiting lists are very long now due to COVID). As of a week ago, I noticed the pain had got worse, accompanied by a headache, but read that this might an inner ear infection and they usually clear up within a few days. I have been taking a couple of Ibuprofen every day since then (both for the dull ear ache and for another issue). I am noticing that the pain is still there today, though very mild, and only notice it when I put pressure on it or move it doing yoga or something. I also feel general pain around my facial muscles/mouth/tongue, but no other symptoms like fever, discharge, lack of energy, dizziness - nothing like that. In fact other than the pain I feel great. \n\nI am going to ring my GP tomorrow just to check, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice. Thanks! Go make a brain scan so you could know for sure, yeah it comes back and as earlier you know about that better for you so it could be removed A lot of ENTs actually have difficulties diagnosing cholesteatoma and you need to make sure the one you are going to is specialised in it. I have had 5 c-tomas and have to get my ears checked every 6 months by an ent. The last one I had, I saw 3 different ENTs for ear pain and hearing loss before I finally met someone who diagnosed that it had come back. They thought the tumor was medium sized but when they opened me up they found that it was filling my entire middle war. It was wrapped around 2 of the bones my taste nerve and my touching my facial nerve. They had to remove the taste and 2 of the bones and had to scrape the facial nerve clean. I am a bit irritated that I had to go back to them so many times just to find someone that could actually diagnose it. After this experience I realised even if they know you have had these issues previously you really need to push for your health", "Major Ear Operation (cholesteatoma) // My Experience. ", "Cholesteatoma and dizziness Hi everyone! I just discovered this subreddit and I am really happy to see we can all share our experiences here. I have had ear infections ever since I was a kid and it got worse around 2007 where I spent few days a week visiting ENTs because they could not figure out what was wrong with my left ear. After three years of treatments, antibiotics and whatnot my doctors decided it was time for a CT scan (three years wow!). CT showed I had a cholesteatoma in my left ear and after two unsuccessful surgeries the third one saved my life (that was 2009). Ever since I have been going on regular checkups, I do my scans every year or two and I have my ear cleaned every couple of months. Everything has been fine with a few inflammations over the years but nothing serious. What concerns me now is that my CT scan shows that my tegmen tympani is thinned out and the bone structure of my left temporal bone is thinned out. I do not know if I had this before but nobody mentioned that to me which pisses me off to be honest. Last few days I have been feeling slight dizziness and it feels like there is a pressure in my head which drives me mad because I do not know what is happening. I read online what could it all mean and I got to a conclusion that I might have something called SCDS (it can be caused by multiple things and among them are cholesteatoma and a thin tegmen tympani) which can cause dizziness and pressure from loud noises. I have noticed that whenever I am between people and they are being loud I get a headache and whenever I am driving In a car for a longer period of time I get sick and dizzy. Does anyone have experience with SCDS? Should I be scared of more complications because I read something about meningitis and CSF leaks which scared me to death. I have been to so many doctors and I do not know who to trust anymore because some of them ruined my ear. I have not felt SCDS symptoms but my cholesteatoma is in my right temporal bone. When it was diagnosed it was mentioned if it grew through the bone I would be at risk of meningitis.", "Hair problems?! Evening All,\n\nJust a quick one, I am new to this group and had a question weather they have to shave your hair for the operation. I pay alot for my hair and now worried what might happen?!\n\nThanks If they are going in behind your ear, then yes. They did not shave all of my hair. They basically gave me a half assed sidecut. However, hair does grow back. I had long hair, so I had no issues in hiding it. I do not have any answers just wanted to say I am nervous about this too. Worst case scenario I wear my hair down a lot I have had my surgery yesterday and they just cut the smallest amount around the ear to put in the staples.", "Can I do anything on the day of surgery? I scheduled my surgery for the same day I was supposed to go to an important dinner meeting that night.\n\nI know it sounds crazy, but is it possible to get the surgery in the morning and be okay to sit at restaurant that night? I will only be eating soft foods, I will not be anything straining. This all depends on what kind of surgery they have planned. I suggest you should call your doctor and ask them. What seems to happen (I have had 2 tympanomastoidectomy) is that you are fine that day. But waking up the next day you feel very tired and ache as the drugs have worn off by that point. Depends on the person but if like you said it is soft foods you should be ok. I was still feeling as though I had drank 4-5 alcoholic drinks the day of surgery (and I am a lightweight). I was super dizzy, could not get up or walk without assistance. I joked that I was \u201ctime traveling\u201d because I kept losing track of time and asking my partner the same things 8-9x over all day. if I texted someone, I would forget when I sent them by the time they responded. I had friends over for an outdoor visit the second night after surgery, and I kept spacing out when they talked. I could barely focus on a movie. those days felt like a blur. \n\nI am on day 7 now and could entertain the idea of being around others now that my dizziness has subsided and I finally feel human. \n\nI do not think anyone would blame you for postponing something due to a surgery!\n\nfor the record, I had a tympanoplasty with atticotomy, plus a new titanium implant. I did not take opioid pain medicine. \n\ngood luck and take it easy! *you are* important!!! others can wait. I am sure I could have gone to dinner that night in some pain but it would not have been worth it because I could not taste shit Hey! Since you have been through the surgery I wanted to ask,do you think I would be okay to be home alone with my kids after I get mine? I know things vary for everyone,but my dad was talking to me like it is a simple thing and no big deal and now I am thinking he was just trying to down play it so I would not freak out. Just wondering if I will need to get my husband to request leave from work. hi! I think everyone is going to have their own experiences, but speaking from my own recovery, I actually could not get up on my own until day 4. I was very dizzy and unsteady on my feet, but gratefully not nauseous. my doctor said to take walks daily to get my balance back. I did this with assistance, increasing my distance a little every day. my partner went back to work on day 4, and I kind of held onto furniture and leaned against walls when I needed to get up and around the house. bending over and lifting over 5-10lb is not usually allowed until your doctor okays you, so he kept everything light and within arm\u2019s reach for me. I think it depends on how old your kids are, but we actually boarded one of our dogs for the first 2 weeks because I just could not physically handle his energy. let me know if you have any other questions! I have a post about my first week up on this subreddit if that helps as well :) good luck &amp; all the best! I am feeling so much healthier now after 6 weeks. I cannot even believe now how sick I was this summer before surgery!! Thanks so much for the response! The 5-10 pound that would be hard for me,my youngest is 2. :( at least it is just for a couple of days though,I am sure I could figure it out.

Also so glad you are feeling better! \n\nhere you go! all the best and happy healing!", "Cholesteatoma surgery - 3 days post-operation  That is you for these posts. My son is having this surgery tomorrow morning and we are stressed. I had it in June. He will be fine. Lose some hearing but he will be fine. I promise. The ear swelling comes down. Look like an MMA fighters ear but she looks good bud Guessing your son's surgery is over now?  No doubt it all went well, and hopefully the stress has gone too.  The challenge now is to keep the area dry, and follow the routine the surgeon provided. Yes, it is over and everything went very well. Now we are just trying to keep up on his meds, keep him hydrated, and ask you said, keep his ear dry. We also need to keep him from moving around too much which is probably going to be the most difficult part. We will also have a follow up surgery in about six months to rebuild the ear. \n\nThank you for your videos. They have been very helpful.", "Temporal bone air cell cholesteatoma. Hi,\n\nawhile ago I found out I had a cholesteatoma. At first, after I read up on it, I assumed it was a normal one in my ear, but once i saw my ENT I found out it is in fact in the air cell of my right temporal bone. Seems it is congenital and simply was missed every other time I had scans on my head. I had a lot of ear trouble as a child and in fact at one point had a skin graft on my ear drum. Anyone in this community familiar with a cholesteatoma of the temporal bone air cell? Hi, thanks for posting.  First I have heard that cholesteatoma can enter the mastoid air cell system, but I guess it is possible as it is an invasive disease .  My surgery report stated that my cholesteatoma was in the \"epitympanum and mastoid\", but there was no mention of any \"air cells\".  I am in Australia too (Melbourne), and can highly recommend my surgeon if you are local (or can travel here).  I was referred to him by my ENT, as I simply asked \"who was the best surgeon known for treating cholesteatoma in the state\", and have been happy with my journey so far. I qualify for the Tasmanian government to pay for my trip and lodging. The condition is so rare and difficult there simply is no one in Tasmania that could do it. Yes, Robert Briggs.  He is very good, and also the Head of Otology and Medical Director of the Cochlear Implant Clinic at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital.  I would definitely ask your ENT to provide you a referral to him, then call his office.  Just beware though, he is very hard to get an appointment with. Apparently that is who my case is being discussed with. That is positive news then - it sounds like you are in very good hands.  Please keep us updated how it goes.", "Does it cause sharp pain in ear drum? Just before the pandemic my ENT said I had a cholesteatoma on my left ear drum. I have a constant sharp pain in there. Hoping to get the cholesteatoma removed soon, but ENT seems unsure if it will help the pain. Anyone have experience with this? Personally I experience a sharp pain from time to time in my ear. Normally this is accompanied by a change in pressure though. I got sharp pains and really bad headaches with the cholesteatoma, now 3 weeks post op and no headaches but occasional sharp pain. Not as bad as before op though. I think it also takes time to settle after healing and all but hopefully that will be gone as well.  I know they cannot give any guarantees with the surgery and sometimes it really is a \u2018let us try it and see\u2019 scenario but always better to have the op with cholesteatoma and hope for the best.

I had one six years ago but apparently he did not do a good job as I just saw my cat scan today and the Cholestatoma is huge, it is completely filling my mastoid and it has eaten a hole into both my ear canal and the bone connecting to the brain cavity. He says that I will be fine since he has done this before and he has seen worse, this is a 6/10, and no fluid will be leaking since there is something behind the bone that blocks it as well. Luckily I do not have any interference with nerves or any loss of function in my face. Unfortunately, however he will probably have to take out the ear canal and reconstruct it as well as the ear bones. So make sure you guys get your scans often so you avoid this kind of crap! Mine has eroded the bones in my ear and is eating into the temporal bone. I am having scans in about two weeks to see how much it is grown. Ok thanks. Good luck ! I have had the same thing happen to me, but the remaining cavity was filled with Bonalive Granules this summer. I can get a hearing aid and swim now. My cholesteatoma had eaten my ossicles and both the mastoid and that brain bone thingy ...  like that membrane that covers the brain, I forgot what it is called, was exposed. That thing being exposed and me having to deal with a bunch of ongoing ear infections is probably the reason why they scheduled me for surgery like very quickly after they found out what it was. Would not want any of that in my brain lol ( also my ear drum was just a piece of dead skin that fluttered with the wind heh.

It is been months since I had my surgery and it still has a weird gurgling drainage constant noise :(", "Possible cholesteatoma? So I have been having issues with my ear for two years now. At first it started with muffled hearing, and the ENT diagnosed me with ETD, but my hearing remained muffled. I went to another ENT a year later and she told me she could not find anything wrong with my ear when she looked inside, which I thought was strange because yellow discharge that smelled awful kept coming out of my ear on one side. She told me it was normal and it was just wax (it definitely was not normal if it was only happening to one side), and then said I probably had TMJ which is what is causing my ETD.\n\nYesterday I was picking something in my ear and I had a lot of drainage coming out again, but this time my hearing just went extremely muffled, it feels like there is air inside trying to pop, I had this painful ear ache, and I have constant tinnitus in my ear now. I have been trying to read up on it and just read the symptoms of cholesteatoma, and now I am terrified I have it but have let it go untreated for too long. I already booked an appointment with an ENT but I have to wait four days. I feel like crying if this is something extremely serious/permanent damage has already been done, because I cannot believe I listened to the other ENT that nothing was wrong with my ear and it was normal. Is there any hope I can regain my hearing if I go through a surgery? I really think you  should stop picking your ear over all, wait until you see your new ENT/HNS. Have them order a CT scan if you feel like it is cholesteatoma. This is how it is usually diagnosed. Hi! \n\nAround 2009-10 I had something similar to what you are describing. A very smelly discharge from my left ear. I could even smell it while breathing. It sucked.\n\nI didnt have medical insurance at the time, so I went to a clinic, and they gave me antibiotic after antibiotic, with no results. I couldnt afford an ENT, so I scheduled an appointment with a \"free' specialist at a public hospital, but they needed to call me. \n\nThis infection lasted almost 2 years. I never got the call, and it did end up going away on its own, and my hearing is decent in that ear.\n\nin 2019 I had another ear infection in my opposite ear, but this time I have insurance so I went right away to the ENT. Got some drops, cleared up no problem. The ENT wanted a CT scan just because I have a history of Ear infections. They found a colesteatoma in my left ear and the bone in between my ear canal and my brain has \"opacified\". So there may be a small hole in it.\n\nThis could have been resolved years ago, and who knows how bad it is now? The CT scan shows a small Colesteatoma, but the MRI doesnt show it at all. \n\nI have surgery on the 1st.\n\nAll this to say, go to the ENT! Get a CT scan, or MRI, or both. (In my case I had both) I went to an ent then was referred to an Otolaryngologist in his office.. I went over 10 years with symptoms before getting a diagnosis, and I even mentioned cholesteatoma because my dad had one as well.. (turns out to be hereditary for us due to face shape and small Eustachian tubes). I did finally get a ct and got diagnosed. It was way scarier in my mind than it actually is. This board is so supportive but I would not go down a webmd rabbit hole because the variance in severity and rate of growth varies greatly between each person affected.", "Has anyone had their mastoid bone removed and taste nerve cut?  My ENT told me last year that the taste nerve on my right side was cut when I had my first cholesteatoma surgery 10 years ago. I never noticed a thing because your other taste nerves compensate it.

Xx Right now I am on my internal medicine rotation, but anesthesiology is my current favorite specialty. Do not want to cut out ENT yet, as I still have to go through that specific rotation.\n\nAs to your current surgery, this thread was made by me one year ago and might help you:(\n\nI do not know enough about your specific case, but if my specific surgery would be an option I would definitely recommend it. Hey thank you! That sounds quite similar! I was reaLly worried about them removing the mastoid bone as worried there would just be a big gap from my ear to my brain and then have been stressed about any ear infection I get going straight to my brain? Do you know if they put anything there like a graft etc?? X There is a thought. Recently I have been thinking I find food sort of bland. I wonder if the nerve\u2019s been damaged by my cholesteatoma. I read awhile ago about some sort of granule the surgeon puts in the bone to support new growth. The old method of around 2010 was to leave a hole, nowadays it is very common to use Bonalive Granules. These are glass fibers(sounds more scary than it is) which your body converts into bone. Animation: \n\nThe Bonalive Granules also kill bacteria, so infections are extremely uncommon.\n\nYou should ask your ENT about what exact type of surgery he wants to perform. Okay that is amazing thank you so much! Will ask all of this in my next meeting I had my left chewing muscle cut into when my cholesteatoma was removed and my ear drum repaired. It took about 5-6 months to fully get taste and movement back. I am almost four months post op and my taste still is not quite right Is it on a certain part of your tongue? Or all over? Just the right side of my tongue.

Had my nerve cut. Taste is back to normal, but on the part my tongue where I lost taste, get random numbness/a salty taste. It happens later in the day usually. Driving me nuts. Could it be something else, or could the numbness persist? How you doing? Honestly quite better only things is slight discharge and my hearing is prob 10% on effected ear which will take some time to get used to permanently, my taste is either back or ive got so used to it idk, I am 3 week post op btw.

If it is not and there is really no sign of infection, or pain, I would say four months is okay. Just monitor it closely. I have bilateral Cholesteatoma, the left ear got severely infected and I had 4 surgeries and counting. The right has never been touched, but will eventually be addressed. Do not wait if it is infected, get it handled as soon as you can. Are both your eardrums ruptured? Its hard to tell I guess if its just sore ears or cholesteatoma sore because I do not know what is normal. Are the listed symptoms online quite accurate? - thank you for your advice Yes they are. My right, untreated ear, does have a perforated ear drum and it impacts my hearing. Unfortunately, it is the only hearing I have and I make due. My symptoms started as severe ear aches and then turned into an infection, bad infection, like drainage and excruciating pain; the mastoid was eating my hearing bones. Aside from that, I do not really remember if I experienced textbook symptoms. I just know that if I could go back in time, knowing what I know now, I would have acted as fast as possible. Your hearing is precious. If you have been officially diagnosed with a cholesteatoma, then hopefully you have found a ENT surgeon you are happy with, and planning to have it surgically treated.

Just wanted to give my tips for surgery. I am two weeks post op. These are my thoughts I wanted to share! \n\n\u2022Try and ask for another of the white plastic ear shields and the tape they use to wrap your head. Dumb me threw mine away and I had the hardest time sleeping for a couple weeks. It would have helped SO MUCH! Clean that sucker immediately after you take it off. \n\n\u2022Buy a fresh bag of cotton balls and split it between every bathroom in your house and your car/place Of work. I have used more cotton balls this month than I have my entire life. Also a fresh Vaseline! \n\n\u2022Your ear will most likely be numb for awhile. My favorite pillow to sleep with was the memory foam pillow! It molded to whatever weird shape my ear was in at the time. I was also thankful for a pillow protector and dark pillowcases. My ear drained and drained and drained. \n\n\u2022I had a pretty hard time recovering for the first couple days. Have someone there to help you out and MAKE you take pain medicine. Save some of the good stuff until about 1.5 weeks in. When your ear starts to go back to normal and not be numb, it hurts! \n\n\u2022Watch how you wash your hair after you get the go ahead. I accidentally picked a scab where the doctor had a secondary incision. Thank god I was in the shower. Whoops! \n\n\u2022make sure your watching any earrings you have on. I put mine in almost immediately because I wanted that area to get used to them. Your ears leak, and earrings get gross quickly! Ear wax is not cute to clean. \n\n\u2022Your hearing is going to SUCK. It is the worst part. Maybe mine was just particularly bad? But I cannot hear anything. \n\nWeird side effect? \n\u2022Be careful touching the area. I now have a soft spot that immediately triggers a migraine. \n\u2022It also triggers my TMJ. Opening your mouth after this... was not fun. \n\nAll in all, I have another surgery in 6 months. It is worth it and I would do it again. Not all surgeries will turn out the same. Share your secrets! I am a month out and I thought it was a cake walk. Maybe that is because I have already dealt with two acl surgeries. But why the second surgery? My doc never mentioned I guess it is different for everyone, because I have been miserable for two weeks. \n\nBut mine was apparently huge, I was in surgery for almost 5 hours. It was wrapped around the two major nerves in that area. The facial nerve and the equilibrium nerve. In addition to eating all the bones in my ear, it had moved onto the skull. They repaired all of that in one surgery. \n\n\nYou are always at risk for a second, third or even fourth surgery. These things come back. :( My Doctor said mine is aggressive and he has no doubt in his mind that he will have to go in and clean it up again. He was worried about around the areas of the nerves. I am assuming they had to be careful and could have missed things due to proximity to things that could screw up my life. The second surgery is required to confirm the cholesteatoma has not grown back, and also to do things to repair your hearing (if possible). In most cases, the second surgery is even easier than the first, as it is not as invasive. This is exactly how it was for me. 5 hour surgery, the mass was way bigger than expected. Just got rediagnosed as having a cholesteatoma again today... Going in for surgery round two in a few weeks. Damn. Did you have any antiseptic packing stuffed in your ear canal? I am a week post op, and the packing is really irritating, more so than the pain I think. Also it is preventing my ear from draining. I have half a mind to take it out as it says in my information leaflet that I should not worry if it falls out. I am so sorry I am just now getting to this. \n\nYes, the packing is part of the process. You will have it for awhile. I am now, 3 months PO and I still have packing falling out. I have my second followup surgery in December and have fully expected to have packing in my ear forever. \ud83d\ude02 I am scheduled for my second surgery December 16th! I will keep you all updated. Follow up to previous surgery.\n\n\nThey went in through the ear canal this time, the cyst has not grown back in the 6 months since my surgery. Wahoo! \n\nThis was a COMPLETELY different recovery than the last. While it \u201churt\u201d for a couple days, it was very mild compared to the first one. I took off for a week expecting to need to recover and only needed two days max.

Typically, medical advice involves giving a diagnosis and/or prescribing a treatment for medical condition.\n\nMedical advice can be distinguished from medical information, which is the relation of facts. Discussing facts and information is considered a fundamental free speech right and is not considered medical advice.\u201d okay so by that definition it would be impossible to take medical advice off a non-physician, thanks for making your original comment sound even more stupid! i did not ask for medical advice so no need for your original smart arse comment correct. you should never take medical advice from a non-physician or non-medical provider. not to mention, a $30 camera cannot make a diagnosis, and neither can strangers on the internet from that footage. it is always best to go see a doctor who can learn your medical history, symptoms, and assess you properly based on your concerns. this is in good practice if you ever have ANY questions about your body. be well. No. You cannot take medical advice from a non physician it is impossible by your definition. I never asked for a diagnosis i simply asked if anyone who suffers from cholesteatomas if they thought it may have been concerning as from research and the symptoms i have, it may be related, again just theorising not asking for a diagnosis. No need to be condescending, i know what a doctor is but perhaps consider rational people dont want to visit the doctors, when it may be unneeded, where sick people are and we are in a pandemic and dont wish to waste doctors time if it can be prevented by assessing if we are overreacting which is something the NHS are encouraging. cheers.. if your symptoms are consistent with cholesteatoma, then it definitely warrants a trip to the doctor. they are the only ones who can truly diagnose it and the only treatment is surgery. go take care of yourself. it is worth it. missing the point but good looking out", "After 3 years of surgery ", "Recent diagnosis with a intact timpanic membrane Hi guys, new to reddit so hopefully doing this right!\n\nI had some popping noises in my ear a few months ago then woke up one day and most of my hearing was gone in my right ear and felt blocked. After a few doctors appointments, antibiotics, then steroids, and  a ct scan, the ent specialist told me last week he thinks I have cholesteatoma and I need surgery, he will have to take out the bone in my ear and I will not be able to hear from it again! He said once all heals he might be able to put in a prosthesis and I will have a 70% chance of regaining some hearing. \nApparently I have a strange showing of it in which the timpanic membrane is still intact. Has any one else had this? \nI am really concerned about the prospect of losing my balance as I am an electrician and supposed to be up ladders all day. The other thing I am concerned about is that it is going to present in my good ear and leave me effectively deaf. Reading through the group there seems to be a fair few with it in both ears so I am assuming it is pretty common. \nAnyway I am glad I found this group! Thanks already for helping me understand the disease better Well my understanding is Cholesteatoma is quite rare. My fairly old doctor has only ever encountered two or three and no surgeon in my state, of Australia, has experience with it. I have an even rarer form though. My ear drum is intact, even though I had a skin graft when young, and the ossicles, the little ear bones, have been eroded. I cannot get replacements because my cholesteatoma has damaged the aural nerve. I actually discovered I had it because I had dizzy spells. Although the hearing is gone in my ear I can balance reasonably well, though I find myself a bit tipsy when I turn sharply. If you do lose your hearing, but the aural nerve survives intact you could get anchored bone hearing aid. I would seek out a second opinion before undergoing surgery simply for the fact that they are sure they will remove bones prior to the surgery based only on the CT scan. If they said there was a possiblity I would have more confidence. This might be the best C-toma dr ever and has seen this so many times they know already but in my experience they are never exactly positive what they will encounter until they open up the ear.  In any case a second opinion never hurts and you can still have this first doctor to the surgery if you choose I had a CT done by the ENT who found my cholesteatoma. Then the surgeon who I was referred to had me do a CT at their hospital. The two interpretations of the CTs did not match up, so then I had to have an MRI. I suggest you try to seek a second opinion.", "How did you pick your surgeon? So after a few years of holding off and being in total denial that I need to have this done, I think I am finally ready to schedule a surgery.  I have read posts on here about how so and so is the best surgeon in the posters particular area and I am wondering, where do you find that type of information? I did mine by googling their name. You can see where they graduated from and their credentials. You can also see some of the patients ratings.  I also asked my surgeon how often he did this surgical procedure. My surgeon was doing a surgical procedure 5 times a week, which made me feel like this is his forte!\n\nWishing you the best of luck! My ENT told me he could perform the surgery, but also admitted it was not his specialty.  So I flat out asked him, who is the surgeon that is known in the state to perform this surgery the best ... then I asked the ENT to refer me to him, and he did.  I had an appointment with him, he was friendly and answered all my questions, so I decided to proceed with him.  I also looked up the surgeon, and he is got a lot of credentials and lots of research papers published, so it was clear he knows what he is doing.", "Does a donut pillow help you sleep post surgery? I am about a week post surgery and I am still struggling to get a solid 8 hours of sleep sleeping upright on my back. \n\nI normally sleep on my side (the side I have been operated on on) so I am putting me ear through the gap in a doughnut pillow might help me get back to my normal sleep routine?\n\nI have tried sleeping on my non operated side but I have still got the packing dissolving so I end up waking up feeling really stuffy and uncomfortable. \n\nAny tips? Definitely helps. Donut pillow or the airplane/travel pillow that goes around your neck. So is this to support your head whilst sleeping upright or do you actually lie on it sideways? The airplane pillow sort of works by \u201cholding your head.\u201d Its quite comfy too because you can tilt your head sideways and have support. I highly recommend a wedge pillow to keep you upright for the first 1-2 nights and sleeping on your side (surgery ear up), then switching to double regular pillows after. That is what I did. I am a week post-op right now, and I am just sleeping on my back with my head tilted left (right ear was my operated ear).", "Upcoming surgery So when I was young (3/4yrs old) I had a mastoidectomy and have basically been deaf in my left ear. About 8 months ago I began to have migraines and some facial paralysis. I thought it was my Bells Palsy that cam back. Finally saw a neurologist and got scans done. Turns out a Cholesteotoma has grown deep in my ear and is putting pressure on my facial nerves and is overtaken my cochlea. Also it is causing some pressure and swelling to my brain stem. Dr says it could be a tumor or a Cholesteotoma. Any one have this issue? Craniotomy is also a possibility due to location of the mass. My cholesteatoma is where the ear meets the base of the skull, along with the spine. I went completely deaf in my right ear but did not mention it for a year or two because I was already mostly deaf in that ear so it did not make much difference. The cholesteatoma, which apparently I have had since birth but no one noticed the many times I have had scans due to hearing problems, was discovered when I started losing my sense of balance. Any treatment has been delayed by the fact that it cannot be dealt with where I live and the local specialist cannot discuss it interstate due to travel restrictions. It is apparently very dangerous because removing it could go wrong and damage where my spine meets my skull. If it does not grow more and become threatening I may not even have it removed. I did not know It could damage the facial nerve by itself, only that that was an area of concern if I have surgery. Hey OP, this is exactly what I had too. Facial nerve pain, sometimes the pillow touching it hurt, and I too, thought it was Bell\u2019s palsy for a moment. I waited for my face to droop, never happened so I thought it was weird and got checked. It turned out to be cholesteatoma. I had migraine on the affected side, and behind my eyeball. Some facial pains/stiffness. I had surgery two years ago, and all this has been resolved. Thankfully have not had a migraine and facial pain/stiffness since!. Wishing you the best of luck!", "One day before the operation Tomorrow around 8am I will be having a operation(cholesteatoma). I have currently headache.

I just woke up again with bad pain. Got To wait an hour for pain pills lol It is tough. Hang in there! Currently 5 days post surgery and the pain still coming and going. Yeah bro, it really is lol. I hope you are feeling better damn. I have popped like over 25 norco pain pills this week man. Only cause I had no choice... Doc gave me ibuprofen to reduce the use of norco. It is going ok; my tongue is still numb and everything tastes just a bit off so that sucks.

I dont go for a check up till sep 7th. Did you also get titanium implants to replace your bones that were eroded or no? No plates. Honestly not too sure all that went down. Doc did not talk to me much after because I was super nauseous from the anesthesia. Learning more this week \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc When I came home from the hospital, I threw up once after that I did not feel nauseous anymore. For some reason, for this ear surgery I did feel pretty nauseous. Woke up this morning feeling pretty decent man.

It was brutal last week though, did not expect that I had pain 1 time after surgery idk maybe your doctor Is not the best... Nah, hes a specialist and at one of the best hospitals. I am not sure lol. Maybe u got told wrong mah boy lmao Probably not. Either way I am pretty good now Hey! Yes 4 weeks post op and first two weeks were horrendous! Gets better though!", "ear pressure visited a specialist to have my ear checked as my ear felt blocked and I thought it was wax, they said it was not wax and it could potentially be a cholesteatoma after further inspection but that i would need to be referred to ENT through my GP. i have now been referred to ENT but due to covid obviously it will not be a priority. currently cannot hear very well out my left ear and I feel a lot of pressure in my ear like it is blocked. it could be a longtime before my appointment, should I be worried? You will likely need multiple appointments leading up to any procedure, so I would recommend starting sooner than later if it is something bothering you. It really depends how long \"a while\" is, like holding off a month probably will not make a huge difference but i would not want to wait more than that. My otologists schedule has not been impacted by covid whatsoever, maybe you can find another doctor that can see you sooner. That is interesting. I came in because my ear was blocked. They could not see what it was so they did a surgery to open the ear and drill out the canal. Upon cutting the skin they found the keratin debris and signs of cholesteatoma so they cleared it out. I was not even told what it was. I read it on my app afterwards and came here. I am on day 4 of recovery so we will see what else needs to happen but I got my surgery within 3 weeks after a five minute ent visit. \n\nI do not know if you should be worried or not but after reading about this stuff it is hard not to be. I would ask for a ct scan at least. My doc said he regretted not doing one. Damn! sorry to hear about that! how are you feeling now? I am still waiting on an appointment to have my ear checked since I last posted this... the feeling in my ear is still really weird I am alright for the most part. The surgery was pretty uneventful recovery wise. It helped with all the pressure I was having though. Hopefully you can get yours checked soon. Really recommend sinus rinsing frequently to help the drainage process of your eustachian tubes.  It has helped me keep the pain and pressure manageable.", "20 yrs post-op A question for everyone who is had the surgery and lived with it for a long time afterward. I have weird ventilation and a lot of popping in that ear. I also have a deviated septum on that side that exacerbates things. what kinds of symptoms have all of you noticed in the years after getting the surgery? I just came back from the doctor and hear mine came back... The last surgery was in 1999, I was 8 years old. I also retained 70% of my hearing. I am afraid it will be worse this time around, though.\n\nThe doctor could see my eardrum being pulled in, that was reason to get a CT. I am now getting an MRI for good measure. But it definitely needs to get operated.\n\nDefinitely get it checked. Sorry to hear! I went to the doc last week and my eardrum looked normal. \n\nWhat were/are your symptoms? I am glad that yours looks good. It is been such a long time for me I thought it would be gone forever. My symptoms were pretty much non existent but I had a severely clogged ear canal that needed to be cleaned out. The wax was also dark yellow and watery. After they cleaned up they saw loose skin which was reason to believe it came back. A clogged canal or Eustachian tube?\n\nDid you initially have congenital or acquired cholesteatoma?

My umami taste bud never has been damaged since my original ear drum injury at 8yrs. I have never met another person with a c-Toma or messed up taste.", "Hi,I am new here. I just found out two days ago that I have a cholesteatoma in my right ear. I have been trying not to panic,but I am having a hard time wrapping my head around all of this and getting used to the symptoms. I go to an ent in ten days to find out more and I guess discuss surgery. Just wanted to say I am really happy that this group is here,I think I have read almost every post like a psycho. If there is any information or advice you have for dealing with all of this I am all ears. Hey! I definitely felt the same way when I first found out about my cholesteatoma back in July. I was frivolously searching for anything and everything, hoping for the best prognosis imaginable.\n\nDefinitely not healthy! Just take it one day at a time until your appointment, get the surgery and get that cholesteatoma out of your ear! \n\nI was diagnosed in July, got the surgery in September, and just went for my most recent follow-up last Thursday. I have recovered pretty well and my hearing feels slightly better than pre-surgery, I have to get a routine check-up and MRI next summer to check for recurrence but I am glad that I went through with it and I am in a better place now with my ear. Yeah it is probably not the healthiest going on an information binge,I just get bad anxiety but you are right about taking it day by day. As nervous as I am I definitely cannot wait to get this thing out! Like the sooner the better honestly. Can you tell me a little more about yours? I am mostly concerned with how much has been damaged already. I have no idea how long it is been there or anything. It makes me feel better that your hearing is a little better than it was before though,obviously loss of hearing is something I have been a little bummed about. I was diagnosed back in June and had my surgery a couple weeks ago. I certainly had the same anxieties. As far as the surgery, it was not that bad and mine apparently was pretty extensive as the operation took 7 hrs (canal wall up mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty, prosthetic put in). But the pain was not bad and I feel pretty good two weeks later. My surgery did result in quite a decrease in hearing because my hearing was virtually unaffected prior to the surgery, and having my ossicles removed obviously impacted the hearing. But it is not like I am completely deaf in the ear, and the hearing will improve as the packing dissolves and the ear drum heals. \n\nSince my hearing was so good to start out with, my surgeon opted for a canal wall up to try to preserve as much hearing as possible. Admittedly I am a bit nervous because apparently the recurrence rate is higher with a canal wall up, so the thought of it coming back sucks but if everything goes perfect going forward and I do not have a recurrence and gain back some more hearing, honestly I would say the whole experience was not too bad even though I was really scared at initial diagnosis. \n\nAll that being said, apparently mine was caught early so it had not really done much damage yet. Yup! My cholesteatoma was found after I went to the ER for something completely unrelated. I will spare you the details and say I got into a pretty nasty fist fight. But prior to that, I really did not have any severe symptoms, except tinnitus and diminished hearing.\n\nAfter I spoke with my doctor, she could not really tell me how long it had been there but she mentioned it was possible that it had been there my whole life. In my case, the growth was confined to the middle ear and the ossicles so it had not done any damage to the mastoid or the inner ear. Apparently, I had lost about 40% of my hearing in the affected ear, my left. My initial prognosis was that my doctor would have to remove 2 out of the 3 hearing bones.\n\nI was able to have endoscopic ear surgery to get it removed (this may not be possible in every case) so my doc did not have to cut me open but pre-surgery, she mentioned that her priority was to eradicate the c-toma so she said that if she had to, she would make the incision and clean the ear out. However, when I woke up from surgery: 1) there was no need for that and my doctor was able to get it all out through my ear canal and 2) I actually only needed 1 hearing bone replaced with a prosthesis instead of 2.\n\nMy surgery removed the cholesteatoma, replaced a hearing bone and repaired my ear drum. Immediately out of surgery, my hearing was reduced severely (due to the packing they will put in and the general physical trauma of surgery) I could still hear but definitely hit family and friends with \"WHAT?\" quite often haha.\n\nWeek 1 was not too bad, it was all about pain management at this point and the ear draining, I took the prescribed medication but tbh, over the counter pain killers will do the trick just fine.\n\nWeeks 2-4 were probably the strangest because your ear will go through a lot of changes. My ears popped a lot, the tinnitus was really loud and I would get the occasional sharp pain in the ear but my hearing did slowly improve in that timeframe. It is important to take it easy this first month in terms of physical activity.\n\nEdit: I was also using ear drops during this first month, my prescription was for 21 days, 5 drops in the ear every day.\n\nWeeks 4-8 were pretty non-bothersome, it was mostly my ear popping but that eventually stopped and I regained most of my hearing during this time and it is where I am at now. I still have tinnitus but it is gotten much better compared to week 3 where it was almost unbearable. \n\n* Almost forgot to mention - the only thing that does suck is having to shower with a cotton ball in your ear and not letting water get in there, I just got the clear to not have to do this anymore on Thursday.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, my last appointment went great, I did another hearing test and this actually improved compared to my hearing levels pre-surgery and I do not have to go back until next summer to have it checked out. \n\nAssuming all goes well, I would only have to go once a year to have this checked but I have been able to get back to my normal routine and I really do not feel that much different now than before, my hearing is still very strong and I do not need hearing aids at this time so I am glad I went through with it and that I was able to preserve my hearing.\n\nThat was really long but I hope that puts you at ease! Thank you so much for your response! The longer the better haha. Also same here,went to the hospital assuming it was just an ear infection and freaked a bunch of doctors out lmao. I am glad that the surgery went so well for you! I think I will feel a lot better after my appointment Tuesday just so I can find out like how bad it is and what the plan is to fix it. Just ready to get it over with you know? Even though I know trying to take it easy during the recovery time is going to be the worst part. \ud83d\ude2d Anyway the tinnitus has been driving me crazy,constant ringing &amp; occasionally I am hearing my heart really loud too which is super annoying. It will be so nice to not hear it anymore. Thanks so much for responding! Hearing from other people who have been through this helps a lot. That is a really long surgery! I think I am most nervous about a mastoidectomy as far as the surgery goes so it is a relief to hear it was not that bad. Also nervous about the canal wall down thing because does not that mean you cannot swim anymore? Sorry if that is a dumb question but I love swimming. I hope everything stays good for you and you will be able to regain some of your hearing! I am scared they will need to remove my ossicles. \ud83d\ude2d it is crazy,you would think since you have two ears it really would not be that big of a deal to not be able to hear very well out of one but man if it has not been an adjustment.", "Question Anyone have like orangish drainage from incision 2 weeks out from surgery?

After meeting with a surgeon it sounds like I will have two surgeries.  One tympanomastoidectomy and another one 4 months after to check if it has come back and put in some prosthetic hearing bones.  \n\nHonestly I am more concerned about waiting 3-4 months than the surgery itself.  For the people out there who have gone through this - I am curious how much you saw your symptoms change over the time leading up to your surgery?  Right now things are not too bad so long as I do a lot of sinus rinsing, flonase, and keep my ear clean.  Quality of life is not too bad - just afraid of what it may become if things progress.  \n\nWhat advice to people have for treating symptoms until I get the darn thing removed?  Thanks - your help is greatly appreciated. If they were that worried. They can fit you into emergency surgery. You have most likely lived with this for awhile, they do not really pop up over night. So I am sure just hanging in there and will be fine. I waited 4 months before they did my first one?? I am a lucky duck and have them in both ears...one is on the books for May. But we are hoping IVF works.. and we will post pone it. I waited six months after my CT scan that found significant destruction in my ear canal, complete dissolution of hearing bones, and damage between my middle ear and brain. That was the soonest I could get an appointment for surgery. I was put on antibiotics, ear drops and nasal steroids to help reduce risk, and stayed on them between the combined approach tympanoplasty and second look. Waiting did not end up changing anything long term for me, just some extra prescription copays. 3-4 months. I would love to even have an estimate when mine could be fixed. Mine was diagnosed 16 months ago. Before I could have surgery the experts have to decide what to do and the specialist handling my case has been unable to even discuss it with his colleagues because of quarantine and travel restrictions. If the doctor felt it was a risk, they would never let you wait so long. If it was urgent, you would have emergency surgery. IMO it is never been urgent and I have had about 18 ops for recurring cholesteatoma.\n\nPlease only follow your doctors advice.

Does your little guy get frequent ear infections? Not since he had tubes put in. He did have multiple before the tubes. His tubes are currently on their way out. I find it odd cholesteatoma could be possible now, since he had the tube surgery a year ago. But maybe it is congenital. I have a congenital cholesteatoma that was only discovered a few years ago but evidently I have had since birth. It is where the ear meets the skull behind my ear. I had tubes as a child and gradual hearing loss in my teens that was attributed to Menieres disease. That diagnoses was also an explanation for bouts of dizziness that I can now attribute to the cholesteatoma eroding the ossicles.

Any help is much appreciated xx", "Third (and hopefully final) surgery done! Looking through this sub prior had some helpful info, so I just wanted to leave my experience here for the record in case anyone has any questions down the road!\n\nI had chronic ear problems as a kid, infections, tubes, the usual. After my last ear problem at about 14, I stopped going to the ent, and thought I was done with that stuff. Had some hearing loss in my left ear but never thought much of it. \n\nFast forward to my second year of college (4 years ago now), started to have even more hearing loss, ear started bleeding, went in and turned out I had a cholesteatoma, but very small. Partly the ENT did not properly convey how serious it was (and partly because I was a stupid teen still) I waited. \n\nSo then two years I remember I have this thing, can barely hear, finally get to a surgeon and find out the cholestatoma has grown and eroded virtually all of my incus, and some of my stapes. I have two surgeries, one to remove the mass, and one to reconstruct the bones. (Canal wall up)\n\nFirst surgery was awful, worst I have ever felt with nausea and vomiting afterwards. Second surgery they were a little more aggressive with the anti-nausea in my anesthesia, and I felt almost perfectly fine afterwards (apart from the pain around my ear where they made the incision). \n\nThen about a year ago I go see another ENT because of even more hearing loss, and it turns out I had a recurrence. By this point I would moved to a city with a more practiced ENT surgeon, and yesterday had my canal wall down surgery to eliminate this nonsense hopefully once and for all. Now I sit here typing all this on some good painkillers. \n\nSome advice I have:\n\nDo not wait to take care of this. Yes, it is a slow growing issue, but the longer it is in there the more damage it can cause, and nothing (at this point) can truly replace native bone should you need reconstruction. \n\nMake sure to talk to your surgeon about all the options, and pros/cons about things like canal wall up and down. My first ENT wanted to try canal wall up, since it leaves you with a normal ear, but never mentioned (I did not ask) that recurrence is much higher (around 30%). Had I known that then I might have just opted for the canal wall down. There is no difference in hearing improvement according to research, just the inconvenience of a doctor visit every year forever. \n\nAfter your surgery take it reeeaal slow. I felt almost like normal the day of my second surgery, well enough that I thought I could get away with eating a regular dinner. Big mistake. You should not be particularly hungry anyways, but I recommend just eating light food such as crackers (or softer foods), and sipping water no matter how thirsty you are. \n\nAnd above all, do not worry too much about it. Surgery like this is pretty routine, and as long as you have a good doctor everything will work out fine. Thank you for your information. My seven year old is about to have his first surgery for a possible cholesteatoma. Thursday we have a \u201csecond opinion\u201d appointment just to make sure our primary ENT is pointing is in the right direction. Thank you for sharing your experience!  Its contributions like these that makes this forum a useful source of information (and hopefully comfort) for those going through the same experience.  I do have a question though - how is your hearing now?\n\nI had my first surgery roughly 5 months ago (canal wall up) where they removed the cholesteatoma and what was left of parts of my damaged hearing bones.  So I cannot hear out of the affected ear, but also have a continual loud tinnitus like ringing in that hear (presumably because the nerve has nothing connected to it?)\n\nI am now waiting for the second stage surgery, where I believe they will check for any re-occurrence, and if all looks good they will reconnect the ocular chain to restore hearing in the affected ear.  What I do not know is what the success rate is of this surgery in terms of restoring hearing, and getting rid of the annoying ringing.\n\nWhat was the end result for you? Yeah of course! So unfortunately I do not know if I can give an accurate estimate of my hearing because of my situation. I did end up having the two surgeries you are having right now. My hearing was pretty bad before the first surgery (50% loss), was maybe slightly worse as far as I could tell in the gap between surgeries, and then I believe the hearing test I had 6 months after the second surgery showed my damaged left ear to within 80% of my normal right ear. I did not have a full chain reconstruction, just an incus prosthesis. \n\nHowever I did end up having this apparently massive recurrence, so there is no telling when that would have started to affect my hearing, and since hearing can take upwards of a year to fully stabilize and recover, I do not know whether if I ever reached my full potential so to speak. \n\nAs for how my hearing is right *now*, I cannot really hear much due to all the gauze in my ear canal :p \nBut my surgeon said the surgery was very successful so he is hopeful for strong hearing recovery (though it will never be as good as my other ear, especially after 3 surgeries).\n\nAs for the ringing, I am really sorry to hear about that. I never experienced anything like that except for when it was healing in the weeks post-op. There is this supposedly excellent technique for temporarily getting rid of tinnitus that makes the rounds on reddit ever so often, definitely try it if you have not already. \n\nAs for general surgery success rates, I found a study that was pretty informative comparing canal wall down/up improvement rates (finding that there is not any), although it was from 98. This surgery has been really standard for a long time afaik so it should still give good baselines. I will see if I can find it again and post it here.", "Loss of taste I had it for my first meal after surgery then lost it, how long did you guys lose your sense of taste? You might get your zinc level checked.  Optimal level is 100.  Zinc deficiency can result in loss of taste.\n\nMy sense of taste was affected for about a month after surgery.  It takes a while for all the anesthesia drugs to work out of the system. Post surgery of cholesteatoma, i never experienced loss of taste... You better check you doctor, it is a sign of  facial nerve malfunction which controls muscles of **facial** expression, and functions in the conveyance of taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat is the reason why during ear surgery they use a facial nerve monitoring device, our ear parts is so minute and microscopic, there are nerve endings that might be hit during surgery. I had my follow up, he says it could take months for it to come back. No loss of taste for me.  Although its been 2 months since my surgery, and for some strange reason, everything tastes salty (in the past few days).  I am guessing its probably something not related to the surgery.", "Anyone else unable to feel their ear after surgery? I had surgery a week ago, now I cannot feel my ear at all. Doctor said this would go away eventually. Just wondering if anyone else has had this experience? I would guess that most people have either partial or total anesthesia/hypoesthesia (numbness) of the ear after surgery, because of the damage the retroauricular incision has on the great auricular nerve. Most cases it resolves in a few months, some may keep a minor residual hypoesthesia for life. Do not worry, though, you will feel just fine either way! It is completely normal, the feeling will eventually return. I have had the surgery twice. Yes feeling does come back slowly :) A lot of the feeling comes back but for me the top of the ear feels slightly numb more than a year since my last surgery, compared to my normal ear. Not that I notice it really. Yes, very normal. Feeling will come back in few days to a couple weeks. Just had my second surgery a week ago, parts of my ear are numb, especially behind it/in front of my scar. It can take a while but the feeling comes back eventually It is been about 6 months for me and my ear is still numb. I had surgery a couple of years ago. My ear is still numb, and I might not ever get the feeling fully back. It is not too far fetch considering they had to sever some of nerves in order to get to the cyst when taking it out. It might heal, or it may not.", "This works for my tinnitus Hi. I found this video on youtube called \u201c4 hours of high pitched tinnitus neuromodulation therapy that works\u201d and it helps alot. \n\nI just listen to this for like 2-5 mins while preparing for bed and it gives me a break so i can fall asleeps.

I am more pissed off than scared. I just hope to God this does not cause an infection. Update for future reference: I teledoc'd and ENT and he assured me that all will be fine as long as I keep taking my antibiotics as prescribed. He told me to leave the hairs in, do not take them out. Yeah man, it will be fine", "Post cholesteatoma and flying Has anyone had any trouble with flying on a plane post op? I have had my tympanoplasty in 2009 but I have never been on a plane before. I am asking because I get dizzy real quick and I was tested in a hospital for nystagmus and I had it after being spun in a chair fo 60 seconds (worst 60 seconds in my life). I get car sick if the road is wavy and I was once in an elevator that got to the 40th floor in 13 seconds and I was so dizzy and sick after I got out. \nI am hoping you could help me with providing some answers around flying with this condition in general. \nThank you! I have been waiting nearly two years since my diagnoses for any idea when, or even if, I will have surgery, but one thing I have been told is that when I have the surgery I will be unable to fly for at least three months, or even take a boat home, meaning I will be stuck in the city where I have the surgery. This is what I\u2018ve been told although that might be for a normal cholesteatoma in the ear whereas mine is unusual. Post surgery elevation changes, and any flights, have been a non-issue for me. I had a combined approach tympanoplasty with reconstruction of ossicular chain. I have completely lost feeling in my surgery ear due to complete eardrum replacement though. I am so sorry to hear that. I hope you have your surgery soon. I was on a cruise ship in Barcelona 2 years ago, and let me tell you, I was throwing up so much and they had to give me a pill that immediately put me to sleep. Sorry to hear that, I have lost my hearing in my left ear, not completely but I have trouble hearing people if they are on my left side. I notice that I have tinitus sometimes but I do not hear it very well. I hope I will be able to fly without any issues. Hey, I had my surgery last year, and the surgeon/ENT told me I could fly after 1.5/2 months post op\n\nHad no troubles during the flight and other ones I took after that Hi! Thank you for your input. I hope I will not have any trouble when time comes. I have been on many international flights post my surgery. There was one flight with a sudden altitude drop that did cause some temporary pain, but no permanent damage. My ENT recommended that I use a few squirts of Afrin in my nose before takeoff and landing to make sure the Eustachian tubes are clear, and I do that on every flight now.", "A great video showing how your hearing works ", "Taste buds It appears the majority of people have issues with their taste buds after this kind of surgery.\n\nI am curious to see how long it took to resolve in most people?  It has not even been a week for me and I am already going nuts trying to figure out which foods are not going to taste weird.\n\nI confess I am NOT a very patient person in general, so that is likely factoring in to my frustration. It is been 4 weeks for me and I still Do not have taste on the upper-right side of my tongue, I just eat on the left side \ud83d\ude02 Mine seem to be coming and going.  Last night I had pizza and it was NOT as enjoyable as it always has been in the past.  But then I just had some chocolate and it tasted mostly the same.  The right side of my tongue sort of feels burnt, but also sort of tingles.\n\nThings like tomato sauce or spicy things seem to create a burning/stinging sensation.\n\nI am trying not to freak out at the idea that this could be permanent but I am terrified it is. I think you are good dude your taste will come back, It does not bother me at all, same with the hearing loss and tinnitus because the way I see it this is much better than what would happen If I just let the cholesteatoma keep growing. I feel lucky They caught it in time before it affected my balance or meningitis Yeah, I mean I keep telling myself meningitis would have been a bitch for sure.   Mostly I just want to enjoy pizza again! \n\nI guess I just have to give it time....  (I admit I am not an incredibly patient person, and I am more than a little irrationally annoyed at my body for doing this lol) I never feel like I lost the taste, It just changed. On the afflicted side it sometimes tastes metallic. According to my doc my sense of taste has been weak on that side for quite some while before the surgery, and my body had just adapted to it. I never noticed any issues before the diagnosis/surgery.\n\nIn fact, other than a slight increase in frequency of ear infections and some unexplained bouts of vertigo, I had no noticeable symptoms whatsoever.\n\nYou are right though.  I have not lost taste, but it has changed considerably for now at least.  It is hard to describe.  Sometimes I think it is getting better and then other times I feel like it is never going to go back to what it was.\n\nI guess it is simply going to take time.  Either it will settle down or I will adapt.  I just need to be patient.  (Not my strong suit at all) It has been six years since my surgery, just sayin'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou should prepared that your sense of taste may never fully recover. If it does, than that is great! Ugh.\n\nWell a taste test of Rocky Road ice cream suggests that things on the left side of my mouth are mostly normal.\n\nBut yeah Im seriously hoping it recovers!! i hope so too. \n\nYou will probably get used to it after a while. Just make sure to let your dentist know about this. It can mess with your teeth. Great.  My teeth are already shit!\n\nUgh.  All I want out of life is to enjoy pizza again! \ud83d\ude02 I have had 4 surgeries. Metallic taste for an hour or two after at the most. Nothing lasting. Took about 4-6 weeks for taste to return on the impacted side for me I had no change to my taste, maybe in the first few hours after surgery I had a metallic one but nothing after that. How strange! Ironically, after my griping, we went out to dinner tonight and it seemed fine!  Who knows??  Lol I just had my taste nerve removed as well. How can it mess with your teeth? It can mess up your mouth if ou only chew on one side, which is not uncommon if you are only able to sense taste on one side.\n\n\u00abIt is generally accepted that chewing on one side has potential damaging effect on temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Habitual chewing side syndrome often causes plaque accumulation on the other side which leads to tooth decay and gum and periodontal diseases.\u00bb\n( Same here. Started to get better after some 4 weeks and by week 6 tastebuds were okay again. It is been 10 weeks since my surgery and my taste is still very dull and strange on my right side. My doctor said that sometimes the taste buds never go back to normal. It is rare but it does happen It is been 6 months since my surgery and I have just accepted that chewing on the left side is the way to go if I want to taste anything. The back right of my tongue does not necessarily taste weird, but I cannot feel it when chewing and there is no taste there. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Mine have mostly returned to normal in the last several days.  There are still a few things that are weird - toast for instance still tastes slightly off in a way I cannot put my finger on.\n\nBut pizza has started tasting good again which was my primary concern! \ud83d\ude02 I know this is late, but I had my mastoidectomy w/tympanoplasty in January and the taste/some muscle movement on my left side still has not fully come back. Weird, but I guess recovery is different for everyone *Most* of mine has come back, but certain things still taste slightly odd.  I may just have to get used to it.  \ud83d\ude15 Yeah I have just gotten used to chewing on my right side haha but now I am due for surgery on my right ear in 2 weeks so I guess I will not taste anything now hahaha Oh noes!  My surgery was on my right side and certain foods are back to normal but others still taste off.  Like I burnt my tongue.  I am hoping it returns 100% eventually.  I would say it is probably 95% now ?\n\nI am hoping I never have to have the surgery again! Yeah I had two cholesteatomas, the left was about 15mm and the right is 12mm! I am kind of looking forward to getting the right taken out so I can be rid of this nasty infection. Oh 95% is not bad, but not great haha hopefully it will return 100% soon", "Cyst Sucking ", "my son is going to have his third timpanoplasty this year and... hi! Im lees mom, and Lee is 17. Lee is having his third timpanoplasty this summer. Lee has alot of mental health issues so i havent explained to him what this surgery may look like.. obviously i will explain this and allow my 17 year old to have choices. Thing is he doesnt make great choices... we feel alone an scared. reading some of these posts make me despair more(no offense they are great posts but my nerves are triggered. )So lee had a timpanoplasty in 2019. In 2020 we were supposed to rebuild his ear canal. Insterad the choletetoma had come back. So they were going to rebuild this March 2021  but we put it off in event he had another big bad surgery with no fruit. They are saying they want to do a canal wall down, perhaps if the cholestetoma came back. They think it may have come back. My heart is breaking. Ok... so all Lee has now is hearing loss in that ear. He has about ten-25  percent of his hearing in that ear currently/ :(. What else that sucks can we expect from a canal wall down. Hewll have to get ear drained? how often? hell have permanant pain? What happens if we just dont deal with this..... \n\nWhat is the difference between a canal wall down and a canal wall up?\n\n Is there anything we can do besides removing part of or all of Lee's ear drum if he still has a cholestetoma? has anybody done anything besides a canal wall up or down to fix a reoccurring cholesteatoma ?\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What is the prognosis.if Lee has a canal wall down? Will his ear drum be able to be saved? is it true he will have to have his ear drained several times a year? how often? Can he go swimming and submerge his head after he is done recovering from a canal wall down?\n\n:/ I had a canal wall down about 6 weeks ago, he also rebuilt my ossicular chain with a graft from my ear, in my experience the surgery went well I could not believe it was done and I only had to take pain pills for like 1 to 2 days after surgery, now here is the actual hard part; recovery. He will go home with stuffing in his ear and big bandage on his head, I left my bandage on a couple more days than recommended, recovery is going to be troublesome for your son depending on his mental issues because he will need a fresh cottonball in his ear for AT LEAST the first 2-4 weeks because the ear constantly drains, he cannot sleep on that ear for about 2-4 weeks (I made a pillow wall on my right side so I would not roll onto my ear in my sleep). Also he cannot pick at his ear or scratch the inside ( it gets real itchy about when you need to clean it) he cannot let water enter his ear so either a showercap or cottonball with vaseline covering it, also be gentle when cleaning the incision especially, it sounds scary but its just a long annoying recovery, and one last thing my doctor told me I cannot submerge my head swimming and allow my ear to fill with water for the rest of my life because it will cause vertigo and that is dangerous while swimming obviously (they make caps and earplugs for that) and yes he will have to get his ear suctioned once or twice a month the rest of his life. I know it sounds daunting but if you let cholesteatoma go it can lead to chronic vertigo and meningitis. You and your son got this! They give you a pamphlet and I am sure will answer all your questions plus the doctor will need you to come back in every 2 weeks for about the first 2 months to change the stuffing and they check out the ear in that process.\n\nEdit: my wording was a little confusing, yes he will be able to submerge his head swimming but only if you have an ear plug in or a cap that you know will keep the water out I had a canal wall down then had a revision after reoccurance, the recovery isnt too bad. Its amazing when you finally get the stuffing pulled out of your ear. Post op i had regular check ups and ear suctioning. But i am now only have to be seen once a year. You cant get water in your ear so invest in good ear plugs or just avoid putting your head under water.  All in all my life is much better now after my ops than it was living with cholesteatoma. I had canal wall down in December 2020, and then I had to have a follow up surgery in March 2021. Everything went fine. Just 2 weeks with the annoying wrap around bandages but honestly the pain was very manageable with just hydrocodone. All pain was gone in a week. He left in the bandages inside the ear for 3 weeks.", "Has anyone had facial weakness/paralysis post removal? I had cholesteatomas in both ears many years ago. I was 8 or 9 when I had my first surgeries, then another round when I was about 12 after they came back. \n\nThe nerves in the right side of my face had already deteriorated pretty severely when the cholesteatomas were first removed, so part of my second set of surgeries involved grafting a nerve from my left leg onto my face. For months after that, I could not talk without a lisp, drink through a straw, or even blink my right eye. \n\nThough I have improved a lot since then, I am still not satisfied with my appearance, or the function in the right side of my face.  My mouth and eye are still weak on that side; I cannot smile or move my eyebrow properly. I struggled with this a lot through my teens, and it is impacted my life and my mental health a lot. I felt ugly and disconnected, like I did not own my body. I feel like I would have turned out to be a very different person if I had not had to deal with the facial paralysis. I am 25 now, and I worry that 13 years has been too long a wait to say something about it to my doctor, and I do not even know what my options would be. \n\nIs this something other people in this sub have dealt with? How has it impacted you and how have you dealt with it? Hey! I am so sorry to know you feel this way. I am now 32 and since I was 17 I have a mild muscle weakness on the left side of my face, increasing my nasolabial fold, as well as other asymmetries on the face. But you should definitely check for your alternatives, since this have such a big impact on your life. Another thing is, consider talking about it to someone. A professional therapist, preferably!

It was really nice to find this group because there is not a lot out there in the way of being able to talk about this stuff.\n\n18 months ago I had a mastoidectomy on my left ear. I wish it had been picked up sooner, but the cholesteatoma that was removed had worn away some hearing bones, so my left ear is pretty much deaf now.\n\nA few days ago, my surgeon performed an atticotomy on my right ear, to get rid of another small cholesteatoma that we had picked up very early due to regular check ups. \n\nThe shit thing now is that, while my right ear recovers from the surgery, I am basically deaf. I think there is some packing inside my ear (feels pretty stuffy) that has to be removed at some point.\n\nHow long after surgery did your hearing come back? Was it gradual or did it come rushing back at some moment? You will only lose your hearing if they take the hearing bones out, I thought? You probably will not be able to hear with the cotton over your ear but after that it should be able to hear? Idk but I am wishing u a speedy recovery man I have a page on Instagram   If you would like to tell your story over there as well. Ok, so I met my surgeon today (6 days after the op) and he suctioned out a lot of \u201cgel foam\u201d and \u201cpacking\u201d and the hearing immediately got a lot better. Not how it was prior to surgery but pretty close. He said it will improve as time passes because there is still a bit of fluid in the middle ear. That is a bit of a relief!", "I need help. I have not gotten checked out by anyone.\n\nLittle over two weeks ago I suddenly woke up with this pain in my right ear and right side of my jaw. My ear was tolerable and I could hear just fine, but I could hardly open my mouth to speak or eat anything. Around two days later and the pain is gone. I did not take any pain killers or anything, just the pain had dissappeared. My jaw was/is fine, but since then my right ear has this clogged feeling, like it is constantly blocked but I can hear just fine. Although, since then a smelly, yellow kind of liquid has been coming out of my ear. I thought I would just give it more time since it seems to be healing on its own. But, to this day there is still a little clogging feeling inside my right ear, very little. And no more liquid coming out of my ear, but if I pick it, it is still there. \nNo hearing loss, no pain, no dizzyness,  no facial muscles damaged, my taste is perfectly fine, but the little clog and smelly yellow, I will call it earwax? is still there.

Like it eating away at my brain! Jesus. But, I am hoping someone can help me. I really do not want it to be cholesteatoma, because I am deathly afraid of surgery. Hospitals in general. But, if these are the symptoms I will get it checked by my family doctor and stop being a wuss. You might just have the normal kind if you have a discharge. If there are no other symptoms then you can get it looked at before anything bad happens. My experience is not normal but I never had a smelly discharge because mine is further in. The facial nerve damage does not appear due to cholesteatoma I believe, but is a risk when the Tumour is removed. See the doc. First step is a course of antibiotics and taking a look at your ear. It is most likely you have an ordinary infection and no cholesteatoma. Be honest about how the medical stuff freaks you out, there are options for people who need a valium before procedures, or to take someone they trust in with them,  or even sedation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso I am going to be blunt, for just about all medical situations  the best way to avoid the need for serious interventions is to seek care early  for minor problems.", "It is back My Ctoma is back and I find out on Friday how much it is grown.

Daily symptoms are leakage(Now bloody) 15-20% decreased hearing. Itchy ear from leakage most likely. \n\nFuck sake.", "When is it an emergency? Hi, all! I was told by my ENT that I have a possible cholesteatoma in my right ear. I have an appointment with an otologist in about 10 days. I have had undiagnosed sinus and ear issues my whole life that were always brushed off as just allergies. My ear drums are significantly retracted and I can feel a large bump behind my right ear. The right side of my head feels an intense pressure and I have constant tinnitus and headaches now. My hearing has gone down significantly and my right ear is especially bad.. I am often confused and my short term memory is almost nonexistent at this point. These symptoms continue to be considered non emergent but all day today I have had zero relief which brings me to my question.\n\nAt what point do symptoms become severe enough to be considered emergent? What do I need to look for? I feel like the internet gives very basic symptoms and mine all feel worse than they ever have. \n\nBonus question: anyone else have both ear drums severely retraced but only have 1 possible cholesteatoma? I have yet to get any answers as to why both of my ear drums are so retracted. \n\nThanks in advance! I am surprised your ENT did not refer you to a surgeon, that is how my process went. Obviously I am no doctor but I would contact your local hospital or university hospital otolaryngology depot and tell them you have a cholesteatoma.   Get a CT referral from your ENT and a hearing test from an audiologist and bring both results with you. My university practice had an audiologist on site. \n\nWith the CT of your mastoid the surgeon  can see how much damage has been done. Sorry should have clarified-- my ENT did refer me to an otologist that performs surgery on these types of things. I had a CT done back in August 2021 but it was really basic and barely shows anything. I do have a copy of that and my most recent audio already faxed to the new Dr.  I just feel like that headaches everyday and the memory issues have been getting worse and worse by the day, and I just do not know if I am overreacting to the sudden onset of these headaches or if this is something truly abnormal. Do you think you have an ear infection? My cholesteatoma removal got put off for a year due to the pandemic and over the summer I got insanely dizzy and thought it was killing me. I went to the ER and turns out it was just a dumb ear infection. I was demanding a CT in the ER I was so sure I had gotten meningitis but they did not give me one and just took one look at my ear and said obvious infection, here is some anti biotics. Oohh good question. I am on that same level right now. But to go demand an MRI or something \ud83d\ude02. I will ask my normal ENT on Monday if it is possible. Thanks for that. I do feel a lot better knowing it at least could just be a regular infection!", "Ok how the HECK do I wash my hair  Johnson's Baby Shampoo or similar. Sit on a stool, keep your head tilted and ask someone to gently soak and wash your hair for you. You stand still and hold a clean cloth against your cut. Use a hairdryer after.

I used not your mother's dry shampoo for a week. It was on because I was off from work and have short hair. LOL.  Good luck. Cup over your ear or buy the little ear caps (like shower caps) and Vaseline on the cotton ball. Change it when you get out and give it a light blowdry so the ear stays dry. It is a pain but you figure it out! Ah yes... now the fun part starts! I always had to try and tape a waterproopf band aid (one of them big see through ones) over my ear and just tilt my head stdeways since the waterproof band aid does not really work that well because of the hair, but it still prevents  a great deal of water from getting absorbed in the cotton in your ear if you were to accidentally spray some water there. Just make sure that the wound is dry befor you put the bandage back on after you are done washing your hair. Btw my advice would be not to put anything in your ear as it has to breathe.\nI used to put in cotton as well but after some dude from this group recommended me to take it out I felt much better.\nIt has to breathe once again there is vacuum formed when you have it in your ears.\nIf it is leaking let it leak Hey have a nice recovery. Your post op looks really fine! Best wishes! Are you feeling well enough to go to the salon? You can hold something over it while they wash it, I am a stylist and I did this.

Im worried about it catching in the staples and also anything getting wet so I think I might just not wash it for as long as I can get away with it. It was definitely difficult at first but you will find a way to make it work for you!

They removed the Cholesteatoma and implanted a titanium \"bone\" in place of the eroded ones. I have a lot of bloody drainage. They also vacuumed out my other ear and I can hear better out of that one now. I am still on good drugs and trying to chill and relax.  Do you have any nausea? Do they have any follow up surgeries scheduled? No did not have any nausea.  I do have a slight sore throat.  No future surgeries scheduled yet. Just a follow up appointment in 6 weeks. Sore throat is expected since they intubated you for general anesthesia.. get well soon.. Thank you for posting as I have been offered an operation like this. I am not sure if they are going to use titanium on me as the doc mentioned artificial cartilage and reusing some of my bone. I have my appointment in Novemener so will ask. Do you know many details of the op- like how they accessed your ear? I have tried googling but get medical jargon instead of patients experience. They cut behind the ear and flipped it open and went in thru the back.  My doc had also said he was going to use my own cartilage if possible but my bone was just gone.  They are is a lot of drainage right now and a little bit of discomfort and pain. Right now I am very glad I did it. I can already hear better. Thanks for posting, and happy to hear it all went well!  Was this your second surgery for cholesteatoma?  I had always thought they need to perform multiple surgeries for this.  The first to remove the cholesteatoma, then a second one up to 12 months later to install prosthesis.  Interesting if they did it all in the 1 surgery though. First surgery. I do not have a hearing implant, just the bone replacement.  I am hoping this is all I will need for this ear.  We will see. How are u feeling these days? Doing well. Thank you for asking. I have to say I am extremely happy that I had the surgery. My hearing has improved so much. I also do not have the constant yellow ooze coming from my ear like I had for so many years.  I did have to take a strong antibiotic and predisone for a week after my first follow up because it still had some drainage that was not clearing up.  That did the trick and all is good now.  I will probably do the other ear late next year.  Hi extremely, I am Dad! That is amazing! I am glad everything is going well and is positive.

Hello guys,\n\n I am posting from a new account since I cannot manage to access my old one, and sorry for my English if I make mistakes.\n\n So, I have always had ear problems since I was a kid, and I had a tympanoplasty when I was in middle school (I am 26 now). I also do have some anxiety when it comes to health issues.\n\nI am currently experiencing some pain in my ear, which irradiates to other areas of my head (nothing too bad), and I feel some pressure inside of it. I also hear some noise inside of my ear sometimes.\n\n Back in December 2020 I was diagnosed with a bad fungal infection in my ear, which was probably there for at least a year (my bad for not visiting a doctor sooner). And I also had otitis, which in my case is chronic. I had lots of smelly earwax every and pain. After getting cured with some antibiotics and fungal drops, the ENT doctor could see that two thirds of my ear drum were missing and that I needed a tympanoplasty to restore it, as it would never grow back. Apparently, the fungus destroyed most of my eardrum, and after getting the infection cured, it does not make that \"pop\" sound anymore, when I yawn.\n\n For about a month, I had no more pain in my ear, but then it started again, some days nothing, some days it is painful.\n\n I decided to postpone any surgery, since I am currently living in a developing country for the next few years for work reasons, and the healthcare is generally bad with lots of corruption, especially during the pandemic. Plus, my lungs are damaged from a previous bad case of pneumonia and I only recently managed to get my first vaccine dose, so I would prefer avoiding hospital visits until I receive the second one.\n\n I recently ordered a cheap otoscope online to check how my eardrum looks, and it seems to me that most of it has grown back despite the ENT saying it would not, except on the right side where a couple of holes are visible, and it looks a bit retracted on that side. Also, the colors are strange, my other eardrum looks more \"transparent\" and homogenous when it comes to color.\n\nI know that for a full diagnosis I need to see a doctor and do a CT scan, but maybe with a couple of pictures and a description of my symptoms it can be ruled out or not, if it is cholesteatoma. I did have an MRI back in December 2019 as I was experiencing some \"pins and needles\" on the right side of my face (I do not have that symptom anymore), but nothing was found in my ear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** \\--- I am currently experiencing ear pain that comes and goes, have a ruptured ear drum (see pictures), a feeling of pressure inside my ear and also noise inside my ear, sometimes.

At the hospital they told me to not touch anything till my first follow up appointment with the surgeon, but my ear looks and feels gross. The stitches are crusty as well. \n\nWould it be okay to clean the stitches and the outer ear with a cotton ball and alcohol? Nooo! Leave it alone. You just got to deal with the gross feeling. Short term grossness avoids long term complications. Precisely this, in the long run it will heal completely. You also stated that this is day 5 post-op, so I expect your follow-up appointment to be soon. The ENT can clean some parts at the appointment if he/she thinks it will not interfere with the healing process. I was told (Canadian surgeon) to clean it with cotton balls and antibiotic cream. It felt so much better to get the blood and crusties out of the staples. I waited a few days though.", "Anyone else have to get their ear cavity cleaned every few months? They pull some nasty ass shit from mine. This is only half of what came out this time.  Must have felt amazing after. No WTF dude I do not have as much but they never let me see it fully and I always ask \u201ccan I please see that\u201d because I love nasty shit that they pull out. I think mine looks similar and it always bleeds and hurts. They usually recommend I use 3% hydrogen peroxide a few days before I come for a cleaning. I use that few times a day and it softens the wax so it is easier to remove. How often you go and does it hurt? Have you had the canal wall down procedure? I have read after, you need to go in and get your ears cleaned. I wondered if you need to go under or if you are awake. I have to go often, because the surgery leaves a cavity that collects a lot of debris and it gets wet. You are awake during the cleaning process. Do you get super dizzy while they are doing the cleaning!?  I have had my surgeon remove wax build up and it made me very dizzy and uncomfortable! I came here because I am too exhausted with this cleaning. It has been about 12 years since I had the canal wall down procedure for the cholesteatoma. It was about 2 times a year that I had to go for cleaning, then 3, then 4, and now is like it does not make sense going there. The debris and wetness is beyond what I can handle. My ear is always wet and collecting debris, every morning is very wet, during the day I can feel the discharge of this nasty thing I have to clean superficially with q-tips. It is itchy and is disrupting my normal day life, I wish there was a solution to this, it is frustrating. I do. I do not recall being that bad early on but after 12 years of the procedure I am even afraid of going sometimes because I know how dizzy it mades me feel, it is not comfortable at all. Sometimes It leaves a metal taste in my mouth after the cleaning Mucinex. Take mucinex. \n\nMy ENT has done 4 surgeries on me to date. The last one happening more than 10 years ago now. We discovered one year during particularly bad allergies that mucinex basically dries all my fluids up in my ears, so I now take it daily and I went from needing bi-monthly cleaning to annual ones, and even the annual ones are mainly just to ensure the cholesteatoma has not returned. What are the implications of taking mucinex for so long?", "Diagnosed with cholesteatoma So I have been diagnosed with cholesteatoma by three different surgeons they are recommend that I have the surgery, not immediately but within a year or so.  Problem is there is nothing wrong with my hearing or anything besides the fact that the cholesteatoma is there.\n\nMy question is has anyone else been at this stage?  What prompted you to go ahead with the surgery anyway?  Did you wait till you started seeing issues? Depends what cholesteatoma you have. Sounds like a small one which they can get out. One year waiting period would indicate you are not at much risk. Left untreated however it will start affecting your hearing. It will continue to grow and start to fuck to your hearing. Get the surgery now before you start having hearing problems. I wish I would known about mine sooner. My hearing is fucked. Surgery is really the only option. There is a lot of important structure in your ear such as facial nerve, hearing, balance etc. not to mention the brain itself is pretty vunerable.\nI basically had no choice becauuse by the time I was diagnosed it had began to eat its way into my brain. Got put up for surgery the following week. I would rather go deaf than risk meningitis, facial palsy and balance issues. Also there are always hearing aids Get it done ASAP. You have gotten very lucky with an early diagnosis. It will only get worse as time goes on. Just had the surgery yesterday and I had lost hearing already. They had to remove the hearing bones but it could have been worse the longer I left it. Id wait until it starts effecting your hearing. Doctor needed to remove some of my hearing bones to get it and i lost a lot more hearing then I expected. Hello~ I had this surgery last year May and I am also a Nurse. Unfortunately due to work and etc I was diagnosed late. This cholesteatoma ended up eating/rotting away my malleus and incus bone. The symptoms that I had were decreased hearing, dizziness and headaches especially behind my affected eye. This ultimately ended up with a titanium prosthetic in my ear attach to my stapes bone. It is better to get the surgery early to save what you can inside. I had a 6 hour surgery and surgery is the only answer. Recovery was not bad. I wish you the best! Thanks everyone, I decided to go ahead with the surgery next week.  Appreciate all the advice! How did the cholesteatoma surgery go?", "First surgery down Hi all,\n\nNew here. Just had my first surgery yesterday (mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty) and had a titanium prosthetic put in to replace eroded hearing bones.\n\nHas anyone else experienced constant pulsation tinnitus after surgery? I had regular tinnitus prior to surgery but now it is pulsating as if it is in sync with my heart beat and is very uncomfortable.\n\nFace is pretty swollen, still in pain and can barely hear in operated ear now when hearing was fine prior to surgery. \n\nWhen do things start to get better? I have permanent tinnitus in both of my ears from cholesteatoma but they do not pulsate. I think it is very individual. Give it some time your ear needs to heal and the tinnitus may change. Same with your hearing. If you are 1 day post op you will not be able to hear properly for a few months at least. First your ear is stuffed with padding to keep the prosthetics from moving and to prevent bleeding. This will likely be taken out in 1 to 2 weeks but you may still have some self dissolving foam around the prosthetic in the middle ear for a little while longer. Also, they likely built you a new ear drum. This is what takes the longest to heal. It has to gain strength enough to start working properly. Just give it some time. The returning of hearing will happen gradually. I had the same surgery and I had the pulsating tinnitus and it drove me nuts!! I could hardly sleep. But as the swelling went down it quieted down for me. I think it lasted maybe two weeks, and then after that I would only hear it briefly if I got my heart rate up. Now I do not have any tinnitus 7 months out. There is hope! Hi I had mine removed when I was 12 and for about 10 years I suffered with severe tinnitus but the worse thing is to pay attention to it, it only magnifies it and makes it worse It is probably just simply due to the trauma(from surgery) in your ear and will most likely settle once you recover.\n\nI had pulsatile tinnitus prior to my surgery as well due to the recurring ear infection. I had some pulsatile after my surgery too, but it went away once I recovered. Thank you this helps My pulsating tinnitus was awful after each surgery (I have had two, about to do a third) but it got better after a few weeks. I do still get it from time to time, but it is not that constant pulse like it is during recovery. Hang in there! \u2764\ufe0f My hearing came back after maybe a week. I did not have tinnitus right after but occasionally do (but just for a few minutes) I am in the same boat as you. It is pulsing as we speak. This used to happen to me when I would get bad ear infections so it sucks. This whole thing feels like the worst ear infection of my life.

It took a lot to figure out I had cholesteatoma and had to get surgery twice and reconstructive surgery. I am missing two bones but my hearing miraculously was still at about 70 percent because of the way they reconstructed it back then.\n\nA couple of months ago my ear started leaking again and when I got it checked out the doctors soon enough found out the cholesteatoma was back. Roughly 20 years later. The ENT immediately advised me to undergo surgery to clean it out again. Today was the day it happened and I must say, I am very glad with how it went. I was not nervous going into it, but I was a little afraid my hearing would get worse.\n\nIt is still too early to say that is not the case, but when I scratch my bandage, I can hear it, so at least I am not deaf, which is a big win, especially since I love making music.\n\nTime to recover now.\n\nBest wishes to anyone going through the same. It is not fun, but getting treated is very much worth it.\n\n( wishing you the speediest recovery \u2764\ufe0f Thank you! I need to go back for a check-up and I am so nervous I will get re diagnosed.. this is the confirmation bias I am here for.. I know this is not pc but my biggest fear with all of this is deafness, I play music and have an abnormal obsession with music in general, it would destroy me to lose significant hearing..I am smart enough to know that prolonging will make it worse if there is a problem but I cannot get my anxiety to understand that.. The pros always outweigh the cons. Do not let this get the best of you. There is risk involved, but there is more risk in not getting treatment.\n\nMy biggest fears are also hearing related so I definitely know what you mean. Keep your head up.\n\n Wishing you well! \ud83e\udd1e I hope you have a speedy recovery! :) I have to go back into surgery in 3 weeks - it is tiring! I totally get how you feel, I am a musician and it is really messed up my career and also having anxiety that one day I would go deaf. My advice is to just do what you can, try and get help and do not leave it late! Push through the anxiety as much as you can because as you said you know prolonging it will make it worse.

Thank you, same to you! Hey I have got a question, were your bones reconstructed? Did it work out well? This time around they did not need to, the cholesteatoma luckily was not wrapped around my bones. They did back in 1999, though. I believe I only have my hammer with an extension left in there. Same and I have really really good hearing and love it I got the surgery today and am praying I regain my hearing I have eustachian tube dysfunction..fluid build up in my middle ear..is there any chances that i have cholesteatoma..I am so scared it is been 2 years Sounds typical", "Only about 2 hours post op. Is this amount of bleeding normal???  Not a medical professional, but that is an awful lot compared to what I had. I would call your doctor ASAP. The area has not gotten any bigger since the time of the picture, maybe it was initial blood from the incision and they did not replace the bandage before waking me up? Possibly, the incision was not fully sutured. I had little to no blood visible. We will keep an eye on it every 20min and make sure the bandage is not getting more saturated Same thing happened to me Oh good that is a relief thank you same thing happen with me in my second surgery. in the first one it does not has any blood I just had my surgery yesterday as well and we have the same side profile. I showed this picture to my husband and he thought it was me. So freaked out haha. How weird!! Which procedure did you have? How did you sleep last night? I just had a typanoplasty thankfully. I slept okay, my ear feels so weird and everything I move my jaw I hear crunching sound. Hard to eat! What about you? I had a tympanomastoidectomy with ossicular chain reconstruction! I slept pretty well but I attribute it to the pain meds. This morning I do not hurt too badly but I am pretty dizzy and nauseous. It depends on how invasive the surgery was. You are probably on blood thinners to prevent any blood clots. They had me on blood thinners following my surgery as well.  That will make it difficult for your blood to coagulate, so I assume this is normal, unless a nurse tells you otherwise(if you are are at a hospital that is) I had the same thing dude it is been a long recovery but I am about to hit the 3 month mark and fully recoup all my hearing So far this first day has not been too bad. The worst part is the soreness in my neck and how moist everything feels. It is really grossing me out haha", "Reconsidering Surgery and Struggling with Acceptance Hi! My son (15) has mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears due to holes in his ear drum. There seemed to be some suspicious problems with his first surgery (left ear) which was supposed to a normal ear drum repair, but turned into a 6 hour cholesteatoma removal with additional removal of his incus bone (and possibly another) due to erosion-which made his hearing worse. On top of that, he lost his taste for a long time afterwards. It is still not completely back. Also, this was after a CT scan showed everything was fine. He now wears hearing aids in both ears.\n\nNow, he is supposed to have a partial reconstruction surgery on that same ear, and I am just not so sure it is a good idea. I do not know if I trust the doctor after what happened, or if the potential benefits of the surgery are even worth it considering the possible risks of permanent loss of taste, facial paralysis, worse hearing, and most likely reconstruction surgery due to issues with the prostheses. The only personal experiences or research I have found, were not positive. \n\nSo, do any of you have personal experiences you can share? If you have had a similar surgery, what were your long term outcomes? Am I just bring an overprotective mom? \n\nAlso, I know this may sound ridiculous, but how has your experiences affected your life plans? I know things could be worse (and he would never complain in a million years!), but my son wanted to learn to scuba dive and be adventurous. He was interested in a career in law enforcement or in culinary arts. He is such an amazing kid, and I do not know how to explain to him that his life may be different. Any information or advice you can share? I am truly sorry for your son\u2019s difficulty. I was much older (40) before having similar surgeries. I guess what I would say is, ask many questions about the potential upside of reconstructive surgery. The effectiveness of prosthetic hearing bones is limited, but on the other hand might provide for better hearing than he has today. I am not a medical expert by any means, but it seems unlikely that a second surgery would make things worse. Get a second opinion for sure if you have concerns about the doctor. \n\nAs far as quality of life, I am living a happy, normal life with few limitations. I have a successful career, am a semi-professional musician, and have run two marathons since my surgeries. I am not sure about diving, but I have been able to swim and snorkel so long as I take care to plug my affected ear. It is true he may have to recalibrate some of his plans, but especially given all you have said about his outlook my bet is he will have a fulfilling life.", "My diagnosis I go back on Valentine\u2019s Day to find out if I need surgery on my right ear.

I took the main bandage off 24 hours after the surgery but have to go hospital on friday to get the packing removed. I am in the uk so not sure how the operation or aftercare differs from anywhere else but I will be glad to answer any questions as well as I can How much hearing is expected to be gained from have the mastoid cavity obliterated? I have not been told how much yet, the day before I had my surgery I had a hearing test and another one will be done in 6 months time so I wont know untill then. My hearing was well below the average of what was expected after cholesteatoma removal so my results may be differant from someone elses From what I read, you can gain anywhere from 5-10 db of hearing from having the mastoid cavity obliterated and the ear canal rebuilt. It is different for everyone though How long did it take for the swelling/ pain to go away?", "Should I be worried about this? I had endoscopic ear surgery a little over 3 months ago and I had my cholesteatoma removed, ear drum repaired and a prosthesis implanted my ear has been relatively fine up until about a week or so ago where it started doing some strange things that I am still not 100% sure how to describe but I will do my best.\n\nI was walking quite a bit last week and I noticed that it felt like my ear was beating or breathing almost, and my hearing would fluctuate up and down for a few seconds before settling back to what I am accustomed to, I could very clearly feel this in the ear. This was also happening when I would lay down on my couch and laud my head on the arm rest while using some pillows as cushion.\n\nThe next thing that happened was that I was trimming my face and all of the sudden, the same thing happened but this time, I felt like a buzz or some rattling in the ear before it stopped.\n\nFinally, yesterday the same thing happened but this time, my ear felt like it popped and I felt like a drain or something like fizzling out and it was actually relieving. I do not feel those fluctuations as strongly now and oddly enough, my ear does not feel like it is full. It is been feeling this way since my surgery. However, despite not feeling those fluctuations in sound as strongly, I still feel them and felt the buzz/rattling this morning again as I was tossing and turning my head in bed this morning.\n\nLike I said, I have been having these feelings just in the last two weeks. The only things that have happened in that timeframe is that 1) I have been dealing with the sniffles a bit for about the same amount of time and 2) I unfortunately got myself into another altercation about 3 weeks ago (I am in AA now as I know I need help and need to take better care of myself).\n\nI am wondering if these feelings are normal for someone with a surgically repaired ear or if my actions potentially dislodged my prosthesis and should see my doctor about this.", "It still feels like there is a bone coming out of my ear.

Normally I would use ear plugs, but my doctor told me not to touch inside my ear. I have not been able to get into contact with her. Did you guys just shower like normal? Hi. May I ask what surgery you had? I had a mastoidectomy 3 days ago and last year. Both times I was told not to wash my hair for 2 weeks as I absolutely need to avoid water. Last year, I did not really take it seriously and showered a couple days too soon and that was the reason for my recurring cholesteotoma. I was told I could shower but for the next 6 weeks to shower with a cup over my ear, or put the shower head low enough so I was only showering from the neck down I had a mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty about a week ago. My surgeon told me that on day 4 I can shower normally with a cotton ball in my ear coated with Vaseline to prevent water from getting into my ear canal. The vaseline will create a seal. Highly recommend trying this. I avoided showers for a few days, then when I did have a shower, I wore a shower cap over the ear. Did not get any water on my hair for over 2 weeks though and just directed the shower handle everywhere below my neck. I had a tympanomastoidectomy. I think I will just take a bath and not wet my hair until I get a response from my doctor because I do not want to risk anything happening. My doctor told me not to wash my hair or wet my incision for one week. The incision has tape over it that will be removed at my one week post-op appointment tomorrow. Then when I can finally wash my hair, I have to place a Vaseline covered cotton ball in my ear that I was told to then cover with tape. I am still nervous about getting water in there despite taking the proper precautions! My doctor did not suggest a cup, but that is a great idea! It sounds great but I hated it haha. You constantly have to hold one arm up to hold the cup there I tried it two days ago when I showered and oh boy that was not fun \ud83d\ude02", "Thank you! Thank you to those who answered my pre-surgery questions!\n\nMy surgery was yesterday, and seems to have gone well.\n\nI am definitely noticing neck and jaw pain as someone noted.  I have not bled nearly as much as I feared I would!\n\nSo far tylenol and advil seem to be keep the pain at bay which I am thankful for.  I do occasionally get a quick stab as some mentioned I might but those are totally bearable so far.\n\nI am very glad to be on the other side of the surgery, will be even more glad when I am on the other side of recovery, and will be most glad if I never have to have this done again! How long was your recovery? Technically I am still in recovery.\n\nI am still taking nightly drops in my ear, and I am still instructed to keep water out of it.\n\nAs far as pain, mine was minimal and lasted about a week.  It was probably another 2 weeks before I could comfortably lay on that side.\n\nI still have a little weirdness with my taste buds - certain things just taste a bit \u201coff\u201d.\n\nI also still do not really have any hearing in that ear.  I am starting to be able to hear things out of it a tiny bit but I cannot always distinguish what is being said or what the noise is. Appreciate the insight! Wishing you good health! How are the taste buds? Still slightly off but somewhat better.", "One day post-op Hey guys! Not too long ago I posted about my diagnosis on here. I just wanted to update and let you know I got the procedure done successfully and should have one more in 6 months! \n\nIf anyone has any questions or anything please let me know. I was terrified but everything seemed to go smoothly! \n\nAny advice for recovery? It is day one since my procedure yesterday and I have been feeling fine, but wonder if there is anything further to know about recovery. Thanks and happy holidays! You will leak from your ears for a bit. It is normal, can be many colors. Red, clear, yellow, brownish. If it looks infected, call the doctor. \n\nYou will have packing in your ear... for months. Do not mess with it. They will eventually remove it. \n\nMake sure you do your ear drops. \n\nI found the 3-4 days after the surgery were the worst. \n\nYou might have a numb ear for awhile. Thank you for some insight! I definitely am not enjoying day one in the slightest, feels like I am just counting down until the next day comes so things can get easier Glad to hear back from you! My main advice is to always take paracetamol when you are in pain, it is safe and will do wonders during the recovery. Do not make the recovery harder on yourself by thinking 'I can cope with the pain', because it is not worth the effort. If they give you the pain medicine, take it if you can. I enjoyed a nice couple days relaxing on pain killers. \ud83d\ude02 I am happily taking these pain meds! I have been napping on and off throughout the day. I hate having to sleep upright I think that is the worst part lol They gave me some pretty good pain killers so I have just been drifting on and off throughout the day and I cannot really complain. So glad I could finally get my head bandage off today too that thing was so annoying Congrats on getting through the procedure. What side effects are you having? I had some dizziness and vertigo and I heard reports of the same thing, so I was slow and cautious with movement to prevent falls. The tinnitus was really bad afterwards but it lessened over time. Thank you! Most odd side effects is having lack of taste on one side of my tongue.. it is rlly annoying. Luckily not so bad with dizziness I have been able to get through without falling yet! Hey I know this is a super old post but how is your taste now? Did it ever come back? Hello! My taste came back fully about 2 months post op and the first month was not great taste-wise! Omg you replied so fast! I am in love with your right now \ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\ude1d. I have my surgery in 6 hours. So I am a bit nervous about this. The doctor said its near my taste nerve so there is a high chance it will be affected. Its my 5th surgery so I am not new to C-toma but I have never had problems with the taste thing. How did you deal with it? Any insider tips to make it less horrible? No problem! (: I just drank a lot of tea with honey and water (weird thing is you lose taste on one side of the tongue not both so it is just an odd sensation). I tended to just chew on the side I could taste on lol Also forgot to add Goodluck with your surgery! I hope it all goes well - I am due for a second surgery in a few months! Thank you! Sorry to hear you also have to get another one. These things just never stop it feels like. Thank so much for the advice and fast responses. Good luck with yours as well!", "When should I be seeing drainage? I am on day 4 of recovery. My head is throbbing nonstop. This feels like the worst infection of my life and I know it is not an ear infection but that is how it feels. \n\nI can feel a weird sensation in my head above my ear. When I touch it, it feels like there is packing all inside from my forehead to my ear. It feels \"crunchy\" like if I am touching bunched up newspaper. I do not know if this is normal. It also feels numb in my head.\n\nSo far I have only seen a little blood come out of my ear on my cotton ball that I replace every 3 hours. I do my ear drops twice a day. I also have not been laying on either side at all.", "Failed surgery. Should I go back to the same surgeon? For context, I am in Canada with public health care where there are long waits for surgery. The guy who did my first surgery is available in 2 months while the better surgeon has a 12-18 month wait. I am exploring  a 3rd option but it is likely 6 months plus.\n\nGot a metal prosthesis to replace a mastoid bone that was eroded due to cholesteatoma. Eardrums retracted; tube installed to equalize the pressure. I saw my ENT 6 weeks ago and he said the prosthesis was pushing against my eardrum. Last week, an examination showed the metal prosthesis is now tearing through my eardrum. \n\nFinally saw the surgeon again. Told him my hearing has dropped, the tinnitus is getting worse and I cannot get deep sleep anymore. Major dip in my health recently. His recommendation? Do nothing. I said that was unacceptable. Second option: take it out, go back to the pre-surgery state. Wtf? Third option: try to put it back in place. Fourth: install a new prosthesis to connect the first and third mastoid bones, which could result in some hearing loss.\n\nIf time was not a factor, the choice would be easy. It is been hard to live like this for 6 weeks with the prosthesis pushing my eardrum. I cannot imagine life like this for 6 months or even a year.\n\nI wonder if I went to emergency at the hospital if I could get it dealt with faster, or if they would send me home.", "2 months post op It is been 2 months since my op - I had a radical mastoidectomy and obliteration. Healing has been super tough ngl. I am a yoga instructor and still cannot bend over without immense pressure. My surgeon was really vague about how long it may last (even said it could be permanent) anyone had anything similar ??? Or even just trying to exercise post op ie sit ups etc", "Anyone had a mastoid obliteration?? ", "canal wall up or down?? 6 years ago I had a right atticotomy and ossiculoplasty. My cholesteatoma has now grown back and I need to have my mastoid bone removed. Can someone please explain to me the canal wall down and canal wall up and each benefit? I am trying to get as much info as possible before I commit to a certain one. Also a massive thank you to everyone who has been so kind and helpful on here I shopped around for my surgeon and ultimately settled at the University of North Carolina.  The doctor there said that the wall down procedure was best for me because I had severe damage to my hearing bones and creating a larger cavity (wall down) would reduce the rate of the disease recurring by a large percentage.  This is important because your ear structure is so sensitive to change.  The more surgeries you have, the more likely you are to have complications. Also, having a \u201cclean and dry\u201d ear allows for otolaryngologists that I will have later in life to observe and keep track of ear changes.  I was very very lucky.  I have lost quite a bit of hearing in my left ear but I can still make out speech and locate sounds (find my phone).  Ask the tough questions. Thank you xx Of course \ud83e\udd19", "Can some cholesteatomas be heard? I do not believe I have a cholesteatoma, but want to get evaluated at my dr just to be safe. I am asking because I have recently been experiencing this sound like something hitting my eardrum when I tilt my head to the affected side and slightly less again when I tilt it to the other side as if something loose was moving around. I want to know if this was a sign seen by people before eventual cholesteatoma diagnosis so I can know if I should be a little more insistent with my dr in having the possibility of this evaluated. Does not sound at all like normal eustachian tube popping, hence my worry. Any insight appreciated. While I do have tinnitus, it is probably the symptom that came last for me.  The problem that eventually lead to my diagnosis was consistent ear infections and loss of hearing.\n\nAnyways, if you are worried about your ears I would recommend you go to an ENT.  If my whole ordeal has taught me anything, it is that I am a bit less trustful of GPs in general as they seemed to ignore my ear problems despite the warning signs being there for years.  I may have been diagnosed much soon had I just gone to an ENT years ago. Cholesteatomas ar more or less in a fixed position. They are connected to the surrounding tissue, if I am not mistaken. So you will not be able to hear it move around. \nMy guess is, (since I am not a doc), that you might have some fluid in you ear. Also there is a possibility that the sound may also come from your neck or jaw. I can certainly hear it when I move my neck, which tells me I should probably spend less time infront of my computer lol. When I had my cholesteatoma I could hear my eyeball rotate believe it or not. But ask your doctor. Makes sense anatomically. I imagine this happened only after you had already started to lose hearing?", "Is this cholesteatoma? The second picture is from a few months ago &amp; the first is today. Each time I get them my ear hurts I get dizzy and my ear feels full/heavy..  It is difficult to give any answer based on this photo. In order to determine if it is a cholesteatoma or not, you are going to have to undergo scans and tests. You should talk to your gp and get a referal to an ent. Good luck! No, there is no visible cholesteatoma in this picture. Cholesteatoma diagnosis depends on a fine observation of the ear through a otoscopy, which is not what is happening here. I do see in this picture something that resembles a little of ear wax.\n\nIf you are having symptoms such as pain, pressure, hearing loss, discharges, bad smell or any other like this, go see your doctor. I am going to go with no since you cannot see it from the outside of the ear but you may need an ear cleaning and an exam! There is lots of inner ear issues I do not think you can see one without a head CT. External/canal cholesteatomas are a thing, just very rare. In fact that is why I am here. I think I have one :( Oh I have never heard of that! I hope you find what you are looking for.. :) hopefully external ones are not as big of an issue since it is not by the brain, maybe? If you want to be absolutely sure though try to get in with an ent I was not properly diagnosed for years with mine.. Yeah actually they are less dangerous than the inner/middle ones! Only problem is they are also harder to find the source of. If I remember correctly, I believe the ratio of patients that have outer vs inner is 1:1000.", "CT scheduled for this week. Diagnosed tentatively this week with Cholesteatoma in both ears and my CT is scheduled for next week to figure out what to do from here. \n\nI am a little freaked out about the \u201crecovery\u201d because I work at all call center and wear a headset. I am not sure what I should expect for the recovery time. I had dizziness, so my gp ordered a mri and ct. this detected the cholesteatoma. The ent specialist I was sent to then ordered another ct. His office passed on my case to a hospital in another state. They have now ordered another ct and mri for this Monday. It has now been 6-7 months and I still do not know when I will have surgery. I am so sorry :( I hope they get answers for you soon. The reason it is taking so long is that there are at least 3 different specialists trying to agree on what to do as the tumour is in the back of my ear between my skull and my neck, so it is difficult. My sister is a trained radiologist and says its pressing on my brain. I will be sending good vibes your way my friend. \u2764\ufe0fHang in there. Thanks.", "5 days post op Hey guys. I am 5 days post op of my first cholesteatoma removal. It was something I was dreading for a long time that ended up not being as bad as I imagined. Anyway, I am a bit concerned about my scar. It seems a little lumpy in around the top part of my ear. I am worried it could turn into a keloid scar. Can anyone share their experiences? Mine is still slightly lumpy, but it is 95% better than it was the first couple months after. I am almost 8 months post op. I will post a pic. Your pic appeared in my feed but I did not know you were posting in response to a bad scar topic. Yeah. Your scar does not seem bad at all haha. How long til you got it wet though? Yeah your scar does not seem bad at all haha. How long til you got it wet though? Scar goes away in my experience (I have had bilateral c-toma w/ many recurrences). The only long-term problem is that the skin behind my ears is now quite thin and get irritated after wearing glasses for a few hours. Thanks for the input. I sent pictures to the care team and they said it will go down over time so I am starting to calm down about it lol. But sorry to hear that. I wear mine a lot too About a week.", "Surgery went well!! Was a lot more extensive that they realised so had a full mastoid obliteration! Taste never cut but facial nerve saved! Off home to recover now \ud83d\udc9b hoping this pain settles down \ud83d\ude05  Glad it went well for you!! Wishing you a speedy recovery \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd Thank you! \ud83d\ude4f Sounds familiar haha, they worked on me for 7 hours instead of the planned 3-5. Did you have something done to your hearing bones as well? And how is the pain right now? I think I had something done to the hearing bones but the doctor spoke to my mum while I was still under so will find out more info in 2 weeks which I get the packaging out! Pain is ok- but this oxy morphine thing is making me so sick this is the worst part - trying not to throw up! Well done! The lead up and anticipation is always the toughest part. Just focus on your wellbeing and self care through your recovery (treat yourself too :-) and it will be a breeze.  All the best! Could not agree more! And thanks heaps! :) 3 days left here for my 3th. Good luck1 Wishing you a speed recovery too! I am curious about swimming after the operation, do you think it will be possible to swim ever again? Hey! I have not swam without ear plugs since I was about 3, and as I got older I just stopped al together as submerging and the pressure difference was not advised. I am not too fussed about swimming but my partner is a surfer so sure I will be dragged out on a board again soon! But will wait till summer I reckon x Did you have problems with your dressing in your ear going rock hard? I am struggling to cope a week in now?! Hey! Thanks for sharing on here it is really helping calm my nerves about all of this. Wanted to check and see how you were doing now? What was the recovery period like for you?", "Early Cholesteatoma Can an early stage cholesteatoma cause brain clots/meningitis?? My doc says we def caught it early but I have been having a plethora of brain and body symptoms (my other other dr says i have somatic symptom disorder so this could be an extension of that) that I am super worried about. Also, any advice for presurgery would be greatly appreciated!! I do not think anyone on this subreddit is qualified to give you an answer on the first part of your question. Cholesteatomas can lead to meningitis but this depends on factors like the size and location of yours.\n\nAs far as pre-surgery, I was anxious the first few weeks I found out about this and I still am (my surgery is in September) but not as much now. Just take it one day at a time and try not to think about it too much, it is not good for you! Get your ears cleaned out by an ENT if you need to but you cannot stop living despite how scary the diagnosis is. That is been my approach to it and I hope it works for you. Mines like, right at the top of my ear canal. Doc says it is partially eroded the first hearing bone but that is it. He also assured me that it is a slow progressing kind of thing. I am just worried about having a brain clot and then dying suddenly. Fr it is all I can think about \ud83d\ude2d I developed somatic symptoms from the constant stress. \n\nMy surgery is also in September!! The 9th, specifically. Good luck to us both and thanks for the advice!!! Meningitis would almost certainly present with the impossibilty of putting your chin to your chest. It is also very rare for cholesteatoma to cause mengitis in the western world, because of medical accessibility when you get the early symptoms of cholesteatoma. Chances of you having mengitis are thus very slim.\n\nSource: Am a medical student and recurring cholesteatoma patient. I am guessing the chances are slim for a blood clot?? Ty sm for easing my anxieties!! As I said, I developed somatic disorder from the constant stress so any amount of reassurance goes a long way for me!!! Hi I had cholesteatoma removed when I was 12 and had it for years and it had eroded most of my hearing bones in left ear and some of the plate below my brain and my ent said it still would have been years before possible meningitis or anything harmful", "I think I might have Cholesteatoma again :( When I was younger, I had a bunch of ear infections but everything was all okay till I reached the age of 11, when the doctors told me I had cholesteatoma. After the surgery, around 50% of the hearing was gone on my right ear and I needed a hearing aid. I had another surgery when I was 13, one when I was 14, and since then I had nothing (I am 16, almost 17 soon), so the doctors and I had assumed that everything was improving and my hearing would eventually go back to normal. However, for the past week, my ear has been draining out this gross wax mixture (I do not know if it is wax, it is just yellow, gooey, and smells bad), and I had my mom take a look with an otoscope that we have at home, and after clearing out a good bunch of the liquid, she discovered a yellowish-but-white pearl thing clinging to the back of my inner ear. We kind of freaked out and we are rushing to schedule an appointment now, but it is all just bringing me down. I thought everything was getting better but it seems it is gone back to whatever it was before. I do not want to go through another surgery, but I have to deal with it sadly. Sorry to hear this, but please try to remain calm and have it properly assessed and diagnosed. If you can, try to reassure yourself, remain logical, and know you will get through it.\n\nOn the chances of recurrence, a ( found that from a sample of 1006 patients, \"*overall estimated proportion with recurrence 5 years after surgery was of 37% in children and of 15% in adults*\", so recurrence is somewhat common.  Looking at this in another way, if you do have recurrence, know that you are not alone.\n\nYou may also want to enquire with your specialist to see if there are any other treatment options available, such as transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES) which is a minimally invasive alternative.  Let us know how you go. Thank you so much, I am seeing a doctor today so hopefully everything turns out alright", "Hearing aid advice I have had 3 surgeries total and possibly another one this year. I am having cholesteatoma in both ear (yayyy) and my hearing has been getting worse and worse. I hate asking people to repeat what they just said and I am awful at paying attention in meeting since I could barely hear a thing. I am considering getting hearing aid and asking my ent doctor about it, but I am worried about wearing hearing aid may cause more ear infection etc. \n\nIf anybody here is wearing hearing aid or have experience, please share your knowledge. I would appreciate a lot. I have a hearing aid for my right ear which I have had a mastoidectony on. So there is a large cavity in there that can get infections easily.  I also just had my third surgery on my left ear but we will see how the hearing is after about 3 months. As of now I am completely deaf on that side. \n\nAt first, I did not like at all after I got it. This was when I still had good hearing on my left side but needed a bit of help with hearing on my right side. When using the hearing aid, I felt like it made people muffled since I could hear out of my left then there would be a slight delay and then I would hear people through the hearing aid on my right. I also did not like the feeling of having something lodged in my ear all day long. It just was not for me. However, now that I am completely deaf on my left side from the last surgery, the hearing aid is really amazing. All the little sounds I could not hear before like water hitting the metal in the sink, clinking of dishes at a cafe, or birds chirping outside it was really crazy. So if you are a only slightly deaf I would not suggest it. It might actually make things more difficult to hear. If you have significant hearing loss on the other hand. I think it is great.\n\nNow for advice on infection. The problem with the hearing aid is that it causes a build up of moisture in your ear due to sweating. This is extremely bad for me since I have that huge cavity in my head, it can cause a lot of problems. To deal with this, I only use the hearing aid when I am around other people, at a meeting, or something where I need to understand what people are saying. I usually take it out when I am alone, doing desk work, or sometimes when I am one on one with someone where there is not a lot of background noise around and I can focus more on what they are saying. Just try and make sure your ear has time to breathe. Also, I think it is good to clean the hearing aid every evening when you take it out or in the morning when before you put it in.\nAnyway I hope this helps. Get a ponto 3 or 4\n\nI was very hesitant but after getting it, LIFE CHANGING. Unfortunately I was on a rollercoaster and my friend threw his hands up, hit my cochlear, and it got knocked off into the void... trying to get a new one. But I would do anything for it. \n\nAsk your doctor about testing some different cochlear devices. They can make a huge difference. Sounds like you might have similar hearing loss to me I got mine when I was young and have had several surgeries so long as you get an open tip (one that does not completely cover the ear opening) you should be fine it will most certainly help with hearing you can have it customized to your hearing deficiency though they can be expensive and take a while to get use to I had them when I was young so it was easy to adapt to them overall absolutely suggest getting them Would you please tell me what model it is? Or how I should tell my surgeon about it etc? I would love to get something similar. Thanks a lot I will definitely ask my doctor about it. Thanks Thank you so much for the detailed information. I am having abother surgery coming up so I would love to have my hearing aid done at the same time It is a oticon siya 2 at least that is what it says on the hearing aid one thing about though is that unless you need two you will not be able to change the volume because one button is on each hearing aid and one side (left) goes down when pressed and the other side (right) turns the volume up when pressed. Otherwise they are amazing in my opinion and have worked great. As for telling your surgeon if they were your doctor simply schedule a appointment I think I got hearing aids when I was in 6th grade so I do not really remember that much but I do remember going to get multiple opinions on the hearing aid No idea what kind of hearing aid you have, but I have a Unitron Moxi Fit 700. I use it similarly to you (only with other people around, really) and I have to change batteries every... two to three weeks? The company I bought it from told me its charge is just under 6 days (in total), so like, \\~140 hours.\n\nIf battery is that much of a problem, perhaps look into a replacement. I can vouch for Unitron being nice - I also have not experienced the delays you speak of. Hope this helps a lil bit for you, as well as OP. I despise having bad hearing personally and I will take anything I can get to fix it, and I imagine it is the same for most people.", "Should I postpone my surgery due to the pandemic? It is in 3 weeks in Miami. I know one south Florida doctor has died from coronavirus already. I know medical professionals in New York are wearing garbage bags for PPE. \n\nIm scared to be in a hospital while this is happening. Im scared to have doctors use their PPE on me while people are actually dying.\n\nI was diagnosed a month ago, I have pretty bad hearing loss. I have to ask people to speak up all the time. I know cholesteatoma can paralyze me and kill me if I let it go on but that wont be for another 5 years according to my doctor.\n\nThe hospital just said they will contact me if my surgery gets canceled. So it is still on as of now but the pandemic gets worse everyday. I am surprised they still plan to go through with your surgery right now. My cholesteatoma has reached the point that it is causing unrelenting pain, I have lost taste in some areas, and I have non-stop facial twitching (especially in my eye area). My cholesteatoma is growing in an atypical fashion, leaving out of the inner ear canal. It is reached some pretty important nerves. I have been prescribed a round of steroids in an attempt to bring down some inflammation, but that is only a temporary fix. My surgeon told me he would let me know when they can get my surgery scheduled. Right now, only immediately urgent life-saving surgeries can be performed in their hospital. I understand your dilemma. On one hand, you would be taking the risk of being exposed to the coronavirus. On the other hand, you need to go ahead and get this surgery knocked out. I worry that if you postpone it until the pandemic dies down, surgeries will be so backlogged that yours might get pushed back too far. Sorry, I got distracted a few days ago and forgot to reply. I think if the doctors feel you should get it done with then listen to them. I have been waiting for an idea of when my surgery will be for 7 months and even had a CT/MRI scan to check progress a week before things went to hell. Now I have to wait even longer until things blow over to even get an idea when I will be treated. Right after I posted this the hospital called me and told it was canceled. Im glad because the country is running extremely low on PPE", "Smell? So, I already put a call into my doctor, but I figured I would ask you all your opinions too. \n\nIt has been two months since my canal wall down, meatoplasty, mastoidectomy. This is my second surgery. I still have some of that yellow-ish crusty stuff that comes out over night when I sleep. When I wake up, I usually just scrape it with my pinky nail and go on my way.\n\nThis morning though, there was a smell. The only way I can describe it is when you have pierced ears and sometimes that nasty smelling stuff comes out? Identical to that. \n\nAny ideas?", "Could this be cholesteatoma?  How should we know? We are not able to look inside your ear over the internet. This is what you should ask your ENT about. Keep going to your ent until you get a clear \"no\" or \"yes\" in regards of whether or not it is a cholesteatoma. That is the only way you can know for sure. Agreed. And even then, they should do some additional tests like an MRI for proper diagnosis.", "My history with cholesteatoma  For some reason, this video helps me mentally with my recent diagnosis of cholesteatoma.  Especially the ( where he gives good advice which is \"*once your ENT has determined that you need to have treatment, do not worry about it - let it go*\".  Have bookmarked this for later! I am getting this surgery in 2 days. I am so scared of the pain and hearing loss afterwards... Please, do not stress about it - you will be fine.  The anesthetic they give you will continue for many hours after you wake up, so you will feel no pain. It will take a couple of weeks to heal, and it way feel weird along the way, but this is something many people go through, and you have got this. As for the hearing loss, I have been told your hearing will be no worse off than what it currently is.  Can I ask what procedure you are having?  I am assuming its a mastoidectomy - are they planning a CWD or CWU? Thank you so much ! And honestly I have no idea, I am a frenchy so I am not quite familiar with these terms... I do know there is going to be a cholesteatoma removal and some kind of bone drilling/scraping with one of the little bones in my ear removed. Sorry for this messy description It sounds like you are having exactly the same thing as what I will be having done in a few months.  CWD is the Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy, where CWU is the Canal Wall Up Mastoidectomy.  Your specialist will most likely take one of these two approaches, depending on your situation.  Please let us know you it goes for you - we would love to hear your experience.\n\nLike most surgical procedures, the absolute worst part is the waiting before hand.  So many things will go through your mind that will cause you to stress, so the best approach is always just to distract yourself and not think about it. That is why I like the video above where he says \"do not worry about it - let it go\".  Everything will be fine, as rest assured the hospital staff are trained professionals who do this every day! Yes thank you! I will try to keep my mind at ease, It is in 2 days. I will tell you how it went! Hi Nananabanana!  Hope you are feeling better, and a weight has been lifted off your shoulders.  How did your procedure go?", "Should I get surgery? I found out I had cholesteatoma about 2 years ago but I have had hearing loss for my left ear for as long as I can remember. My doctor said surgery is optional and it is possible that I can get my hearing back. My mom does not want to get surgery no matter how much I tried asking due to the 5 hour time period if the surgery were to be carried out. Should I keep trying to ask her? This is really hard to answer, once it is you who is going to go throught it. But you should also have a serious conversation with your ENT about what are the possibilities with your specific cholesteatoma. I say that because there are many ways a cholesteatoma can present. It may be small, simple and steady or it might be big, badly localized or growing. Probably not growing in your case, since he talked about \"optional\". But what approach will he use? Tympanoplasty? Mastoidectomy? Is it wall up or wall down? Bone reconstruction? Need for grafts?\n\nBut keep in mind that, aside from the normal complications from a surgery (usually very small probabilities), there might be, in some cases, complications with facial nerve, post op infections, ear discharges (you can read some about this in this sub), necessity of frequent visits to the ENT for cleaning and all sort of things.\n\nAlso, try asking what happens if you will not have the surgery. Will you need constant CTs or MRIs? May it grow? If it does, what might happen?\n\nYou are the only one who can decide for that, since you are the only one who can feel what you feel about the hearing loss or the \"having a cholesteatoma\" stuff. And your doctor, with your exams and knowledge of your case, is the only one who can help you with true info and answers to your questions.\n\nI know it does not answer your question, but none of us actually can. And I hope you find out what is best for you.\n\nObs: I do not know how old you are, but talk to your mom instead of trying to convince her. I am very sure she wants what is best for you. A unilateral mild hearing loss (or even a severe one) is usually nothing beyond that. Having a cholesteatoma has the potential to actually cause death. The only way to correct it is through surgery. This ^ Hey! \n\nSo first of all congratulations on confronting a health issue like this. \n\nIt takes real courage to confront a disease like Cholesteatoma, particularly during a global pandemic so kudos!\n\nI am scheduled for surgery in 24hrs, so I totally understand why you are reaching out for help. \n\nBut! Please balance this with the knowledge that surgery is safe and not as bad as you think. I know that my fears are largely unfounded and that I will hopefully wake up and wonder why I got so worked up! \n\nTo start, although Cholesteatomas are rare they vary massively from person to person. \n\nThe simple truth is I know you are posting for answers and peace of mind but you will not find it here, rather you will get lots of personal stories, support and encouragement. \n\nAlthough nearly everyone here has a diagnosis, NO ONE on Reddit is genuinely qualified to speak about your case in absolute terms. Some family doctors who know their patients since birth miss Cholesteatomas, so I sincerely doubt we can give you an absolute answer. \n\nYou sound quite worried, so I would say go back to your ent ASAP for more information. Here is some questions you might want to think about asking:\n\n1) Do I need to have a hearing test or CT/MRI imaging done?\n\nThis might sound scary, but it is important to get an understanding of what is going in terms of size and placement. Please keep in mind CT scans do not tell you the entire story (only surgery can do a decent job of this). However, after having my scan I could ask my ent some questions that put my mind at rest. E.g. is my inner ear and balance likely to be affected? Is it pushing towards my skull plate and can you see any signs of a csf leak or other complications? \n\nThankfully the answer to all of these questions was no! PHEW! but, the bad news was that my hearing bones have been eroded and require reconstruction.The outcome is likely to be some hearing loss, but again, health, quality of life and peace of mind easily outweigh the unfortunate downsides. \n\nThe scan is very useful in this final respect because it will impact what type of surgery you end up having. If the cyst has damaged your hearing bones then you will likely have to have these reconstructed (I explain this more in question 3) \n\n2) why would you say surgery is optional? \n\nMy surgeons preference was similarly split but he favoured surgery.\n\nThis recommendation was mainly because My hearing was, and still is quite good in that ear. However, in retrospect, we now know this is because the Cholesteatoma is acting as a hearing bone for me, hence why the hearing loss is less apparent. Please DONT  assume decent hearing means you do not need surgery. it is easy to make that leap but it is faulty reasoning I wish I had not made. \n\n3) what kinds of surgical interventions would be appropriate for my case, AND can you explain them to me in simple language? \n\nSo the surgical procedures for Cholesteatoma are numerous and quite complicated. Your ent will be able to explain to you what would be the most appropriate. \n\nHowever, there is one rule of thumb about them that might be helpful. \n\nGenerally speaking you have got surgery that goes straight through the ear drum with Tiny tools. These procedures are way less invasive, carry with it less risk and are generally less complicated. \n\nThen you have combined approach surgeries, where the surgeon makes and incision behind the ear and uses the less invasive method. \n\nNow again, I am speaking in general terms here, but if you get on things earlier, your surgeon feels the need to do it and has the tools and experience, usually the surgery will be the less invasive option.  (and I cannot stress this enough every case is different please consult your surgeon) \n\nAs I said earlier about getting ct scans/imaging done, scans also help you to figure out if your hearing bones have been damaged. This will give a better understanding of the surgery.  If your hearing bones have not been affected it is possible you will only need minimally invasive surgery, and then a second look operation to make sure the cyst has gone. \n\nHowever, if your hearing bones have been damaged then you will need to talk about reconstruction surgery. This can happen all in one go ( removal+reconstruction like I am scheduled for) or they do the removal and then reconstruct upon a second look to make sure nothing has come back. \n\nIf they stage the reconstruction over two procedures that can be quite upsetting because if the bones are damaged they do the removal and then you will have hearing loss that will then improve post reconstruction which can be months later.\n\nIn my case where they do both in one go I will have a longer surgery, a slightly longer recovery, hopefully some hearing improvements and then a second look surgery to confirm or exclude recurrence. \n\n4) you mentioned your mum doesen\u2019t want you going under, so perhaps you should ask about any risks from anaesthesia to your specific case? \n\nSo first of all if you are scared about Anesthesia PLEASE watch this video I found it very helpful. Please do not worry about the title! it is a video from a lovely anaesthesia specialist who explains why it is incredibly incredibly safe to go under in 2020: \n\n\nMy ent doctor laughed when I asked him about the risk of anaesthetic. I am  26 and in pretty good shape. He said that he did my procedure on a 90 year old woman with multiple heart and lung problems and that I have nothing to worry about. \n\nRegardless, I did my research and cut out alcohol from my diet and started working out pretty aggressively (cardio and kettlebells do wonder for my mood and keeping my anxiety low) just to make sure I am in the best possible shape for surgery! Keep in mind, I do not need to do this but I found it helpful for my mental health and peace of mind to know I am doing everything I can to kick some serious Cholesteatoma ass. \n\nPlease dm if you are scared. I am feeling worried, it is been a terrifying journey but  I am sure you are a strong enough person to resolve this issue surgery or not! \n\nStay strong, please try to like your normal life and do not let this annoying disease rule your life. Remember it is ok to be vulnerable! It is ok to be scared! do what makes you smile and talk to a therapist or loved one if it gets too much. \n\nI found the love of my friends, my family, exercise and painting to be my guiding light.  Please keep it up you are doing so much better than you think right now! \n\nI wish you all the best \ud83d\ude0a Yup I have had my cholesteatoma since I was a kid. I am in my late 20s not and it is been eating its way into my skull and has almost reached my brain. My doctor said it is better to have a safe ear, or else I would risk meningitis, paralysis, or other types of complications. I am getting my surgery in less than 24 hours. &gt;Stay strong, please try to like your normal life and do not let this annoying disease rule your life. Remember it is ok to be vulnerable! It is ok to be scared! do what makes you smile and talk to a therapist or loved one if it gets too much.\n\nI am going to surgery in less than 24 hours as well! Thank you for sharing your thoughts and insights as it is been helpful for me. That makes me so happy to hear!! I am sure we are both going to get through this and kick some ass tomorrow. \n\nIn doubt always remember what eowyn says in return of the king. \u201cCourage merry courage for our friends\u201d \n\nWere not alone, were stronger than we think. I would do it. If it is growing then there is no time like the present. It is too late for me now. My ear is completely garbage.  A doctor recommended a surgery for me years ago and I never went through with it. It is caught up to me and now parts of my ear cannot be repaired. My doctor told me that my cholesteatoma was not too bad and that I could probably wait. I had already dealt with a cholesteatoma once before when I was four years old that did a significant amount of damage so I opted for surgery immediately. After the surgery the doctor told me that it was significantly larger than what the CT scan showed and we made the right choice moving forward with the surgery immediately. My advice is to get rid of that thing and recover now while you still have your hearing and your life. Surgery update! 3hours in theatre but everything went fab, slight discomfort but feeling better already Can confirm what other people are saying here. \n\nMy surgery went well but they said some worrying damage could have happened if I fobbed it off", "Cholesteatoma vs Ear Infection Dear friends, \n\nI have been experiencing smelly earwax in my right ear for a few weeks now. I am not sure how this compares to the discharge you would usually have from a cholesteatoma, as I usually need to put my finger or a cotton swab in my ear in order to be able to smell the wax. I have no other symptoms usually associated with cholesteatoma (eg tinnitus, ear pain, etc.). I know the usual advice would be to seek medical advice, but I experience health anxiety and am trying to not go to the doctor's too often as it only validates the anxiety most of the time, rather than getting rid of a rational worry. \n\nDo you believe this could be cholesteatoma, from your experience? Was the discharge that you experienced runny, or was it mostly contained inside of your ear rather than spilling out? \n\nThank you very much. Cholesteatoma can only be seen through a CT or MRI scan, so do not worry your ear wax is not the determining factor here. If I were you, I would still seek advice from an ENT. It might just turn out you have a sinus infection or allergies etc - but I am no doctor so take my opinion lightly. I too have health anxiety, but over time you learn that it is better to take care of the issue than to ignore it! It can bring you some peace. Thank you for your response! I will wait a few weeks, and if the odour does not go away, I shall to for a check up. Hope you have a great day :).", "Third surgery.. Canal Wall Down this time Hey everyone!\nI had my first surgery in Dec 2018, had a second look surgery in August 2019. I was having symptoms again and went in last week and ENT confirmed that Cholesteatoma has returned and this time it is going to be a CWD surgery. Can anyone tell me what this is like? Specifically I wonder if anyone had a CWU and then a CWD and noticed an improvement in hearing (my hearing went down after first CWU surgery)? Is the CWD a giant hole in your ear canal? Any info would be welcomed! Canal wall down is the worst of them all. The first week post op is horrible. I couldnt stand up nor eat nor doing anything without having to feel like the whole world spinning. Expect a lot of throwing up when you wake from anesthesia also. However, it is for the best. It prevents cholesteatoma from coming back. Your hearing will be worse too, but not the end of the world compared to constant ear infections and surgeries. Best of luck. Take good care of yourself. Ask family members to help you on your first couple weeks after surgery. While everyone is different, I would not absolutely expect the throwing up? As I have talked about a bunch in this sub, I have had extensive procedures, CWU, CWD, craniotomy, tymp-mastoid, etc. On both sides and have never thrown up from anesthesia. CWD does not prevent Cholesteatoma from coming back, but it does make it take longer for it to come back. Cholesteatoma is generally caused by improper Eustachian tube function - even after all of my procedures with one of the best surgeons in the world, I have had regrowth twice. As far as the other person saying your hearing will be worse, that is only because your ear will be full of packing post surgery to help heal, some will dissolve and the rest removed and if there is no nerve damage or deep bone damage your healing will definitely improve. If you have had a CWU, you will be just fine - CWD, while it is a little more extensive - is for the better. And it is not a giant hole, they essentially shave a layer of skin from the entire  canal to remove the deep roots of Cholesteatoma. My surgeon is Dr. Daniel Lee from Massachusetts Eye and Ear. He is got some videos on YouTube talking about it with a PowerPoint presentation that may be helpful. Anyways, do not fret, you will do just fine and good luck! Have you had a CWU and CWD? Did you experience vomiting with both? Thanks for such a detailed answer. Curious if you experienced the dizziness/vertigo with your CWD that the other person mentioned? I have had both. I have cholesteatoma in both ears and have survived 5 surgeries. Only CWD made me vomit so much like to the point there was nothing left to throw up. I did not eat for a day or 2 Yikes. This will be #3 for me. Really hoping I am not going to experience the vomiting! Yes, very common. So much that it caused you to vomit? Not at all You have nerves that effect balance and dizziness in your ears, between the disease and the surgeries things are going to be disrupted.\nAlways had vertigo from Cholesteatoma, and slight dizziness post-op. Pain killers probably contribute to the effect as well. Interesting, he was my surgeon as well", "Should I get Surgery? My doctor said I have automastoiditis which looks like I already had surgery but I had not yet. It had eaten the bone that is usually grinded in surgery. I am worried that the cons may outweigh the pros of the procedure. \nHelp me decide please. I am not really sure if we have the same problem. Is the bone in question the ossicles? in which case I believe you could have artificial bones installed, or, as in my case, the bone on your skull, in which case my understanding being if allowed to continue will open the skull leading to meningitis.\n\nwhatever the case, as with any medical procedure, the prevention of further damage would outweigh any drawbacks of the operation. I honestly do not know if it is the ossicles or not. The doctor said that some of the bones have eroded. I hope that they will not have to resort to opening the skull if I do have it to that extent.\n\nThanks for the advice. Maybe after New year I will plan for surgery. My biggest concern is reading some of the studies that after surgery people can get facial paralysis. But I will try to push through the surgery with high hopes Unfortunately, I think that surgery is inevitable, although it is usually not an urgent situation (in most cases, but not all, of course). I understand your concerns about facial paralysis, but according to my surgeon (who is the leading surgeon for this procedure in my state), the statistics show this risk to be &lt;1%. I have the same thing going on right now and it is best to get the surgery...... this is my 3rd time with this and I am going in to surgery sometime in April-May In your experience how long does it take to organise surgery? Of course it depends on how busy the surgeon is. I have still to talk with the surgeon handling my case ( it will not be till next year) but I was assuming it would only be a month or two afterwards that they would do it. Usually a month or two like you said, sometimes he take longer but my surgeon is the best in my region, so it makes since. I do not think you can avoid surgery. If you leave it in there for too long, it would erode all the bones in there. I just my 4th surgery today on Christmas eve :) I have cholesteatoma in both ears. Please done ignore it, it is just going to get worse", "currently on day 4 of recovery :) feeling good &amp; grateful. left ear c-toma (actually 2!) removed. atticotomy. new eardrum made with tragus cartilage and chewing muscle fascia. total ossicular replacement titanium prosthesis. incus and stapes were destroyed. chorda tympani in tact!  Oof I only had one hearing bone replaced, how is your hearing doing 4 days in? I imagine little to no sound? I think it is currently improved compared to pre-op, but it might be the packing offering more sound conduction than I am used to receiving. I am trying not to get my hopes up because I know the primary goal is a healthy, safe and dry ear. we will see! *fingers crossed* but right now I am very sensitive to sound in that ear. Word! A healthy ear is the best ear, it def will go through a lot phases over the next few weeks, wishing you a good + speedy recovery. thank you kindly", "Hello, I had cholesteatoma surgery in august. Today, my right ear has been popping and making noises. I guess is the best way to explain it\u2026 is this normal? On and off today, this morning and just now lasts a few minutes or so. ", "No sign of Cholesteatoma. Could CT scan be wrong. Fell ill today, so I went to hospital. Had blood Test and CT scans because I informed the doctor about my Cholesteatoma. When we got the results there was no sign of my Cholesteatoma. Doctor said different CT scans are different sizes, and my sister is a trained radiology technician who told me it is MRI\u2019s that detect soft tissue Cholesteatoma, CT scan looks at the bone. Is it very possible that the CT scan today could be wrong. I just had two CT scans two weeks ago and no one mentioned a missing Cholesteatoma. Have not even heard from who,ever ordered more scans. Got called back by my ENT\u2019s office. Despite describing where my tumour was the doctor that examined the CT scans had looked where a normal Cholesteatoma is, not my rare form. That is why he did not see it.", "Post op feedback. Guys I had my surgery 1 month and 5 days ago, before the surgery my hearing was much better than now, unfortunately it didnt get better but I have a feeling that something is stuck in my ear. As well it is still leaking at nights when i sleep on my right side. Can anyone relate, hearing will get better ? What should I expect, or I just have to accept that I will not be able to hear anymore with that ear and that is it. Hey, I had my surgeries over three years ago. Have you had reconstructive surgery or just removal? I can say that your hearing will likely never be the same in that ear and that feeling of something stuck in there does not really go away... it sucks but it gets better, I promise. I find falling asleep is the time I notice it the most, I usually put a tv show on or some music and it gets to the point you can hardly notice at all. \n\nI hope this helps and if you have any questions at all feel free to dm me. Keep the head up man. Also leaking will be normal for a little while longer. If you have any concerns, please do not hesitate to call your doctor and ask questions when at your check ups. Also the leaking will be normal for a little while longer. As always, never hesitate to ask your doctor questions or concerns. I had just the removal. So for my hearing to get better I should have a construction of the ear right ? Yes, but in the terms of \"better\" can range from a lot of things depending on the extent of the cholesteatoma that developed. When I got my reconstructive surgery after 6 months (to ensure that it does not develop again), my ear felt less clogged and my hearing was slightly better. I also had a bone in my ear removed due to it, so I am not sure if you would need reconstructive procedure done.\n\n   My advice to you, to be honest, is do not expect your hearing to be the same ever again in that ear unfortunately. It can get better though. Thanks for answering me though. Honestly this is what I thought, still have 1 ear left and hearint is good, but because of that now I will leave music producing and dj-ing:) will start looking for new hobies Probably a smart move, though an unfortunate one. Maybe you can find a way to keep at your passions while still protecting your ears? Anyway I hope things look up for you and I am glad I could help in what small way I could. I suppose music production will not serve me anymore since I was just a beginner, will keep dj-ing as it makes me feel alive most of the time. thanks once again mate and wish you good luck in all what you are doing Is your surgeon planning a second look surgery? After my removal the hearing chain was not reconstructed until my second look surgery. Perhaps that is the plan for you as well? I think so, but I am not sure, he informed me that I will keep seeing him for the next half a year and after a computer tomograph. If it will show signs of cholesteatoma formed then I will have another surgery, the thing is I am leaving in Moldova(you may google it, but it is poorest country from Europe) and it is very hard to have a good surgeon as you guess. I had to ask my surgeon questions that I have seen from this subreddit and also what I have read online, he does not update me so much about what is going on and that is very sad. He is a good surgeon by the way but I am sure he did not get the right curriculum to explain me everything same as in other countries are doing, but it is what it is and I cannot complain about it since at the moment is very hard to get a surgery, we dont have enough spaces because of covid:)", "Need some help regarding symptoms after removal. So I had two procedures when I was 8 and 10. Both to remove cholesteatomas. The second procedure was also a \u201cwall down\u201d procedure so the canal was widened and stuff so when it comes back they can remove it with regular cleanings rather than surgery. \n\n\nAnyways, not sure if any of you guys have had this issue before but sometimes I get drainage that smells bad.  It is been almost two years since the last time I had it happened but it is starting again now. I am supposed to do irrigation\u2019s with water and vinegar regularly but after Covid hit and I was dealing with all of that I kind of stopped doing that. \n\nI was just wondering if any of you have ever experienced the drainage that smells and how did you fix it or deal with it?   \n\nIt is been 11 years since my last surgery and about a year and a half since my last cleaning. (Supposed to be every 6 months but my life has been crazy and then Covid hit, so I will be going again shortly.) I forgot to mention my second procedure got rid of the mastoid bone.    I honestly do not know if this is common for you guys but apparently I have a few tiny cavities in my ear canal that the drainage comes from?  That is why the mastoid reconstruction is not the best option for me because the risk of them not entirely emptying one of those cavities and then completely sealing it would be bad. Bc I get reoccurring cholesteatomas. So I do not consider the risk worth it. Hi. I am sorry you are having trouble! My daughters  C-toma required a canal wall down with mastoidectomy.  She has not had any drainage from the ear since then, but any drainage that has a scent should be looked at right away!  You could have a small infection that if left alone could turn into a large one! In the past before her canal wall down she had several canal wall ups.  And many times she would get drainage that smelled bad.  In fact it happened so often I would regularly smell her ear to see if I thought she needed to see her ent.  If it was my daughter I would start her on cipro drops until I could get her into her ent. This is what her ent has advised me to do in the past to tide her over until we could get there in the next day or 2. I am not a dr, nor do I pretend to be but I thought I would share what I would do (not necessarily what you should do)", "Facial paresis from Cholesteatoma I found out I had Cholesteatoma when I was in fourth grade. Had 3 surgeries to remove it. In 7th grade I developed a tumor-like cyst and I had surgery to remove that. During this surgery they cut my facial nerve and did not realize it until post-op. I had surgery the following Friday to attempt to piece my facial nerve back together. I am now 24 and Cholesteatoma free (after 8 surgeries). I have about 15% hearing in my \u201cbad ear\u201d. But that is not what I struggle with. To this day I still struggle with the way my face looks. It is not drooping terribly or effecting my vision. But looking in the mirror can be so draining on some days. I was wondering if there is anyone else out there with a similar experience. Does it ever get easier? I thought 10+ years would bring some progression but sometimes I feel like I am losing my confidence as I get older (I am also a female). I would love some support and advice :)", "Feels like my ear bone is popping out of my ear. Not officially diagnosed, but saw my primary and  he wants an ENT to take a look. Honestly, I was a nurse and diagnosed myself about 2 weeks ago. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with this. Its like a bone is coming up to my ear. Why would you not go to a doctor for this? I really did not want to believe it. I made 9 billion excuses. I just had a mass removed from spine last August and was hospitalized for almost 5 months. The thought of having another surgery made me physically sick.\nLike I said after 2 weeks I went to my primary and he agreed with what I thought and wrote me a referral for a specific ENT. Plus I work in a hospital doing cardiac monitoring/interpretations, and with this whole covid 19 bs , I have working full throttle.\nYes, I am full of excuses. Yes, nurses make the worst patients. But it is gotten to the point that it is really uncomfortable and I need to rectify the issue ASAP! It is kind of starting to freak me the eff out. Make sure they do a CT scan to properly diagnose it. I never really felt anything. I had earaches/infections when I was younger.  Daily ear drainage all through my adult life. Then severe hearing loss in my late 30's to early 40's. Depends what you mean by \"popping\".  Do you feel a mass or something solid inside your middle ear which feels like its poking you?  It could be a cholesteatoma, as that fits the definition of the condition. I vaguely recall feeling something like that, although it was not a sharp poke ... just felt like a blocked ear, but something that seemed to move around a bit when I shook my head around.  It was not painful - just annoying. As for the word you used of \"popping\" ... I had a popping sound like you get when you equalise your ears, but I believe that was the cholesteatoma causing that sound.  Let us know what the ENT finds. I will thank you. I have only one other issue my ears. Also my right ear. I punctured the ear drum or something. I did not ear issues as a kid. Thank you again. I really appreciate it. And I am so sorry that it has affected your hearing so badly. Yeah! I had that too! I do not even know how to describe it. There is something in my ear. It is hard and its causing pressure in my ear. I can physically feel when I touch my ear. It is like a bone is coming from inside moving out of my ear. I am sorry if that is a sucky description but, I have no other way to describe it. And I really appreciate you guys taking the time to answer me. I am sorry I cannot give a better description. Sounds like mastoiditis. I had a bilateral mastoidectomy when I got my first extraction surgeries, it is comorbid with the presence of c-toma. See if you can at least get antibiotics? And a CT scan/MRI as others have suggested. Been diagnosed 2 months ago. Doctor said i have an early form and we found it fast. I forgot to tell him about this sound u describe. About 1 year ago it started as a sharp clink i heard when i was walking and now i hear it when i shook my head but its a deeper sound. I also hear the popping sound when i yawn or swallow and i also have tinnitus non stop. Sorry for my english. Your English is fine. And thank you for taking the time to respond! I know what clinking sound you are talking about. The part that is freaking me out is the pressure in my ear and that feeling that something is in there.  My GP is the best. He treats me like a colleague more than a patient. I am on dioxocil 500 mg po 2x/day for a +MSSA infection to my spine/discs. A SE from the mass that was there. He gave me Cipro ear drops and Levaquin 500mg daily for ten days, on top of my other ABT.\nI am still trying to find ENT who takes my insurance but, my primary will give me the scripts for the necessary tests.\nThank you so much for helping me out. 25 years of nursing and I never heard of this. Thanks again. I posted in this subject when I had my surgery if you want to take a look back. It was totally worth it. My hearing is so much better. Good luck! Cholesteatoma is the bitchiest of bitches. Hoping for your sake it is just a bacterial infection that can be cured up\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb Oh God! I hope so! Thank you so much!

One main question I have for those who have gone through the surgery, how long did it take to truly recover to go back to work? Doctor gave me 2 weeks sick leave.\n\nPost surgery you will have occasional dizziness, so stay safe, avoid activities that required concentration (i.e., driving).\n\nHoping for your speedy recovery. Welcome to the team. I did not get my surgery ear packing out for over 2 weeks and then I was told to keep it clean. Dr gave me a month off. I felt like I could get back to work after a week but mine was only 1 ear. You are going to have hearing loss and you need to expect that. You are probably going to need hearing aids. I would say the time you take off depends on your employment. Thank you for the info.  My doctor said about a week, which just did not seem right to me.  I drive a lot for my job and need to figure out the best time to get this done. Thanks. I am having one ear done at a time. The worse one (left ear) I am pretty much deaf in already.  I am starting to lose hearing in my right ear too which prompted me to finally go get it seen by a specialist.  I know I screwed up my hearing by waiting all of these years.  Uggh I think it depends on the approach, with a longer recovery if they have to go through your mastoid. I had one combined approach surgery, through the canal and mastoid, and a later surgery just through the canal which was a much shorter recovery. They told me both were absolutely necessary and I ended up deaf in one ear, which was the best possible outcome. tbh my hearing was better before the surgery. I know its degenerative but I have been having regrets about having it done. Surgery and everything went well I just wasnt prepared for them to take 2 hearing bones out when I wasnt warned, it was an in operation decision. So as much as you may regret waiting it might not have turned out any better. Good luck buddy. Thanks for your post, and first and foremost, please try not to worry (I know it can be hard).  Remaining positive throughout this will help.\n\nI am around your age too, had hearing symptoms for a while, was formally diagnosed in January, and had my first surgery in May.  The surgery was pleasantly easy.  I stayed in hospital overnight, and went home the next day.  To be honest, I felt I could have gone back to work after 2 days, but the surgeon said take 2 weeks off and just rest.  I found I slept a lot the day after surgery, but that was probably just my body re-adjusting after the anesthetic.  My ear continued to bleed a little bit over those 2 weeks, and I slept with a protective cover on my pillow.  There was no pain, just the slight bleeding was annoying to clean up.  I had the 2 weeks off, and then went back to work, good as gold.\n\nI have had 2 checkups with the ENT since the operation, and all is looking good.  My next checkup is in 3 months, at which point I am guessing we will start to plan surgery #2 (i.e. 12 months after the first surgery) where the ENT will go back in, check the ensure the cholesteatoma has not come back (around a 10% chance it will), and in that same operation he will look to put in prosthetic hearing bones (I think?) if its all clear.  Fingers crossed it goes to plan.\n\nSo that is where I am at.  No pain in the affected ear, I but a continual tinnitus like ringing, and cannot hear anything on that side.  The whole ear and mastoid area is still numb too, but apparently that is normal and can last a few months.\n\nApart from trying to reassure you that it will all go well, the only other advice I can give you is to get a haircut before your surgery.  Oh, and get a shower cap, so you can cover your ear when you shower.  Please keep us updated how you go. That is good to hear. I really appreciate the feedback.  The hair is already short so that will be no problem.   Thank you so much. Wow that is very promising. Thank you for sharing.", "Getting My Hearing Back (Mastoidectomy Surgery + Recovery) ", "Opinions on symptoms Hi all, \nI know I should get a professional opinion but I have been scared to follow through ever since going in and being diagnosed with swimmers ear. I Did the antibiotics but symptoms persisted. Are the following symptoms pointing towards cholesteatoma? Btw this is in both ears. \n-Ears feeling full \n-Pressure \n-Occasional muffled hearing \n-Clicking when I turn my head certain ways \n-Tight jaw \n-Itchy ear mostly in the mornings \n-Occasional vertigo and tinnitus  \n-I do not feel pain, just uncomfortable sometimes \n-also I do not have any discharge or fluid leaking from either ear. \n-no paralysis although it feels like all my neck/face/jaw muscles are tense and tight. \nI can literally feel an M&amp;M sized lump right between upper jaw and ear canal. It seems to move around a bit. \n\nI feel like I have symptoms of TMJ and cholesteatoma, but it also feels like maybe I have a big blockage of impacted ear wax? \nAnyone have similar symptoms? I am going crazy trying to self diagnose. I bi*#!ed out of my last appointment. \n\nThanks for reading this and I appreciate any responses. If you do not have a cholesteatoma now, you stand a good chance of getting one by letting those symptoms persist. See a doctor before inaction leads to damage of the vital mechanics of your inner ear. For all we know those could just be the wrong antibiotics. You really should see your doctor. We cannot answer anything over the internet as the symptoms you describe can have many causes. Even though you are scared to follow through, you are more likely tor get an answer, which again gives you fewer things to worry about. Your condition vill certainly not improve if you leave it as it is, and can, with time, lead to devastating consequences, which again will require many more trips to the ear doctor in the future. The sooner you sort this out, the better!", "Over a decade later, still getting infections I had a cholesteatoma in my left ear that corroded the hearing bones and to remove it the doctor had to remove my mastoid. I know this is common for this condition, but 14 years later I still get infections and major drainage. I am not sure why, since I was only 16 or 17, but I never had a canal reconstruction. I played football at the time and I think the concern was that it could be damaged, even after I fully recovered from surgery. \n\nMy question is, is it normal to have continuous issues like I am having and is it too late to do anything about it? This is exactly what happened to me- I keep getting recurring ear infections and I went to a specialist and I am on the waiting list for mastoid reconstructive surgery. The doctor is going to use artificial cartilage to fill the cavity where my mastoid was in the Hope's that it stops the infections. I was due to get the surgery this summer but then Corona happened so I have no idea when it will be now If you do not mind me asking, where are you located? I am in the uk I sill have them too. Eustachian tube dysfunction. Switching from hearing aids to a BAHA helps a bit if you wear them. I have had mastoid reconstructive surgery with Bonalive granules, was this not considered as an option by your ENT? Wow! Very similar experience! I still have infections and drainage every once in awhile- my Eustachian Tube seems to also heavily drain into my mouth once a month.", "Surgery scheduled for next week, wondering about recovery time Hey all, I got diagnosed with a small cholesteatoma back in early September, but was not able to schedule a surgery until next week due to Covid. Obviously my priority is getting my ear properly treated, but I am also curious about my recovery time, especially as it pertains to my ability to start exercising after the surgery. I was wondering how long after surgery do most people get the go-ahead to start lifting heavy things again? Lifting and strenuous activity? Probably two weeks. I have a very low impact job and my surgeon recommended 2 weeks recovery. Two weeks before lifting heavy things is a good start, but you should let your ENT check you weekly and then give you green light. Hopefully that will end up being the case! Nice \u2014 I will check with my doctor for my expected timeframe as well. It depends if they need to remove your mastoid bone or not. My surgeon was unsure if it would be necessary, until he could see behind the eardrum during the surgery. It was necessary and so my recovery is longer. 6 weeks before lifting anything heavy. I am at 3 weeks and the vertigo symptoms  finally finished a few days ago, but I still feel weak and tired. I wish the recovery was faster. You have to sleep upright after the surgery and I find it difficult to get restful sleep, especially with the increased tinnnitus post-op. It gets better with time. \n\nNot trying to be negative, but this is the kind of insider info I was looking for before my own surgery. All the best. Hey, thanks for letting me know. Wishing you a speedy recovery man. My son had surgery on the 4th, and he is already back to normal.  He is not to do heavy lifting, but he felt pretty good in less than a week.  \n\nGood luck with your surgery, and I hope you recover quickly! Thanks so much, wishing the best for you and your son as well!", "Extreme vertigo ear fullness So I previously had Cholesteatoma in my right ear.  My doctor put a tube in it and drained it, we did not want to take it out cause it would cause more hearing loss.  I ruptured my eardrum again 6 weeks ago and was not really consistent with the ear drops and antibiotics.  5 days ago I got really bad vertigo where I am spinning which I have never had it like this before.  Went to my ent today and he said it looks clean could not see any cholesteatoma.  I had the cholesteatoms removed 7 years ago and have not been doing checkups unless I have an issue.  I am really scared he wants to do a ct scan and I am worried that it is further in my head.  Does anyone have a similar situation to this?  What was your diagnosis?  I am just wondering if I have meniers or labrynthitis.  I am really worried I have a toddler and it is hard to do things with her cause I keep losing my balance. Many years ago I started going deaf in my right ear and had bouts of debilitating dizziness. I was diagnosed with menieres. Last year I had more dizziness and my gp ordered an MRI/CT. It revealed I had a congenital cholesteatoma in my right temporal bone. Apparently I\u2019be had it all my life but on the numerous times I would had a scan of my head the examiners never saw it as they did not know to look. With the virus situation I have been unable to go interstate to have it removed. I actually saw my initial ENT yesterday to go over some MRIs last week. The tumour is rather big but apparently has not grown any since last year. The ENT could not say anymore since as the cholesteatoma is in the bone it is not his specialty. His colleague was supposed to be organising an operation but has not been able to travel interstate to discuss it. That is what I am afraid is happening to me.  I had it cleaned out 7 years ago and about 3 years ago he did a debreement in office.  I have never had vertigo before until last week.  I am wondering if the surgery solves the spinning sensation.  I hope you get yours figured out I have to do audio test first then I will schedule my ct scan. May I ask is there any way to subside the dizzy spells?  It is driving me insane and making me so upset I am a very active person and have a motorcycle and literally cannot do anything right now. Well, when it was thought to be menieres disease I was prescribed Stemetil for the dizziness. Do you still take it even though you found out the true problem?  And thanks for responding it is nice to have someone to talk to about this with. I actually have not taken it for ages. When I had an attack of diziness I would take a stemetil tablet, but I had not had a serious attack for years. I was slowly going deaf in my right ear and 2 or 3 years ago I went compeltely deaf in that ear. I never mentioned it to my GP as it could not get any worse. Last year I did not have such bad vertigo but I became off balance generally. That is when investigation found I had a large tumour inside my ear against my skull. I am sorry to hear that we are a rare breed, this shit sucks.  Hopefully my dizziness subsided I do not know how I am going to work or drive anywhere like this. I should probably elaborate that my Cholesteatoma is not the ordianry kind but instead a much rarer type in the bone rather than in the ear canal itself. Oh yeah you mentioned that I have the ear canal one obviously.  Well I hope everything goes smoothly it seems on this Reddit a lot of people are better off having the surgery and regaining some hearing.  I am hoping if I need surgery I can regain some hearing back or at least keep it the same but I doubt it.... Not a doctor this is not medical advice but a cholesteatoma is something that needs to be removed. It can kill you. It can grow and lead to a cerebro-spinal fluid leak which can give you meningitis which might kill you. It killed famous playwright Oscar Wilde since there was no treatment for it back then. Find a surgeon who will remove it. Your hearing is unfortunately secondary to the cholesteatoma.", "Hello i had cholesteatoma surgery 21 years ago I was 7 years old when I got my cholesteatoma surgery, I never went back for check up because it was 2 hours away but am regularly seeing a ent again. I have had tubes numerous times, and also had the big white ball on my head. I am curious who else has had the surgery and would like to talk in the comments.", "Mastoid obliteration Hey everyone! I have got my second surgery in one week and I am super nervous! Has anyone had a mastoid obliteration?? Yes, you can DM me if you have any questions/anxieties Amazing thank you !", "Just diagnosed Hey guys I am new to this as I have just gotten a diagnosis after getting a CT scan. For as long as I can remember I have always had problems in my right ear with chronic infections and whatnot.\n\nI feel generally fine about this surgery, but what I am\nMost worried about is when I am getting put under. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with that or any stories to share? I am sick of feeling so nervous and counting down the days for the procedure. Any information would be appreciated. Ugh I absolutely hate needles but I will be fine I am sure. \n\nAlso super happy to know a community for cholesteatoma exists, reading through this sub has already relieved some fear from me. Thanks for reading I have had the surgery twice and I am a medical student who is aspiring to become an anesthesiologist. I would be happy to answer any questions about being put under that you have, I would also be happy to answer questions through private messages.\n\nTo put it shortly: being put under is like blinking. The best way to know what it feels like is to open the photo gallery on your phone and look at a certain picture, then scroll to another one. As crazy as it sounds, that is what anesthesia feels like.\n\nFeel free to ask me any other questions. The only needle I got was for the IV. That was in the pre-op room. After that, it was anasthesia in my IV bag and a mask for 30 seconds before I passed out. It was not a needle-heavy procedure. \n\nGood luck! I was worried too before the procedure. Just give yourself time to recover afterwards. It is taking me a while to get 100% of my balance back. Thanks so much for your reply as I wish u luck in medical school! I have been put under for wisdom teeth surgery but I feel maybe it is a different feeling when the surgery duration may be longer, such as this procedure. Luckily I do remember feeling like it was a blink of an eye so I have comfort in knowing that.\n\nHowever, I just hate the feeling of my arm getting tight and numb before they put the IV in. Do you have any advice for that and how to chill out. Also, do they have any sort of calming medication before the operation? When they put the IV in, was that a generally smooth and easy process? Also thank you for taking the time to share with me I appreciate it so much It will probably feel the same, because the surgery to remove a cholesteatoma is not really considered a long surgery. The only thing that might happen, happened to me, is that you dream for a short while after 'waking up' from anesthesia. This might give you the illusion that you slept which makes it feel like time has passed.\n\nRegarding the IV, just remember that the person that is going to insert it has been doing it for years on a daily basis. He/She will probably be very good at it, which makes it very likely to succeed on the first try.\n\nOn the case of calming medication, this really depends on the country and doctor. In the USA calming medication is more common and more standard procedure to administer to patients. In Europe it is less common to be the standard procedure. If the anesthesiologist notices that you are nervous he/she can offer to inject some of the calming agent into the IV. It is completely safe, but it might make you go under before the actual induction of anesthesia is supposed to occur. This is also completely safe if it happens. I had my first ever surgery this year and I was scared of going under, it is literally like blinking! I did not even know I fell asleep and then I just woke up and it was done! They gave me some oxygen to calm down talking about random stuff, they put the anaesthesia through my cannula and all was good! Thanks for sharing (: I feel better knowing that it is like blinking and not some horrible experience! Yep it was quick. My general rule is not to watch when they put it in, then it does not upset me. Quick pinch then not much afterwards. I had one in for 2 hours as I waited in pre-op and it was not a big deal. I was able to go use the washroom while moving the IV cart around. Slightly uncomfortable, but doable.\n\nAlso the time between getting on the table and passing out was less than 2 minutes which was faster than I expected. Anasthesia is not like a dream, more like fast-forwarding. The groggyness, however, persists for a while. Expect your balance to be slightly off and take care to avoid falling. I saw a youtube report of a guy fainting in hospital, so I took extra care to look for guardrails in my foggy post-surgery state. You do not want to turn your head too quickly or look down suddenly or you can get dizzy. Am I the only one here who had surgery to remove cholesteatoma without general anesthesia? :D I was sedated but awake during the whole thing, I remember hearing the surgeons chipping away from my skull. :D", "Having trouble opening my mouth and speaking. 1 month post-op.

Anyone one else have this? How long can I expect this soreness to last? Thanks! Has the pain been happening since the surgery? I had sudden jaw pain about 2 months post op because my jaw muscles had weakened on the cholesteatoma side of my face, but doing jaw exercises and trying to chew gum on that side helped.

It might be from the surgery or it might be from something else. It is impossible for anyone to give you a proper answer without getting a look at your ear.", "Tympanomastoidectomy, what to expect? I am having this surgery done Weds for removal of a cholesteatoma.  I do not really know what to expect after the surgery, and I have about a thousand questions!\n\nHow much pain am I likely to experience and for how long?\n\nHow long will I likely have to wait until I can wash my hair properly again?\n\nHow long until I can drive again?\n\nWhen will I likely be able to new hearing aids?\n\nWill they put me to sleep for this or just give me an anesthetic so I do not feel it?\n\nWould I be best to mostly shave my head beforehand so my hair does not get in the way?\n\nANY reassurance or anything about recovery time and process would be helpful.  I confess, I am really stressed about this! I was in the same boat as you almost a year to the date. I had my tympanomastoidectectomy June 11, 2020; like you, I had MANY of the same questions. \n\n1. The pain is definitely painful, but bearable, the doctors prescribed me some heavy loaded meds- I decided to not take them and switched off between ibuprofen and Tylenol every 6-8 hours. The most pain I had was not with my ear, but with my neck and surrounding muscles to lift my head, eat, or look left to right. You are pretty much a vegetable for a week until your body can regain the strength to do normal day activities. I recommend sleeping elevated to help with the struggle of lifting your head. I also had some trouble with my jaw feeling crooked and this is because of being intubated for over 6 hours, it is very strenuous on your mouth. This caused some trouble eating and always wanting sprite soda to help with the scratchy feeling in my throat! \n\n2. I waited a week to wash my hair, some say to wait longer but I had long hair at the time and could not deal with it being so greasy. Allocate someone you trust to help you bathe for the first week, you do not want to get any part of your ear wet, and you are very limited to how much you can move in general- find a buddy/parent to help. I did not wash my hair properly for nearly two months because I was scared to get water in my ear. But once I could hold my head up and move freely I frequently got baths to wash my hair since I could dip my head in without submerging my ear. \n\n3. It took about a month or so for me to drive again, mainly because of the immobility from my neck, I wanted to make sure I was safe to look quickly in any direction while I was driving. \n\n4. I still do not have hearing aids and my hearing has improved 25% since surgery, I will be going for another surgery in August to complete an ossicular chain reconstruction- pretty much a titanium rod connected my middle ear bones together since the cholesteatoma only eroded away my second bone. After this surgery I should have 70-80% hearing back in my right ear. \n\n5. You will for SURE be knocked out for this surgery!!!\n\n6. I was super worried my head would need shaved, but my doctor made the incision super close to where my ear meets my head. The scar is hardly noticeable. However, this may not be the case for you, I would recommend just putting your hair up in a braid or pony tail before surgery. I would recommend a tight French brain because since you cannot wash your hair for a week anyway it can just stay up and out of your face and ear as it is healing. If they need to shave it I would assume they would let you know. \n\n\nAfter surgery you will likely have a cup on your ear, I called it my helmet lol. This cup will be super uncomfortable, and you will not be able to sleep on that side for a while. It is crazy uncomfortable, and there were nights I definitely cried because I wanted to lay on my right side. \n\nYour ear will start to get feeling back to \u201cnormal\u201dafter a few weeks and be prepared to feel sharp pinches while this is happening. The nerves are literally growing back into your ear so do not panic!! This is a good sign. I would recommend sleeping with your helmet for month or so to make sure the healing process is healthy and fast. You will not want to sleep on that side anyway because it will almost hurt your ear. \n\nYour ear will pop and feel very full of water for a good bit. It is a bit disorienting but you will get used to it and it will not last too terribly long. \n\n\nI hope this helps you get some answers if you have more questions feel free to ask! Join the Facebook group titled \"cholesteatoma-the hidden disease\" tons of people on there! I got the transcanal endoscopic ear surgery a week and a half ago. It differs in because the surgeon did all the work in the ear canal and not cutting behind my ear and doing open ear surgery. I cannot answer to the recovery time for the more invasive surgery, but I can tell you how I am feeling after a week and a half and what happened shortly post op.\n\nYour pain level will likely be much higher than mine. I was prescribed tramadol which helped tremendously. I paired it with Tylenol for the first couple of days, never exceeding the recommended dosage for each. I also used decongestant. You pain will like last much longer than mine, but I would say the pain subsided to tolerable levels without meds after 4 days.\n\nI waited 2 full days to shower, but since I do not have a large exposed wound like you would, showering is not a big issue. The annoying part is putting a vaseline coated cotton ball in my ear every time I shower.\n\nI did not drive for a week because of the meds. Strong painkillers make it difficult to drive and it is very unsafe. I suggest taking a week off of work and getting enough food and necessities in that time so you can just stay home and rest. When I did start driving a week later, my left ear was deaf(still kind of is) so my situational awareness was at an all time low. You hear everything in just one ear so your brain is trying to process everything. Sounds become fuzzy and you do not get to selectively hear anything with just one working ear. Take it easy while driving as noises you have became accustomed to are gone, and you will hear new weird noises as your brain gets used to gathering information from just one ear.\n\nMy follow up is this Thursday so I will find out about hearing aids and further surgeries.\n\nYou will be put under. The surgery will be a blink of an eye for you but 2-3 hours for everyone else.\n\nNo, you do not need to shave your head. \n\nI know our surgeries are different but I hope this helps. Got my tympanomastoidectomy on the 28th, thanks for leaving all this here!  It is really helpful to see what others experienced.  \n\nDid you have any neck pain before having surgery?  Out of all the symptoms that has actually been the worse one for me so far.  Curious if I should expect that to be extra bad after surgery or not. Yes!! That was especially painful unfortunately my son has had two timpanoplasties when he was 15 and 16. He is 17 and about to have another timpanoplasty:(hes allergic to pain meds! he was in pain the next day pretty significantly. It got better and he didnt have pain thankfull after a week. I hear sometimes pain is bad, it hasnt been so far for him. I think they told us 72 hours. We went a day beyond that for hair washing. They will def. put you to sleep. dont shave your head. Its unlikely that they will shave enough to be obvious. stress makes it worse. i always make sure he has a clean room beforehand and a clean bathtub and lots of snacks and popcicles and drinks and people to love on him. Youll be fine.", "My pearly journey (+ recurrence with new symptoms?) Heyy everyone!\n\nI am 25f from Europe, I was so surprised and thrilled at the same time to find a subreddit about this diagnosis and the access to share experience and information! I am partially deaf on left ear due to this condition and have a constant bilateral tinnitus.\n\nAs a toddler I have had bouts of acute otitis media episodes and some  eustachian tube malfunctioning due to which I have undergone a surgery where they inserted some kind of a tube in my ear and  took it out later. This mostly affected my left side on which I have been always hard of hearing ever since.\n\nWhen I was 16 my then-classmates brought into my attention how  freakin deaf I have gradually become, I would not respond to my name even when they stood close to me, additionally it was only then I  noticed how much I rely on reading lips to understand. Few months later my ear starts producing a pinkish discharge and feels pressured so I finally roll myself into the ENT office. \n\nLong story short after MRI and CT scans they cut me open to take out the pearl and replace my anvil bone (which the pearl has eagerly munched on) with a titanium one - it all happened quite fast. I recovered from the surgery and went on eartroubles-free for about 2 years when the same scenario has replicated (discharge, pressure). This time doctor informs me there is a chronic inflammation present and my ear has rejected and plopped the fake anvil almost out of the ear itself. The recovery after the second surgery was much harder, opiod medicine was not cutting it for the radiating pain. \n\nNow it is 4 years later. \nI changed countries and no longer have the specialists at hand which were taking care of my ear since childhood basically.\nI have my first appointment with the ENT here on friday.\nA month ago I first experienced the 'rollercoaster' - I shift my eyesight/head slightly and the whole room goes spinning - and I do not mean I get dizzy or lightheaded, but proper \"IcantFocusOnAnyObjectWtfIsGoingOn\" spinning feeling of your vision and body like when you exit a ride in an amusement park which was spinning you vigorously for 20 minutes. This intense sensation lasts about 30 seconds to a minute where I have to just hold on to anything near me and wait for it to stabilize a bit. Afterwards I get sick to my stomach (just like after rollercoaster or a car ride) and for the rest of the day (or night, it usually happens later in the day) until I fall asleep Im walking and the ground is unstable, wonky, like Im stepping on water. \n\nThis has been happening now from 2-3 times per week to almost daily. I noticed my left ear is more wet than the other. \n\nI am curious what is your experience, have you encountered any vertigo related issues on your journey?\n\n I do not have it confirmed yet that it is related to the pearly ear in my case - but my gut feeling is going off like there is not even a chance that it is not. \n\nThank you all and best of luck. I used to have periodic loss of equilibrium. First time it happened I was in town and after sitting down by the side of the road stumbled to the hospital a few blocks away where they gave me stematil and I had to take a taxi home. Afterwards I was diagnosed with Menieres Disease. That lasted until about 2 years ago, when not having had vertigo for years I started to have loss of balance. After an MRI and CT scan a congenital cholesteatoma was discovered ( they would just missed it the numerous times I would had a scan). I am still waiting for treatment because with the pandemic and no one on the island where I live being experienced enough to treat it I cannot travel interstate nor can the specialist expected to discuss my case with experts. Glad they eventually managed to catch it!

I see my ENT/surgeon on Monday to discuss recent MRI's and upcoming surgery. I am still really nervous, but everyone here has been making it just a bit more bearable. Thank you You will be just fine.

I know I will be fine but....I am still so nervous. Thank you!!! I know the feeling all too well. I have had 2 mastoidectomy procedures and 4 craniotomy surgeries for severe bilateral Cholesteatoma and tumor growth. They never seem to get easier. Omg that sounds horrible, I am so sorry you had to go through all that!! Sometimes I wish I could just get rid of my ears/hearing all together so I would never have to deal with any of this. I My first surgery is in a couple weeks so I can relate ): if u need someone to talk to I am always a message away! Good luck, and thank you! I am sure we will be absolutely fine\ud83e\udd17", "Had tympanoplasty about 10 years ago. My ear has not been the same since but it seems to be getting worse. Does it look like a growth or my ear canal skin is growing over my eardrum? ", "Recently discovered cholesteatoma after a year of ignoring symptoms. Booked for surgery soon. Can people share their experiences? Anything I should be aware of afterwards? Have had constant tinnitus, feeling of fullness/blocked ear, conductive hearing loss in my right ear for about a year now. I ignored the symptoms up until a couple months ago and have now found I have a cholesteatoma which has caused the bones in my middle ear to have been eaten away. My ear drum is apparently like cling wrap. \n\nBeen told I need a tympanoplasty where they will take cartilage from my ear to make a new ear drum. A titanium prosthesis to rebuild the ossicular chain and obviously they will be removing the cholesteatoma. \n\nWas wondering if anyone could share their experiences with surgery? How did they feel after? Was there much pain? Did tinnitus subside or get worse once healed? Was anyone so dizzy that they were actually sick after surgery? Did hearing return close to normal? \n\nSorry for the long post! Hi, and welcome to the subreddit!  Firstly, I want to let you know that everything will be fine, and its not as bad an experience as you might be thinking.  Remain positive, and your journey will be a breeze :-)\n\nYour symptoms sounds **exactly** like what I had in late 2018 ... blocked ear, left it too long, continual tinnitus, and I also had some vertigo and a strange rattle in my ear every now and then. I went to the GP, she flushed out my ear a couple of times with warm water to no improvement, so referred me to an ENT, who then sent me for a CT scan and hearing test, and that is how I was diagnosed.\n\nMy first surgery was in mid-2019 and like you, a large part of my hearing bones had been destroyed by the cholesteatoma. In the surgery (about 4 hours), they cleared it out, and removed the damaged hearing bones. I was quite nervous before this surgery, but it was way easier than I was expecting. The only discomfort was from the bandage wrapped around my head which was a bit too tight.  I stayed in hospital overnight, and was discharged the next morning. Had 2 weeks off work, then back after that, although to be honest, I felt I could have gone back to work after a couple of days. Had a bit of bleeding from the ear, but no pain, dizzyness, or anything (except for the tinnitus which was still there, although I had been used to it so it did not worry me).\n\nI then had to wait another 9 months until my second surgery where they opened me up again to check to ensure it had not come back, then installed prosthetic hearing bones. I was super relaxed before this surgery, because I knew the first one was a breeze. However the recovery for that was not as good for me (I had felt really dizzy and like I wanted to vomit after waking up from the surgery) but they gave me an anti-nausea injection as I was still in that \"waking up from surgery daze\" and that took literally 10 seconds and the room stopped spinning, and everything was fine.\n\nSo its been about 6 months now since my second surgery, and my hearing is back to about 80% of normal hearing. However the tinnitus is still there, but once again, I have gotten used to that.  I just had a 6-monthly check-up with my surgeon last week, and he said everything looks great, and I will now see him in 12-months.\n\nHappy to answer any other questions you may have, and there is heaps of similar stories and videos in the sub-reddit which may help too. But my best advice, is get your mindset right, as it is something you need treated, but nothing you should worry about. Hope this helps! I evacuated the Florida Keys ( Where I have lived for 10 years, and live here again.)  for hurricane Irma in 2017. My family and I went to Boston ( where we are from originally ) to visit family while it passed. Fortunately, for me as you will see in a minute, they closed the Keys afterwards and there was no re-entry for over 2 weeks. During this time I was taking an afternoon nap and woke up with severe vertigo, everything was spinning violently 45 to 90 degrees and then back on me. We were not to the ER, was told Improper things, went to 2 specialists that week and again was told improper things. I was finally referred to Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary to see Dr. Lee. He is literally the reason I am alive to share my story today. They had me take MRIs and CT scans, only to find the worst case of Cholesteatoma he had ever seen. My hearing had always been bad, and like you, always had severe tinnitus. The cholesteatoma on my left side had gotten through my skull and started tangling with my brain. I also had 11 tumors in my left side between my ear canal and mastoid bone. I also had it on my right side and it too bored a hole in the back of my skull and leaving tumors, one of which on my facial nerve which is inoperable. I have had a total of 6 surgeries for it now, 4 craniotomies, and 2 tympanomasroidectomies for removal and reconstruction. I fly up every 3 months for surveillance and hearing tests.Unfortunately for us, this disease is reoccurring and it is a constant battle, but I am happy to say, currently, I am cholesteatoma free my hearing has improved, but it is not a fun process. I wish you the best of luck and offer to be here as a friend if you ever need to chat. I got diagnosed with a cholesteatoma after I countinously went to the ent with complaints of drainage from my ear. I never really had tinnitus to begin with, but I did often experience the sensation of something blocking my hearing.  \n\n*^(Oh, nvm when i think about it I did have some tinnitus. It was the nice kind of tinnitus that sounded like ocean waves. It really helped me sleep.  Also nearing the surgery I had a lot of loud pulsatile tinnitus(basically heard my own heartbeat) which was kind of annoying but I also did not really mind because it also made sleeping easier???)*\n\n My cholesteatoma was, according to the report, comprehensive. It had rendered my eardurm  defective. Ossicles was completely eaten by it. It had made it is way throug the skull bone, about to reach my meninges?? My balance organ and facial nerve was also affected by it.\n\nDuring my first surgery in 2015 they replaced my ossicles with titanium and rebuilt my ear drum and balance organs. They also did a mastoidectomy. In my experience there was never really that much pain. I was under for like 6 hours I think? I had to spend an extra day at the hospital due to ongoing infection in my ear that was present beforehand. My hearing is pretty good at the moment. No complaints there.\n\nIn 2018 another surgery was needed to rebuild my ear canal. \n\nI did not really have any bad experiences with the surgeries or afterwards. The worst part is showering/washing your hair because you cannot get water in your ear until it is healed. Also I have a slight facial paralysis on the affected side, but it is barely noticeable. If your facial nerve is affected you might experience changes in taste on one side of your tongue after the procedure.\n\nAnd rip you if you are wearing glasses. It will look wonky as heck when you wear glasses because of the bandages.\n\nUhm, also it feels weird whenever someone touches my ear now because it is kind of paralyzed because of the surgeries. I can only wiggle one ear now. But yeah, it went really well. I love reading other peoples experiences with C-toma. We are all a little family. Glad you are ok. I love reading other peoples experiences with C-toma. We are all a little family. Glad you are ok. Thank you so much for your reply! I guess the surgery sounds a lot worse than what it really is. How are you doing now? I was warned about the taste and nerve part! How noticeable is the loss of taste? The surgeon I spoke to told me most people would not notice it.. \n\nAhhh the showering and washing hair is something I am not looking forward to as well. I have long hair which is a huge chore to wash as it is! Wow that is rough. :( I am glad to hear your hearing is improved and you are currently cholesteatoma free! \n\nDid you have trouble with ear popping too?! My ears never pop. I cannot even pop them myself really.. it is quite difficult. Usually if I sneeze very hard my ears will pop.. but other than that nothing Yes, that is because of Eustachian tube disfunction, that is what causes Cholesteatoma. I actually did not experience any noticeable changes. My surgeron was kind of surpised at this fact. Hello, this is my first post on Reddit but I stumbled into this group by searching google.  I had the exact same procedure you described done yesterday.  Some background: this is my my third surgery involving cholesteatoma in this ear.  I had my first two surgeries twenty years ago when I was 16.  I have had issues like you described (minus the tinnitus) for about a year now and like you finally decided to see a ent again.  As far as the surgery yesterday it went really well even though I have been extremely stressed leading up to it.  It was a four hour surgery and anesthesia was amazing.  When they started rolling me back to the OR they gave me something to help me relax and at that point I was like \u201clet us do this.\u201d  When I got to the OR they put me to sleep and honestly it was like flipping a light switch, I just woke back up and everything was finished.  I have not really had pain yet just really bad pressure and throbbing in the ear.  Let me know if you have any other questions.", "My Ear Surgery Experience | Cholesteatoma ", "Cochlear BAHA 5 activation - incredible! I lost most of the hearing in my left ear because of a large cholesteatoma that I did not get taken out as early as I should have. I have since had a BAHA installed and it recently got turned on.

I do not have a feel-good story (yet, I hope too one day) but your post gives me a lot of hope for the future. How does music or nature sound with it? My hearing is getting so bad and my tinnitus is loud and constant. I have to ask my partner to repeat themselves almost every time they speak. My mastoidectimy was scheduled for April 2020 and they canceled it a week before due to corona. So that is another year of growth and another year of hearing bones eaten up my cholesteatoma Everything sounds really quite good except quite high frequencies seem to reverb a little bit. Nature works really well; I can hear the swishes of leaves and the splashes of water very crisply now. I have had a great result. I really hope that you can have your surgeries soon.

Now I likely have an epidermoid tumor but I am getting a mastoidectomy in a week. 2 weeks after my surgery I have a standardized exam to write, for which I will need to do a lot of practice right after my surgery (it is a tough exam). Do you all think it is possible to just sit down and study a lot post-op? \n\nI know everyone is different but I am wondering whether it is even possible (or even not recommended) as this will be my first mastoidectomy.\n\n(also I had scheduled this exam way before I knew I had a tumor and rescheduling it will be difficult :/) There is no way someone here can get you a simple answer for this. We do not know the specifics of your case nor are we specialists (at least most of us). What I can say is: most people get good and ready to go in 1 or 2 days. Of course, physical activities are not advised but again, I do not know what you are going through. I had a meeting with a statistician about my PhD project 3 days after my last surgery. Also, if you say it is very hard to reschedule, in Brazil we have a saying for that: \"if there is no solution, it is already solved\".\nTalk to your doc, most likely he will tell you not to worry about it.

All of these have been in the right ear and a magnitude of damage has occurred. \n\nI have lost the ability to hear out of the ear (by and large) and have lost the ability to taste on half of my mouth due to the cyst growing around the tasting nerve. \n\nThrough the years I have had many ups and downs and continue to battle this condition. My last surgery was in December and I have already been told that another operation is imminent with my surgerical ear behaving poorly yet again. \n\nI have also recently uncovered that my nonsurgical ear has a retraction pocket that may develop into a cholesteatoma on that side. This would be a first. \n\nI am happy to help anyone out with tips on recovery, living with the disease, and navigating the entire surgical process. I am looking for a community of those who understand what it is like. So my hearing got a lot better after my surgery four months ago. But I was having A LOT of pain, suction pressure. The pressure went away, and so did my hearing. My doctor says I have a small hole in my eardrum (which just be why the pressure is not pulling anymore). Do you think if I get it repaired my hearing will come back? My doctor just kind of shrugged off my question and referred me for hearing aids. I would love to actually be able to hear. My husband is a surgical nurse who works with my ear doctor. My husband thinks my ear is basically just fucked up and if they re repair the eardrum, my ear pressure will just pull it again and make it burst. Thoughts? While I do not know for sure, I do know that through all of my surgeries I was told my hearing would improve post-operatively. So far I have not seen any evidence of that. \n\nIf your doctor does not answer your questions well, id consider going for another opinion. Maybe you need to see what their idea would be to improve your situation. My affected ear hearing probably improved only by 10 decibels after osteoplasty. Still classified at moderate hearing loss. \n\nI need to adjust when i am talking to someone, i prefer them talking more on my unaffected ear.\n\nAfter surgery you need to do lifestyle changes like you need to avoid contact sports as it might dislodged the prosthesis inside.\nI do swimming but not deep diving as it will exert pressure on my ear drum which has prosthesis.\n\nRight now im happy with result, pain free and discharge free ear.\n\nHope it helps.", "ANY UK Madtoidectomy quotes that I can get I have just been diagnosed and the waiting list is currently around 6 months before I am able to get it sorted. I want to get it done before the summer   Is in so It does not take away from university", "Random question Hi guys, I just got my surgery a week ago and now I am wondering how often your ear leaks post-op. I know it is different for everyone, I am just curious!:) Consistently for about four weeks and then I have not had any leaking unless I put ear drops. Post-op, I had a bit of blood leaking out for a day or two, but the numbness stayed for many weeks. My daughter had many surgeries, her numbness mostly went away until this last one that was a canal wall down. Her ear is still mostly numbe 4 years later Numbness will likely remain persistent. Drainage can last anywhere depending on complications. I had a congenital cholesteatoma which had to be operated with mastoidectomy twice as it returned two years later, destroying the newly constructed eardrum. Numbness dependes a lot on the incision. The rule of thumb is: neurologic features (paresis, anesthesia...) will probably solve within 6 months. If they do not, you will have to live with it. My first 2 surgeries did not give me any anesthesia, but the incision in the last one was way bigger. So I have anesthesia in some areas and hyperesthesia in others (some areas are very sensitive, kind of hurtful).", "Outer ear cholesteotoma? My daughter\u2019s ear has had this bump for the past two years, it fills up whenever she has a cold or a runny nose then it drains, doctors are not concerned with it! And it goes down with antibiotics then swells up again.  Was this diagnosed as an external auditory canal cholesteotoma? No it was not, we went to 5 different doctors Ent and dermatologists and they all felt with it like it is a normal zit but it is be ongoing for 2.5 years! In the same place! I do not think it is cholesteatoma because cholesteatoma is more of a growth and it just keeps growing, not fluctuating a ct is usually used to determine if you have one. However it could be a regular cyst which could be removed but they probably will not push it if it is not causing any issues. So it never drains?? That would be a relief if it was not a cholesteatoma Cholesteatomas do not fill up and (pop)drain they are more like tumors deep in the ear that keep growing until removed, the ent also needs a special microscope to see it. This really does just seem like a little sebaceous cyst especially if it pops and drains, if it does not keep growing or cause hearing issues I do not see why they would be in a hurry to remove it. Some people elect to have the cyst and cyst sac removed but if it drains I personally would not worry about it because it probably will not grow and obstruct her hearing. Also if all of those doctors say there is nothing to worry about I would trust them. Thanks for clearing that up ! Branchial Cleft Cyst Type 1", "Wearing Headphones Post Op Hey everyone! I am 15 days Post op now and I am feeling much better and have started to regain some of my hearing in my right ear. I am a gamer and was wondering what you guys thought about wearing over the ear headphones. Do you think it is too soon to do so? Nope. Not a good idea. Your eardrums are still trying to heal, and the structure in your ear is still damaged. Wearing headphone means constant pressure and force banging against it. Also, wearing headphones trap in moisture which leads to ear infections. That is why your surgeon says do not do physical stuff and avoid loud concert/places. Gaming can wait. I am a gamer myself and constantly wear headphones so I understand your frustration, but just rest up, and leave your ear alone for a month or 2 Okay no headphones then! Thank you for the reply! Hey! I am also a gamer and I am actually getting my 5th C-toma surgery today (in 6 hours). What I do is I get ear buds that have the mic on the opposite side that I had the operation. This time I bough some hyper x cloud gaming earbuds. They are not too expensive and have alright reviews. We will see how they work in practice though after the surgery. I had my husband listen to the mic and he said it was good sound but he could hear a lot of background (like himself echoing from another room). These are just a cheap option  but I am sure you could find something better. I would stay away from putting any headphones or earbuds in that ear at least a few months post op. Oh wow! I just noticed this is an old post. Sorry! Hopefully you are able to wear a headset now \ud83d\ude1d I am recovered enough now to use headphones while I am gaming. I got the okay from my doctor the last time I saw him. I appreciate the reply though! I hope your surgery went well! Can I ask you how it went? And how is the healing process going? It went fairly well. The tumor was larger then they thought. It was very aggressive so they had to remove 2 of my hearing bones and my taste nerve for the left side of my tongue. I got 2 new prosthetics made of my own cell tissues from the hearing bones they removed though. The tumor was also touching my facial nerve! They said they scraped it away but it is something we will really have to keep an eye on. I bled a lot during surgery and was really weak when I woke up and had a hematoma at the bottom of the incision that busted open the stitches during the healing phase. My hearing returned super fast. After only about a month I regained hearing (for all prior surgeries I had it usually took 3 months). The hearing is also better than what it was before I went into the surgery. I will not even need a hearing aid. The taste thing is a little weird and 2 months later I am still trying to get used to it. It is not as bad as I thought it would be. I can still taste food but the left side of my tongue feels almost like it is always burned. It is a very strange feeling.", "Cholesteatoma? \n\nI have had smelly discharge for a few weeks and white or off yellow greasy deposits when i try to clean my ears. \nI have had antibiotics which took away all of the pain but i remain with very mild tinnitus and a reduced hearing in my right ear.\n\nAdditionally I just pulled this \u2018thing\u2019 out of my other left ear.. it doesnt look or feel like ear wax, its way stretchier!

Your eardrum looks very good to me but I am no doctor Until you see an ENT i recommend using a netipot or saline nasal spray and stay away from things you could be allergic to. This sould help your eustachian dysfunction. Also try to eat healthy, take vitamins and maintain a strong immune system. Catching a cold is the last thing you want to do.

Hi there, I have just had a Cholesteatoma removed 6 weeks ago, this is what I was getting out of my ear too. It looks very much like Cholesteatoma tissue. Please get checked out ASAP and show this picture. Does it feel soft still? Even though it is been out for a while - if so, then I would bet that it is Cholesteatoma. Good luck.

Please let us know what you find out!! I will try to make an appointment. They will not see me without a hearing test unfortunately. It feels almost fatty like. My ear canal is huge. I had surgery on it before and it left my ear canal huge to the point where I can fit the whole tip and a quarter of my pinky nail into it (my other ear, I can barely put the tip of my pinky into the entrance of the inner canal) I also had Cholesteatoma when I was a child (around 9yo) and now I am 23. \n\nI have got a lot of build up all the time because my ear canal is quite open.

I would not sell anything quite yet :)\n\nStill consult with your doctor to be sure during your preop. Also, the only fear I have is if I crash my motorcycle and hit my head, I heard the prosthetic MAY dislodge.\n\nHope this helps. Gotcha. Thank you so much for your insight. i know this is late, but your doctor should be able to give you some time when you can recommence those sports, i had to wait 6 weeks for physical contact sport/ other dangerous sports and 9 weeks till i could get water in my ear. i would reccomend talking to your ent about when you can do this", "Four days post OP.

I do not see the doctor for another week or so. I have ear drops and am still taking my course of antibiotics. \n\nTia! I just had my surgery the middle of last month and mine was draining for about three weeks or so. It will be happening for a while because of the packing that should be in your ear. They cannot stitch the inside of the ear canal so it will drain for a while until the incision heals more. Does your drainage look like a cheeseburger from McDonald\u2019s.

It is also why one of his ears looks a little different. Do not know if the recent vertigo is related to the cholesteatoma returning.  I did not know this, but it is crazy that one cholesteatoma left him deaf. I myself have had 8 and while I have significant hearing loss it is not that bad. I am deaf in one ear from my cholesteatoma. It was just mostly deaf but went complete about 2 years ago. I had cholesteatoma as a child that destroyed all 3 middle ear bones and left me with profound hearing loss. I had surgery a few years ago where they inserted a TORP and now I only have a 20db hearing loss. All my bones are gone as well, I am getting a ct scan Thursday to see if I have the cholesteatoma again but behind my eardrum.  Hopefully I can have a successful surgery like this if needed.  I am pretty sure I have lost more than 20 db right now..  It took two attempts at surgery and a new surgeon to regain a good portion of my hearing, though it will never be back to a normal hearing level as medical science just has not advanced enough yet to correct a conductive hearing loss like the one I have. If you are missing all of the middle ear bones and no inner ear damage, then you likely have hearing loss of at least 50 db, but I am not a doctor... Well hope it is not too expensive.

When I was around 7-8 years old, I started to get these extreme migraines that would come and go multiple times a month--probably the only other symptom besides ear infections I can remember. My mom had no idea what to do, as nothing seemed to work. After a while our GP at the time referred me to Sick Kids, and that is where they have found the Cholesteatoma and was  9 years old and booked for my first big surgery. It was massive and caused my ear to bleed (when I was close to my surgery date). The skin growth destroyed my ear drum and ate away the 3 middle ear bones inside my ear. They reconstructed the ear drum using my tragus skin thankfully and did a beautiful job of it! I did lose hearing and was moderate to severe hearing loss at the time.\n\nSo at 14 year old now, it turned out it grew back again but this time I had 0 symptoms. No migraine, no ear infection...when they opened my ear open, it grew in 3 different areas and one being very close to my facial nerve. After the surgery, they scheduled another one a couple of month later to make sure nothing was growing back and when they opened me up again, they could see that there was still some growing and removed whatever was left.\n\nNow I am 31 years old, severe to profoundly deaf on my left side. I have been noticing pain inside my left ear that would shoot down to my arm and a different type of pain (more sharp) in the same ear. I have gone to my specialist 6 months ago and found nothing...I am booking another as I am still getting the same pain and they thought maybe all the ear wax was causing the pain and to book again after 6 months if it continues. I did go through a period in the last 6-7 years where I would have a TON of sinus infection...like every other month. One sinus infection was so bad that it infected my neck lymph nodes (both very close to my ears) that swelled up my entire neck and face like I had the mumps and had terrible fever all week.\n\nMy apologies for the lengthy post, I wanted to share my experience and wanted to ask if anyone has experienced this kind of pain? Please also share your experience! ", "Bloody drainage months after successful mastoidectomy I had a successful canal wall down surgery to remove a C toma right before the pandemic. Pretty quick recovery, they had to remove 2 of my hearing bones though. I am scheduled to get prosthetic bones in the next 2 weeks, but this week out of no where I have been having more than the usual drainage and this morning I notice there was blood along with the drainage and I have some minor pain. Should I get it checked out or just wait for my pre-op appointment? Yes, contact your surgeon as soon as possible, and mention exactly what you posted above. It could indicate an infection, so you may need to take a course of antibiotics to clear up the infection prior to the surgery.", "What recurring cholesteatoma are like. It all started when I was 14 I started having ear infections for the first time in my life so I went to ENT who (while being an ass and someone who I never returned to) explained to me that I probably had this thing called a cholesteatoma. Obviously at that age I did not really understand much about this but after a CT scan I was explained that I would probably have to have surgery to remedy it. Luckily, I lived in a country with great healthcare which meant that the first surgery went very well and after a 2 week recovery I was back at school. The worst one was probably the second go around firstly knowing that is was back really sucked. Cause I had hoped that it had gone but also the second surgery was much more severe. To this day I have never felt worse idk if other have felt this easy but for me the second time recovering the pain was so bad that I lost track of time and I was stuck crying in my room with a pile of bloody sterile pads what felt like up to my chest. I think I also lost my ear drum this go around but my different surgeries have kind of melted together.\n\nAfter that I was told that my cholesteatoma was probably on the more aggressive which really sucked. A few months later I got several very serious ear infections including an extremely serious mastoid infection that let to me getting intra-muscular antibiotics which were both painful and embarrassing (I vomited in the subway on the way back from getting my first shot and well they were all in the butt which as a 15-16 year old is kind of weird.) The third surgery was the last one done in the country I used to live in and while not as bad as the last one the third round of stuff cost me over 3 months of school and was the starting point for me dropping out of school for a bit due to mental health reasons partly cause by my illness which remain with me to this day. In addition the third time was when my ossicles and mastoid where removed and when I became deaf in my right ear.\n\nWe then moved to where I currently live and in my first year of moving it came back. Obviously after 3 times I was kind of used to the whole thing but the pain of recovery still sucks. I do not know if other people have had this but is not the moment when they finally remove the packing in the ear the absolute worst part it feels like your brain is being removed via suction out through your ear. This was my last one to date but since I have had so many I would not be surprised if it came back at some point. \n\n I still cannot shower without covering my ear and I will probably never be able to swim ever again without great risk of getting ear infections which sucks and I cannot hear out of my right ear which also sucks but apart from that life only sucks due to other stuff in my life.\n\nSorry for the long diatribe I just needed to get it out there. Oh and I am now 20 and it is been 3 years since I have had my last cholesteatoma I think time flies when you are depressed.\n\nTLDR: I have had multiple surgeries they have sucked and my right ear is really messed up. Also on the funny side I think when they put back my ear they placed it slightly wrong or something cause my right ear is now really differently oriented that my left ear.\n\nUpdate: has anyone lost earwax production in an ear that had a cholesteatoma? Sorry for all the questions I have just never talked to anyone with the same condition as me. I seem to grow wax faster than normal. It only really affects my good ear, but it also grows in the ear the Cholesteatoma made deaf. My form of cholesteatoma is rarer though. Now I am worried. I have been told once I have the surgery I will have to stay in that city for a month with no air or boat travel ( the only way to get where I live). I hope I do not have the issues you had, although mine is different, not in the ear but behind it in the skull. Do not worry about it. Most people should be fine as long as you do not lose your eardrum which you should not I only lost mine after my second surgery which was very serious. I think most people do not have my problem. My left ear does produce enough wax for both sides lol. The surgery sucks but the first one was by far the easiest and had the fewest side-effects. hey man, sorry to hear you are having so many issues post surgery. I have had 7 surgeries in the past 8 years with this disease and have another one coming up so I feel ya. It definitely can put a damper on life especially when medical complications arise from the illness, but it is very important to try and stay positive lest you will revel in  the negativity.", "Is it possible to regain hearing post-op? &amp; maintenance question For clarity, cholesteatoma has sadly been a big part of my life in my teens. I am 22 now. I have had four surgeries to remove cholesteatoma - two on my left ear, two on my right.\n\n1. My right ear was operated last, in 2015. Given how often it would reoccur, my doctor opted for a more extensive (\"radical\", in his words) surgery, which brought my right ear down to 30% (and it no longer has the first \"wall\" you encounter if you were to put your finger in your ear), but has removed cholesteatoma for good - no signs of reoccurring in the last 4 years! :)   \nI am wondering though, does anyone have a similar experience? I am not sure what the type of surgery is called. I am curious if it is possible to ever regain hearing on this ear. I have a hearing aid for now and it is alright, but I would much rather just get my hearing back. I understand these matters are complicated and perhaps I am being optimistic, but it has changed my life profoundly, and not in a good way.  \n\n2. My left ear, anatomically, remains the same as that of a pre-op person. As a result my hearing is also fine (well, about 70-80%). The problem is though, that after more than 5 years at this point, I still have to go to checkups every 2-3 months with my doctor, and it is the same story every time: he \\*just\\* about gets to clear it out before cholesteatoma would reoccur. He is stated surgery will always be on the horizon, and he would probably go for it if it was not my \"good\" ear.  \nWith this said, I am wondering if there is anything I can do personally to prevent cholesteatoma reoccuring? My doctor said that the answer is pretty much no, aside from keeping water out, and y'know, not going out into the cold with wet hair or the likes, but nothing specific. I am hoping there is some sort of ear drops or some medicine that perhaps keeps your ear a bit cleaner (not just at the surface level, but at the middle-ear level). Havent heard of anything, pretty much what I was told. It sounds like you do not like feeling powerless but this ones basically out of our control. Only real choice we have is, in how we deal with it. Million variables here, but did you get prosthetic hearing bones put in? No", "Wet ear after surgery I am currently one month post op and for the past week I have been having a slight wet ear. I feel it usually when I wake up in the mornings and I use a qtip to clean my ear. Discharge is thin and slightly yellow, no smell. Has anyone else had this? This happens post-op sometimes and it often is harmless. Uou can ask your ENT to be sure. This happeneth post-op oft and t oft is harmless.  Uou can asketh thy ent to beest sure\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` Im a week post op. Does your ear finally look normal, or does it still look retarded? Hahahaha Okay thanks Lol it is almost looking normal again Thank God. Lol, feel like I look like dumbo right now man hahah Yea things are a bit wonky after surgery esp with the swelling", "Feeling Discouraged I had my first mastoidectomy in December 2020 and am seemingly set to have another surgery in August. \n\nI am so sick of the ringing and pressure 24/7 in my ear. I just wanted to see if anyone else has dealt with this. I feel so alone in it and am miserable.\n\nEvery month my ENT has to put that needle thing in my ear and I almost faint from the pain (not trying to be dramatic I promise lol). I see my ENT again on Tuesday and I am always nervous for it ): \n\nAny advice or similar situation? The ringing and \u201cswooshing\u201d in my ear is getting so old is there any hope it will ever go away? My ear sounds like the sinking of the titanic constantly. I had my surgery two years ago. You are not alone. I had horrible pressure in my head before surgery. Pressure is gone but ringing is still there. :(  Same here - non stop ringing since surgery at the end of February My doctor says everything is looking great and ahead of schedule but I also have constant drainage from my ear which is embarassing and frustrating :(( I see my ENT next week but it is not like he can do anything.", "I will visit the hospital again in November, I still do not know why doctor told me it had to wait until it is gets bigger and destroys everything so they can do surgery \ud83d\ude15 He talked about years. My hearing is also not good and of course, tinnitus. Opinions? Thank you!  I would go to another doctor to get a second opinion tbh Definitely Sorry I did not explain all... I have seen 3 doctors and everyone says the same \ud83d\ude2b this time I will ask him why we have to wait so much the ONLY treatment is surgery. it needs to come out ASAP. it is the only option. my surgeon scheduled me 5 weeks later to avoid further complications. if you join the FB group, you can read everyone is stories about waiting too long and what complications can arise. if you have a diagnosis, get it OUT! I agree with you. Can you share the link to the group you mention? Thank you it is called Cholesteatoma - The Hidden Disease", "Sleeping Morning all,\n\nI have just removed my head-bandage like instructed the day after surgery. I am just a little worried about how to sleep as I am very fidgety and now sure weather it would be best for me to bandage my ear up to sleep?\n\nAlso if I am feeling okay apart from pain do you think I can go for little walks?\n\nThanks guys! Also how do I wash all the gunk and blood without wetting my ear?! walks are great and were encouraged by my discharge paperwork. I am 4 weeks post op today.\n\nI was very dizzy the first few days, but my partner would hold my arm and take me on assisted walks. the more walks I did, the less dizzy I felt. \n\nas for sleeping, I slept upright for 2 weeks which was not fun but felt safe. I basically created a nest of pillows :) hydrogen peroxide!", "Options for further treatment Hey there,\n\nAround 3 years ago now I had a second surgery to treat my cholesteatoma and it seems to have gone away for good now. However the hearing loss is still a constant source of fustration and annoyance. My surgeon mentioned he removed the bones in my middle ear after the first op. I also learned that sometimes that these bones are then replaced by prothesis which basically restore normal hearing.\n\nMy question is what would be the best way to go about knowing whether I would be able to get this done. I am in the UK also.\n\nAny help would be appriciated. Hey! That Is similar to mine right now, i had all 3 bones removed due to erosion on my left side, my ENT also suggested a prosthetic bone at my last surgery but the cholesteamtoma had come back with a vengeance so she couldnt do it but said she will try for my next surgery. She also suggested a hearing aid for the mean time, perhaps that is something you could try too? I got my aid just over a month ago and its been such a game changer. It has its annoyances but overall i think its worth it to be able to hear again. I did have to fork out quite a lot for my aid whereas the surgery is free (in NZ) but i didnt want to have to wait another year being deaf but ymmv.\n\nId suggest booking a time to talk to your ent to weigh up the options of prosthesis vs aid. I would talk to your ENT - I had my prosthetic put in during removal so they are definitely possible. However, there is no guarantee you go back to 100% normal hearing, it just helps a bit.", "Second surgery. Hey there! \nSo yesterday I found out my cholesteatoma has regrown. This time it is more aggressive and it is made it is way into my skull. I need my mastoid bone removed, my taste nerve cut and might lose my heating.\nMy first surgery they were not through the front of my ear and it was fairly successful. They reconstructed my hearing bones and I had not had many issues.\nHowever it is now back and very serious. I do not even have the option not to have the surgery as it is so aggressive.\nI am really worried and scared. For some reason the cutting of the taste nerve is really bothering me too!\nAny advice? Xx I do not have any advice but just want to send virtual hugs. That really sucks and must be so scary. I am so sorry you have to deal with this. But what is most important is for you to be alive and healthy. Hope it all goes well and please keep us posted! My fellow human, I feel you, you still have a life ahead to live. Make it unique and always look for half a glass full of water not empty. I had to get surgery on my left ear a few years ago. Now I need it on my right ear. However I am trying to put off surgery until sometime next year. I just became a father and cant imagine putting my wife in the position to care for me and our newborn right now. My first surgery took at least 2 weeks to recover to decent state physically and mentally. Wow I had it in left ear when I was 7 and never went back for check up and nervous. I am praying for your recovery", "3rd recurrence with major complication this year Hey guys. I was really happy to find out about this sub and to read all of your stories. Cholesteatoma is a real pain in that place and knowing from others really help coping.\n\nI am from Brazil \\, had congenital cholesteatoma on the left year, diagnosed and operated when I was 6. By the time I was 17, my little friend got back, my hearing on the LE was gone, and I had surgery again. By this time, no hearing was left on the LE and I got a little of muscle weakness on the left side of the face.\n\nWell, 4 years ago I got into med school and, due to financial problems (and a little bit of rebellion), I stopped doing my annual head MRIs for That is horrible what you have been through, man. Get well soon. I have had 4 surgeries on both ears. The thing I have learned is to block water out of my ear when I shower with a cotton ball. I stop swimming completely, and it makes me sad. I also stop wearing in-ear headphones and switch to open back headphones. Most importantly, like you said, keep seeing your ent doctor and keep an eye on your ear. Anyways, best of luck. Get better soon. Holy crap. I have never felt so lucky about the one I had removed. I had no idea there could be so many seriously complications.  Sending you hugs and positive vibes. Take care. Damn. Mine is in my R Temporal bone and I imagine my operation will be similar ( disregarding all the complications). You even look like me from behind. This will do wonders for my anxiety. Currently waiting for another CT/MRI. Was contacted last week but the technician said the referral had the same reference number as previously and they cannot do the same order twice. Both ears? Did you lose too much hearing? Sorry about the swimming, I do enjoy swimming too and, since my external auditory canal has been obliterated I do not think it will be an issue. Thank you for your words, hope you are able to do some kind of procedure to allow you to swim again! Holy crap indeed! Most people are lucky, I was actually the unlucky one! Thanks for the nice vibes! Hope you are well! Hey! Do not worry, you will be just fine! Your case probably is not as big as mine, so these complications are hugely less expected. I do not think our appearances matter for our surgeries hahahah Sorry about the bureaucracy problem, hope you solve it as soon as possible Wishing you a speedy recovery, my friend. Going into surgery in a couple weeks. Thanks! I am 100% right now! You will do just fine too.", "Ear Suddenly Feels \u201cFull\u201d Again The day before Thanksgiving I had my second surgery on my left ear - the first was a tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy. All of my ossicles were removed (I am 100% deaf in my left ear now) and the second surgery was supposed to be an ossicular chain restoration and tympanomastoidectomy revision. Turns out it was all in my mastoid and pressing on my facial nerve. He also had concern about a brain abscess. So, what was supposed to be a short surgery through my ear canal, turned into a 3 hour surgery with no ossicular chain restoration and a meatoplasty. \n\nIt has been almost three weeks. My ear is still draining if I lay my head down on that side, but I am only using cotton balls for showers. In the last day or so my ear feels very \u201cfull\u201d. And I am concerned if that is normal. I know last surgery this was around the time all the dried blood started coming out, so maybe that is the pressure I feel? Any thoughts?", "Conflicted opinions from surgeons. Two years ago I was diagnosed with Cholesteatoma. The first surgeon (the one who diagnosed me) said it was small and I am young so I should go with a wait and see approach instead of removal. Then I moved to a place where I was not covered by insurance (since I am still under my parents) so I did not check up on it till the symtpons got bad, which was earlier this year. Went to see a surgeon where I lived and they recommended to remove it because it looked big. So I made plans to stay at my parents temporarily and get it removed. But when I met with the surgeon here they again recommended a wait and see approach and not even a scan. So now I just feel conflicted and not sure what to do. Should I tell the surgeon I want the operation against their recommendation or not? I mean, you got to trust the professionals, but I would recommend asking about the potential for harm to your hearing anatomy. I wish I would had surgery when I was younger because it might have saved some of the damage to my hearing bones caused by recurring infections and ultimately cholesteatoma. It is now been 12 years since my surgery and I have not had any major issues.", "Draining after surgery? Hello all!\nI have had my third surgery for cholesteatoma a little over a week ago (Aug 28th). The first two surgeries where on my right ear and now the latest one is on my left. I do not really remember much from the previous surgeries since they happened when I was younger so I am a bit unsure if everything is going as it should. I had the packing removed last Thursday and the doctor said everything looked good, however, ever since then my ear has been draining this yellow/brown fluid. I was wondering if this is normal? I sleep on the right side so during the night it will fill up with this fluid then when I lay on my back it drains out of my ear. I have to let it drain like this twice every night once in the middle of the night and once when I wake up in the morning then throughout the day I keep something with me to dry it off if it leaks. I do put a yellow medication in my ear twice a day and I am sure some of the fluid is that but I do not think it can be all of it. Has anyone else had this issue? Is this normal? Sorry I know this is pretty gross but the phones are shut off for the doc until Monday so I thought maybe you all would know. Hope you are doing better soon. Ive had multiple surgeries for both ear also, and my last surgery in my left ear gave me similar problem like yours. My advice is to put a cotton ball in your affected ear or both when you shower. Absolutely keep your ear dry so you will not get ear infection. 2nd most important thing is DO NOT poke your ear with qtip/finger or anything, I know it gets itchy as hell sometimes but the more you poke at it, the worse it gets. I visit my ent doc pretty regularly or however often as he suggests so he can remove some of the debris and keep an eye on my ear. He also gives me steroid and antibiotics drops to keep everything uncontrolled. \n\nIn term of how long the discharge lasted for me, I think it was a long time, 6 months or something. I did not have that problem with the other surgeries. Weird. Yellow discharge could mean infection but I am no doctor. It is usually the case for me. \n\nSome extra advices, Do not use in-ear earphones, use over-the-ear headphones if you have to or want to enjoy some music at times. Do not use headphones for a long period of time if you can. Stay away from smokers or quit smoking if you do. \n\nI have been able to keep my ears relatively healthy for more almost 2 years now. Get well soon. Yeah when I shower my doc said to hold a mug over my ear. So right now that is what I am doing while my husband washes my hair. I am glad you have said that about the qtip/finger. I feel like there is so much gunk in there and its leaking so much I want to clean around the opening at least but I have been trying to abstain.\n\nSix months! Wow that is a long time! I guess healing from this type of surgery does take a good minute.\n\nThank you so much for the advice! I will try and follow what you said. I know it is late but if you are still having a issue I would definitely get it checked also for the cotton ball use vasaline or protulem jelly (have not a clue how to spell those two) cholesteatoma can come back after surgery though I have personally been told to keep a cotton ball in my ear for sometime after through out the day and when asleep it should start clearing up at this point I recall having drainage for sometime after especially after getting packing removed if your still taking the medicine then I would not be to worried usually drops after getting packing removed is to help what ever is left (packaging) in the ear to dissolve so drainage would make sense if it is draining", "Before treatment, could you feel the lump in your ear with your finger? So back in 2017 I had an ear episode where my right ear kept leaking and could barely hear out of it. After 2 doctor visits and the er visit (no ENT) leaking stopped and hearing returned. However, I later noticed a bump on the top side of my ear canal. Now 3 years later I think It might have gotten bigger though I still cannot feel it unless I yawn.\n\nI know the best answer here is go see a ENT but as a jobless U.S. citizen I have no insurance and literally have no money for out of pocket. \n\nIf anyone could share their experience about this  I would greatly appreciate it as there is not really any info I can findon anyone with this similar experience. From my experience when I was seen by an ENT, when I had been diagnosed with having a cholesteatoma, the doctor first found that I had a polyp in my canal. Once the polyp was removed in office, he was then able to see that I had a cholesteatoma. \nI am sorry to hear about your situation. If possible, try applying for Medi-Cal so that you can get seen. The longer it goes untreated, the worse it gets. \ud83d\ude41 Did you notice the polyp before your ENT found it? Where there any noticable symptoms prior to your diagnosis? Thanks for replying btw I could not. I had not noticed the polyp, as it was more towards where my ear drum was. Some really noticeable symptoms that I had were significant hearing loss and reoccurring vertigo. I also never suffered from migraines until then either. I have always had ear issues so I brushed the symptoms off for a good couple years, but it progressed so that is when I went to get it checked out. I would have gone sooner if I had known about Cholesteatomas and their symptoms before then.", "Ear scar pic  I have not had my Cholesteatoma removed yet, and when I do it will be different (the back of the skull), but here is my scar from a skin graft on my eardrum 33 years ago.\n\n( That is not bad at all. Why are they having to go in the back of the skull? Did you get a 2nd opinion? My cholesteatoma is not so much in the ear as at the back of the ear where it meets the spine and back of the skull. It is been almost a year because apart from the quarantine, lots of different experts have to consult on how to approach it. I had another mri this week to check progress. I noted how your scar looks but did not realise you were showing it as bad. Good luck with the surgery. I am very happy with how everything turned out with mine. The scar was not bad at all.", "Post-op meal ideas? Due to have my first surgery in three weeks, and am looking for easy meal ideas after as I have been warned food might be difficult. My partner will have to go to work for much of the day after the first few days, so easy as possible.\n\nI do not eat soup and have celiac (so no gluten). So far, we have come up with yoghurts, fruit purees and protein shakes. It seems a bit sugar-loaded however. Anything anyone else found easy to eat? Also, how long til you were back eating normal foods?\n\nThanks in advance! Ask the surgeon to box up the removed Cholesteatoma and wack it on the BBQ when you get home. I just ate normal food right away? I do not see why food should be a problem. If you are doing  general anesthesia, you may be a little bit sore in your throat but that is about it.  The nurses offered me soups and meatballs with mashed potatoes a couple of hours after both of my surgeries, and I was completely sedated with general anesthesia and everything. The only difficulty may be that you might be tired and it will be bothersome to prepare food. In that case I would suggest you prep some meals beforehand which you can reheat once you get back home.", "Second Surgery I know someone getting their second surgery today. Any care package ideas that I could drop off later? Thank you! Extra Strength Tylenol! Nice one! A care package for home use could be a mix of items to take their mind off the recovery (food &amp; sweets, games, etc), and functional items to make their next few weeks easier (( to cover pillow incase any drainage when sleeping, shower cap for hair, offer of help around the house, etc) THC edibles (if they are legal where you are). I had a friend drop some off after my third surgery and they really took the edge off!", "Surgery tomorrow I was diagnosed with cholesteatoma a few months ago and my typanomastoidectomy is on Nov 25. I have been gathering lots of info and getting as healthy as possible. A big concern is how much hearing I will have after the procedure. Does anyone know how long it takes for hearing to recover? \n\nI know it will be worse right after the surgery, but I want to know the timeline of when it will improve. My surgeon says the gauze will stay in for 6 weeks, so I wonder if I will need to wait until that point to estimate what my new hearing levels will be like. I am also hoping that the procedure might fix my tinnitus, which the surgeon said is possible, but it depends on how much damage he finds behind my eardrum.\n\nThanks Best of luck on your surgery. I have had 5 surgeries myself on both ears, so in my experience, sound is very muffled until they take all the packing in your ears out. It could take as long as 6 weeks. But it is split into like 2 phases, the first one is for the outside bandage and stuff, it should help somewhat with the hearing, the 2nd round of removing the remaining packaging is almost 2 months after the surgery. Tinnitus will improve, but it will not go away, at least not in my case. It is a lot better after the surgery for me tho, it used to be unbearable. I sleep with the whitenoise machine (for newborn), place it kind of far from me, and it helps drowning out the tinitus for me. \n\nWhat I could tell you is that you need this surgery, and it will make everything better.

Going in for surgery in two weeks to have the cholesteatoma removed, a new ear drum made, and my ossicles reconstructed with titanium pieces. Can anyone please share their experiences if I have they have had any of these done? Especially if you have had all 3 at the same time? What is recovery like? How painful is it? Please I am really nervous Also curious if the conductive hearing loss gets any better after surgery? Will the tinnitus subside? :/ I have had all of this done, on both sides. Pain is tolerable, especially with pain meds. Recovery is monotonous but obviously crucial. I always feel real tired and groggy for a few days but I have issues with anesthesia. Your ear will be full of packing post-op so you will feel really deaf but does dissolve and remaining packing will be cleaned out at post-op checkup which is cool because that is when you will notice your hearing improvement. Do not be nervous, it is a giant step in the right direction. Although I believe ( I could be wrong)  it is rare to have removal and reconstruction in same procedure. I had each removal done on one side at a time and then reconstruction on each side separately. However, I had severe bilateral Cholesteatoma and CFS leak on both sides as well, including multiple tumors. I have had 6 extensive surgeries and am alive and well, hearing is good but so suffer from severe tinnitus. Feel free to message me to chat more, and best of luck! You will be fine. I had this EXACT procedure done about two weeks ago! It is not nearly as scary as you think and I am terrified of having surgery! If you have any specific questions feel free to message me! Overall, I did not experience much pain, more so just the annoyance of having one of my ears unable to hear at all afterwards-but I just started to be able to hear again as of a couple days ago! Every day it gets just a little better, but expect to be pretty tired for a while. I wish u the best of luck! OP, how was your surgery.", "Recent diagnosis Hi all, I am 26, UK and long story short, I have recently been diagnosed with cholesteatoma.Ive had issues for a number of years (since I was 8) but only recently been diagnosed after changing GPs and getting a referral.I am having an Op for mastoid exploration surgery in November. I have significant hearing loss. \n\nThe main thing that I am battling with is that my family are very unsupportive because the symptoms are very hard to describe, the pain, the vertigo etc.They think I am making it up. Any tips? As the mother of a c-toma child i can promise you are not making up any of these symptoms and I am sorry your family does not understand.  The good thing is you are an adult and do not need there permission for medical treatment. Give your family some websites to check out or bring them to your ent visit.  It is something  most people have never heard of so they do not understand it.  Most people  think you just have a regular ear infection and are being overly dramatic upon first hearing that your ear hurts and when you say surgery they think you are just getting tubes in your ears.  You will require post-op care for several days so you need to find a friend or family member who will take care of you.  Even walking to the bathroom will require supervision as you might be dizzy or nauseous. Feel free to ask me any question as we have been going through this for 15 years. Thank you so much for this. My partner has no idea why I am nervous about recovery, apparently its just health anxiety (which I have). He hs even suggested that the reason I am not flying at the moment is due to nerves and not the massive hole in my eardrum....\n I am relieved to actually no what is wrong with me. For years, I thought I was having panic attacks but now realise it was vertigo! The vertigo might be worse right after surgery at your age I imagine it will be as my child's had gotten worse every time.  Keep ahead of the pain with the meds for the first 3 days if you can. Have they used the words canal wall up or down? Or are they going to build a new ear drum  with a graph or patch your old one? Hi, they have not said-something about going behind my ear drum - I am really not sure. I think they see a small skin mass on my middle ear but they are not sure exactly what is going on.:( It is very hard to see exactly what they have going on before surgery on the CT scans they just see that there is a gray mass in our experience.  That coupled with draining tends to signal C-toma. (From what I understand)  Hopefully your hearing bones are all intact and when they remove the mass your hearing will improve! If they are going in through the ear canal your recovery will not be that hard. (Still not fun,but not super super crazy) But if they go in behind the ear please tell your partner that your internet momma would like them to not leave you alone for the first day and not more that a couple hours on the next couple days. Thanks for your post!  I agree with the other comments here that you need to educate your family, and explain to them the symptoms you have are real, and you need their support.  Let them know that what you have is real, and a rare condition ... quoting ( \"*only nine out of every 100,000 adults in the U.S. get them\"*.  In Europe, \"t*he estimated incidence of cholesteatoma in northern Europe is 9.2 per 100\u2009000 population a year*\".   If they are internet literate, point them to this subreddit as the discussion here might help in their education.  \n\nBut please look at the positive of what has happened.  You have been diagnosed and are getting the treatment you need.  Cholesteatoma is a chronic condition, meaning it will will not just \"go away\".  The treatment you are booked in for is the best way to treat this, to avoid further complications.  If left untreated, this condition can cause major complications.  So rest assured, you are doing the right thing in having the surgery.\n\nPlease come back and let us all know how you progress.  I am sure you will be fine though :-) If you refer to it as a tumor (which basically it is) people may understand the seriousness better. Usually the simpler you word things the easier it is for people to understand. Also explain that surgery is the only cure for this and if not done the erosion will lead to meningitis or brain infection. This exactly! During my child's first surgery at 3yo they found a hole in her skull and there was already infection on the outside layer of the brain. The dr has said it was amazing she did not have signs of cerebral meningitis. Just checking in :)\n\nI had a six hour surgery last Monday to remove the issue and bonehead etc.\n\nI am feeling okay and thebpain is subsiding.Thank you for your kind words early this year.\n\nX Hi! I am so glad you are starting to feel better! This surgery is such a hard one to heal from.  Did they have to to a canal wall down or were you able to have a canal wall up? Pluses and minuses to each one.  We have been through both after several canal wall ups and the c-toma returning. (But hers was extreme. Most people's are not as bad as hers so dont stress over that)  either way I am sure you will get healthy now.  Keep a close eye out for post-op infection.  Thank you for the update!! Let me know if you have any questions I am happy to share anything I know! Thank you!\n\nIn the end my operation lasted six hours!I am not sure but he had to 'rebuild the canal wall' and do some bone grafting..\n\nThe stitches come out on Thursday and I have a follow up in the New Year!I am verynlucky as the guy that did is a professor specialising in this condition but had to wait a while for treatment on the NHS.\n\nReally hoping this solves it, at least partially as I am tired about thinking about my ear!! In the end they went front way in", "Scar tissue closing up after canal wall down approach A month ago I had a canal wall down removal of cholesteatoma, unfortunately the scar tissue that developed within my reconstructed ear canal is closing up as it has healed. If it continues to close up I will have to get surgery again. My surgeon said that this is because I am young and healthy (20 and fairly athletic) and my body actually healed too well. Has anyone else had this? How did your CWD go? I am scheduled for mine next month. Did you have CWU first? Went great. I had a cholesteatoma surgery when I was an early teenager. It was a canal wall up I believe. This recent surgery was to remove a new large cholesteatoma within the mastoid cavity, and was canal wall down. The recovery for this one is a lot longer ~1 month and now I am back to normal. My hearing is definitely about 10% worse than pre-op.", "Life before surgery Hi guys. Im 21 years old and i have been diagnosed by my ENT doctor with cholesteatoma in my right ear 2 month ago. I did the CT and the result said there is no sign yet so iv been told to wait until other symptoms occur. My hearing is not the best anymore,tinnitus started 2 weeks ago and my ear is clogged. \n\nThe problems with my ear started 3 years ago and iv been having middle era infection every 6 months. \n\nI really need someone to talk to. Reading this sub made me believe i am a happy case but i cant find informations about every stage of this thing. I want to know what is normal and not panic . Im ready to lose my hearing but i want to get rid of this. Sorry for my english. Thank you. I really think you should get a second opinion. They diagnosed you with cholesteatoma and the CT? Showed there are no signs yet? Something does not sound right. You should be your own advocate and really  ask for a second opinion. In my case I have had ear trouble since I was born, including a skin graft on my eardrum. About 10 months ago I had dizzy spells and had a ct and mri of my brain. Turned out I had a congenital cholesteatoma growing since I was born and examiners simply never glanced at that part of my skull when I had scans. Something I forgot to mention before. I know I have a cholesteatoma. I have the scans on disk. Yet, when I went to the er a few months ago I told the attending doctor I had it and he did another scan and then claimed there was no sign of the tumour. I checked with my ent. Yes, I still have it. The examiner when I went to the er simply looked in the wrong place. A tumour might not be in the usual place, so someone unfamiliar with your case might miss it. I read that a lot of people had ear problems even for 10 or 20 years before surgery. In 2020 alone i visited the ENT 4 times (not same doctor, had to get a second opinion) with middle ear infections and i feel like i cant live a normal life anymore. I feel like my hearing loss was caused by bad treatment rather then the cholesteatoma . What was your life before surgery ? Many ear infections? Hearing loss? Clogged nose and ears ? Were these part of your everyday life ? I want to accept what is happening . Thank you. Thanks for posting - and welcome!  First things first - do not panic.  Second thing, do not go on to YouTube and search for videos on these things (they can be quite gross! :-)  Third thing, get informed.  The fact you are here is a great start.\n\nAs per the definition of the condition, its simply a noncancerous skin growth in your middle ear, behind your ear drum.  It can affect your hearing, and damage part of your fragile ear bones (that happened to me), however it can usually all be repaired and you will get the majority of your hearing back.  For me, I simply had 2 surgeries; the first, they cleared out the cholesteatoma and the damaged hearing bones.  Then the second surgery about 9 months later, they checked to ensure it was still clear, and also installed titanium prosthetic hearing bones to restore my hearing.  And that is where I am now.  Looking back at this journey, its been way, way easier than I was initially expecting.\n\nAs for your next steps, I agree you should probably go and get a second opinion if you are in a position to do so. If you have been diagnosed with a cholesteatoma, and the symptoms are causing you grief (blocked ear, tinnitus, infections, etc) then you may want to get another specialist to discuss your condition with. Do not be afraid or embarrassed to \"shop around\" - it is your health you are trying to improve here. Be pro-active, but the main thing is, do not panic. Well i had lots of ear and nose trouble as a child. Various surgeries on my nose and ears, including a skin graft on my eardrums and tubes. I would get ear infections, but my Cholesteatoma is further back than usual, near the skull, so we do not think they are related.  I have virtually no sense of smell. About 20 years ago I drastically lost the hearing in my right side (the one with my Cholesteatoma) which the doctors diagnosed at the time as Mennieres disease. I get tinnitus for a few seconds every once in awhile. Also if I concentrate i get tinnitus on purpose. I have a hearing aid for my left ear to make up for my deafness on the right. About a year or two ago i lost the hearing in my right ear completely. I did not think much of it as I was practically deaf in that ear anyway, so i never told my doctor. Then last year i had dizzy spells so I told my doctor, he ordered scans, and they detected the Cholesteatoma I have apparently had from childhood. Wow thank you so much . Were you able to figure out what was the period of time since the choleteatoma appeard and the surgery? Do you know ( roughly ) how many years you lived with the cholesteatoma?  Do you have any tips, something you wish you knew before the surgery ? Did you change your lifestyle to avoid it happening again ? Here is a quick dot point summary of my experience and timings (noting everyone is different).  My situation was pretty easy, although others have had a more challenging ride. Anyway, I hope this helps you.\n\n* June 2018: I had a blocked ear about June 2018 during the Winter months here (which was not uncommon).  Initially waited for it to clear on its own.\n* September 2018: my ear was still blocked, so I went to my GP. She did the usual treatment over several weeks (ear wax softener, and flushed my ear out with warm water a couple of times).  I also experienced some vertigo at this time.\n* November 2018: this treatment did not improve the blocked ear, so she referred me to an ENT, who first noticed the ear drum was infected, and gave me some ear drops to clear it up. This cleared up the infection, however the blocked ear was still there, so the ENT sent me off for a CT scan and a hearing test.\n* January 2019: results came back, and the ENT formally diagnosed the cholesteatoma.\n\nIn this time, I did research on the condition (including starting this sub-reddit), shopped around for the best ENT in my state (based on reputation), and had an appointment with him to get a second opinion and get answers to questions from my research (eg, I initially wanted to know about the relatively new \"Transcanal Endoscopic Ear Surgery\" (TEES) method, as this is minimally invasive).\n\n* March 2019: after weighing up everything I had learned, I decided to book in with the best ENT I found for a \"canal wall up mastoidectomy\" to treat my condition (this was also his recommendation).\n* May 2019: had the surgery (cleared out cholesteatoma, remove damaged bones, disconnect ossicular chain), all went well.\n* March 2020: had the second surgery (second clear, reconnect OC), and all went well.  Hearing vastly improved, although I still have tinnitus, but I believe that is common.\n\nSo what I have learnt is, your ear is quite fragile, and ear wax (cerumen) serves an important purpose (eg, it cleans, lubricates, protects against bacteria, water, etc). Do not stick anything smaller than your elbow in to your ear. Sinus infections can make its way inside your ear via your sinuses, so be cautious about that, and see a specialist for advice if concerned.\n\nIf you need surgery, first ensure you have a positive mind-set, get informed, do not panic, know how to relax and calm your body, and know everything will be fine. To prepare for surgery, try and get yourself in to good health if possible (physically and mentally), and get a haircut in the days before you are operated on. Its quite an easy job as the patient - you just lay there.\n\nIn terms of any lifestyle changes, I have not thought of any ... I just feel I am more knowledgeable on this condition now via my experience, and use this sub-reddit to share with others.  Thank you so much for answering. Since feb 2018 i had the same journey. It all started with bad treatment. You help me alot.", "Pain in skull after surgery Hi guys, had mastoid obliteration surgery 4 weeks ago and recovery has been pretty intense. 2 weeks ago I saw my surgeon and he told me to wait another 6 weeks before going back to work and doing exercise etc. I have been having heaps of pain behind my ear, sort of like brain freeze?? Where it feels like my head is tightening every time I move? And only way I can get relief is to push my finger tips on other parts of my skull to sort of even out the pressure?? Anyone else had anything similar ??? I am so sorry that you are going through this. I hope it is all just part of the healing process and that it goes away soon for you. It really seems that although people have a lot in common with the symptoms and recovery from mastoid and cholesteatoma issues, we are all individuals and experience it all a little differently. I had a mastoidectomy 2 weeks ago and I am getting a bit of tightness and pain but I would not describe the pain as brain freeze, for me it is more like sharp stabbing pains that happen periodically. The tightness comes whenever I move my hair around that area, if I am brushing it or tying it up and I forget to be gentle. I am also still swollen on the left side of my face, it is puffy. The pressure feels worse on some days and not so bad on others but I am able to deal with it, so I do not think it is too bad. I am only seeing my surgeon in a couple of weeks time so I do not even know all the details of the surgery yet. Good luck with the recovery. This was my first surgery, was this your first surgery too? What has you surgeon said about the likelihood of needing another? Thanks! I am hoping it is just muscles re attaching or something? As they had to take cartilage from behind for reconstruction also. \nThis was my second surgery but I had my first 6 years ago and that was a lot more minor and was not a mastoidectomy it was a right atticotomy and something else? I think the cholesteatoma was in really ear stages then. This time I had a full mastoid obliteration. Hopefully not likely to regrow but I need to be checked up every year for the next 5 years he said. I used to have suction every year but moved away for 2 years and did not have suction and then it regrew so hoping if I stay on top of that I should be ok!\nHope your recovery is going well too xx Hey!

Eh cannot quite remember but I know I started at 5 I think that was a cholesteatoma or ear tube do not know which but I know I have had cholesteatoma 2 times in each ear so I have had about 10ish surgeries just recently had one yesterday (main reason im lurking on here) I hope you hear well now and live life to the fullest!", "Hearing aids and fitting recommendations after radical mastoidectomy with mild hearing loss. ", "I wish this sub was more active. My experience with Cholesteatoma has been one of true endurance. I am 31, with 6 extensive brain surgeries under my belt. I love to chat with others who suffer, or have loved ones who suffer. Feel free to reach out and chat and I also have a page on Instagram  Come say hi! Tell her your story. Hey! So, I have recently been diagnosed with a cholesteatoma actually and have been very stressed about it. I had a tympanoplasty about 6-7 years ago because my ENT believed a cholesteatoma destroyed my ear drum, but it was never removed. Unfortunately he is switched between 3 different hospitals and I believe my record has gotten tossed around too much and they are having trouble finding it so he does not quite remember what happened. I assume it either was not too bad at the time or he did mention that when you get put under anesthesia that things open up and maybe it got hidden. I did get a CT scan so I believe he obviously did what he thought was best. I am obviously not a doctor/surgeon so I know very little. Anyway, recently in the last month I have seen him twice, he said my left ear (the same ear I got the tympanoplasty) is looking very bad, I got a CT scan and he said it is not looking too good. I looked at the scan and it basically showed that the bones surrounding which are supposed to have air pockets, have 0 air pockets, and my entire middle ear is basically 1 solid mass at this point. I have been pretty much deaf in my left ear since birth I believe since I had a speech impediment and have had at least 6 tube surgeries for both ears and ENT is a very visited place for me. I am 25 and after doing all this research and even watching a few videos I have stressed myself out too much and I cannot help but to feel a little overwhelmed. I have no idea how bad it is in there, but I do know my hearing has gradually decreased over the ears, current hearing test indicated I can only understand about 36% of words because of my hearing loss. I have always described my hearing loss as feeling like something is blocking my ear, and I guess something literally is. I am fortunate enough that my right ear is perfectly fine at the moment, he has been hinting that it could be suffering the same fate in regards to my eardrum retracting as my left did, but my hearing in my right is as good as it will ever be. I am very scared, I have my surgery scheduled for January 21st and I keep reading about the post-op and my surgeon had mentioned that I would have to go back for ear cleanings every 6 months basically for the rest of my life. He also mentioned ballooning my eustacian tubes so I do not need tubes anymore and a lot of ear canal scraping for easier cleaning and whatever else I suppose. I am most likely expecting to me pretty much completely deaf but hoping for the opposite obviously. I guess it all depends how bad it is in there, but it seems like I have had this for YEARS and cannot imagine the out come being too great. I have also been kicking my self a bit because I read that people who smoke also have I think a 60% more than non smoker likelyhood of getting cholesteatomas and increasing the risk, and I feel as if I have just done this to myself. I always think about how one day I will be completely deaf, and probably a lot sooner than just the usual old-age deafness. I hope my right ear never suffers the same fate of a cholesteatoma because I do not know what I would do if I could not hear anything, the thought has haunted me for my entire life. I am trying to stay positive and think that maybe the removal of my cholesteatoma will improve my hearing. It is at least re-assuring that I will not have to worry about my brain being attacked by this thing, assuming it has not been already. I am sorry to hear that you have had to have 6 brain surgeries, I am sure that is awful but you are strong and thanks for posting! I actually only just discovered this subreddit because of my new research and thought it was awesome that at least people care here and share their experiences. I will be sure to post mine after my surgery to hopefully ease others in the same predicament. I do not know what to expect until it happens, but I can only hope for the best, for all of us here really. I feel as if all the post-op stuff is what concerns me the most, especially since I will be cut off from insurance in April, and will now have to hope I can get affordable insurance to fund all my future surgeries and general cleanings/check ups. Plus with all the corona non-sense everything is already so stressful. My job requires a lot of heavy lifting and my unemployment is so small I will be struggling for at least a month. Well anyways, POSITIVITY, I will keep trying, haha. Thanks for the comment, I am sorry to hear about all the confusion, it can make things difficult but it seems by reading your post that you are trying to stay positive which is always good. I will say, ( and I am no doctor) that while any form of Cholesteatoma is bad, your case does not seem to be too horrible and may be taken care of in that one surgery. But, surveillance is a must. I have had the balloon inflation in hopes that it will prevent reoccurring problems. And I go for cleanings/surveillance every 3 months. I live in Florida and my surgeon is in Boston, so the traveling can be vexing, but worth it for the right help. May I ask where you are located, out of curiosity? And feel free to keep in touch via Reddit or Instagram if you are on there. I have started a page for people like us to keep a dialogue and to promote support. I wish you the best of luck and will tell you from reading what you have posted, I am confident you will be ok! All the recent posts have concerned people asking what others experience was with their surgery. I have not been able to reply because I have not managed to have any surgery despite my cholesteatoma being discovered more than a year ago. With the pandemic I could not go interstate for the surgery. The only progress is the occasional ct/mri to monitor the cholesteatoma\u2019s growth, in fact I am having another one tomorrow. I am 31 with two surgeries done. It is tough but necessary. I am lucky when I compare myself with how many you have had. \n\nI do not have Instagram but I hope you get lots of love and stories on there.

Thanks the for response, hope everything\u2019s good with you! Hi! I never have much to add to this sub because my ordeal with cholesteatomas started at age 7. I had a congenital cholesteatoma that had been cooking in there since birth and took a few different doctors to realize that it was not just an ear infection. By the time I was able to see an ENT that specialized in cholesteatomas, it had conquered my right ear. My first surgery was 9 hours- things were much worse when they went in there and the tumor had spread down my Eustachian tube and almost reached my brain. The cholesteatoma came back after this and I ended up having a radical canal wall down mastoidectomy with all of my ear bones removed and my eardrum placed against my back ear wall over the course of two more surgeries. I have no hearing in that ear and have to get it professionally cleaned/checked for recurrence every 4 months. I cannot complain because it has not come back in 10 years and I have adapted to the hearing loss after having it for so long Hey, crazy story. Glad you are ok. My story is almost identical to yours, I had is bilaterally, though.", "My history with cholesteatoma - VIDEO Hello everyone...

That Is insane.", "Recently diagnosed , am I allowed to swim? Hi! I have been recently diagnosed with cholosteatoma in my left ear, the doctor has said that it is eaten severely into the bones in my ear and that hearing reconstruction after the operation may be an option. I am still waiting on my operation date and am going away on the weekend , no airplane or anything just a weekend away which we are driving too. Am I allowed to swim and get my ear wet this weekend? I know I will not be able too after the operation but I cannot find any information on whether I can pre operation , \n\nAlso, am I going to be left deaf in the left ear? This is what I am most worried about when I have the operation :s \n\nThank you :) I am having my surgery next Tuesday. I was not told to keep water out of my ear before my surgery, so that leads me to believe it is okay (although each case may vary). \n\nI, too, would love to know how much hearing loss I am realistically going to be dealing with post-surgery. My greatest joy in life is listening to music, and I hope that this surgery will not have too much of an impact on that (although I know it will definitely be an issue for a few months as it is healing). \n\nBest of luck to you with your procedure... My hearing stayed about the same after surgery/recovery (I am four months out). But my hearing sucked before and I am getting hearing aids. I went to a water park the day before my surgery and rode slides and everything was fine... Good luck. I have had 3 surgeries, my hearing is basically no worse than before. Hi, if you do not have a hole in your eardrum you can swim. But I do recommend earplugs to protect both your ears from swimmer's ear. Just as a precaution. As far as being left with hearing in your c-toma ear. I do not think anyone on here can tell you for sure. Reconstruction of your hearing bones will most likely depend on how eroded the bones are and if the foot plate is solid enough to support the new bones without fear of it breaking free.  The good news is there are lots of options! Right now focus on health and your doctor will hopefully be able to know more about your hearing as soon as they see exactly what they are working with. Also after your surgery heals you will be able to swim again in case you were thinking you were out of the water forever! (But i personally think ear plugs are still a good idea) If your one ear is severely affected you might want to try switching your devices to mono instead of stereo if you use earbuds I am super late to this conversation, but thought I would throw in my two cents. I have had 2 surgeries for cholesteatoma in my left ear, about to go in for my third (and hopefully final) canal wall down in a couple weeks. You should definitely take precaution to keep water out of the ear. Even if chances are low, it is still a good idea to use a wax ear plug. They are kind of a pain (imo, they hurt my tiny ear canals), but the last thing you want is a complication which could delay or diminish your treatment. \n\nAs for quality of hearing, do not let the ENT's talk of \"we will prioritize a healthy ear first and hearing second\" scare you. They just do not want to give you false hope or be accused of malpractice after. All 4 ENTs I have been to have pretty much said the chances are that your hearing will never be the same as it would if you had a normal ear, especially if you end up getting a prosthesis (as in my case as well), since nothing conducts as well as \"native bone\". However you can get pretty close, and I believe at least partial hearing restoration is possible in most cases (in other words, if you have gotten used to living with the cholesteatoma, you can only have improvements from here). \n\nIn my case, I had a canal wall up the first time (for reasons I still do not quite understand), and then an incus prosthesis put in, after which my hearing improved significantly to within 90% of what it should be, only to gradually decline as I had a recurrence here \\~2 years later. Hiya, thanks for this :) I did go swimming that day and Jesus , I regretted it big time. I am a week post operation now and waiting on the stitches to be taken out, I am still in  pain and hearing is muffled and muted but lots of weird noises from my ears ( tinnitus) to fill the silence aha. The vertigo is so annoying, I feel like I am on a carousel. I am having another operation in six month as a second look op to see if there is any regrowth and to see if they can repair some hearing ( they actually ended up leaving the ossicles in my ear even though two had been eroded , so that is good I guess?) :)", "Mastoidectomy Surgery Large Vein Found I had a mastoidectomy on 12/18. My ENT thought I would possibly need a middle fossa craniotomy because she thought I had a CSF leak. When she operated, no CSF leak was found but she did find a very large vein in the mastoid air cell space. Did this happen to anyone else? Is there supposed to be a vein there? I have never heard of it. My left mastoid bone was full of tumors and I had a pretty severe CSF leak on both sides. 6 intense procedures - but maybe was just never mentioned. ( I am in no way a doctor and am not suggesting I know anything that would imply that I am one)", "So.. I am kind of the worst at dealing with my ear stuff. Anyway as the title says I suck at this. I hate it and I wish I had normal Eustachian tubes.. anyway my Otolaryngologist is expensive I can not afford the copay for ear cleanings. \n\nSo I am wondering if any of you have had your ears flushed instead of the sucking tool to clean the wax? It is basically free to have the ear wax cleaned out via flushing as opposed to a high copay for the orlaryngologist.. I cannot hear and I know they need cleaned as it is been a while I have had my ears flushed and it works great, just a little messy if you do it yourself at home. You can buy a thick syringe that works great or even poking a hole in the lid of a plastic water bottle works in a pinch. Just use warm water and be ready for the water to get everywhere I do not recommend doing the flushing alone, and consult your doctor before you let anyone else do it. I think flushing is not recommended if you have eardrum injuries, it can make you dizzy if your ear is sensitive and can create additional problems if not done properly. Many doctors have flushed my ear when it should not have been flushed and it made me feel worse. Please consult your doctor before doing it.", "update:Packing came out today! I just got the first round of packing out there were 3 sponges the size of large ear plugs. There is still packing in there by my ear drum but I feel a lot less uncomfortable. They had to enlarge my ear canal so that they can make it to the mastoid during future cleanings. Apparently it will appear a little smaller as it heals but it looks a little crazy right now, fortunately my hair is long so I really do not care. Having the packing removed was not painful at all. They prescribed otovel ear drops and I am supposed to use them for the next two weeks.  I have not had any real complications but I did have some personal questions answered that I will add. \n\n1. I am a cannabis user but have not smoked since surgery for fear of complications, turns out that was a good instinct. He said I could continue use in 4-6 weeks. \n\n2.  I will be able to do adult swimming next summer assuming my other ear surgery is done before then (I have a small cholesteatoma in my other ear as well)  but will have to wear earplugs and/or an ear band. I will no longer be able to do deep under water due to pressure so no cannonballs,handstands or water slides ever again but I am glad I do not have to avoid swimming all together. \n\n3. My husband is in a psychedelic rock band (they are loud) and has a few shows coming up and I was wondering how if it was safe to attend. It is! I just just have to wear an earplug in my non surgery ear. He said that since there is still packing by my eardrum it is not necessary to wear and ear plug on that side at the moment. \n\nI go back in two weeks if anyone has any questions they would like me to ask my doctor I do not mind so let me know :) Thanks for sharing! I am really glad to hear your recovery is going well... How is your hearing? I am four months post-op and just got fitted for hearing aids :( I am not sure because there is still packing in there by my ear drum. According to my doctor it all depends on how the scar tissue heals, if I understand right if it heals in like a crisscross shape i will lose hearing, and if it heals more flat my hearing will be better. It is just a wait and see game, I was a little out of it when he talked to my husband who said he did not seem as optimistic about me retaining my hearing but my husband is also bad at reading people so... anyway I just saw a pa today and I see my doctor in two weeks and I will ask him to explain it to me once more.. I am just trying to roll with the punches so if I have to get aides I will just try to find the good which is that I can still hear even if it is not the same. my dad had this issue too and only has 30% hearing in his affected ear. He had two surgeries when he was younger and the second one the mass was the size of a golf ball according to him. (He is a bit of an exaggerater). The thing about this disease from what I can tell is that each person who has it has their own unique version which makes it hard to determine anything unfortunately. But I am still alive! So there is that! That is so frustrating about doctors telling us important info when we are drugged up! Or talking over our heads when we are not. My doctor loves to fucking mumble! I am like, I am DEAF do you mind speaking up and/or WRITING these things down?!? Ugh I get so frustrated. I just want to understand my fucked up ears and hear again. I am lucky though in that my husband is a surgical nurse and he works with my ear doctor, so my husband is really good at understanding my medical info. Just wish I was. I would love to be included more. \n\nIt is good that we are alive. Mine was growing into my brain and was getting kind of scary when they caught it. It is frustrating since it is hard to research.  I am lucky that although my drs bedside manner is lacking he is direct and explains things in layman\u2019s terms using charts in his office. But there is still a lot of wait and see and the unknown is scary and frustrating, I am a planner/preparer/researcher so it is particularly annoying to me when I do not know what to expect.", "My surgery story. Hello, I am a 33 year old female who had surgery yesterday and I would like to write a detailed report of my experience while it is still fresh. Hopefully I can alleviate fears others may have. \n\nA little back story: I have had ear issues my entire life but antibiotics always cleared them up until about 8 years ago. I went to several gps over the years and was always given oral antibiotics and told to take various decongestants. I had years of foul smelling drainage until I finally found a gp who referred me to an ent. The ent prescribed ovotel drops which cleared up the smelly drainage completely, he sent me for a ct and referred me to an Otologist. Apparently my Eustachian tubes never really grew due to the shape of my face (my father also had two cholesteatomas removed when he was younger so in my case this was inherited somewhat). This caused the debris to collect behind my ear drum creating the tumor. There is also a small one on the other side that will eventually need to be removed. \n\nPresurgery: I will start off by saying I have high anxiety around medical stuff, I was scared. I also use cannabis regularly and read some scary stuff about that and Anesthesia after speaking with the anesthesiologist I felt better, he told me it would actually help with nausea post op which made me feel better about that. I am currently having a 50mg sucker as I type this and he was right. \nI got to the hospital in the morning, I changed into a hospital gown and they gave me an IV with saline. All of the doctors came in to answer any questions then a little bit later I was wheeled to the operating room. They told me they were giving me something to relax me as they put the monitors on and that is the last thing I remember. \n\nPost surgery: I was having a dream right before I woke up but I do not remember it. The doctor was talking with my husband when they wheeled me in. When I came to I felt hungover and my throat hurt from the ventilator tube. The nurse gave me ibuprofen then I got up and got dressed. The surgery started around 8 and I was home by noon. I was nauseous the entire 30min drive home and threw up once I got there. My husband gave me my pain meds and I ate a sandwich which made me feel way better. I am not in too much pain except for the incision and muscle aches when the pain meds wear off but overall it was a success and much less scary than I thought. I am about to remove the bowl from my head and I think that will help with some discomfort. \n\nThe packing comes out in two weeks and we will assess my hearing then, I had surprisingly good hearing considering the damage so hopefully most of that will remain. I will try to remember to update after the packing is out. Feel free to ask questions if there is something I did not mention l. I would be happy to respond. I am glad you are doing so well! Good luck Thank you for posting this. I am planning to do my surgery in October.  Keep us informed on your healing process. Here is to a quick recovery. I had this surgery back in April. Good luck with the healing process!!! It was pretty painful for me. My hearing drastically improved about 5-6 weeks out. But then I had a lot of pain/pressure and my eardrum popped a small hole in itself. My hearing went back to the way it was before surgery. I do not want anymore surgeries, so I am doing hearing aids. I am not going to lie, while the healing process is better than I imagined it does still suck. I do feel that if I absolutely had to go back to work at a week I probably could have but it would have been hard. Packing comes out on Thursday and I am am so excited as that has been the worst part lately.. I will probably do aids too if my hearing is lost though I am supposed to have the same surgery on the other ear too and if I have lost my hearing in this ear I am going to have a hard time getting it done in the other", "One week post op / third total surgery. AMA :) Hi everyone. This sub has been a place I go when I need info about my ear issues. I just had a wall down procedure last week and would like to contribute any of my experiences on my Cholesteatoma journey to anyone who is going through it :) I do not consider myself an expert by any means, but I have found a lot of comfort in asking/reading in here! Curious if over time you have learned to associate certain symptoms with the growth of the cholesteatoma now that you have gone through it a few times? Absolutely. Ear discharge that smelled bad was one symptom I had both times I was diagnosed with a cholesteatoma. It was much different looking than regular earwax, watery and brown/yellow. But the smell was the most obvious, it is weird being able to smell your own ear \ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd22 How has your hearing changed? I know this is old but I am about a week post op right now and I am wondering how soon I can get back to exercising? Before this I would weight lift 5 days a week and run 3 times a week. I know I will not be back to that anytime soon but right now I can hardly walk my dogs without feeling dizzy and out of breath. \nAlso, how long did you have to sleep with your head elevated? My doctor did not give me any sort of timeline and I just am not getting any good sleep this way. \nLastly, when did they take the packing out of your ear canal. It is driving me nuts!!", "Thankful to have found this group Sometime in the next couple of months I am going to be having surgery on my left ear, as I have a mass in the prussaks space (right between the tympanic membrane). Honestly I am terrified, and reading your success stories makes me feel a lot better. I have never had a surgery, or much less been in a hospital for more than one or two hours since I was born. I am super scared to be honest. I am going at this totally alone (no real support structure out here). But I am thankful to each and every one of you for sharing your stories and your struggles. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n This was the outcome of the CT Scan and the doc wants to do surgery.   \n\\-- There is moderate left mastoid effusion with mild osseous remodeling. There is 4 x 5 x 5 mm soft tissue density lesion in the left epitympanum extending to the Prussak's space. There is suggestion of mild erosion of the left malleus and incus, associated with this soft tissue density lesion. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I just had my cholesteatoma removed this morning (also the left ear) and it honestly was not that bad! \n\nEvery case is different, but my doctor was able to get mine out with endoscopic surgery, meaning no incision and all through the ear canal. She thought she would have to replace 2 of my hearing bones but it actually turned out to be just 1.\n\nEdit: Definitely ask your doctor A LOT of questions about your case as this may be an option for you vs. a mastoidectomy, which is the more invasive procedure.\n\nI was definitely terrified when I was initially diagnosed 2 months ago but I thought of it as a sooner rather than later thing, you def do not want that in your body for a prolonged period of time. \n\nI am sorry that you have to go through this alone but know there are people like you all over the world and we are with you in spirit! \n\nPS - Anything you want to ask about my cholesteatoma, feel free to do so! Yeah when my Dr. asked about wanting the surgery, I told him let us schedule it as soon as possible. I know there is a potential for it to grow and make things worse. Just waiting on it to be schedule. I am really hoping for endoscopic surgery, but it is back in the prussak's space and it is about a 4-5mm mass. so we will see. Honestly I just hope to take care of it soon. Glad your surgery went well seeing how you are able to get online shortly after it was done!", "Ear tube removal in office advice Not sure if this is rhe right sub but i feel like many of us have had ear tubes before. Ive had one in for 10 years and my doctor wants to remove it next week in office after my current infection clears up. It is a t-tube and im nervous of having it removed while awake. Has anyone had their tubes removed in office before? My doctor told me to expect some pain. Yes and the pain was very minor.", "Cholesteatoma surgery - 3 days post-operation ", "Afraid of Diagnosis Long story but here is how I found out I might have this:\n\nAs a child, I had a history of ear infections and I would often go to the hospital for them and I eventually had surgery to (hopefully) put a stop to them which it did. It left one ear slightly bigger than the other, and I was picked on a lot for this but I the infections stopped and life went on. I turn 27 tomorrow.\n\nThis past weekend I got into a pretty bad altercation and had to go to the ER and got some stitches on my forehead. I had some bumps, cuts and my left ear felt a bit clogged but otherwise, I felt pretty ok. As a preventative measure, I got a CAT scan and while my skull is fine they mentioned the possibility of a cholesteatoma. To say the least, I was shocked.\n\nAnd now, the last couple of days, I am afraid of being diagnosed with this as I have read the prognosis and fear losing my hearing. Is it more likely that this has been growing in my ear for some time now and the CAT scan just caught it or that this altercation caused this to happen?\n\nEither way, I have an appointment with an ENT this Thursday and quite honestly, I am scared to death and am wishing this is not the case. That maybe it is just swelling or a rupture that will heal on its own.\n\nHowever, when I think about the trouble I have had with my ears, I cannot help but expect the worst. I feel like my life is about to change.\n\nThis altercation I had either saved my life or ruined it.\n\nIn your honest opinions, what do ya'll think is the case? And how can I control my nervousness until my appointment? Do you have hearing loss now? Most of the time they remove it via surgery. There is a chance it could have eroded some of your ossicles and could need repair. Or not. I had a cholesteatoma removed awhile back. I had it due to a hole in the eardrum. They thought I would have a tympanomastoidecomy and repair of the ossicles but actually, there was 0 damage to any of the structures. I was lucky it was just discovered whilst looking around. It had not actually grown to erode anything and cause symptoms. \nI think if it is incidentally found then you will be better off than if you had say, hearing loss, dizziness, drainage etc from it growing and growing and damaging your structures. \nAll in all I forget that I ever had one. I finally got a cat scan and they caught the cholesteatoma in my right ear, I grew up with chronic ear infections too, it is a growth so your altercation would not cause a cholstestoma.\n\nmine was already pretty bad it had eroded 2 out of 3 of my hearing bones, if you do not nip it in the bud now it will just keep growing and that can lead to really bad shit, my hearing is a little worse after my surgery but they said it will get better \n\nhonestly man i would be more worried about leaving that growth in your head it can grow into meningitis and vertigo, just get the surgery if you need it, the surgery was not bad at all for me I went under and then boom i wake up and it is over, easy peasy \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Right now my hearing is kind of muffled but I believe part of that is because I got stomped around the left ear, it is gotten better the last day or two.\n\nMore generally though, I have noticed that I get a lot of ear wax in the ear, ringing for sure and sometimes I feel like air gets trapped in there so I have to blow my nose to \"reset\" my hearing. I have kind of suspected a eustachian tube dysfunction but I just never went to a doc for it cause I did not think it was that serious. At it is best, I would say my left ear is at 75-85% in terms of hearing, my right has always felt better. Yeah, I think I have been reading too much about it since it was mentioned to me. The potential complications, what can happen if it worsens, etc.\n\nMy symptoms have not been too severe and like I mentioned, had I never gotten into this altercation, I might have never known about it.\n\nAlso, I really appreciate your response, just hearing from someone else calms me down. Just know that losing hearing in one ear is not really a big deal.  I am totally deaf in my left ear after having a cholesteatoma removed from it recently.  Before the surgery my hearing was maybe at 20/30% in that ear.\n\nDocs think they can get me some hearing back by putting in a prosthetic bone, but honestly even in the event I get 0 hearing back in the ear I would not really feel like my life is that affected.  I have a number of friends deaf in one ear for various other reasons and you would not know it unless they told you or were trying to whisper to them in that ear.\n\nAltercation is pretty vague but as other people have said I cannot imagine there is any possibility this *caused* a cholesteatoma.  If anything you should feel fortunate that the CT scan helped find something that could have gotten worse had it gone untreated.  Cholesteatomas, as I understand them, are a mass of skin cells.  While they can be aggressive I do not think there is any chance of one forming over night. The doctor explained that to me as well, he mentioned that it is likely been sitting there undetected for years. \n\nThat night I got into a fight, I got punched and kicked in the head a few times (I am ok!) and my ear felt a bit muffled but it is doing much better now.\n\nI am still a bit nervous going forward but I plan to take care of it now before it really becomes a problem. The doctor said the same thing you did, that it was a good thing it was found when it was. I asked about the size of it and he mentioned it was small but I am likely going to need surgery and I have a follow up appointment at the end of this month for a hearing test with a different doctor who is more experienced with cholesteatomas. All in all, I still do not feel great about my diagnosis but hoping for a more optimistic prognosis.", "Cyst Sucking So, I have had a spermatocele (cyst that grows on testicles) for about 1.5 years. In this time, it has never grown or hurt too much. A few days ago, me and my girlfriend got curious and experimented with her sucking on it (I know, stupid.) It felt good even tho I could not feel much, but its more important that every day since, my cyst has grown, became redder and more sensitive to touch. Should I be worried (P.S. on vacation, cannot see doctor) This is not the sub for that", "A few questions So about two weeks ago, I started experiencing nightly episodes of vertigo. It got to the point that I had to go to the hospital and they actually did an MRI (I was very lucky to get one as fast as I was). The MRI showed fluid on the mastoid which the Dr interpreted as mastoiditis. A few days after I spoke to an ENT and she had told me that it was not quite mastoiditis, but the fluid was causing vestibular migraines. My symptoms had progressed to aura like feelings, like in an attack it would genuinely feel as though my brain was shutting down. The ringing had gotten way worse, as had my headaches. I was also starting to get confused when speaking, seeing gray in my vision, falling, you name it. Its been really hard. Anyways, I got a callback from the ENT two days ago and she told me the Dr found what could be a growth on my ear. They do not know if it is a choleostoma or not (my appointment to find out is on Monday) but I am wondering if these symptoms are indicative of this or not. Has anyone else diagnosed with a cholesteatoma experienced any of these symptoms?

Was anxious about it before going in, but  it was not as bad as I thought.\n\nMy opinion Pros: \n- Do not have to be anxious about the growth in my ear\n- Glad I caught it before it got worse\n- There are alot of alternatives to either getting my hearing back or using hearing aids or bone induction headphones.\n\nMy opinion and experience Cons: \n- U feel sluggish because of the drugs\n- U get dizzy when you move around too fast\n- The doctors were not very gentle when putting the breathing tube down so now I have uvulvulitis (elongated uvulva makes it hard to talk and is irritating since it just feels awkward) salt water gargle with warm water and cough drops help!\n- U get extremely constipated because of all the drugs and after general anesthesia lol so drink alot of water!!\nIt is been 2 days and I still have not pooped \ud83e\udd23. Worst case Ill have to get a laxative...\n- Ringing and popping are highly annoying so all you can do is take anti inflammatories that the doctor can prescribe you\n- Hard to eat because of my jaw being sore\n\n\nThough I have a bigger cons list, the pros outweighs them by alot for me since the cons are temporary and will heal over time.\n\nOh another tip is to get an elevated pillow! I got one from Amazon that angles 40-45 degrees and it is a memory foam pillow. Makes it much easier to sleep!\n\nHopefully my experience sheds some light on to your own and I will update after a week or so to see what differences there are.\n\nMy follow up with doctor is March 2nd so I will have to sit tight until then to remove the packing!\n\nStay safe and healthy everyone \ud83d\ude01 Take care of yourself. Do not lift anything. Do not bent over or run. Just relax for a month or two. Get well soon. Thanks man! Appreciate the comment. Agree with the no lifting. My elderly neighbor came over to ask for help 2 days post op and I thought I felt fine. Nearly collapsed with jello legs. Thanks for the pillow idea!! I have got operation #3 in 2 weeks, I am going to look for one. Sleeping on a recliner is not as good as it sounds for 5 days! Dang! yeah take it easy. It is hard not to feel impatient with it but that is all we can do.\n\nYeah the pillow will help alot more! It is a good enough angle that ur head is lifted and you have plenty of space for comfort.\n\nGood luck! Had a bit more blood leaking today, cleaned up my stitching area with warm water and q tips then topped it off with polysporin! When I was changing my cotton ball, some of the packing was coming out.. I was not sure if it was supposed to do that so I just did my best to put it back in there and close it off with another cotton ball. \n\nMessaging my doctor if there is any issues or if it is ok if some of the packing comes out.. if anyone has any experience with this pls feel free to comment!\n\n Was able to poop and shower today though loll. Progress \ud83d\ude04 Had way too much blood. Could not get some rest for two days. Literally no sleep as it was constantly draining every few minutes. Plus the clicking and crackling sounds it kept making since the liquid was flowing through.. unbearable! \n\nProbably the hardest two nights so far. \nWent to the ER and they could not do much, had to wait for my surgeon the next day and he removed the packing inside my ear, vacuumed it and cleaned it up and repacked it brand new again. Was probably the most anxiety inducing 10 minutes and 2 days worth of no sleep.... \ud83d\ude16\n\nIt is been about a day, just regular drainage and was able to sleep!!

I am due to have a Tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy next week, i am super nervous. iv had a cholesteatoma for several years, i just keep putting off the surgery because im a chicken. I dont have many symptoms, and i get regular check ups to make sure its not getting worse. I do have slight hearing loss, and some drainage. \n\nI am very worried that i will come out with more issues than going in. I am worried about facial numbness, my ear not being straight afterwards, my hearing loss being more profound, and this may seem dumb, but im worried ill have to shave part of my hair. \n\ncan anyone give me any advice or words of comfort. im wanting to put the surgery off, but my ins is changing  so its now or never.  im seeing a specialist in Houston, dr vrebec. has anyoene happen to have this surgery done by him before? I felt everything you are feeling. Honestly, you are going to be nervous up until you wake up. Nothing anyone says will make you feel less anxious. This is what I can tell you though. The hair shave is pretty bad ass looking. I was nervous about that too. They will not shave more than they need too. Also, hair always grow back. This is not permanent. They will place facial nerve electrodes on your face to make sure you do not have facial paralysis. They will constantly check that your facial nerves are intact. (I should mention I am also a Nurse). Your ear will be straight. They will cut behind it and flap it open. It will not be fully removed. Your ear will be numb. The feeling will come back in a year OR LESS. Although I admit that the top of my ear is still slightly numb. You MIGHT also wake up with your tongue slightly numb. That lasted a couple days for me. It was not uncomfortable. I was not drooling or anything, or any speech change. One thing I regret is holding off my surgery. I held it off so long. The cholesteatoma ate up two of my hearing bone and the attic of my skull. It was getting worse and worse.AFTER surgery hearing did improve. I cannot feel the implant inside. The recovery was not bad at all. I did not take any narcotic pills they gave me. I managed with Tylenol. Everyone is pain differs, I am aware, if you cannot handle the slightest bit of discomfort and pain, I say take the NORCO they will give you.\n\nLastly, I wish you the best and a great recovery. Good luck. I am having my second cholesteatoma surgery in a few weeks as well. You are actually luckier than me as my cholesteatoma has filled my mastoid and has eaten a hole into the bone going to my brain. I already had surgery a couple of years ago for cholesteatoma and it was not actually that bad. I do not remember the pain being very bad and I did not have to take that many opiods really. All that happens is you go into the hospital room, you wait for about a half hour, then they come in and put in your IV. Literally less than a second later, you wake up groggy and it is all over. You will be on hard drugs when you wake up so you will not feel any pain when you wake up. It will start to hurt a little more as time goes by but not that much. \n\nAlso, think about how lucky we are to be alive right now. 100 years ago this disease would kill you and me. It killed the famous playwright Oscar Wilde. Now, it is a simple surgery that I am sure your surgeon has done *hundreds* of times before. \n\nBest wishes and I hope you have a speedy recovery My son is having his second look surgery next week.  He had his first surgery last year, and despite the extensive cholesteatoma, he recovered quickly and did not have any face numbness.  They also did the incision very close to his ear, and did not shave any of his hair.  \n\nGood luck, and I hope you have a fast recovery.  It is definitely good that you do not put it off if you only have slight hearing loss.", "Post OP. Glad I found this subreddit. A little history about me which should put context in to my diagnoses. Never had an ear infection in my life. Hearing has always been well above average, even on my cholesteatoma ear(left). I was SOF in the military for about 12 years. So I was around a lot of loud things and a lot of things that put pressure in to my eardrums. Weapons, helicopters, cargo planes, skydiving, diving, high frequency electronics, etc. I have always had random tinnitus and it was not debilitating. I always thought it was just part of the job.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to about 8-9 months ago, been out of the military for about 2 years now. I saw the VA about my left ear feeling full and sound being muffled. I could also hear the blood vessels pumping blood in the same ear. Those were really my only symptoms. No balance issues. Tinnitus did not get worse. No headaches. The biggest thing that annoyed me really, was my left ear always felt like it had water in it and it could not hear as well as my right.\n\nNurse practitioner in the VA diagnosed it as an allergic reaction, prescribed me antibiotics allergy meds. Obviously, it did not help. Saw the same nurse and she prescribed me OTHER allergy meds. I was smart this time and demanded to get a consult with the ENT specialist in the hospital. Thankfully, she obliged. \n\nMonths later, I was finally able to see an ENT doctor. Looked in my ear and gave me the diagnosis. Suggested surgery to remove it. I did a hearing test in which my right ear obviously did extremely well and my left ear did surprisingly average. Also did a CT scan which confirmed their diagnosis. \n\nFast forward to last week. Surgery day. I was put under and given really strong meds. I was able to talk the doctor afterwards and he gave me the skinny on how it went. Apparently, the surgeon removed a decent sized cyst which eroded the hearing bone. Not sure how much, but he believes that it could have been there for years. The docs decided to clean the area and remove any traces of the cholesteatoma in my hear and rebuilt my eardrum. They also decided to leave my hearing bones in, for the time being. I only have a scar in the front of my ear, not the back.\n\nThe doc stated that there is a 25% chance of this coming back, so they did not replace or reconstruct my hearing bone with prosthetics until they can get another CT scan to make sure the cholesteatoma is gone for good. I was surprised by the doc's theory however. He stated that it must have been there for a few years given the size of the cyst. Must have had a small rupture on my eardrum in my military days and the eardrum did not heal properly which created the growth. Kind Of makes sense now that I think about it. I am hoping that my shenanigans in the military is the cause of this, rather than being genetically predisposed for this condition. I hope it does not ever come back.\n\nAnyway, I get to see the ENT doctor again next week. Hopefully, they will clean all the scar tissue. For all intents and purposes, I am practically deaf on my left ear now. Like, I can hear it when I scratch my face on the left side and things that cause sound through vibrations against my face and head. I can also hear my left ear popping randomly. Also, I can pressurize and depressurize my ears at will. I can hear that too.\n\n1 week later and no real pain. I was given some strong meds so it helped. Sometimes, I get a random sharp pain in my ear canal every now and then. The bleeding has almost completely stopped but I am getting a clear watery discharge here and there. It is healing quite well.\n\nShould I expect my hearing to get a little better as time goes on? Or am I practically deaf on my left ear until the next surgery? Should I ask my doctor for a hearing aid until then? Will it even help? Thanks for listening to my rant. Hello, it is difficult to say about the hearing. Everyone is different and only time will tell. I am sure the doctor had to build you a new eardrum and this takes time to heal and gain strength to work, often several months. On top of that you often also have packing behind the eardrum that erodes overtime that could also block the hearing. I have had 5 cholesteatoma and each time I am usually deaf in the ear for a few months afterwards but after around 4 months or so the hearing stabilizes and you can then know if you will need hearingaids or not. Thanks for the info! I did not realize I also had some packing behind my eardrum in the middle ear after surgery. Since I am going through the VA for this, there are some more detailed information that is not given to me unless I ask the right questions. I just looked it up and it is crazy that they did not tell me this. All they told me was hearing should get better after a few months but the middle ear packing actually makes a ton of sense as to why I cannot hear anything right now. \n\nI am sorry you had to go through 5 cholesteatoma surgeries. I am pretty annoyed of my one surgery. The inability to hear on my left side is a change. My right side hearing is great, but since all the sounds are okay heard by my right ear, my brain cannot filter and sort anything. It is\u2026 a bit overwhelming. I hope it gets better with time. Yeah I feel you. I am from the states but I moved to Sweden about 7 years ago. The doctors in the states... I feel like they do not tell you everything. I got 3 surgeries in the states and they never told me that I could lose my taste, my facial mobility might be affected, etc. They never told me the risks of the surgery before they operated. It was not until I moved to Sweden and had to get surgery here that I learned those things.\n\nI also had surgery last week on my left side. (had it on the 26th). I am going in today to get the bandaging and some of the packing removed. Even for me who has had all these surgeries. It feels overwhelming when I go outside for like a walk or something. It feels strange to be so deaf on one side and then everything kind of blurs together with the otherside. This usually gets batter after a few weeks though. Just give it time. Also, the crackling you hear is likely to be the packing in the middle ear (at least that is what I have heard). I think it is like a foam or something (again I could be completely wrong about this). \n\nThe first ctoma they found in my left ear was last in Aug of last year. Similar to you, they tried to save my hearing bones and scraped the tumor away from them. However, they accidently missed a few cells and the tumor grew back off those cells. It was very aggressive. In just 1 year the tumor grew pretty big and it ate away 2 of the 3 hearing bones and my taste nerve. It was even touching the facial nerve! I do not mean to scare you at all but if you have any symptoms at all in the next few months/years and might suspect it coming back, demand an mri to check for reoccurance. You do not want what happened to me to happen to you as well. My main symptom was itching that no medication they gave me would help. Then I started noticing hearing changes. Just curious, have you noticed any taste changes at all after your surgery? Or any burning on the left side of your toungue?\n\nEdit! Oh also! I have notice the reddit group is not as active but if you have Facebook. There is a ctoma group that is super active and has provided me with a lot if of information and help for my surgeries. It is called Cholesteatoma - The Hidden Disease. \nHello! You have made the mistake of writing \"ect\" instead of \"etc.\"\n\n\"Ect\" is a common misspelling of \"etc,\" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase \"et cetera.\" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as \"et\" to \"and\" + \"cetera\" to \"the rest;\" a literal translation to \"and the rest\" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. \n\n(\n\n^(I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Message me for bug reports.)  Oh my. I hope things can be sorted out for you there in Sweden. I was not told about the risks until an hour before the surgery. Kind of annoying, but it is the VA. I have to be really heavy handed with my requests and demands to get anything done with them, TBH. So it makes me look like a complete asshole for wanting them to do their jobs and give me the information I need.\n\nI was very much afraid of permanent facial paralysis or weakness post-op but that does not seem to have been the case. My face is fine. My taste is slowly getting better, though my tongue still feels a bit numb. Like when you burn your tongue, it kind of feels like the feeling afterward. \n\nI heal pretty quickly, but I feel that my healing factor is going to work against me with ctoma. Quickly healing means this tumor can grow faster because it is a part of me. I get to see the doctor again next week. I am not sure if there is any packing deep in my ear canal, but it sure feels like it would stuffed with something. I hope they clean that ear out well.\n\nThe doc said there was damage to my hearing bones, but maybe it was not so bad because the surgeon left them in there after removing the cyst. And I would not say I was hearing just fine before the surgery. I mean, I tolerated the hearing loss relative to my right ear and would be fine my hearing went back to those same levels. I was just tired of my ear feeling full all of the time. And obviously the damn cyst eating everything in its path.", "Consequences of cholesteatoma surgery? Doctor told me might get surgery but on next appointment I will decide. (it might be at the end of January 2022) It seems cholesteatoma has destroyed some bone inside ear.\n\nI have not ask in detail about the procedure for this surgery but I have read that after this surgery you might need another one 6 months after.\n\nAlso, after this surgery you have to avoid water at all cost? For example, I will not be able to swim again? It is not that I swim everyday but I had plans to swim to get a better condition :( Welcome to the club!\n\nSome things (and this is based on what I have heard).\n\nTypically it is a two part surgery. The first one they go in and clear out the infection then do a \"second look\" to make sure it is not come back and to put in a prosthetic to replace the bones which have been destroyed. \n\nThere are two ways to close up the ear after the surgery. With or without a hole left into the mastoid cavity. If you like the water, you do not want the \"wall down\" surgery with the open hole. The hole allows for future inspection and clearing of the mastoid cavity without surgery, but effectively means you need to keep the ear dry. The doctor did not leave an opening after my first surgery, but ended up leaving one after the second since my pre-surgery CT scan showed that the infection was starting to return. The thought is that the cavity can be cleaned out a couple times a year instead of rolling the dice on the infection coming back without a way to get in there without surgery. \n\nTypically you go about a year between surgeries (or at least that is what my doctor said), but my second one was delayed by six months because of COVID shit. \n\nOne suggestion would be to ask around and make sure you have a good surgeon. My dad actually ended up flying to LA for his surgery instead of getting it locally since the local expertise in his state was lacking. I ended up doing mine local with a good surgeon. Though the consequences of this surgery result in many inconveniences, I would say it is very worth it. The discomfort of knowing you have this disease and that it will continue to grow is unbearable to me - not to mention the frequent check ups you would have to get with your ENT instead where the doctor will use a suction tool to clean around it and I swear it makes me feel so dizzy and lightheaded every time. Instead, just knock ur out with the surgery if applicable. It really really sucks but I do believe it is worth it in the long run. \n\nI have has 2 surgeries so far for this and would be happy to answer any questions you have also (: Thank you so much for the detailed explanation. I am living in Korea as international student. There is a little problem with communication but for my next appointment I will try to go with Korean friend.\n\nLast year, doctor in my country put a little tube in my eardrum to equalize ear pressure and eardrum is still open.\n\nIt seems this Korean doctor will be the surgeon as he seems one of the top professors from ENT specialty.\n\nI will try to get better explanation next time. I have been reading about this surgery and also trying to contact my previous doctor.\n\nAlso I hope I can get a good recovery as I have to use my vacation before entering my masters in March. Thank you! I feel the same, whenever I go to doctor for cleaning it just ruins my day. :(\n\nIn your case tinnitus dissappeared or at least decreased? \nAlso, did your hearing got better? Right now I feel that I can hear 50% on my right ear. \n\nWhat about recovery? Thank you in advance :) Do consider that you will not be able to fly on an airplane for at least a couple months after your surgery\n\nMaybe just six weeks\n\nStill, something to consider.", "Possibly have cholesteatoma... Hello all, I hope you are doing well in these weird times :)  \nI need some advice or want to know about your experiences!  \nI have had trouble with my left for 1-3 years... it got quite bad about a year ago so I got help.\n\nI saw 4 different doctors (3 ENTS - 1 GP) and they thought I had glue ear and I went into surgery to have grommets  (tbh it was even had to convince them I had something wrong at all)  \nSo I had surgery about 5 days ago now to be woken up and to be told they were wrong and suspected I have cholesteatoma (CT scan next week to confirm)  \n\n\nI am still in so much pain, I feel like I am losing my hearing more and more every day...\n\nI am a musician so this is the worst thing that could happen. How to make sure my other ear does not get the same fate?!\n\nHow do you deal with the pain? Is the surgery painful/scary &amp; did it help? \n\nSorry for all the questions! I am just so stressed, first no one believes me then they say sorry we wrongly diagnosed you...\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience? I had ear issues for 10 years before it was finally diagnosed and I got surgery. Music is a huge part of my life and I also dabble in making it and I am still able to do so. My hearing is worse but I still have it and I do not really notice a difference unless I am looking for it. Also the surgery seems way scarier than it is. I was healed in a week but took plenty of time off work to heal up. They give you pain\nMedication so that helps a lot with the pain l, I also did a lot of edibles. Damn 10 years is a long time, good to hear you can still make music and have not noticed much of a difference. Defo going to take time off to heal! thanks for commenting. I have had 2 surgeries - one in the middle of 2019, and my second in March of this year. Firstly, the worry and stress I put myself through (particularly before the first surgery) was way more painful than the surgery and recovery itself.  Now I know what to expect, I can tell you the surgeries are a breeze.  The only \"pain\" I had after the surgery was from the bandage wrapped around my head being a bit too tight.\n\nDid the surgery help?  Absolutely yes.  If I were diagnosed with cholesteatoma knowing what I know now, I would have no problems in having the surgery performed again. My hearing is back to about 80% of the full hearing range, and I am fine with that. You will be fine!  Keep us updated with how you go.", "How to deal with hearing loss? I was diagnosed with a cholesteatoma 2.5 years ago, had first surgery and was told it was all removed but they also had to take out 1.5 of the wee hearing bones because they were too damaged. I could hear slightly but it really wasnt great. Im a week out from having my second surgery, it was supposed to be a tympanoplasty + ossicular chain reconstruction but once they got a look the cholesteatoma was back with a vengeance and it destroyed the last hearing bones. I have a follow up appointment soon but what are the odds of it ever being surgically fixed? Should i just suck it up and get a hearing aid? Idk. Also how do you deal with being half deaf all of a sudden? Im mostly ok but every now and then i just want to cry and  then i feel dumb cause i know its not the end of the world. Well my hearing loss was gradual. When I eventually went completely deaf in that ear I just lived with it as there was nothing I could do. When I was diagnosed with a cholesteatoma the government gave me two CROS hearing aids. One of them transmits the sound from my deaf side to my good ear so I do not always have to have people talk on my good side. I had cholesteatoma about 15 years ago, and had a ossicle chain reconstruction done 5 years ago with a TORP to replace all 3 bones as there was nothing there. That was unsuccessful and I still had a 50 db hearing loss. I had the same surgery again a couple of years ago with a more experienced surgeon and now only have a 20db hearing loss. I like to stay positive and believe that medical procedures will improve within the next decade to be able to fully and easily restore conductive hearing loss.", "Surgery went well!! Was a lot more extensive that they realised so had a full mastoid obliteration! Taste never cut but facial nerve saved! Off home to recover now \ud83d\udc9b hoping this pain settles down \ud83d\ude05 "]
