As part of their work on Zika virus vaccines, scientists have been trying to tease out how and if ADE impacts Zika severity and if cross-infection with dengue or other flaviviruses worsens the disease.\n&gt; \n&gt; A Brazil-based research team examined samples from 65 patients who were evaluated at a hospital in Sao Paulo state during the first half of 2016, when the area was experiencing a Zika outbreak. To explore any connection between ADE and both dengue and Zika, the researchers examined patients' viral loads and their cytokine profiles during acute infection. They published their findings yesterday in Clinical Infectious Diseases.\n&gt; \n&gt; For patients diagnosed as having acute dengue or Zika infections, the researchers did not see higher viremia levels in those who had previously been infected with dengue, but they noted that the study had only enough power to detect the difference with Zika virus.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the cytokine analysis part of the study, the investigators looked at patterns with 10 cytokines, finding a significant difference in only one: IL-1-beta, which was lower in patients with acute dengue infections who had been infected with dengue previously. Again, the researchers said the power to detect differences between the groups was low, but in the Zika patients they did see a significant positive association between IL-1-beta and viral load.\n&gt; \n&gt; The authors said they will continue to evaluate the group of patients to assess if earlier dengue infection protects against future Zika infections or illnesses involving other dengue serotypes. They also said they will explore other immunoglobulin subclasses and different immune cell subsets to better understand the mechanisms of the findings they observed in the patients.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jun 20 Clin Infect Dis (\n&gt;___\n\n^(source: ", "Use Zika to renew focus on birth-defect research ", "Outsmarting Outbreaks: Using Genomics to Track Viruses - Kristian Andersen, Scripps Research (2019) Viruses are spread by airlines and cruise ships.

The Zika virus will do much to change this for the benefit of all.  \n\nIf moving to Florida, you should guard against your home, yard and surrounding area becoming a breeding ground for Aedes mosquitoes.  Ample information on how to do this available online (CDC, PAHO, ECDC, State and Local Health Department websites).  \n\nThe main or key pieces of information needing to be understood:\n\n* Aedes mosquitoes are indoor pests. They live in and around our homes.  \n* Their bite does not cause irritation and may not be noticeable,\n* They do not make the buzzing sound normally associated with mosquitoes.\n\nWhen safeguarding your home, it is essential to eliminate possible breeding locations.  Female Aedes will deposit eggs above a water source. When the eggs hatch they fall into the water where the balance of the gestation process takes place.  Indoors, anywhere where there is a facet can become a breeding locations. ie In bathtubs and sinks overflow traps, under sinks located in kitchens, bathrooms , laundry  rooms, commode tanks. Outdoors, anything that can collect water can become a breeding location.\n\nWith the daily rainfall common in most areas of Florida, this can be a considerable task. \n\n", "Zika Virus and the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 Syndrome | Case Series from Seven Countries ", "If the Zika virus is bad only for pregnant women, why do not we just spread it to everybody before they get pregnant?

The isolate and sequences from the original liver RNA data clustered with an Asian holarctica subspecies that includes the japonica biovar.\n&gt; \n&gt; Testing of eight other ringtail possums and three rabbits with similar symptoms were negative for F tularensis, suggesting that there are other sources for acute necrotizing enteritis and hepatitis in the animals.\n&gt; \n&gt; The team concluded that native ringtail possums in Australia might be a natural reservoir or host of tularemia and could serve as sentinels for disease activity that could pose a threat to humans.\n&gt;\n&gt; May 9 Emerg Infect Dis (\n", "Banner Message Changes to provide more relevant information The information block below the main banner has been updated to provide more relevant information on the spread of the Zika virus in all US States and Territories.\n\nMore information on the data displayed may be found in the ( under (\n\n***\n|^Legend|^Description|\n|:-|:-|\n|^(USA Zika Cases)|^(The total number of TAC &amp; LAC cases in all US States and Territories)|\n|^(As of Date)|^(The *latest* reporting date provided by the CDC.) |\n||^(**Note**: As information is reported at different times, there will be minor inconsistencies.)|\n|^(Total)|^(The total of all TAC, LAC, Pregnancies &amp; GBS cases.)|\n|^(Pregnancies)|^(Total number of pregnancies with possible zika infections at the reporting time.)|\n|^(GBS)|^(Total number of Guillain-Barre syndrome cases at the reporting time.)|\n|^(TAC)|^(**T**ravel **A**ssociated **C**ases.)|\n|^(LAC)|^(**L**ocally **A**cquired **C**ases.)|\n|^(Superscripted)|^(Superscript Numbers indicate the differences between the current and last report totals.)|   \n***\nPlease PM /u/IIWIIM8 with any questions, comments or suggestions regarding these changes.", "Zika\u2019s long, strange trip into the limelight ", "Venezuelan health minister admits to 4500 cases of Zika, number might be even bigger according to public health specialists ", "How To Build a Human, the standard model: from Fertilization to Birth ", "Human Trials of Zika Vaccine Planned for 2016 ", "Measures Taken to Prevent Zika Virus Infection During Pregnancy \u2014 Puerto Rico, 2016 | (09JUN17)  &gt; **CDC notes 5% rate of Zika birth defects in US territories | Jun 08, 2017**\n&gt; \n&gt; Today the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released its first analysis of Zika-related birth defects in US territories, concluding that 5% of all pregnancies with a confirmed Zika diagnosis in the mother resulted in a birth defect.\n&gt; \n&gt; The study was published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).\n&gt; \n&gt; \"These findings are consistent with an earlier report we produced on women in the 50 states who had Zika-affected pregnancies,\" said Anne Schuchat, MD, the acting director of the CDC, in a press briefing.\n&gt; \n&gt; The study tracked the outcomes of 2,549 pregnant women in territories (including Puerto Rico, Micronesia, and America Samoa) who had lab-confirmed Zika infections in pregnancy from Jan 1, 2016, to Apr 25 of this year.

Visually connecting with normal Human Gestation. ", "First local Zika cases noted in India; studies explore transmission | (26MAY17) CIDRAP ", " Unsure about zika and pregnancy.  It is very disappointing your doctors have not been better communicators with you - I am sorry that you have not had your concerns more adequately addressed by them. I would recommend re-contacting your OB for an in-person appointment so that they can answer all of your questions as it pertains to your situation. The following information is general in nature, and so may change based on your circumstances and OB's advice, but hopefully can address some of your concerns. I work in this field, but I am not a medical doctor.\n\nFirstly, you and your fianc\u00e9 should only use condoms from now until you are given the okay to stop from your OB. This is because the zika virus can be sexually transmitted, and if you or your fianc\u00e9 was infected in December, you could transfer/have transferred it to each other if you have been having unprotected sex. However on the chance that it has not transferred, you do not want to risk that he transfers the virus to you and therefore your baby. Do not share sex toys, and always use a condom when having sex (oral, anal, or vaginal) for the rest of the pregnancy. \n\nZika can last in semen for at least 6 months, even if a man receives a negative blood test for Zika. Testing semen for Zika is difficult to interpret. This is why they are doing an antibody test. The antibody test will be on you - a blood test \u2013 not on her. It will test for antibodies in your blood that shows if you were infected with Zika. This test can be done up to 12 weeks after exposure, so you will want to do it asap. As we are in week 7 of this year, your dates are a little off (9 weeks would indicate possible pregnancy when you were exposed, but this is calculated on your last menstrual period not conception). Either way, you are still within that 12 week window, but the sooner the better. If the results of the test are positive, or unclear, the doctors will forward it on for a second test to be done by the CDC (called a PRNT) for complete confirmation. \n\nEven if it is positive, not every pregnant mother infected with Zika will result in a baby with Zika Congenital Syndrome. The CDC advises that \"Not all babies born with congenital Zika infection will have all of these problems. Some infants with congenital Zika virus infection who do not have microcephaly at birth may later experience slowed head growth and develop postnatal microcephaly. Recognizing that Zika is a cause of certain birth defects does not mean that every pregnant woman infected with Zika will have a baby with a birth defect. It means that infection with Zika during pregnancy increases the chances for these problems. Scientists continue to study how Zika virus affects mothers and their children to better understand the full range of potential health problems that Zika virus infection during pregnancy may cause.\"\n\nFinally, what are the chances of getting Zika in Ft Lauderdale in December 2016? The type of mosquito that spreads Zika only has a small range that it lives in. In December 2016, Zika was present in Miami Beach mosquitoes but was not identified in Ft Lauderdale mosquitoes. As of today, based on publicly available information, mosquitoes in Ft Lauderdale do not have Zika. I am not sure which \"yellow zone\" they are talking about, as the CDC has not publicly changed any status.  Even if there is a newly identified outbreak of Zika now, that does not mean that Ft Lauderdale mosquitoes had Zika back in December.\n\nAssuming all of the above, your doctor is doing the right thing getting you tested but I do not personally think there is a need to panic. There is no simple \"risk level\" as there are so many assumptions and variables. However, if it were me I would 1) get the antibody test done asap, and 2) only use condoms if you choose to have sex (oral, anal, vaginal) during the rest of the pregnancy. Your risk, from the information above, appears to be low \u2013 if it were me, I would be \"alert but not alarmed\". \n\nA lot of this is available on the CDC website but it is highly technical and full of jargon.

Wolbachia pipientis, a bacterial endosymbiont of insect, has recently garnered attention as a mechanism for arbovirus control. Here we report that Aedes aegypti harboring Wolbachia are highly resistant to infection with two currently circulating Zika virus isolates from the recent Brazilian epidemic. Wolbachia-harboring mosquitoes displayed lower viral prevalence and intensity and decreased disseminated infection and, critically, did not carry infectious virus in the saliva, suggesting that viral transmission was blocked. Our data indicate that the use of Wolbachia-harboring mosquitoes could represent an effective mechanism to reduce Zika virus transmission and should be included as part of Zika control strategies.", "Department of Health Daily Zika Update ", "Washington\u2019s first case of Zika virus found at Thurston County hospital ", "CDC's New Miami Zika 'Red Zone' Means Stay Out for Pregnant Women ", "Brazilian scientists find new Zika-linked brain disorder in adults ", "The Zika Virus: Will an outbreak occur?

He had just come from the public health lab in New York City, where technicians had been finding markers for Zika in the blood of arriving travelers almost every day. In the smaller, but still international, city of Washington, the same test was negative \u2014 every time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Soon, U.S. health officials joined in Tran\u2019s concern: Samples supplied by the federal government of the frightening, mosquito-borne virus that were tested in the lab as a control were appearing as if they contained no virus.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cI knew then that something was tremendously wrong,\u201d Tran said late last week in an interview. He halted testing, and with help from analysts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, traced the problem to a mistake that any high school chemistry student could understand.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were two types of solution the District could have purchased to conduct a phase of the test. One bottle came marked with a \u201cD,\u201d for diluted, and the other with a \u201cU\u201d, for undiluted. D.C. lab workers had purchased the diluted version, Tran said, and then mistakenly watered it down as if it was the more concentrated one, weakening the ability to detect for Zika.\n&gt; \n&gt; For a public health lab to commit such an error once would be an embarrassment in the high-stakes testing of Zika, which has potentially devastating consequences for pregnant women, scientists and federal health officials say. **That the District lab \u2014 which is also a first line of defense in screening bioterrorism threats \u2014 repeated the mistake daily, and without anyone catching it for more than six months, amounts to a more systemic and worrisome failure, experts said.**\n&gt; \n&gt; Interviews and public documents show that the debacle unfolded over a period of months last year in which the District lab was in a state of turmoil \u2014 understaffed, lacking permanent leadership, spread thin on competing projects, and relying on new employees to test for the emerging public health threat in Zika.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cA relatively inexperienced staff and a lack of leadership \u2014 that is a bad combination,\u201d said Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases for the Association of Public Health Laboratories, which works to safeguard the integrity of public health labs nationwide. \u201cThe positive here is that the lab does have new leadership and he caught the error quickly, even though the situation is already really, very unfortunate.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Since D.C. officials announced the error on February 9, public health officials in a network of nearly 50 labs studying Zika have questioned how it could have gone so wrong. It was the only jurisdiction in the country to have mishandled the testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the District, the mishap has shaken public confidence in Zika testing and, attorneys say, could result in millions of dollars in legal claims. And all of that may pale in comparison to the effects that the botched tests may have on a handful of D.C. families.\n&gt; \n&gt; At least nine pregnant women in the nation\u2019s capital were caught in the faulty testing between July and December of last year, D.C. officials said Thursday. The women were told they did not have Zika when in fact new testing by a CDC lab in Colorado shows that the women did have antibodies that could signal the presence of the virus. Follow-up tests on eight have been inconclusive and one has been confirmed as having a Zika infection.\n&gt; \n&gt; District officials say they do not know how far along any of the women were in their pregnancies when they were wrongly told they were healthy. The District also does not know if any of the women have since given birth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zika is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito but it can also be passed through sex, even if the infected person shows no symptoms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Public health officials say they have relayed the new test results to the women\u2019s health care providers, and they are girding for the number of new Zika patients to rise as retesting is completed for the final third of the 300 pregnant women the District says were inaccurately tested.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to a study in December, about 6 percent of pregnant women believed to be infected with Zika in the United States had a baby or fetus with at least one birth defect related to the viral infection last year. Most suffered from severe microcephaly, characterized by abnormally small head size and, often, an underdeveloped brain.\n&gt; \n&gt; But babies infected with Zika are not always obvious. Some problems stemming from infection may not show up until a year after birth or longer and can include hearing loss, irritability, difficulty swallowing, and cognitive, sensory and motor-skill difficulties.\n&gt; \n&gt; That means the fallout in the District may not be felt for some time.\n&gt; \n&gt; **\u2018A mad scramble\u2019**\n&gt; \n&gt; Tucked away in the District\u2019s new glass-and-steel forensic sciences building, a couple of blocks south of the National Air and Space Museum, are a group of scientists who quietly toil away on some vitally important work.\n&gt; \n&gt; At inauguration time, they test the food served at high-dollar balls for food-borne illnesses and contamination. When a suspicious, white powder is found in the District, the lab is one of the first to test the substances for biological weapons. And on more mundane days, the staff of the Public Health Laboratory Division tests water pollution in the Potomac and helps to identify influenza strains that should be included in the next year\u2019s vaccines.\n&gt; \n&gt; As a division of the District\u2019s Forensic Sciences Department, the lab was rarely in the news.\n&gt; \n&gt; By comparison, the lab\u2019s sister division, the crime lab, had to halt DNA testing in 2015, after questions surfaced about the accuracy of its work.\n&gt; \n&gt; The scandal forced out the department\u2019s former director and D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) brought in Jenifer Smith, a former FBI forensics expert, to clean house and restore the lab\u2019s reputation.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to two officials familiar with Smith\u2019s rebuilding plan, as well as public budget documents from the agency, Smith\u2019s top priority early last year was restarting DNA testing at the crime lab.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the year before it confronted Zika, the public health lab was shedding its most experienced staff \u2014 for a variety of reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; Former director Alpha Diallo, a native of Guinea, left to fight Ebola in Africa. The lab\u2019s head of virology, Anicet Dahourou, and its head of microbiology, Morris Blaylock, also resigned and took jobs with the CDC in Atlanta.\n&gt; \n&gt; In March 2016, with Zika as a looming threat, three of the lab\u2019s six quality assurance jobs were vacant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Maurice Knuckles, who had directed the office a decade earlier, was brought back from semiretirement by Smith to run things on an interim basis, officials said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blaylock, reached in Atlanta, said preparing for Zika in the early months of last year with a thin staff was \u201ca mad scramble.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; The District wanted to join dozens of states that were applying to the CDC for the authority to conduct their own Zika tests instead of shipping them off to the federal agency. To apply, the lab was sent a panel of blind tests by the CDC and had to replicate positive and negative results achieved at a federal lab.\n&gt; \n&gt; The D.C. health lab successfully did so and got permission in late May to begin its own Zika testing program, Tran said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Smith said the lab hired four people to conduct the tests and trained them for weeks before Zika testing was launched on July 14.\n&gt; \n&gt; Part of the preparation process involved setting up quality controls, testing procedures and what Tran described as a small \u201cmanufacturing plant\u201d of solutions and coatings to conduct the tests.\n&gt; \n&gt; In an interview, Smith and Tran said it was unclear if the lab employees had used the appropriate dilution in the spring when the lab passed the CDC test.\n&gt; \n&gt; But Tran said that it is now clear that by July, workers had begun the lab\u2019s Zika testing with an over-diluted solution.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was not caught earlier, Tran said, because even with a weakened solution, daily control tests still showed positive results, at least, until a final batch was mixed late last year.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blaylock said the loss of the lab\u2019s virology director was a major gap, and any sustained campaign of virus testing would have exposed weaknesses in the team\u2019s staffing.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWe could deal with an emergency response, we could manage it for a short time, but anything long-term, it was going to wear down that team because it was so short-staffed,\u201d he said. \u201cI know they were trying to get personnel on board, I do know that was the primary challenge.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Smith dismissed the idea that the botched tests were the result of a newly hired staff or lack of seasoned leaders in key positions. \u201cThis is not an issue of staffing,\u201d she said.\n&gt; \n&gt; **\u2018Something is wrong\u2019**\n&gt; \n&gt; The faulty solution was not the failure point that Tran noticed in the District\u2019s Zika testing procedures when he joined the lab late last fall.\n&gt; \n&gt; Concerned about the high number of negative results, Tran began double-checking the team\u2019s math and found an error, he said. Lab workers had fumbled a formula to calculate test results, skewing some inconclusive ones toward negative results.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cI started to investigate and the first thing I found was a really, a quite basic arithmetic error,\u201d he said.\n&gt; \n&gt; That discovery led Tran to stop the testing and recalculate the score for the tests done since July.\n&gt; \n&gt; None of the recalculations resulted in a shift to a clearly positive result, he said. Tran was prepared to resume testing in the lab when a new problem developed with the daily control tests: \u201cNow, we were getting no reaction through the plates and I said, \u2018Something is wrong. .\u2009.\u2009. We need to do a deep dig and figure out what is wrong.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; On a conference call with the CDC\u2019s Zika experts in December, Tran was stumped. The analysts had gone over all the other complicated calibrations and procedures and everything seemed right. Then one asked a basic question. What type of solution had the District purchased?\n&gt; \n&gt; Tran had never thought to check. \u201cThat was huge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe dilution factor was a problem since the day we began.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Smith said that no one involved in the mistake still works at the lab, but she declined to say how many employees were affected or if they resigned under pressure. Bowser last week said no one had been fired.\n&gt; \n&gt; Smith said she thought the District\u2019s trouble would someday be held up as an example of something more than a mistake.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cWe are going to learn from this; the field of science will advance,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis is a situation where you had positive controls working, but the test is at a level where it gave a different result. .\u2009.\u2009. It is a great example in the grayness of the world we work in. .\u2009.\u2009. This is not the instant pregnancy test, these are more complicated tests.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Tran said he knew the lab would attract intense scrutiny over the mistake but never hesitated to go public.\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201cI knew what was going to be happening, but there was no other decision for me to make,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to give the best care because there is no cure for this.\u201d\n \nsource: \n\n\n", "WHO | Zika situation report (31MAR16) ", "Prevent Aedes Mosquito Breeding ", "PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases: Zika Virus Outbreak in Haiti in 2014: Molecular and Clinical Data | (25APR16) ", "Chris Christie's call for Zika quarantines is just as silly as his call for Ebola quarantines ", "Race for Zika vaccine gathers momentum as virus spreads ", "Australia pledges aid to help Tonga with Zika virus ", "Florida announces Zika case hundreds of miles from Miami ", "Zika Virus Outbreak in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Clinical Characterization, Epidemiological and Virological Aspects | PLOS (12APR16) ", "U.S. Scientists Are Starting From Ground Zero With The Zika Vaccine ", "Elements of transgenic disease-vector control (Part 1: setting the scene) ", "Association between Zika virus and Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is marked by rapid muscle onset weakness.

Phylogenetic analysis reveals that contemporary epidemic strains have accumulated multiple substitutions from their Asian ancestor. Here, we show that a single serine to asparagine substitution (S139N) in the viral polyprotein substantially increased ZIKV infectivity in both human and mouse neural progenitor cells (NPCs), led to more significant microcephaly in the mouse fetus, and higher mortality in neonatal mice. Evolutionary analysis indicates that the S139N substitution arose before the 2013 outbreak in French Polynesia and has been stably maintained during subsequent spread to the Americas. This functional adaption makes ZIKV more virulent to human NPCs, thus contributing to the increased incidence of microcephaly in recent ZIKV epidemics.\n&gt;\n", "Zika and Sexual Transmission | Zika virus (04APR16) ", "Florida to begin aerial spraying of insecticides to control Zika ", "Zika 'link' to paralysing myelitis, say researchers ", "Zika Posing a Crisis For Motherhood ", "Understanding updated Zika map Updated Zika map shows equal risk in United States, Central America, the Caribbean, and most of South America.

Thus Zika-related GBS follows a parainfectious pattern, rather than the classical post-infection presentation of GBS.\n&gt; Temporal Zika, GBS relationship?\n&gt; \n&gt; According to a commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine, the study provides some temporal evidence of Zika virus infection and subsequent GBS diagnosis.

Then they repeated sample collection at months 2, 4, and 6. All of the specimens were tested by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serum was tested by IgM assay. Patients who still tested positive for any type of specimen at week 4 underwent biweekly collection until results were negative.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zika RNA typically cleared serum within a median time of 14 days, with a 95th percentile time of 54 days, urine 8 and 39 days, respectively, and semen in 34 and 81 days, respectively.

The authors suggest that 2016's second wave of Zika infections could have actually been another flavivirus, such as chikungunya.\n&gt; \n&gt; Using data from two national databases, experts from Brazil and the World Health Organization (WHO) showed that in 2015 a spike in Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) was followed 6 months later with a spike in microcephaly cases. Zika infection has been linked to both diseases. But in 2016, a spike in GBS was not followed by a subsequent rise in microcephaly numbers. The authors suggest that chikungunya \u2014not Zika\u2014was causing the GBS in 2016, and Brazil only experienced a true Zika outbreak in the previous year.\n&gt; \n&gt; The authors posited two other possibilities for the lack of microcephaly cases in 2016: the women in 2015 suffered an unknown co-infection or co-factor that led them to have babies with microcephaly, or the fear of microcephaly and Zika infection led to more abortions and delayed pregnancies. But birth registry data are not yet complete enough to determine whether birth rates fell or abortion rates increased in 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Among these hypotheses, the first seems to be the most plausible \u2014 that is, both ZIKV and chikungunya viruses are important causes of GBS, but among the arboviruses circulating in Brazil, only ZIKV causes microcephaly and other neurologic disorders after infection during pregnancy,\" the authors conclude.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mar 29 N Engl J Med ( I have said it before - data from Brazil is highly suspect, and the link is still tenuous.

Mosquitos only reproduce when it rains and there is standing water left everywhere in buckets, tires etc. Mosquitos only travel a few hundred meters from where they were born as well.\n\nKnowing all this, the government implemented a strict penalty system that if you have standing water around your property, be it private or business, you will receive hefty fines. As such the mosquitos do not get a place to reproduce and the amount of mosquitos are greatly reduced.\n\nBesides this, the government also sprays an \"environment friendly\" pesticide into the areas where they are known to reproduce(next to the lagoons for example). How environment friendly that really is is anyone's guess though.\n\nLast year there were zero cases of Zika registered on the island. &gt; Papiamento \n\nI can work with a good number of languages, so that should not be a problem.

The findings also came with a warning that too few babies born with congenital Zika infections are getting the recommended brain imaging. CDC experts published their findings today in a Vital Signs report in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).\n&gt; \n&gt; At a media telebriefing today, Anne Schuchat, MD, acting CDC director, said most of the pregnant women were infected with Zika virus during travel outside of the United States and that the Zika threat is far from over. She said the CDC is still receiving about 30 to 40 reports of pregnant women infected with Zika virus each week.\n&gt; Higher risk in first-trimester infections\n&gt; \n&gt; Today's report covers 1,297 pregnancies with possible recent Zika infection reported in 44 states in 2016.

The level was even higher\u201415%\u2014in women infected during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, there were 45 live births and 6 pregnancy losses in the pregnant women who had any lab evidence of possible Zika infections. Schuchat said the cases have links to travel to 16 different countries or territories.\n&gt; \n&gt; Peggy Honein, PhD, MPH, chief of the birth defects branch at the CDC's National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, said for comparison, a report in December from Brazilian researchers found about a 10% birth defect level in Rio de Janeiro pregnant women who had been infected in any trimester with Zika virus. And a report from French Guiana found that about 13% of babies born to women infected during the first two trimesters had evidence of brain abnormalities. \"We are seeing some consistency in the reports,\" she said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Schuchat said the number of affected babies and fetuses may be an undercount, because some likely went undetected, because babies either did not get the recommended evaluation or because some problems, such as developmental delay, do not surface until well after birth. \"We are still learning about the full range of Zika,\" Schuchat said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zika's impact on babies and their families can be devastating, not only because of the heartbreaking physical effects, but also because of resources needed to care for affected babies. The cost of caring for a baby born with microcephaly is estimated to be $4 million, an amount that rises to $10 million for those who reach adulthood.\n&gt; Gaps in babies' medical exams\n&gt; \n&gt; CDC investigators also found that only one in four Zika-affected babies received recommended brain imaging after birth, a key to identifying problems and connecting babies and families to crucial medical care and support. Officials at the media briefing said the reasons are complex and not fully understood. Schuchat, however, said the recommendation for physical exam and tests for Zika-affected babies is relatively new, and many clinicians might not be aware of it and may not know the value of brain scanning.\n&gt; \n&gt; The report also noted a gap in testing newborns who have possible congenital Zika infections: one in three had no report of Zika testing at birth.\n&gt; \n&gt; She said though the condition is rare, pregnant women with possible Zika virus infection have been reported in 44 states, a reminder than a baby born with Zika-linked birth defect could occur nearly anywhere in the country.\n&gt; \n&gt; With a new mosquito season just around the corner and the travel season in full swing, CDC officials today urged pregnant women to avoid visiting areas with known Zika risk and avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has traveled to an area where the virus is spreading locally.

Our plan was to be very aggressive with prevention methods, watch for symptoms, &amp; then get us both tested when we get back. If we had no symptoms &amp; were negative then try to get pregnant.\n\nWhat is your thoughts? Prevalence rate will not be relevant or helpful for you. There is zika in CR, except for in high altitudes. Your plan sounds sensible, but be aware false negatives have been an issue with public health departments. In addition, if one of you tests positive, you should have a plan for up to 6 months preventing possible transmission (ie barrier sex). \nIt is all about weighing risks. For what it is worth, If I were hoping to get pregnant in the next year, I would not be travelling to zika areas.\n\nsource: work for int orgs in this field. Thanks for commenting. I appreciate it. Since you are involved can I ask one more question? \n\nWhere would we go to get tested? Would her OBGYN be able to order those tests or do we go to somewhere else? Sure! Yes - obgyn can, in fact any primary care doctor should be able to. Might be worth scheduling an appointment with obgyn before you go to make sure you have all the latest up to date info on specificity of the diagnostic test (ie what are the chances of a false negative blood test that misses zika in semen) plus they can preschedule for the test on your return. Yeah we are def pre scheduling. &amp; we talked about our decision tree (for lack of better term). \n\nThanks for your info. If I end up with some other question can I ask you? \n\n&amp; thanks for not brow beating or anything. \n\n Of course. Balancing risks are always tough and involve very personal decisions. Good luck!  This was a very helpful answer. I have a similar question, involving my husband possibly taking a business trip to Costa Rica in two months, then weighing whether we would have to wait 6 months to try to conceive. Is the degree of risk still the same in Costa Rica as when you responded to this two months ago? (How does it relate to the risk in Brazil?) (I know it depends on luck and precautions and where you go in CR, but still--any kind of way to describe it?) \n\nI guess we are wondering whether there is any way for us to be sure enough via testing that he did not/does not have Zika that we do not have to wait the full 6 months? Sorry to be asking these questions, I know they do not have straightforward answers, I just cannot help but ask them.  Hi! So the CDC still classifies Costa Rica as a category 2 risk and advise that couples wait at least 6 months after travel. San Jose and Liberia (two main cities in CAR) are both in transmission zones. An important note is that even if local transmission rates have dropped, that is likely because of increasing local immunity which would not apply to travellers such as your husband, so it is still a risk. Unfortunately, negative blood tests do not mean there is not possible zika still in seminal fluids that could transmit to you (and potential baby).Testing semen and vaginal fluids for Zika virus is not currently available outside of the research setting.\n\nFurther, in a study released this week, zika infection is associated with decreased sperm count in men (returns to normal within a couple of months). This shows how much we are still learning about this disease and how it works. If it were me and my partner, he would not travel. If he legitimately had to, we would then use condoms for 6 months and delay pregnancy.\n\nI would highly recommend seeing your OB/GYN with your partner to discuss your options fully.  :)\n \nMore info here:\n Thanks so much for this answer!

The CDC said that, since Jun 15, 2016, residents of Broward and Palm Beach counties have been at a potentially increased risk, because they often move back and forth to Miami-Dade County, which was Florida's only transmission area. Also, some of the people in the region who were sick with Zika apparently did not travel to Miami-Dade County.\n&gt; \n&gt; The CDC's statement also appears to push back the start date of the risk period from Aug 1, 2016, to Jun 15, 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; Denise Jamieson, MD, incident commander with the CDC's Zika emergency response and chief of the women's health and fertility branch in the CDC's reproductive health division, told reporters that new information found in the cases highlights the challenges of identifying the exposure source.\n&gt; \n&gt; Officials said residents of the tri-county area may not consider their movements between counties as travel to a risk area. Though the exposure locations are unclear for some of the patients who acquired their infections locally, CDC officials said that while Broward and Palm Beach counties have not been considered active local transmission areas, they are areas at increased risk.\n&gt; \n&gt; The increased risk is especially relevant for semen, because of viral persistence in that reproductive tissue, the CDC said. Unlike for blood donations, donated semen does not undergo a validated test to detect Zika virus, so there is a risk that some donations collected and stored at local tissue banks might still contain Zika virus.\n&gt; \n&gt; Federal health officials want to make sure women and couples are aware of the potential threat to semen donated over the past several months in the Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties and talk to their doctors before undergoing assisted reproduction procedures with donated semen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter Marks, MD, PhD, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said there are 12 sperm banks in the three-county area.\n&gt; \n&gt; There have been no suspected cases of Zika in Florida transmitted through donated semen, said Matthew Kuehnert, MD, who leads the blood safety task force for the CDC's Zika emergency response.\n&gt; \n&gt; Officials said the last locally acquired Zika case occurred on Dec 21, though Florida Health recently reported a few more cases that were confirmed in follow-up testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; See also:\n&gt; \n&gt; Mar 13 CDC ( **( **(", "NIH launches large study of pregnant women in areas affected by Zika virus | (21JUN16) ", "Texas Dept of State Health Services | Zika Virus Update | (27JAN17) ", "Zika virus: a previously slow pandemic spreads rapidly through the Americas (Published: 18DEC2015) ", "UMMS scientists offer first look at how our cells can \u2018swallow up and quarantine\u2019 Zika ", "Zika Virus Risk-Based Preparedness and Response Guidance for States | Zika virus (09MAR16) ", "WHO sets new guidelines on Zika sex; CDC reviewing its advice ", "Beenie Man Misses OVO Fest After Contracting The Zika Virus ", "Zika virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccine | (08MAY17) CIDRAP summary in comments  &gt; **VLP Zika vaccine successful in preclinical study**\n&gt; \n&gt; A novel virus-like particle (VLP) Zika vaccine elicited high titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies in mice, according to the vaccine's manufacturer, TechnoVax.

The team compared the findings and incidence with two age-range matched controls from the same neighborhood as each GBS patient.\n&gt; \n&gt; Incidence of GBS was 10 times higher in people age 60 and older compared with those younger than 20. Last week's Brazilian study also found that the incidence was 10 times higher in the oldest group than in the youngest group.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Colombian study also found that those with suspected or probable Zika disease also had higher odds of developing GBS.

We reviewed clinical data for GBS cases in Barranquilla and performed a case-control investigation to assess the association of suspect and probable Zika virus disease with GBS.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **Methods**\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We used the Brighton Collaboration Criteria to confirm reported GBS patients in Barranquilla during October 2015\u2013April 2016. In April 2016, two neighborhood and age range-matched controls were selected for each confirmed GBS case-patient. We obtained demographics and antecedent symptoms in the 2-month period before GBS onset for case-patients and the same period for controls. Sera were collected for Zika virus antibody testing. Suspected Zika virus disease was defined as a history of rash and \u22652 other Zika-related symptoms (fever, arthralgia, myalgia, or conjunctivitis). Probable Zika virus disease was defined as suspected Zika virus disease with laboratory evidence of a recent Zika virus or flavivirus infection. Conditional logistic regression adjusted for sex and race/ethnicity was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **Results**\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We confirmed 47 GBS cases. Incidence increased with age (10-fold higher in those \u226560\u2005years versus those &lt;20\u2005years). We interviewed 40 case-patients and 79 controls. There was no significant difference in laboratory evidence of recent Zika virus or flavivirus infection between case-patients and controls (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 0.9\u20135.1). GBS was associated with having suspected (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.1\u20138.6) or probable Zika virus disease (OR: 4.6, CI: 1.1\u201319.0).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **Conclusions**\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Older individuals and those with suspected and probable Zika virus disease had higher odds of developing GBS.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; **Key points**\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *We confirmed a Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia, during October 2015\u2013April 2016.

Scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) said that microcephaly occurs when the Zika virus attacks a developing fetus's stem cells. The authors discovered that the Asian, but not African, lineage of Zika viruses causes the stem cells to stop proliferating in the developing fetus.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"We discovered that the Asian lineage Zika virus halted the proliferation of brain stem cells and hindered their ability to develop into brain nerve cells,\" said Ping Wu, MD, PhD, senior author on the study and UTMB professor in the Department of Neuroscience &amp; Cell Biology, in a press release from UTMB. \"This difference seems to be linked with a Zika-induced change in global gene expression pattern, it remains to be seen which genes are responsible.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally today, JAMA Pediatrics published the results of a September 2016 workshop sponsored by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institutes of Health to identify the key components of caring for children born with Zika-related microcephaly and other complications.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many children, experts agree, may not have microcephaly at birth but may develop neurologic disorders because of prenatal Zika infection.

Researchers from New York and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently calculated the background level for that state, using data from 2013 to 2015 before imported cases began to appear in the United States.

Writing in The Lancet Infectious Diseases yesterday, the team described an outbreak that began in August 2016.\n&gt; \n&gt; From August through November 2016, Singapore confirmed 455 Zika cases, with the outbreak occurring in an area at high risk for dengue transmission and near a construction site where control of mosquito breeding was difficult. During the first phase of the outbreak, health authorities isolated sick patients in the hospital in an attempt to prevent the virus from spreading, but it had already moved into the local mosquito population. Officials then focused on community engagement and vector control.\n&gt; \n&gt; The team estimated that after authorities implemented response steps, over a 4-week period the reproductive number (R0) declined from 3.62 to 1.22.\n&gt; \n&gt; Phylogenetic analysis of human and mosquito Zika strains showed little diversity and found the virus was distinct from other Asian strains, with the most common ancestor from May 2016.

Most insecticides only produce a transient reduction of adult populations, and breeding sites can be hard to target. To counter these factors, researchers used adult mosquitoes to disseminate particles of PPF to breeding sites.\n&gt; \n&gt; From February 2014 to March 2015, researchers working in Manacapuru, Brazil, measured mosquito populations throughout the city. Beginning in March 2015, they placed plastic cups containing PPF and tap water in 100 dwellings and analyzed mosquito populations after 5 months of citywide PPF dissemination, 3 months of focal PPF dissemination around Aedes-infested dwellings, and 3 months after dissemination ended.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to the study, the number of Aedes juvenile samples decreased by 79% to 92%, and mean adult Aedes emergence fell from 1,077 per month at baseline to 50.4 per month during PPF dissemination.

At the height of the first wave in 2016, peak monthly occurrence was estimated at 49.9 cases per 10,000 live births. During the second wave, the estimated monthly peaks varied from 3.2 cases to 15 cases per 10,000 live births, or at most less than a third of the rate during the 2016 peak.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the first study that looked at the microcephaly cases in terms of regional differences, the authors said. They added that the results, taken with data from other countries battling Zika, provide more evidence that the first wave in Brazil was an outlier.\n&gt; \n&gt; But there are no clear answers yet as to what caused the increase in microcephaly cases. The authors said, \"The marked variation in the frequency of infection-related microcephaly across regions and time is puzzling.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; In a commentary on the study, two UK experts expand on the data: \"The difference in the association between Zika virus and microcephaly in northeastern Brazil and the rest of the country\u2014which the authors do not present\u2014would be more than 100 times greater.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Other cohorts assessed in other regions of Brazil and Latin America will provide further robust evidence on whether variations exist in risk, and if so, why,\" said Laura C.

The study is based on tissue specimens from 627 completed pregnancies that involved possible maternal Zika virus exposure from the 50 states and Washington, D.C., that were submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2016 for testing.\n&gt; \n&gt; These specimens included placental tissues from 546 live births and placental and fetal tissues from 81 pregnancy losses. \"Among live births, placental tissue RT-PCR  provided confirmation of recent maternal Zika virus infection for 47 (10%) women who otherwise did not have a definitive diagnosis,\" the authors said.\n&gt; \n&gt; The authors write that testing the placental tissues for Zika virus can offer a definitive diagnosis that separates Zika infection from other flaviviruses, or if the mother's test results are inconclusive.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Tissue analysis can be valuable when maternal serologic testing either cannot differentiate between Zika virus and other related flaviviruses, or has been conducted &gt;12 weeks after possible maternal exposure, and infant Zika virus testing is not definitive, negative, or not performed. Tissue analysis provides another opportunity to confirm maternal Zika virus infection, which can be important to both families and health care providers,\" the authors concluded.\n&gt; \n&gt; They add, however, that a positive placental specimen does not differentiate between maternal or congenital infections, making prenatal testing still the most valuable tool in the management of pregnant women with possible Zika exposure.\n&gt; \n&gt; See also:\n&gt; \n&gt; Jun 21 Lancet (\n&gt; \n&gt; Jun 21 Lancet (\n&gt; \n&gt; Jun 23 MMWR (\n&gt; \n\n^(source: \n\n", "Zika virus 'scarier than thought' says US ", "You can get alerts on any locally acquired vector-borne cases of Zika reported in your state by the CDC.

Can I ask why Martinique and Guadeloupe have been removed from the CDC zika risk map? Is it under reporting or? I have been looking at zika free warm weather winter destinations and Martinique and Guadaloupe are the only Caribbean destinations listed as no known risk, despite being surrounded by zika in every other country. A lot of nations do not have the resources to determine the extent of issues being faced.  They look instead to larger nations and international orgs with deeper pockets to provide information.
