Two of my four foster kittens! Benji is being adopted by my boyfriend so he is going to an amazing home! Any tips on how to support his needs?  Yay baby wobblers! The best thing you can do is let him learn :) As much as you may want to scoop him up and give him kisses every time he beefs it, it is best to let him correct himself and develop those muscles to compensate for his clumsiness!\n\nBeing a kitten, he is already very clumsy, so chances are high that he will get better as he grows! Sooo adorable! Totally agree with the previous comment - let him learn and wobble in a safe environment (of course no stairs or sharp corners nearby!) As he gets bigger, his muscles will strengthen and he will gain more stability. They are incredibly sweet cats, and the bond you develop with them is pretty darn strong as they rely on you for assistance, you are there to help them up if they tip over, etc. Lots of close contact. My CH baby (well, almost 8 months old now!) runs the house, and tells my other 2 non-CH kitties what is up \ud83d\ude3c She can manage stairs with supervision, uses her litter box like 'normal'. She does not let CH hold her back in any way. For litter, you may want to try the pellet kind (Yesterday's News or similar) as many CH cats lie down in their box as they are using it, and the pellets will not stick to their fur. You may need to cut down the front portion of a litter box so Benji can easily access the box without having to try to climb over the side of it (foam pipe insulation easily covers the rough edge created when you cut the side down). He will probably be able to graduate to a normal box when he grows and his little legs get longer. Keep some moist cat-safe wipes on hand, so you can wipe him down after litter box accidents, or food accidents (he will for sure tip over into his food at some point haha!)   Congrats to your BF on the new addition! \ud83d\udc31 That sweet little blep I would check some of the more recent posts for some good pieces of advice. It may help you quite a bit. Such a cute little wobbler! Aside from what the other comments said, having area rugs or carpeted rooms are great for CH cats, as they can usually stabilize themselves better. Or at least mine has an easier time lol. Oh, and maybe get lots of toys they can play with while laying down! So happy for his new addition to the family!", "Wobbly in slow motion. Meet Flounder, our adopted kitten.  Hi gorgeous Flounder! That name is amazing! What a gorgeous boy! Omg what a cutey!", "Special platform for while eating? I am in the process of adopting a cat with mild CH, and one of the things they talked about is how he does not eat a lot because he has a hard time standing and eating, and he gets really sick if he does not eat food that is up on a platform for him.\n\nHearing this, I went home and  designed a \"platform\" (for lack of a better name) that he could rest his weight on while standing and eating. Has anyone tried something similar before? I am sure I am not the first one... \n\nHe is still pretty young (11 months) so it seems like now would be a good time to get him used to this sort of setup, but I wonder if maybe this is one of those classic beginner mistakes? I have never had a cat with CH but im pretty handy and want to at least try to make things easier for him to do on his own. I will always be there to help him but like, maybe it will give him a confidence boost if I get him a setup where he needs me a little less?\n\nI know it is important for him to build his muscles, but I also feel it is more important for him to be able to eat all his food comfortably. I am more than happy to help him build muscle in other ways, and it can be something we slowly try to work towards him not needing as well, but for the time being it seems like building this is a good idea.\n\nWe also already have tons of climbing stuff because our other cats LOVE climbing so once I make those a little safer for him, he will have plenty of exercise options.\n\nSorry for rambling a bit, I am very excited to take him home tomorrow, he is such a sweet man \u2764\n\n\nEdit: also, I saw many people saying not to have your CH cat outside ever, and I was curious as to why. I like to walk my cats in a stroller, and i find it is a very good bonding opportunity for me and the cats. It would be a shame to leave him out BUT his well being comes first. I know I probably sound crazy but I love my cats and they love basking in the sun so sometimes on sunny days I take them to a quiet park and they take a nap in the stroller... Congrats on your new wobbly angel! \n\nI know he will have an amazing home with you just by how much you care and how much you are thinking ahead. \n\nTo start yes absolutely a platform could help. It really depends. At 11 months and a mild case he probably has certain ways he is begun to compensate and attempt to stabilize. A structure to assist in a less exhausting mealtime is a great idea and definitely will not hinder any exercise or strength building. Some people have had success with almost small mini feeding stalls with the bowl on one end. With my little guy I just have a nice firm grippy rug under his bowls and he loves being able to anchor his claws in and eat without any assistance. \n\nPlaying with him is really how you will help him build strength and confidence. My guy Hermes LOVES fetch so I promote that daily. Wands can be fun and interactive for them on the carpet or on a big bed  \n\nAs for the outside thing that is just because of their inability to fend for themselves and escape danger in an emergency. Under supervision it is totally fine. Just stay away from rough concrete, gravel, pavement, because they can really rub their legs and paws raw. Hermes loves his outdoor time.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, good luck! A platform will only help. He cannot build muscle if he is not getting enough calories to grow. Meeting his basic needs should not be a physical therapy exercise. \n\nAs for the outside thing, being restrained in a stroller should be fine as long as he cannot get out. When they say \u201cno outside\u201d they mean do not let your cat be an \u201coutdoor cat,\u201d as in do not be an irresponsible idiot and let your cat free roam, destroy native wildlife, and get hit by cars and attacked by wild animals.

Again, should definitely talk with your vet before trying things. Anything to do with the neurological system makes me nervous personally! Talk to your vet.

I do have a 7 month old puppy who is energetic, is good with our current cat, but likes to play a bit rough with her.

", "Husky with CH I think my husky had a seizure this morning. Has anyone else had this happen? He is 11 years old so he is not a young pup but it is hard to talk to anyone about because of his condition. He looks fine to everyone else but I can tell something still just is not right. I am no vet so the first piece of advice I would give you is to take him to one ASAP. Seizures could be so many things and none of them are good. Some are definitely less serious than others like dieting problems, but it could also be anything from that to a brain tumor. Take your dog to a vet, let them know he had a seizure, they will probably want to x Ray the dog if not give him an MRI (not sure as I said I am no vet) but from that point what is wrong and what your options are should be clearer. Thank you! He has an appointment but they did not seem to think it was that serious and will not see him until tomorrow.  He regular Vet was not in the clinic today and the lady I spoke with told me everything I was describing was \u201cnormal\u201d for his condition. How is your pup doing? Has he had any more seizures? Thank you so much for asking! He is doing very well. He was a little unsteady the day after and had trouble coordinating his movements but after helping him and exercising his legs he is back to normal like it never happened. So glad he is doing better. I cannot imagine how scary that must have been.

Any advise on a first time ch cat mom? My advice is to be patient with finding out what works for them! We adopted a wobbler that we thought was a mild case, but she is actually pretty severe\u2014could not climb into or out of a normal litter box and could not stand up to do her business. We had a looooootttt of accidents and did a lot of trial and error with box types, litter materials, etc. It was frustrating, but we gave her time to acclimate and \u201ctell\u201d us what worked for her.  Try out different styles of litter boxes,  my ch kitty has a favourite corner style allowing him to eliminate with ease.   Be slow with changing foods as changing foods sometimes gives my guy the runs ; which means baths.    Be cautious with different wet foods too.    If they are still young I would recommend giving baths regularly to get them use to it.  I am so happy I did that as now he actually enjoys baths.    Water dishes! Make sure you find one that works and your kitty is able to drink water out of it.    I use sleepy pod food / water dishes due to the fact they are soft and prevents teeth chipping as well they stay on the floor and do not slide.        Lots to ch kitties on Instagram to build a community- I echo the importance of litter boxes and patience.  Our two had a fair amount of accidents and oftentimes fell into their elimination while trying to exit the litter box (one also lays down to eliminate).  We ended up constructing a custom litter box using a Rubbermaid tub and it was a game changer (you can look them up online).\n\nI could not be happier with our decision to adopt CH kitties.", "How does CH affect eyesight? We have a new cat with suspected but not confirmed CH in what seems to be a mild form, from what we have read. But while we have seen that it affects eyesight, there is little to no clarification of that part.\n\nHe seems to be lacking depth perception, when chasing a laser he will mostly attack the air between him and the dot, I am not sure if this is expected or not? Umm I dont know if it affects eyesight because I am not a vet. But it very much does affect their ability to move jump and chase things. The part of their brain responsible for fine motor skills is not fully developed, but I am sure you already knew that. It is more than likely that your cat can see the laser its brain just cannot do the things required to make the cat go and catch it. If I were you I would take the cat to a vet so that they can test it for blindness. Much luck and love for you and your little wobbler. He is going for his first vet visit soon so I will bring it up, thanks.\n\nHe was a stray domestic cat we got from a shelter a week ago, settled in within about 5 minutes when we got home, such a friendly wobbly guy :) From what I have seen, CH does not affect eyesight. It does definitely seem to affect the depth perception though! My Richter and a number of other fosters we have had usually have poor depth perception, but not all :) If you shine a light in his eyes and see his pupils dilate, then that is a pretty good indicator that he can see. Keep us updated! Our kitten will launch himself across the room like a freakin antelope to get a laser dot. My little Pomeranian Nala has pretty bad depth perception with her CH, she needs assisted water  drinking where I literally have to hold her head in her water bowl for her to drink other wise she just hovers over it licking the air. \nShe does not do this with food though and can get her head right in and eat. Her head tremor is pretty bad too which would not help but yes I have also queried eyesight too. \n\nIt does effect there sensorys too I heard but unsure in what way with eyesight.", "Hermes conquering the stairs! ", "CH Cats and Anesthesia Hi!\n\nI found a kitten outside while I was working in October and he seemed weird to me, I have done some research and I found out he may be struggling from Cerebellar Hypoplasia because he couldn\u00b4t balance well and was falling all the time. And although my boyfriend\u00b4s limit was one cat and we already had one (\"healthy\") cat at home, I decided to take him with me. Now my boyfriend loves him as much as I do, he brought lots of joy into our lives and I am sooo glad I didn\u00b4t leave him outside, I knew he may die there quite easily (falling, other animals, other cats, injuries...), and I just couldn\u00b4t leave him there. I am such a cat lover, and I also work as a cat sitter, so that may say it all, but this is the first time I actually take care of a somehow disabled kitty.\n\nHe is about 6 months old now and our vet suggested neutering him. He is an indoor cat, but you never know what can happen... But he also told me there is a greater risk that something bad can happen during the operation. Are CH cats really at a bigger risk of complications with anesthesia than cats with no condition?\n\nTL;DR: A CH cat adopted me. Is anesthesia safe for him? Anecdotal only, your vet knows more than I do but I know of one ch kitten who died getting neutered but he was much younger, barely six weeks so that may have contributed. I have two ch cats now, one minor one severe and they are both neutered and doing fine. I adopted my kitten from a shelter, which means he cane to me already with all his shots, treatments, and neutered. As long as the kitten is old enough to go under I would say it should be fine. I have heard it is good to \u201ctest \u201c anesthesia on cats though? Because something bad COULD go wrong with any procedure. Whether it be a wrong dosage or the cat is not healthy in other areas. The biggest recommendation is to avoid ketamine during sedation as it can cause their recovery to be rough. They are already wobbly and they can wake up dizzy and disoriented. \nOtherwise they are not really at a higher risk than other pets under anesthesia. My Ch cat went under for his neuter and came through just fine. Make sure you trust the vet doing the procedure. My vet is a little pricier than most but they are very competent and have reassured me through all of his medical issues. The only type of anesthesia not safe for CH cats is ketamine. Most vets do not use ketamine anymore except as a last resort for pets resistant to other anesthetics, but if a CH cat were to accidentally receive ketamine, there is no way for them to wake up from the anesthesia and they would die. I recommend having your vet add ketamine to your pet\u2019s list of allergies.\n\nAnother safety consideration for anesthesia is your pet\u2019s body weight. CH kitties are often smaller and have delayed growth since they are not able to exercise their muscles well in kittenhood while they figure out how to consciously coordinate their movements (since the cerebellum would usually coordinate muscle memory, but it is underdeveloped). So sometimes vets prefer to delay spay/neuter surgeries for CH kittens until they meet a certain weight threshold. Keep in mind that the stress of a spay/neuter surgery is far less than the stress of going into heat and potential pregnancy/birth, so it is very important to have a CH cat spayed or neutered.\n\nOther than that, any other contraindications to anesthesia would come from separate health problems not related to CH. Our CH kitty Tesla (they/them) also has epilepsy and has actually tolerated anesthesia better than any other cat I have owned (all of whom are larger than Tesla, who weighs just 6 pounds full-grown.) Tesla actually had an intestinal obstruction (from eating a Thai chili-spiced almond, because they are adventurous like that) that had to be removed by emergency abdominal surgery, and then required second surgery seven months later for a complication during healing (a blood vessel grew back around the intestine and caused a second obstruction). Both times, they were ready to come home from the vet a full day earlier than expected, as they came up out of anesthesia easily and were stable right away.

We have hardwood floors, and while we did buy rugs to help the little guy, it seems he still will accidentally slam his head against the hard floor. I have noticed that some of his whiskers have broken off. Is that normal? Do you think it is causing him a lot of pain? Losing whiskers here and there is normal but if your cat is missing a lot of whiskers that could certainly be an issue that you should seek out a Veterinarian for in my opinion. My ch kitten (now a robust, handsome ch cat) had a few of his whiskers seem to snap clean off.

Today however they were very bad, particularly as he began to walk. Could he have mild CH? Is it sometimes hardly present? But then more so? I am no vet. That is who I would ask about this, but also post a longer video of his movement. From what I do understand about CH even in its milder forms it is very noticeable, and mainly affects your cats gait. From this video it does not look like it but if you want to send me a longer video of him walking, and do not mind waiting a week I could show it to my cats vet and see what she thinks cuz he has an appointment on the 26th We have shown it to a vet and also taken him to a vet. The vet said she could not say what it was and to observe him and see if it continues, if it does he will be assessed for epilepsy or a brain tumour among other things. When we took him to the vet he did not exhibit this behaviour and was judged neurologically normal. However when back home it continued in a milder form before ceasing, at least for now. Hmm yea it may not be CH hopefully it is not any of those other things either but it definitely is not CH as the shaking symptom does not stop due to the part of the cats brain responsible for movement not being fully formed.

Slow to grow and almost lost an eye at one point. But she is the sweetest and very rambunctious! Absolutely adorable!  \ud83e\udd70 how severe is she? Some basic tips I can think of would be rugs or carpeted areas, cat cleansing wipes for when she falls and gets messy, and I found putting the litter box against a corner helps by giving them something to lean against. She is fairly mild, you really only notice it if she is playing. The house is mostly carpet already but the litter in the corner is a great suggestion The Cerebellar Hypoplasia Cats &amp; Kittens Facebook group is super active and helpful! Welcome to the wobble family! My best advice is to let her fall over and correct herself to build muscle where she needs it. I would also lightly suggest removing her collar until she gets a little older, just because kittens can get it snagged easily when playing and cleaning. Better safe than sorry!

We are down to 2 a week, which I think is totally amazing and worth others trying it. I got mine off amazon. Its called Pet Hemp Oil for dogs and cats. I give it to her twice a day mixed into her food. Sometimes I will put a few drops on some treats throughout the day.

We currently have a low-walled box in a corner of the room, so walls on two sides. We started with traditional clumping clay litter, but after one incident of clumped litter all over her rear half, we switched to pine pellets. This solved the clumping problem, but now she is tracking her waste all over the room. \n\nWe are trying to find a middle ground here. Does anyone think non-clumping clay litter would work in this case? Any other suggestions? Anything is appreciated You are definitely going to want to get a litterbox that is enclosed. Like a two piece one that has a little hole that your cat can crawl in and out of something like (\nI initially had an open litterbox when I first rescued my wobbler. That did not last long as she would get cat litter and poop absolutely everywhere around the litterbox A.K.A the carpet.\n\nAs for litter it really depends on the severity of the cats condition. Mine is pretty moderate she has noticeable intention tremors. Her head Bob's with almost every motion, and she cant run or jump at all. I personally use that fresh step crystal cat litter it comes in like a blue plastic sack. I think that litter is pretty good in regards to tracking and dust as I usually dont find any litter outside of the box. Be careful about what kind of box you get btw in regards to how high the entrance is. You may need to make or buy some kind of ramp so your cat can access it. I hope I was able to be of some help. Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions and best of luck to you and your kitty cat. Thank you! We are going to look for a litter box like that (with a lower entrance, most likely) or make one ourselves. Do you have any thoughts on a narrow box with high walls? I was thinking that if there was not enough room for her to fall to the side, instead being propped up by the high walls, it would help with rolling in the waste. \n\nHer condition is moderate, she can stand still enough to eat and drink from her bowls, but she has trouble standing in the box (probably due to not having high walls). I was thinking about switching to non-clumping clay litter because the pine pellets do not allow her to really cover the solid waste, but it would not clump to her if it is wet and she sits in it. Any thoughts on that? Thanks again. We are using Okocat clumping litter(Your pet will love this Okocat Original Premium Wood Clumping Cat Litter, 13.2-lb box: ) - it does not stick to her fur and she does not track it everywhere. We had the same issue as you with clay based litters and have gone through a lot of different litter box set ups until recently (our CH cat is now 2)\n\nAlso bought this litter box(Your pet will love this Good Pet Stuff Hidden Cat Litter Planter: ) fairly recently and it is really great for CH cats - really roomy and it being covered helps too Thank you! It seems both of you are having success with that type of box, so I will definitely get one. \n\nDoes that litter allow for the solid waste to be covered up? The problem we are having with the pellets is that they do not bury solids well, even though she is doing her best to cover it with the pellets. Thank you!

Sounds similar our CH cat - moderate, will eat/drink standing but always lays down in the litter box. The entrance does look high on this one from the photos but she seems to get out of it pretty gracefully. I think you would be ok with a narrow one - had Breeze prior, which worked well (and that is quite narrow).\n\nOurs has actually never been able to cover her solid waste but our non CH cat sometimes does it for her if he is feeling nice - so yeah can be done with this litter no problems\n\nGood luck!!

My floppy boy uses it just fine.\n\nI have experimented with a few kinds of litter, and while we both like pine pellets the best, you might also try grass seed, walnut shell, or wheat litters. I have two non CH cats but one is notorious for having poopy paws  and also tracking litter everywhere but that has been nearly 100% fixed after switching to Fresh Step Clean Paws. They have a few varieties of Clean Paws including an unscented version. Hope that helps. Thanks, I will look into it! Thank you, I will check out those alternatives!", "Noodles to the rescue! ", "My cats not using her litterbox Yeah title. I have tried getting her a different one without a lid. She still will not use it. She used to use this letterbox that was covered and had a little doggy door. But I noticed that one day when I went to clean it. It was spotless and the area behind and around it were covered in cat urine. I got her a new one without a door and lid, its just open, and she still will not use it. What can I do? Is the entrance low enough? She might be having trouble getting in. Otherwise, cats start going outside the box for a lot of reasons, from UTIs to just being stressed out. Nothing wrong with a vet check just to confirm she is not sick. Were there any other factors that changed recently (New pet, New roommate, different litter, changed box location, cat feeling sick, etc)? Cats will not typically change litterbox behavior unless something is going on to cause it. Sometimes, you have got to just keep trying things to figure out what is not working. Could be the location of the box or the type of litter. My CHer will only use a clean box (because he falls to the side). You should use an enzymatic foaming cleanser on the area nearby and possibly get more boxes and a few different types of litter for the kitty to try. I am dealing with similar issue but I think it is because they are kittens and other cats used to live here.

He used to be very amicable, loved other people, and was curious/playful about other cats. Rather abruptly, he became downright hostile to anyone or anything that is not me. He will not retreat either. He will just attack. He attacks everyone, and growls and hisses. I had a roommate give him treats every day for a year and he would still attack her and was never comfortable with her.  I started fostering some kittens in the hopes that he would warm up to one of them. Even when I keep them separated, he gets very agitated. He will figure out where they are so he can attack them. Like if I have the fosters in the bathroom and I go to the bathroom he will run in to attack the kittens. He does not really like to play. \n\nIt is already an issue because I love him and I want him to have a happy life. It is compounded by his cerebellar hypoplasia because when he goes to attack things he often takes some nasty falls and I am worried he is going to hurt himself. \n\nHe never attacks me. Not even a hiss or scratch. He is always affectionate towards me.\n\nHe is been to the vet and they said everything\u2019s fine. I do not have enough money to pursue another opinion.

I am unsure. \n\nI have started him on CBD oil and it has honestly helped with his anxiety.

He is neutered. It is so strange that they are so particular. Mine is named widget :). But widget used to be very social very easygoing. I will try cbd .

The vet said his tooth is not chipped enough to cause pain and that the rest of him looks fine, but I cannot think of any other explanation for his behavior. Makes me sad :( I would maybe get a second opinion! A chipped tooth can very well cause pain. I feel like some vets do not really understand wobblers that well. \n\nDoes he have all his claws?

I have a one year old CH kitten who I love immensely despite constantly needing to hold her up while she is in the litter box. But she is very skinny and I am struggling to get her to gain weight. I feel like if she had more muscle strength it may help offset her wobbles, because right now she falls over constantly and really struggles to get back up. She has a healthy appetite and loves the wet food we give her, but i just cannot get her to put on any weight, and seeing her constantly stuck trying to get her feet back under her breaks my heart. Any advice?? My kitty does not have serious CH so he is able to get back up and use a box fine. But I have noticed he seems pretty skinny too compared  to my non ch cat. My non ch cat is kind of chubby but she does not play as much as my ch kitty does. Um wondering if the way they hold themselves causes their muscles and bones to grow differently resulting in a different body shape than we expect. Your kitty should be lean, so somewhat muscular but with no ribs or hip bones visible or easily felt. I think that might change with the way our cats hold themselves. My first thought is you could try physical therapy? But the best way would probably be using water for them to walk in but I mean,  we are  talking about cats here so idk how well that would work. You should also ask your vet to check for parasites if it seems like she is eating well but not gaining weight. Mine (female, about a year, nearly severe) was pretty skinny, but we got her up to a healthy (according to vet) weight by feeding her a can and a half of the big cans of Hills science diet per day. It seems like a lot, but CH cats probably use so much more energy moving around, they need the extra food. I do not know about muscle, but mine has gotten pretty strong just by playing chase with the feather toy and by climbing up on her ottoman Thank you I will try that out, really appreciate it!

It seems like a good option so that the urine drains away quickly. Just unsure how those pellets will work with my guy. Wanted some opinions if they are out there. I have used it in the past with one of my non-CH cats. It worked really well keeping the smell down, but I disliked how often I had to change the urine pads. It ended up being a lot more expensive than regular litter. I have since switched to pine pellets and I like it a lot better. We use pine right now but he is a messy boy. Tracks even the low tracking litter and somehow manages to get clumping litter stuck to him daily.", "Any tips/products for messy eaters? My CH kitten (?, seven months) tends to make a mess when she eats, especially with wet food. I use a silicone bowl on a rubber mat, both placed against a wall so she can lean on something. She throws her food with her mouth as she yanks her head back up to chew, which gets it on the wall, the floor behind her, her fur, etc. It is not a huge problem or anything, but I was wondering what advice you all might have. \n\nThanks in advance! Maybe water down the wet food so it is more a soup than pate? That way she laps it up instead of trying to chew it.\n\nEdit: typo Interesting idea, I will see if she likes it. The only problem I see is her knocking her bowls. She typically spills some water throughout the day, so she will probably also spill some soup The ezpz silicon suction bowl has been life changing for us. It sticks on a hard surface and has a flat mat bottom to help reduce messes. Awesome, I will check it out! Maybe put some sort of rubber non slip stuff under the bowl? Definitely do this. Best purchase I have made. They have a pet version too(under a different brand), where the water and food are on one silicon mat. But you can just get 2 separate ezpz bowls. I actually do this for all my cats as they get a lysine supplement for feline herpes and one has bladder crystals.  Just adopted my first CH cat last week.

She can go about her daily functions independently, just with lots of tumbling. The real problem is the litter box. \n\nThrough lots of trial and error, we have settled on an igloo-shaped box (with front door flap removed) and non-clumping clay litter. She relieves herself while lying on her side. We think that the reason she so frequently gets feces on her back paws/legs is because she spends minutes trying to cover it after she drops it, falling all over the place in the process. We wish she would just do her business and wobble out, but she is a cat and cannot understand my pleas. \n\nLately we have been reaching in and taking her out once she is about a minute into her covering ritual, but we are worried that this might scare her into holding it in. It is also imperfect because we can never be sure she is completely finished. \n\nWith all that exposition out of the way, what do you all think of our current tactic, and how could we encourage her to make her trips quicker and easier? Something different that worked for mine is putting soft cloth down in the box rather than litter. Less mess and I wash it like cloth diapers. He only goes #1 in it though and uses a regular box for #2 which your baby might not be able to do. I have had similar issues and have just accepted the  fact that the solution lies in cleaning them. So I use cat wipes for most of the cleaning stuff but on the more severe poop messes I use warm water and dawn dish soap. Now fair warning cats hate bath but luckily due to how hard it is for our kind of cats to move it is not too much of a hassle.  With my ch kitty who is also severe I found that worlds best kitty litter is the best .  It absorbs it super fast, and clumps but does not stick to him. It is also very lightweight so when he attempts to bury his business ( which just consists of him hitting scratching the side of the little box) it naturally covers it up some. I also have had to find the sweet spot in amount of kitty litter. With more than normal litter to assist in his poor attempts.    Natures miracle makes the best wipes too for easy clean up.   And sadly. Just staying on top of cleaning.    I found that he only likes one of the 5 boxes we have and it is a tall bottomed corner litter box , so I just clean that one 2-3 times a day.    \nGood luck ! Yeah we have been using damp paper towels for spot cleaning, but my girlfriend will get in the bath with her when she (the cat) really needs one Thanks, I will check out that litter! I do not have any magical solution unfortunately. My moderate CH senior had to lay down on potty pads to do his business by the end. But World's best and Dr elsey's litter have been my favorites for most cats and both clump and cover well. \n\nYou mentioned that you are worried about her holding her waste in if you keep having to pull her from the box. Is she toy or food motivated? Maybe if you distract her and try to lure her out of the box area with something positive it would be more of a redirection?\n\nThis might sound silly but you could try making your own litterbox? I have do not it by taking a large plastic storage container, and cutting down part of one of the sides (pad the cut edges too). Maybe she would be more inclined to lean on a flat wall than a curved one, and maybe she will not need to cover her poop as much when the smells are not trapped inside? Also then if you do have to pick her up out of the litter box, it would not be as sudden since it is got and open top. All great ideas! I was thinking of making my own box, something with high, flat walls that are narrow enough that she cannot fall over sideways. It would have entrances at both ends so she can enter/leave through different ends and not have to turn around. Any ideas for that kind of construction? All great ideas!

I have had a similar problem with my cat in the past as well. She would dig and dig for too long after doing her business, I ended up with the theory that because she was in an enclosed litter box the smell was lingering even though the poo was buried the smell was still there so she was continuing to attempt to hide the smell. Removing the cover of the litter box mostly solved the problem although she still likes to kick a lot of litter out of the box. She doesnt stay in there after she finishes burying her business except sometimes she digs near the business and does not bury it well so its not a complete solution but still a massive improvement.

If you uncover the litter box the smell will dissipate faster after she has completed her business and her instinctual urge to dig will be satisfied more naturally and quickly as soon as the scent of her poo or pee is covered. The enclosed box traps the smell even after they have completely buried their waste and their instinctual urge to cover their smell is more slowly satisfied. Keeping it clean is also helpful, but I would bet you are already on top of that if you are here on reddit asking for advice.

This would be easiest to draw but imagine were looking at a storage bin and we label the sides a-d starting at the top and  going clockwise. I was thinking you could cut a hole on side b, and side c (but near the corner of c and d). Or cut the shortest sides off completely if it is sturdy enough. Not sure if you would be able to find a narrow enough bin though. Sorry I do not have any better idea of how to do that, but great idea about 2 points of entry though!  We have been contemplating something that sounds like that, but we also run into the problem of finding one narrow enough. Maybe the could attach something solid on the long inner sides to narrow it further Yeah that is probably the best thing you could really do in terms of keeping kitty clean. It does not really fix the problem of like cat getting poop on the floor, but I also have a kind of solution. So idk how much you watch your cat use the bathroom, but I have this pretty big rubber matt under my cats litterbox. So what I do whenever Death Lord, my cat, uses it as soon as she comes out onto the rubber matt I lift her up to inspect for poop, I am the poop inspector. If she is clean I do not deploy the wipes if she is had a particularly wicked poop I can then get her to either the sink or wipes since I am already holding her. Now idk if the job of poop inspector sounds like the solution for you but fair warning, you might accidently get poop on yourself, and yes I have accidently gotten poop on myself. Also I just want to say that its super mega cute that your gf bathes with your cat that is wholesome as fuck. I would not recommend interrupting kitty's litter box habits. My CHer suffers from chronic idiopathic FLUTD, and letting him be totally comfortable in the box is vital.  I would focus more on a litter system that will help her stay clean while allowing her to do her thing.\n\nI have seen people recommend putting something in the middle of the box that they can lean on, so she can stand while doing her business.

I do not know how to post a picture in the comments either but I would love to see them\ud83d\ude0a The litter box can be a tricky place for the CH cats, I am glad you have found something that works for them. One important thing I have learned is to make sure I am not using a clay based litter, many of the clumping litters are. If they lay down to go, or fall on their face, they can accidentally swallow some. The clay cannot be digested and turns into a dangerous clay ball in their stomachs. I had never thought about anything like that, there are so many things I did not think about at first. Lol I learn new things all the time about these amazing babies\ud83d\udc96 I was able to find a link that includes the option that we went for: \n\nOurs is the one (I believe that it is the second one shown) where you buy a LARGE Rubbermaid storage container and took a rotating saw to one side. We quickly ended up modifying to add a bigger lip to the entrance as Oopsie would lay down inside and her pee would spray out the side because the lip was so low. I took a thick cardboard section that I measured and cut to add just a little more height at the bottom without compromising a low edge for them to climb in. After cutting it, I wrapped it several times in duck tape to make it waterproof and then used more duck tape strips to tape I from the inside. Nice! I might end up doing that for the kittens when they are full grown. Right now they use the one shown in the link that is a triangle box, it is sides are high enough for them to lean on, for now at least. Lol. The little girl is more severe, but she is so careful she never gets messy, her brother, Ollie, spends so much time trying to dig on the sides to cover it that sometimes he falls on it. Lol\n\nFredo, my very severe boy, uses a regular litter box because I have to take him to it and lay him in it anyway. I am just happy he is learned to go when I put him in the box!!!\n\nAlso, with the kittens in the triangle box, I rolled up a towel in front of it to help Basil get in.

I assumed it was because I didnt clean it (low key depression is ruining how good a mom i am) but my other non CH cat will still go in the box regardless. I had literally just fineshed cleaning one of the boxes out and P'yan comes to pee in it and then right after he goes into a spot I noticed he had pooped earlier today and poops again. On the floor. Even though the box was relativly clean (cant switch out litter because covid). His poo is also strange to me.. Its almost slimey and lighter in color than I asume it should be. Its definitely a red flag poop to me but idk when we will be able to see a vet with all these quarenteens... I would check with your vet (maybe a phone call?) about the consistency question, but I have a possible answer about pooping outside the box.  My CH kitty sometimes falls over when she is trying to use the box.  I have even seen her fall out of the box.  Because of this we often see her poops just outside the box (basically wherever she has landed when she tips over). Im asking my bf if we can make a vet visit but we dont even have a vet anymore and are trying to find an affordable one. But that is definitely the 1st thing I thought to do so its the plan. Was just hoping for insight. I am not sure if its problems using the box, since he normally uses it just fine but he does tip over a lot. Im using boxes as make shift hoods for the boxes so he has something to lean on (and because cats are stinky lol). He goes out of his way to poop in a corner \ud83d\ude14 This could be a sign that he is not feeling well, sometimes cats will avoid the box if it hurts when they go and look for a less painful spot. Mine did this before being diagnosed with bladder crystals and it complete resolved once he felt better.  Definitely worth a call to a vet.

He has severe CH or a similar congenital mobility disorder; the vet was not sure. His back legs are barely functional. He can get around, but he falls over a lot, and it takes him a while to get from A to B. The nice thing is that because he cannot move fast, he cannot bonk his head and run into it things at high speed like some CH cats. \n\nAlthough I had a mild CHer for years, this is obviously a whole new ball game. So I will be happy to tap into your vast expertise on how to care for a severe CH kitty. \n\nMy primary concern, of course, is the litter box. They told me I may have to use potty pads unless I can get some kind of very flat, wide litter box, which I do not have yet. I am trying to avoid the \"diaper solution\" if possible. And of course I want to get him invested in using a litter box \u2014 any kind \u2014 as early as possible. That way, as he gets older and better able to get into the box, he will already have a habit of preferring litter. \n\nAny tips and links you can impart would be greatly appreciated. \ud83d\ude3b I am committed to doing whatever it takes, but obviously, I would prefer not to destroy my carpet in the process!

I found a litter box on chewy, but it was a couple years ago. It has a low and slanted entrance, it also has extra high sides. It helps my severe girl because she can get in by herself and lean on the side to stand up while she goes. \n\nMy VERY severe boy cannot get around at all by himself, he used to just pee wherever he was. I do not want a pee smelling house. Lol. I got him used to peeing in the box by laying him in there, on his side, any time I thought he might need to go. \n\nIt took a while, I would play games on my phone and stuff waiting for him to pee, and I would pick him up and give him treats as soon as he did go. Eventually he learned to pee in there and knows that is what it is for. He gets so excited with himself and it is adorable.\n\nDepending on your kittens abilities, maybe something like that would work? I do not know how to ad a picture or video in the comments, but my cats have an Instagram page and I had put a video of how he uses the litter box on there.

My little girl is only 6 1/2 months old, by the time she is full grown she might need extra high sides like that. I will definitely keep in mind what you made! \nI adopted her brother with her, he is moderate so he walks around well in his cute wobbly way. Unfortunately he is also the one who makes the most mess with the litter box, he spends so much time in there trying to (unsuccessfully) bury his mess, that he ends up falling in it. My boy also sometimes falls in his, too. But I am just ecstatic that he uses it at all and I do not have to put diapers on him. Exactly!!! That is a very good thing! Much easier to clean up where they fell in some poo, than keeping diapers on them! You can also get a 'jumbo' Nature's Miracle disposable litter box and cut an entryway in the side with a box cutter, leaving only about a 1/2 inch lip. They do sometimes kick litter out and track it, but it makes it very easy to get in and out.

A heavy food dish will help your cat not push it around as much. Get a feather toy or something else that you can pull around, chasing the toy will help them learn and get stronger.

My wobbly girl is able to lean against the high sides to keep her balance when she goes to the bathroom this is the answer I have got a tiny ch babe right now and the best thing we have used so far is a cardboard box cut to about 5\u201d tall, with a 7ish inch long cutout that goes only as high as the litter is deep. So that is her entry, and it is about 1.5\u201d tall. We will probably go the storage tub route when she gets bigger. I put a step stool in front of a storage bin for the CH cat to get into, since I have 3 normal cats that usually could just hop right in", "Litter box help Seeking help with litter box usage.\n\nI have had my kitty Alice for a few months now and there is been some medical issues to address which are now all seemingly taken care of. The problem is she still will not use the litter box. She did have a UTI (and I am honestly not sure how long, the woman I rescued her from had 0 money for medical care and she had no medical history prior to the year this woman had her) but that is all cleared up, as are the ear infection and teeth issues. As far as the vet can tell there is no medical reason for it. Her CH is not a super severe case. She almost walks as if she had socks on her back feet. Just a really wide legged stance.\n\nI have a litter robot for my other two cats but I also kept a wide, lower sided litter box that I know she can get into. But she does not even try. She just goes straight for the carpet. And while of course I am not thrilled either, I can tell my boyfriend is really starting to lose patience with the situation. Understandably so, no one wants their room to smell like cat pee all the time. And I have a poor sense of smell so half the time I do not even know she is done it or if I have cleaned it good enough.\n\nAny suggestions for getting a wobbly kitty to use her litter box instead of the carpet? Better litter suggestions? Better box? I will try anything at this point. I am willing to go the diaper route if I have to but for her sake I would rather not. Maybe try a different cat litter. Some are very fussy to the feel/texture of certain types of cat litter on their feet. My cat has the same issue, and I am using a senior cat pan. It is made specifically for senior cats so it has low walls and an entrance lip that is even lower. A box surrounding it so he kicks less litter out and has something to lean on. But  because of his wobble he struggles just to squat and stay balanced (his case is very mild and walks normally, can even use a cat tree almost as good as my normal cat). As soon as he loses balance, he just thinks he cant do it there and goes on the floor. Sometimes if cats have an issue with going, (whether that is physically tripping, or having a medical issue like constipation) they attribute it to the box and wont go. \n\nI placed down puppy pads near the box and whenever he decides to not use the box, he goes straight to the puppy pad. Idk how, but he just knows to always go on the puppy pad if there is one available. Same. Puppy pee pads next to the litter box Helped a ton, even when she did not want to get all the way in the litter box she still walked next to it.\n\nI tried everything \u2014 attractant, lower litter box sides, dif litter. Other thing that helped was physically putting her in the litter box after every meal when she would normally want to go, and try to retrain her to go over there.\n\nGood luck! I had not thought of the puppy pads, that is a great idea thank you! I did just order a senior cat litter box too so hopefully that helps too.\n\nI will definitely be trying both out. I had not even though of puppy pew pads, that is such a good idea. Thanks!\n\nI will also try putting her in after she eats/drinks. Hopefully that helps.", "Revan eating dinner is an extreme sport.  Watching our CH girl eating her wet food is the best part of any day. My kitty eats just like this, too!  Just out of curiosity\u2026 my kitty, I have come to find out, was born without a gallbladder.  Have you heard of any other CH kitty with this condition? I have not! Revan has his first vet checkup tomorrow so I will ask about it. We are also pretty sure he is deaf but I do not think there is any correlation. Our kitty is deaf as well."]
