["Ten years ago this week. Photo was taken just before I was put on a respirator. 97 days later I walked out of the hospital. Permanent nerve damage to my feet changed my life, but I still have one. We never know what we can do till we have to.  Wow, thanks for sharing. My dad had GB three times: 27 years ago, 4 years ago, and 2 months ago. He is still recovering from the last time and we were in ICU for a week. He was not out on a respirator this time but dang it was terrible and scary and painful for him. I have never been so scared in my life..but at the same time we feel so lucky to see the fast recovery. Take care of yourself and so great to hear you are ok! ( Walked out of the hospital after a month in ICU and 5 in rehab. Permanent nerve damage as well, but still alive and kicking. Pull ups / push ups not so much, my arms do not work that well. Blimey - me 20 years ago. Still have the foot problems (foot drop) but small prove to pay. After I found the whole experience a bit like how I would imagine moon walking - a world of weirdness that very few people can truly relate to Thank you for sharing. \n\nThis was me less than a year ago. ICU for 3 and a half weeks. Walked out at 12 weeks. \n\nNerves have not fully recovered on my upper body, but you know what? Does not stop me from returning to climbing! I am back to beginner level, but hey, baby steps. Less than a year and climbing! At any level that is impressive baby steps. That is soo rare, any idea what triggers it in his case? I think just getting a bad cold - it was the case the three times that it happened. I hope this never happens again. I think just getting a bad cold - it was the case the three times that it happened. I hope this never happens again. My dad had it and was almost paralyzed he has really bad foot pain now and says there is no options any pointers? I wish I had some words of encouragement for the foot pain, but I am sorry I do not. It is just a part of me.  I have found that Cobain make a flip flop that has a very thick base and that is the only foot wear that does not make it worse.  Did he try Lyrica, it has helped a lot of people?", "Dad  has been in the ICU 14 days now fighting GBS and some other complications. Anyone that was in the hospital for a long time / had a serious ICU stay want to share their experiences with me? My Dad, who is 71, suddenly got hit with GBS two weeks ago.  He was in Myrtle Beach on vacation with my mom at the time, woke up the first morning they were down there and had no feeling in his feet / lower legs and was very weak, could not walk on his own.  Was in the ER / ICU down there for a few days progressively getting worse despite a few rounds of IVIG treatment (they suspected GBS after a day and started the infusions but were not able to completely confirm the diagnosis despite a spinal tap and lumbar puncture among other tests).  He wasnt getting any better (lost hand and arm movement, and was starting to have breathing problems so he got intubated) and they wanted to move him to a more serious facility so we had him flown back home to Ohio to the Cleveland Clinic. They are a pretty kickass Hospital system and some of the family lives about 15 minutes from the Main Campus in downtown Cleveland so Mom has a close place to stay. \n\n They have been doing plasmapheresis treatments on him, to some better results.  He is able to move his arms and shoulders, hand control is still a bit wonky but he can mostly point to stuff now (has an alphabet board and spells things out to communicate because he is been intubated for the past 11 days). Has very minimal movement in 1 leg, nothing in the other so far but can tell when you are touching both feet so that is atleast something.  They have been doing stretches and some basic PT in his bed with him and he has those leg sleeves on to help with the muscles and cramping as well.  Breathing was getting better but now its started to go downhill again unfortunately.  We were hoping to get him off the intubation but doesnt seem like that will be in the cards just yet.   He is had high blood pressure and is borderline diabetic so managing both of those on top of this has been a challenge for the doctors apparently.  And as if this all was not enough, they have found inflammation and lesions on his spinal cord, and a few on his liver as well so we are awaiting biopsy and PET scan results on those and just hoping for the best right now because we have got enough on our plates with all the rest of this :(     \n\n\nHe was a mailman for 30 years, walking his route every day.  It blows my mind that of all people, he can be the one to suddenly lose the use of his legs like this.  His calves are the size of my thighs!  Hes a typical stubborn Italian gentleman so naturally hes a stubborn terrible patient lol but seeing him completely laid up like this after 2 weeks and still in real trouble is.....I do not really have the words for it.  \n\nSo, any of you survivors or family members that have had any similar experiences with serious hospital stays want to share?  Any tips for us family members who can only watch from the outside? (mom is the only allowed visitor right now, thanks COVID)  Things you wish you had in your room to help cope with the hospital stay?  I have been reading up and know its a very long road to varying degrees of recovery, but it would help to hear some firsthand accounts to know it can, and will, get better, even if it seems insurmountable right now. Just came to say I feel what you are going through. My mom had sudden loss of feeling on her legs at the end of February, and 2 days later she could not even blink her eyes. Luckily IVIG stopped the progression before she needed to be intubated, but 3 weeks after she was admitted, we stopped being able to visit because of Covid. It is been rough, but luckily she is at a skilled nursing facility now that has a window in her room so we can visit her. It is been 7 months and she is still in a wheelchair and has use of only one arm/hand. \n\nThe one thing I would say is that she was in a lot of pain/discomfort at the beginning and it was difficult for her to talk in order to ask for help moving/shifting. Since your dad cannot communicate easily with the intubation, try to make sure they are turning him regularly and managing his pain as best as they can. Also make sure they are giving him a high dose of vitamin B12, that made a BIG difference in my mom's movement returning. \n\nOther than those things, it is really just a crappy time of wait and hope and see. Sending lots of healing thoughts to your family Start looking now for a good rehab/skilled nursing facility. My dad was about the same age as yours when he got GBS.  They would only keep him so long in ICU until he was stable.  Medicare and his supplement only pay for a set number of days and I am sorry I cannot remember how many. But once they were near the limit, the social worker there helped us find a nursing home/rehab that would take him. Because he still had a trach, not all places would accept him.  Do your research and ask your doctors and social workers about the types of care and facilities he will need.  Visit those places if possible. It is a long road to recovery. thanks for the b12 tip, I will pass that along to my mom to make sure hes getting a good dose of that if possible.  as for the pain / discomfort, she has said that the nurses are all doing a very good job of checking in on them and making sure my dads comfortable.  they adjust the tube frequently and swab his mouth as well so that hasnt been too much of an issue, and they have done extra leg exercises for him a few times after he asked them to, so it seems like they have a good group of nurses in there.\n\nthanks for the kind words and thoughts, appreciate it.  hope your mom continues to recover and can get out of the nursing facility eventually (if possible).   how long was she in the hospital for overall, if you dont mind me asking? I was intubated for 21 days. The combination of the opioids they had me on and the nerve pain was UTTER HELL. I managed to have enough arm movement in the last half to spell things out with an alphabet board similar to how your dad is doing now. All I can say is that he really needs you to stay with him because I sure as hell needed my parents back then. Stay strong! He will get through this and come out on top. Hi! A year ago my dad was diagnosed with gbs (65 y/o) The case was similar to your dad, he was nearly a month in ICU and aprox 15 days intubated (he had the trach done, which helped). He was treated with IVIG, two rounds. He then was at a rehab facility for 6 months. Now he can walk by his own, he is still working to regain force and resistance. This is a long way, it takes time and will to recover, so the most important thing is to make sure you are by his side. Family was very important for my dad. He will be ok, it just takes time. Should you need something, talk to someone, dm me. I wish nothing for the best to you and your dad. :) I am so sorry to hear this. My sister in law was in the ICU on ventilator for over 60 days in 2019. Cannot believe it was just a year ago. Now she is walking!! She went from compete paralysis and now walking! It is miraculous. Even when it seems so bad, it can get better! Keep your positivity up and patience. Sending prayers your way. \n\nAlso they kept saying it would get worse before it got better, and that was definitely true a few times! \n\n\u2764\ufe0f It will only get better from here on forward. I am sorry that your father is dealing with this illness.  I was hospitalized for three months.  First week I was intubated and in a medically induced coma.  I flat lined, once stablized I was transported to a large teaching hospital where I was admitted to the neurological ICU.  I flat lined  in the ambulance.  I have no memory of the first week and the second is fuzzy.  I developed GBS after the flu shot.  I got the shot 10/18/19 and my first visit to the ER was 11/3/19.  I was misdiagnosed with muscle spasms between my shoulder blades.  Two days later back to the ER via ambulance.  I got home February this year after a three week stay at a Rehabilitation Center.  I cannot praise that facility enough.  I went from complete paralysis, to a wheel chair, to a walker and now a cane.  I am so much better, I will never be 100% but I am grateful for the progress I have made and continue to make.  Tell him not to give up, there are so many better days ahead.  Best of luck to him and your family.  May blessings hug you tightly. glad to hear you are making so much progress!  keep on kicking butt with your rehab  :) Hello....\n\nThis story sounds exactly what my 72 year old dad went thru (was on vacation with my mom at my sisters place in idaho / went to er being weak and unable to walk/ said he was fine / on the flight back to NY had to have a wheelchair help him) and finally ended up at the cleveland clinic (they are from NYS about 1/2 hr from erie) after being in erie pa / pittsburgh / back to erie and finally cleveland (after looking at johns hopkins as the other alternative).   My dad was a dairy farmer and healthy as a horse and this was the first time he was ever hospitalized.\n\nI will tell you that the people in cleveland were absolutely awesome and after being down and out for almost one year, is back to walking / driving / and is generally fine (still has tingling in his feet) but after we thought he would be a vegetable, we are beyond blessed to where he is today compared to 2 yrs ago.     We are also grateful for whom is his dr in buffalo (with covid its telehealth) now as he has worked with him on the infusions and its one of the best in the eastern us  (we just got off his 6 month appt 10 mins ago).  Between the 2 they saved him\n\nHe would be more than happy to speak to you or your dad about his experiences and tell you what worked for him and did not and also what my sister and i did along the way (as she is in idaho and i am in georgia) to get him to the point he is at now.  This happened right before covid so our family is ready to write off the past 2-3 years  If you have an interest, my email is  and name is tim.   Sounds like your dads personality is alot like mine.\n\nBest of luck to you... Thank you so much.  I started driving again two weeks ago.  I felt like a teenager with a learners permit.  \ud83d\ude0a Sorry to hear about your Dad. I have GBS and still recovering- gone from complete loss of using arms and legs to walker/wheel chair since dec 2018. Important thing is to continue making progress- it is slower for us older folks, I am 63. Make sure he has a phone that lets him FaceTime with loved ones. Warm compresses sometimes helped with nerve pain in arms/hands. Get small bag weights to help strengthen hands/arms and rubber strips for physical therapy. Sit up ASAP to strengthen core muscles. Get a good rehab facility for physical and occupational (putting on clothes &amp; other necessities) therapy. Think positive and keep working!", "Good doctor in Florida? My mother has recently been diagnosed with CIDP. Can anyone recommend a good neurologist in Central Florida or Florida in general? Her current doctor does not seem up to the task and the staff lied about getting paperwork done causing a 4 month delay in starting IVIg. She is also been referred to another neurologist to deal with another symptom even though it is related to the CIDP. Would a doctor with experience with CIDP be able to handle everything? I am sorry to hear your mother is going through this.  \n\n\nI would recommend you reach out to the great people at ( I second that you should reach out to the gbs/CIDP foundation. They can refer you to a center of excellence nearby. Best of luck to your mother- I also have CIDP and ivig has not helped me sadly. I hope you have better results! Thanks, I will do that! Sorry you did not have any luck with ivig. We are worried the same will happen with her though everyone is saying to give it 4-6 months. Did you find anything that helped you? I had it 14 months ago, 99% recovered so far. I was admitted at University of Miami hospital. Excellent treatment.\n\nNow I am following up with Dr Reznick, in Mount Sinai Miami. So far so good.", "Anyone else affected by the IVIG shortage? I am at a loss for words. After a grueling 8 months of experimentation (spending two of those eight months in a wheelchair), we have finally figured out what works best for me. I have rapidly progressive motor CIDP, and rituximab infusions+IVIG every three weeks works for me. I have finally been feeling normal again and hitting the gym 5-6 days a week. Now there is an IVIG shortage, and my hospital is restricting it for those whose life actually depends on it. Totally fine with that, and I understand, yet it is just devastating when the drug that keeps you walking is denied. They are swapping IVIG with IV steroids, but those never worked for me in the past. Just wondering how many of you are affected, and if anyone wants to talk about it? Ive been affected by it, but I had no idea it was getting this bad. Three months ago my home infusion company could not get my particular type of IVIG (I get it every 4 weeks) and had to give me whatever they could find instead. I can really feel a difference in my strength level on the new stuff.\n\nI asked my neuro and she said she is not sure when the shortage will end. But I feel like I have been hearing about IVIG shortages since I started this 20 years ago. So I am really not hopeful. \n\nI am actually a little scared :/\n\nCan I ask where you live? Do you do inpatient treatments at your hospital or outpatient? FWIW (surely will not work for everyone) a severe elimination diet worked for me. I cut:\n\nGarlic\nDairy (milk products - eggs &amp; oddly yogurt ok)\nNightshades\nChocolate \nCoffee (well, mostly)\nAdded sugar (fruit ok)\n\nWith this draconian regimen I was able to forgo IVIG and halt CIDP progression. If you are dealing with an IVIG shortage, an elimination diet might be worth trying. Oh and I cannot have alcohol - it provokes an instant wave of numbness and parasthesia. So sorry to hear that :/ Did they end up having to give you a lower dose, or a different brand? And yeah, my hospital is currently holding it for three illnesses that need it to live. Not sure which ones. I heard about the shortage back in May, but it was not as serious as it is now. I am in Rhode Island right now. I usually end up having to be admitted to get the infusions since we always run into problems with insurance. Technically supposed to be outpatient, but with an admittance. We have been working on setting up an infusion center, but we were just notified of the shortage. I am scared as well. Roughly three months ago I could not stand for more than five seconds, and was told it would not get better than that. But the rituximab started kicking in, and in turn made IVIG work better. Now I am working out and living normally. Sliding back towards that state of weakness has been incredibly unnerving. Hoping the steroids work since my immune system is more suppressed than the last time we tried them. The only thing I have been doing is trying to remain optimistic and encouraging everyone I can to donate plasma. From what I have read, plasma donations are doing just fine, the growing demand of IVIG is the problem. Neurologist told me maybe 30 days of the shortage, but he does like to sugarcoat a lot of things. Okay so I am not sure how reputable this source is, but I found a news article that states  this: \"Officials say the shortage could last until the end of July\" about the shortage. Full article linked below. That makes me hopeful that the shortage is a very temporary thing and we can expect a return to normal pretty soon. \n\nStill sucks to suddenly lose progress and all that :/ but at least we are not talking a year or anything.\n\n I really hope that is the case. My dad just spoke to the CIDP/GBS foundation and they actually provided some good advice. They said to ask for different brands, lower doses, possibly even subcutaneous IVIG. Apparently hospitals have to follow the guidelines to preserve all IVIG for life threatening diseases, but some infusion centers will have it available if they do not have patients whose lives are at risk. When I stayed at Hasbros children\u2019s hospital for three months, I met this amazing doctor who actually has an autoimmune condition and requires monthly subcutaneous IVIG. She gave the best advice, and I am going to call her and see how it is affecting her, and if she knows anything. Actually yep. I have CVID. Those of us with Primary Immunodeficiencies (PI) cannot produce IgG. So our blood lacks the needed proteins to fight off infections. \nFor me, IVIG is lifesaving. Without it, I get infections so bad they could quite literally kill me. Constant bronchitis, sinusitis, and kidney infections (I really, really wish I was being over dramatic). \nThink boy in the plastic bubble. That is me. \nWithout the IViG I cannot even go to the grocery store. I cannot go out in public, and I am confined to my house. \nThat does not work when you have a full-time job and are only 23 years old. That is not a life. \nSo yes, for some of us, IVIG is truly life saving. Hence why hospitals are trying to \u201ctriage\u201d the medicine for people like me who will quite literally die without it. \nFor autoimmune based diseases, there are other (albeit less effective) treatments. So while people may get ill, and sadly miserable, it will not technically put their life at immediate risk to not get it. \nNow that is not saying you will not be horribly, terribly miserable, rather that other people will legitimately die without the treatment since PI patients cannot manufacture the IgG themselves and there is NO OTHER TREATMENTS. \nNothing. \nNo steroids, no Biologics, nada. \nAnd antibiotics only help you fight off an infection if you have a functioning immune system. (Side note: they also suppress the immune system too) \n\nI really wish suppliers and pharmacies had not let it get to this point. Demand outstripped supply and sadly some people are using IVIG off-label for diseases that are not meant to be primarily treated by IVIG. It is more of a bandaid rather than a fix for some off-label uses (like treating mild-moderate autoimmune diseases). \nNot to mention, PI patients (like myself) usually only require doses like 40g every 2-3 weeks at the most. Whereas autoimmune patients sometimes need as much as 80g every 2 weeks!! That is a big difference, especially when you consider that one dose of IVIG requires A TON of donors!! Add to that, that IVIG takes months to properly manufacture and is prone to recalls due to contamination. \nPlease do not take anything I have said to say that you are not worthy of the medicine. Heck I wish everyone who needs it could get it! But given that supply cannot meet demand, it has to be triaged for only the most dire cases. Cases where people will not make it to live until the next supply boost. \nAt this moment in time, pharmaceutical companies like Takeda (makes gammagard) are saying the shortage of available IVIG will likely last until the END of 2019. :( \n\nI wish you all luck and I hope you start to feel even a teeny bit better soon!! \ud83d\udc9c", "Progressing Numbness and Altered Perception I am a \\~35 year old male of European decent who contracted Covid within the last two weeks. I am in overall good health with no known long term medical conditions. Today I began feeling numbness and aching in my hands that has since spread to upper arms. I am also feeling as though I have an altered conciseness. Specifically, I feel detached from my body and unable to hold a clear line of thought. This is not to the point of confusion, but is out of the norm. As an example, I have been reading about Gullian Barre Syndrome for over an hour and had difficulty remembering the name to type this sentence. Given these conditions, I think there is a potential that I have Gullian Barre Syndrome. Can any other members provide opinion from education or experience that relates my symptoms and this disease? Alternatively are there any other possible diseases that come to mind? I am likely going to the hospital very shortly.", "/guillainbarre Subdirect Statistics ", "Food allergies after Guillain Barre? Hello everyone! I had guillain-barre in 2007 and I was paralyzed for about 2 months, I was 11/12 at the time. Throughout the years I have developed Celiac Disease, lactose intolerance, and an egg allergy. I know that having food allergies has to do with the immune system but I do not know everything behind it. Is it possible that guillain-barre could have caused me to develop food allergies? I also have hypothyroidism as well. Does anyone else struggle with these? I do not - but GBS is an autoimmune disease and they tend to cluster. So the GBS did not cause the food allergies, but the GBS, food allergies, hypothyroid all arose from the autoimmune vulnerability you have. That makes sense, Thank you! After having gbs Miller Fisher variant I have developed a food sensitivity to corn, gluten, and fructose. My environmental allergies have gotten worse as well. I do not tolerate sugar anymore. 5 years GBS now. Seems more likely that you had several undiagnosed autoimmune conditions which set you up to also get G-B. That is how I ended up with CIDP: ulcerative colitis, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, and an H1N1 flu shot. I ended up with terrible allergies to food, beverages and  even the advil family. I found having my copper IUD in made those allergies quite a bit worse for some reason but 6 months after IVIG treatment, I started feeling terrible again. Run down, itchy and overall just plain awful feeling. At one point at one point I ended up in emergency as my lips and skin would not stop swelling and burning. I had a internal doctor go over me with a fine tooth comb but nothing came up. My family doctor and I suspect that IUD to be an issue and ever since taking it out I have not had the same issues however I am Permanently allergic to anything that has ibuprofen in it.  I was having issues daily with a wide variety of foods and prior to GBS treatment I had not a single one.", "Does guillian barre cause or make anxiety or depression worse? Does guillian barre make anxiety or depression worse? This is probably something you should ask your doctor about if you are facing it.\n\nFrom personal experience, I received counseling while hospitalized, and went to a counselor specializing in traumatic medical events once I was discharged. It, for me, absolutely made my anxiety worse. It has for me. I think that is less about GBS being the direct cause, and more about how it has affected my life. I also have PTSD from my long hospital stay, so that does not help. \n\nIt is really awful disease and definitely takes a toll on one\u2019s psyche. Only indirectly. An anxiety and depression can result from human needs not being met (as a result of illness). I realized that it did for me, at least temporarily, and that was primarily because I could not do things I was doing before, like go on long hikes. The lingering pain/fatigue, however mild, can actually change your lifestyle in a significant way, and that takes a toll over time. One of the hardest things for me was trying to be an engaged parent at a time when I was easily exhausted from just commuting to/from work by bus. It did not for me. Weirdly it ended my depression and anxiety - both of which were becoming unmanageable prior to the onset of GBS. My daughter\u2019s GBS and later CIDP diagnoses has been the major source of her depression.  I believe it is the circumstances of dealing with a chronic disease more than a chemical imbalance caused by the disease.  However she is in therapy and on antidepressants and both have been hugely successful in helping her cope Yes it made it worse. I think the biggest reason was being in ICU for two months and could not see my kids Just the treatment itself can cause trauma - it is been 30 years since I went through mine and I have only just realized my fear of being unable to breathe (being under blanket covers, etc) relates to my GBS treatment. Beyond that, it is a very stressful situation, especially with medical bills and missed work.

Also, not knowing if a certain place is fully accessible makes me a little on edge.", "Any other Australians? So I was diagnosed in late May 2019 at the age of 16. I went for a regular eye test after experiencing double vision for a week. My optometrist was not happy with what he saw and refferd me to an opthamologist the next day(which is an insanely short time, causing my mum to panic)\n\nFor the last couple weeks before that I had been very weak, and had a few falls where my body locked up.( Even spilt hot tea on myself once) But anyhow, the opthamologist was extremely concerned with my symptoms and was not letting us go till there was a hospital bed waiting for us. When I was admitted for the first time I could stand, bend my knees a bit, and still move my arms. During the night they put a heart-rate moniter on me, at one point I sat up and it shot up to 170bpm. Within a day I could bearly move, unfortunately they did not update my chart and ended up discharging me saying It was just stress. There where quite a few bad practices during that adminision,such as forgotten medication and the like, but I digress.\n\nA week later I could not move, my GP saw me and said that I had GBS and needed a lumbar puncture to confirm it, We had to get an ambulance to the nearest hospital. The doctor who eventually proformed the procedure told us that it was unnecessary and even said \"do you know how much it costs us?\" She was really good despite that. I was transferred to a larger hospital during the night with GBS, and started IVIG. During all this I was pretty much completely alone, my mum has to care for my family and I was in a separate room. For the first two weeks I just continued to get worse even with the treatment, but ended up in a rehab ward. Eventually I was diagnosed with Miller fishers variant, increased intracranial pressure and FND\n\nRehab was quite odd, I had more treatment there then in acute, another course of IVIG started to help as well as multiple therapeutic lumber punctures, one of which hit a nerve causing chronic pain.\n\nAt the time I entered rehab I could not move at all, not being able to roll over was probably the worst, nurses got pissed at me for always pushing the call bell despite my inability to do anything myself. During rehab I ended up losing over 25kg(55lbs) I Started at 64kg(141lbs) and 174cm tall but 39 kg at my lowest with a bmi of around 13. I was bearly alive at that point, and had a NGT put in so I could be pumped with food. I was constantly vomiting because of the NGT, and stoped eating entirely because it was so uncomfortable. \n\nAfter three months I was given an ultimatum by the ward coordinator, get your weight up to 48kg so you can go home or be put in a care home. She gave me this because I was making 0 progress and others needed my spot, I still do not think that was right but I did not have much choice.I worked until I could assist with transferring my body from place to place(pivoting was all I could do) When I heard that I may be able to go home I was elated, and became determined to do so.\n\nAfter four months I was discharged without a NGT.( Either they could take it out or I was going to rip it out)(Please do not threaten your healthcare professionals like I did) I had a diation who agreed to take it out, do out patient care as well as Ot/physio.\n\nNow seven weeks later I am able to walk, cook, and do nearly everything the same as before. My age defiantly helped with recovery and catching it so early did as well. I am now 51kg(112lbs) and am getting closer to my original physique and power. Though I do have seizures now, I was always angry and emotional during my admission but I am starting to come to terms with the lasting effects. \n At the minute I am staying at home, and plan to continue school next year.\n\nMost of the time doctors and nurses have your best interest, and I hope yours are kinder then most of mine. I have never heard of a worse case of gbs. I am so sorry you had to go through that. Like you I was discharged the first time I went to the Er. I could barely walk, could not get up from the couch, and could not walk or even crawl up the stairs. \nThen a day or two after I was discharged I was home alone. I was stuck on the couch and I had to rock back and forth to get the momentum I needed to get up. \n\nI started \u201cwalking \u201c I put quotes because I was barely walking. Then I fell and could not crawl or pull myself up. My mom threatened to sue the hospital if they discharged me again. \n\nThey suspected I had gbs but they needed to do a spinal tap and an EMG, and something else I cannot remember. That first night was terrifying. I could not roll over and my feet started going numb. I could barely walk, and my right side was getting so weak I could not hold my arm up. They put me on ivig the next day and I could feel it working right away. I had to do physical therapy in the hospital but even when I got home I could not walk up the stairs.  I could not sleep in my bed because it was so high up. \n\nIt took awhile for me to get back to normal. I got gbs because I had a severe respiratory virus and did not go to the doctor. It sounds like you had an intestinal virus which can cause a worse form of gbs. I am glad you are doing so much better and if you ever want to talk just pm me.\nBtw I am from Chicago, Illinois. Jeez that is rough, I am glad you are getting back to normal. American hospitals seem to know a bit more about GBS then over here, I guess they see it more often. Thank you and I hope that you are doing much better as well. Gbs was the scariest thing I have ever experienced. It took awhile for my right side to get as strong as my left side. I feel lucky I did not get sicker. It is really rare. I am sorry that you developed seizures from it. And that the ivig did not work right away. I could not get out of bed without help from a nurse and then when they put me on ivig I was able to sort of pull myself up but I still needed a nurse to help me to the bathroom. I was discharged after about a week and then I had to use a walker for awhile. At the time it happened I was going to a methadone clinic and everyone was staring at me but no one except the nurse asked what was wrong. I think that is really rude that the other patients just stared. I had to call an ambulance to help get me up my stairs into the house a few times. I cannot believe both of us got sent home the first time we went to the hospital. I am in Sydney and was diagnosed with CIDP 2 years ago.  Wish you all the best and hope things continue to improve for you. Thank you, I do hope you are going good as well.", "Graduate student seeking to learn from person with GBS and his/her experience with assistive technology I am an occupational therapy student and currently enrolled in an assistive technology class.

Thank you in advance!  PM me if you like.", "I hate to sound like a worry wart... Male/50.\n\nVaccinated end of July.  Not sure when, maybe 2-3 months ago, started to feel like my bed was vibrating.  Felt like someone was running a washing machine next door in my condo.\n\n2-3 weeks ago, woke up with a pulsing sensation in my neck that scared me.  Thought it was arrhythmia.  Saw a cardiologist, said my heart was fine, BP a little high but nothing scary.\n\n10 days ago, realized it was my right calf vibrating.  I do not know if I should call it tingling, tremors or just...vibrating.  Been getting worse since then, waking me up 4-5 times a night with the neck pulsing.  Weird thing is, neck pulsing goes away within seconds of standing up.\n\nNo other symptoms that I know of.  No pain.  No weakness (I think).  Saw a neurologist and she ran some physical tests in the office and said my symptoms were \"weird\".  She noted my hands tremble a little bit when held out straight but I think I have had a little of that as long as I could remember, figured it was just caffeine.  Gave me pregabalin and sent me home.\n\nI would be happy to give other details but do not want to make a giant wall of text no-one will read :)\n\nAny thoughts?  No idea what is going on.  Parkinsons, GBS, CIDP, nerve impingement (I have had two pinched nerves in my neck before but they resulted in standard arm and neck pain for a few weeks). It does not sound like GBS to me. In my personal experience, once the tingling started, it did not go away, it only got worse and it went *fast*. I went from \u201cmy thumb feels weird\u201d to a ventilator in a week or less, so the fact that your first onset of symptoms was 2+ months ago suggests to me that it is not GBS. \n\nThe other difference to me is the way you describe the sensation you are having in your leg. To me, the feeling was similar to the \u201cpins and needles\u201d you get when your limbs fall asleep. More accurately, I grew up in an area where we got a lot of snow in the winter, and it felt like I would been making snowballs with no mittens on and then ran my hands under warm water. Within a few days, I went from feeling that sensation in the thumb on my right hand to my entire body.\n\nDid your doctor talk about restless leg syndrome at all? Thank you for replying and sharing.\n\nDoctor did not talk about RLS.  I have occasionally, before this had an urge to kick but it would go away the next day.  With this, I do not really feel an urge to kick.\n\nIt is not really like a strong pins and needles thing.  I mean, maybe the very last vestiges of it where it is just tingling.\n\nI do not know whether to describe it as tingling or vibrating.  The neck thing is definitely a pulsing, to where I thought it was a blood pressure issue of some kind.  Not sure if it is related but similar timing.\n\nAny thoughts on other things to investigate? I am afraid not. I have zero medical background, I only know what I know about GBS because I had it. The restless leg suggestion was just because my dad had it, and that twitchy feeling you described in your calf sounded like something he would talked about. When I was in hospital I felt like a human tuning fork. And similar to you when I went south it went fast. These cases where people have prolong periods of pins and needles with no pronounced weakness is likely something else Could you please describe your symptoms from the GBS in detail? Primarily, tingling and numbness in my arms and legs. Within a few days I was not able to walk at all, and was on a ventilator within a week. I also had a great deal of pain all over, but I am told that is not typical of GBS. The symptoms developed quickly and they never improved, they only got worse.", "GBS recovery ideas??? Hi All and happy and healthy 2020!!!\n\nI was diagnosed with GBS in September lat year and attempting a speedy recovery.........which may be optimistic! I have read people with MS have had great success in taking \"Taurine\" and \"Lions Mane\" that really seem to increase the regrowth of the myelin sheath, anyone have any knowledge of this or any other ideas???\n\nI am looking for anything that can promote recovery or ideas into it??? Is the MS stuff backed up by reliable studies or anecdotal? It is possibly slightly dangerous to be promoting non evidence based stuff. With my GBS the biggest help was learning acceptance and patience.... so we can help each other with that I recommend daily B12 shots. Idk about that stuff but eat as many omega 3\u2019s, 6\u2019s, and 9\u2019s you can. Eat lots of avocados, walnuts, and chia seeds, as well as eggs and salmon if you eat meat/eggs. \n\nThis has been clinically proven to help restore the myelin sheath around your nerves. These fatty acids are like the single best thing to eat. You should also avoid processed foods, as these inhibit myelin growth. A quick poke around Google finds some studies and research papers for MS with these things. They do seem to look helpful for nerve repair and myelination. I would caution without knowing what is going on with you though who knows if the myelination is actually your blocker.  The longest part of my recovery 10 years ago was mostly related to side effects of the GBS treatment, anemia not myelination. \n\nGenerally healthy eating, and paying attention to the feedback your body gives would be my focus.  I doubt there is going to be major negatives to introducing these things though. I would not look to energy drinks for your taurine :). I would like to second this. Please look for reliable studies when considering medicine-like substances. You really would not want to risk taking something counter-productive or harmful.\n\nI believe my PT and doctors recommended a high protein diet to aid at least muscle recovery. The food I was fed through my stomach tube certainly seemed to be high protein as well.\n\nIn all fairness, I was unable to find specific studies for basic muscle recovery after immobilization since it is such a basic thing. Everything I found was fairly cutting edge and focused on very specific scenarios that might not apply for GBS recovery. But protein is a basic dietary component and I am sure you can find good resources about it with a little time (which I do not have right now, sorry). What was your treatment to become anemic? I had 5 days worth of Immunoglobulin and that was it.... now attempting to be \"Patient\" while looking into alternatives to assist recovery, Taurine and Lions mane are both harmless but yes Ill stay away from the energy drinks;-) Agreed and have always been a healthy eater/person......... smashing as much of the good stuff as I can, thanks. where do you yet daily shots, im o B12 supps at 1200Mu per tab, do you know the strength of the shots where do you yet daily shots, im o B12 supps at 1200Mu per tab, do you know the strength of the shots Good. Other big thing is not over exerting yourself, and using your muscles/ exercising regularly. You essentially want to do the same thing people do to develop muscle memory: use your body and stay active.\n\nThere is a fascinating book that talks about muscle memory and how the reason it works is because a greater amount of myelin. It is called The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle. The same applies to GBS. Eating habits, exercise, and time are your best friends. I wish you the best of luck in your recovery! Hey thanks for this, ill look it up now!!\nI was 88Kg of pretty lean muscle prior and now 79kg............I did have good muscle memory all my life so perhaps it'l come back with vengeance.....;-))) That is great to hear! After my stint in the hospital this past March I went from almost 200 lbs (91 kg) to about 168 lbs (76 kg) due to being paralyzed for about a month.\n\nSounds like you are already on your way to kicking some serious ass! Good luck! Did you have IVIG treatment or plasmapheresis? I had 12 total days of IVIG treatment and had no problem with anemia I had 5 days of IVIG, then had my red blood cell count nose dived, if I recall correctly, about 1-2 weeks after treatment ended.  It was explained to me as my body stopped making red blood cells from being flooded by the IVIG and it would take a bit for my immune system to figure out normal again. \n\nIn the, we all are a little different with GBS, I was Miller Fisher, and went from no symptoms to unable to get out of a bed, and barely blowing the air flow test to avoid ventilation in 3 days. Then walked out of the hospital, on stubborn slightly shaking legs, 11 days after being admitted.  (Well they forced me to ride a wheel chair to the exit, but I stupidly forced myself to walk to the car.) Sounds similar to me. Still technically undiagnosed, but they think it was a variant of miller fisher. \n\nRed blood cell count was low before I was admitted though (this was after my first round of IVIG). Was on ventilator for about 48 hours, and paralyzed from the waist down for about 3 weeks. Walking to the car from the exit of the hospital was my goal lol Hey thanks for this but honestly Taurine and lions mane are completely harmless, proven fact!\n\nIm all over the healthy eating as was training prior to this little gem of a scenario................thanks for your input. I am 105 days since discharge now, walking with wobbly weak legs but no movement in feet so difficult to walk properly, arms weak as hell and using cutlery to eat is to say a challenge. \n\nGBS certainly seems to affect everyone slightly different and It seems the speed of treatment is key, I was diagnosed and treated late due to my work situation and location so although not affected with respiratory system and was in and out of hospital in 2 weeks, I seem to be left with significant nerve damage.... all about the myelin now!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I buy it of the Internet. Shots are much more concentrated than pills and way better. I take 3 ml/day. Day before the onset I was squatting 110kg. 4 months later i hit the gym and could not squat without weights (both balance and strength problems) . Grip too weak to hold 2kg dumbbell. \n\nThis morning, 1 year and 2 months since onset, I am squatting 100kg. Deadlift 110kg. Almost back to normal baby!!\n\nI have removed both gluten and dairy from diet and believe it played a major role in recovery. Hey thanks as its very encouraging to hear, i was stronger 6 weeks agon that I m now, strange. \nIt seems to be no improvement and difficult to stay positive but stories like yours are great to hear, I imagine what ill be doing in another three months and so on. You should not get weaker, let your doctor know, hopefully it is not CIDP. Hi! I am wondering if you have seen any progress since you have started taking taurine and lions mane. It looks quite promising online. H there, so turns out Ive had a re-lapse but they are also suspecting CIDP only further testing and time will tell......\n\nI do still take both the Lions mane and Taurine and since the last IVIG I have responded really well, dont think ive been taking it long enough through to really see if anything is going on there. I do believe that both hold some benefit so will keep it up and let you know if I spring out of bed one morning.................", "My prophetic dream 2 years ago, my legs started to suddenly collapse out from under me. It was so weird, because for years I had recurring dreams of it happening. I went to the ER, had tests done, they could not find anything and told me it was from stress; and despite being unable to walk, the idiot doctor released me.  It was true, I was in the midst of one of the most stressful periods of my life, but to the point of literally paralyzing me? My neighbors had to carry me out of the Lyft car and into my house! The next day, my sister &amp; brother picked me up and took me to the hospital near them, and by the time we got there not even an hour later, I was completely paralyzed and my breathing became labored. \n\nFortunately, they diagnosed me within 30 minutes: Guillain-Barre Syndrome. I became completely paralyzed from the neck down to my toes, and had to be intubated. I was delirious from a bad UTI and spent a week having delusional nightmares &amp; they all thought I was going to die. I even saw my dead Dad at my bedside. All I could do, and did do, was pray. I had to keep my headspace as calm as I never knew I could be...\n\nThey did the standard 2 treatments, and the first one did not work; the second treatment did, and I began to regain feeling about a month after initial onset, but now I had to relearn how to do every single thing that we take for granted. Sit, walk, talk, hold something in my hand. So, for the second month, I did just that at an inpatient rehab hospital. I had to learn how to properly swallow, I could not even have a sip of water (the greatest beverage on Earth! Also the biggest torture for me as I recovered, thirsting for water). The first success? Holding the toothbrush and brushing my teeth. Each day, I busted my ass to do a little more. Open a clothespin without dropping it. Put pegs in holes. Change the channel on the remote. Breathe on my own, especially so that I could finally drink a big glittery glass full of icy water. Roll over to the side to help nurses clean me up. Wipe my own ass. Would joke with the nurses that was my goal then mimic the kid in Big Daddy. Once I was able to do something, I insisted on keeping it that way. The first time I sat up after a month in bed, whoa! You never realize how important your core muscles are until they are not used for a while. The first time I stood up, with machines helping me, ooof, dizzying! But every single day, I made more and more progress. One movement at a time.\n\nA couple weeks later, I finally got to chew on ice, yay! Ahhhhh, ice ice baby! A couple of weeks after that, \u201cI can wipe my own ass!\u201d After that, taking steps with a walker and cane. A week earlier than initially expected, I was released from the rehab, and stayed with my sisters for the next 2 months until I was safe enough to go up and down steps on my own, and also doing home therapies. Once I felt comfortable enough, I was ready to go home. Not even 4 months later and I was home, doing physical therapy back to 100% independence and able to do everything prior to getting GBS. The only residual effects are numb toes and chronic fatigue syndrome, and a weaker stomach from where feeding tube was. The best residual effect is truly appreciating the simplest blessings in life that I previously took for granted. I thank God every day for them too. Your journey brought tears to my eyes.  I have the same philosophy, never give up, keep fighting to regain what was lost. When I was able to walk with a walker I gave away my wheelchair, when I could manage without a walker I gave that away too.  Never going back again. You keep fighting, keep reminding your body how to do these things.  I will be thinking of you when I do my PT later.  You can do it! Thank you so much, Bimbleberry! Celebrate each movement you regain, keep your headspace determined, keep the faith and before you know it you will amaze yourself and find gratitude in all the things we tend to forget about at times. Fortunately my body did remember, and last year I did some remodeling on my house-any of the things I am able to do there, I have. Best of luck with your PT, I am cheering you on! First of all, congratulations on your recovery!\n\nThe scary thing is, I too had dreams a few months before it finally hit me. I would dream that I would be out in public, like at a store, and my whole body would go weak, and I could not move. What a scary coincidence. Wow! Amazing journey! That is freaky! I had a lot of those dreams over a couple of decades before it happened. I wonder how many others had prophetic dreams of it happening... Mine hit at the end of October and I started having the dreams regularly in June. I also wonder if anyone else had that happen, too.", "Transient tingling post-vaccine ", "Does anyone here have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome? I had GBS- Miller Fisher type a few years ago. I was dx with EDS about 2 years before that. It is so hard to tell if my deficits that are problems now are a result of the GBS or the EDS. For example, I have gastroparesis that is bad enough that I have had feeding tubes/picc lines. Two causes of GP are EDS and GBS (autonomic neuropathy. I wonder if it was just the perfect storm of both. If anyone has any experience with a connective tissue disorder and GBS or has any insight I would love to hear what you have to say. Thanks, you all!", "Is there any way to test if you *had* GBS? Back in 2017, about 3 weeks after recovering from diagnosed Influenza A, I began have bilateral numbness, pins-and-needles pain in my hands. I was then hit with major fatigue and the following weeks lost feeling in my feet, began to trip, fall over (to the point I had to purchase a wheelchair)...it was awful. I was in my last semester of graduate school so I had no time for doctors. I also had no money for doctors (wonderful America).  I finished my dissertation with the help of voice to type software and my family in helping me get places.  I lost my job offer and literally had no idea why my body was shutting down. \nAfter 3 months of this my GP ordered an MRI which showed a few \u201cwhite matter foci lesions\u201d per the radiologist but in follow ups with neurologists they said they did not see those.  \nI was mostly tested for MS, which came back no clinical findings. My GP put me on a strong steroid treatment and physical therapy and I got most of my life back. However I still have weakness in my legs and both hands. My hands also hurt, all the time.  After 2-3 years of this I finally found a new neurologist.  He did a nerve condition test and ruled out CIDP (which I was sure I had) and ordered another battery of tests for MS.  $5000 later, all negative.  I had my appointment today where he told me he could not diagnosis me, but he also could not say I did not have MS. Just needed to wait. \n\nHere is my question, if I had GBS back in 2017 is there any test they could do now to determine that? \n\nIve accepted that where I am feeling wise and pain wise is just where I am stuck at, no matter what it is, it is nothing fixable. However, putting a name to that pain would make my life so much in easier in having to explain it to others or getting understanding/protections at work.  I think all my doctors just think \u201cMS\u201d and will not look for anything else.  I do not mind going back to my doctor and asking for further testing, but if there is no way to determine if I could have had GBS in 2017 then it is not worth the copay.  \n\nThank you in advance all i know is had two spinal taps so they could determine I had GBS. These were expensive and somewhat painful. Hello, so sorry this happened. I was just admitted to the hospital a few days ago, having never heard of GBS. I have learned a lot in my past few days, mostly from doctors, but also from good 'ol Google. \nFrom my limited, very new understanding, it usually has a really quick onset. How quickly from your first symptoms were noticed did your legs start to lose feeling? For me it was just a few days. It sounds like our situations are similar in that it is mainly affecting hands. \n\n\nQuestion: how were you able to purchase a wheelchair without a prescription? Or, if you had a prescription, why did not your doctor hospitalize you? When I went in with muscle weakness, they treated it as a medical emergency and brought me to the ER. \n\n\nI hope you find answers! It went from hands to feet in under a week.  I never had the same level of pain in my feet/legs that I have in my hands so the numbness was easier to ignore than the electrical pain in my arms.  \nI purchased one off Amazon, around $250, no prescription but worth it.  It is a someone else has to push it, but how my hands are I could not use a manual one.  I am kicking myself now for not going to the doctor (I saw an orthopedist a few days after my hands went numb and started hurting thinking it was carpel tunnel? But he just said \u201call I can say it is not carpel tunnel\u201d and sent me in my way.) I was under the impression that steroids worsen GBS symptoms and can sometimes be fatal. If the steroids helped you, I would think it was not GBS. Then again, GBS is different in every person who has it and there is so little information on it. I am sorry that was not much help but I hope you find what it is that is causing you pain. I can feel your frustration. It is strange. The EMG reveals no nerve impairment which suggests no demylenation is occuring or very little.\n\nHowever, your condition improved with a course of steroids which suggests it countered some kind of inflammation. Do you have muscle atrophy? \n\nIt could be anything. Severe vitamin deficiency, diabetes, Lupus (although rare in men), Lyme disease to even something like multiple myeloma can cause pretty significant neuropathy. GBS and CIDP are hard to diagnose because neuropathy has so many causes. \n\nSo in terms of suggestions, you may need to start with an internal medicine doc that could critically assess your condition and order testing that follows an algorithm where you can eliminate potential causes one by one. Yes that is where I am. My neurologist offered to order a spinal tap, but his take was that if it the spinal tap found something nothing would change other than I would have a name for it.  Given the cost and potential risks/procedure pain he felt it was not something he would push for.  If I get worse, then it is an option. I do not know enough about GBS, my primary was more giving me the treatment for MS and just in general knowing it was not an infection hoping the steroids could help lessen any possible inflammation causing the nerve pain.  Steroids are one of the main treatments for CIDP, which is how I found out about GBS and CIDP.  (Which is not a lot, I am very grateful for this small, but active Reddit community) even if I do not have CIDP my symptoms are basically the same so it is nice to have people who understand. Or even with jus GBS...to know that fear of being fine and then *switch*! You are totally not fine.  It is scary.  I do not like the baseline I am at, but it is tolerable and I am terrified that I am going to wake up one day and be right back to where I was December 2017. Thank you for your reply! \n\nThe more I read about peripheral neuropathy the more I see how hard it is to diagnosis.  There has the be enough damage there to test, but as a person you can feel the effects of mild neuropathy way before.  \n\nMy EMG showed that I was in the normal range, well my doctors words were \u201cmostly normal\u201d. He said I was on the very edge of normal for my lower legs and feet (totally fine in the knee and thigh) and lower end for the hands\u2014but that it was still normal.  I did consider it a win, to some extent what I was saying was verified.  I did not have a baseline EMG to show that where my level was now was lower than what it was 4 years ago so technically it could not be used to help diagnosis me.  \n\nNo muscle atrophy. Been checked for Lupus and Lyme. (Negative)  feel like I have given enough blood to be checked for every autoimmune condition that can be determined by a blood test.  I am going back to my Rheumatologist.  It went internal medicine doctor - neurologist - internal medicine again - referred to a more experience internist - rheumatologist- rheum sent me to a neurologist who specializes in a wide array of demyelinating disorders - he is sending me back to the rheumatologist for more work ups but is just like \u201cget an appointment immediately if your symptoms worsen, but if not learn to accept it and maybe be glad you do not have a diagnosis, that can change your life a lot\u201d which I get and get frustrated by. That is extremely frustrating. For me, at first, the term \"psychosomatic\" was thrown around and I was sent home. Very invalidating. But it is important to advocate for yourself, which is something I am learning to do. It is tough, but we will figure it out! Best of luck. Keep us posted after your next appointment! I am going through that right now. I am really glad things have gotten better for you but yeah, that is a lot of anxiety. My spinal fluid did not have enough proteins for one doctor to diagnose GBS, but enough for a different doctor to order the treatment for it. So I agree with someone earlier, that it is so different for everyone and we do not know much. So frustrating. My first time to the ER they said it was psychosomatic and sent me home. Been there.", "What was your recovery timeline like? I am heading into month seven of recovery. I still cannot walk at all without my walker. I tried to use a cane today. I took one step and nearly fell. Even with my walker I can only walk a little ways before having lots of pain in my legs and feet along with getting tired so fast. I was reading where 80% of most people can walk without assistance after six months of recovery. \n\nI am feeling discouraged. Any advice or input would be appreciated. All I can say is to work as hard as possible for me I would get up and move around as much as possible. I had a mild case as far as being mobile was concerned. I was able to use a cane and not a walker, I also fell a lot. I was eight month but still have loss of feeling in hands and feet nine years after. I knew I was better once I could pull off a jumping Jack! It was just one but I busted my but to get it. That worked into recovery for me again a mild case. It hits every one different. Keep moving as much as you can stand. Good luck and keep fighting!! Do not give up. No pain no gain.my recovery  was about 5 months with a cane ,lot of physical therapy. I was 52.though after 10 years my muscle are not like they used to be, but that might be age. This depends on how badly nerves get damaged from what I have learned. Do not be hard on yourself, the GBS does enough of that. Just do what you can when you can and keep on keeping on. \n\nI was tetraplegic for about 3 months and went blind in one eye. Told I would be in a wheelchair for life. May 2019 I got sick, ventilated etc came home with a walker 11/19. As of now 9/21 I can walk without any aids, ride a bicycle and am working on range of motion. Still cannot really feel or move my feet properly but I am working on it. \n\nThe physical side is hard but the mental battles way harder imo. I have found discipline with exercises has got me through when motivation fails me. Little by little. One day at a time. You got this. \n\nSide note: worth checking out lionsmane mushroom - it is legal and excellent for neural regeneration. So I started experiencing extreme weakness and soreness a week after having routine gallbladder surgery this was the end of Feb 2013. I was paralyzed and hospitalized from the end of February through the end of April. The entire time doing intensive physical therapy and occupational therapy daily. I needed two PT aides and I could not stand or walk at all. After that, I was transferred to a nursing home which was the lowest point for me mentally because I was only 25 years old living with a bunch of seniors. The first nursing home was not very conducive for the healing process so I went to a different one. They did not have physical therapists on staff there so home health sent one out to me there two times a week. I was in a wheelchair, but gradually started to be able to transfer myself to bed or a chair. I still needed assistance using the bathroom and showering. Two or three months after that, I was using a wheelchair still but also learned to take a step or two with a walker and gradually more. I think it took me about 10-11 months after being diagnosed with GBS to not needing a walker anymore. I did still use a cane for a long time after that.\n\nI had a variant of GBS with a thiamine deficiency and a couple of other deficiencies because I had surgery almost right before being paralyzed so there were other complications that delayed my recovery. I still have not fully recovered 100% and likely never will, but things did improve. Thank you for the encouragement! I have also fell more times than to count\u2026 I sort of just use to it ha. Thankfully I have not in a long time. I am so glad you are doing better. Wow I am so glad you are doing better. I did not have near as a severe case as you. Mine was really bad in my hands, and my legs were pretty much useless from the knee down. I believe the nerve damage is quite severe in my right foot. Parts of it still have zero feeling. You are so right about the mental aspects as well. Thank you for replying!", "Feet vibrating for about a month Hi there. I had GBS in 2017 and have been having what I consider to be symptoms of a relapse. I have been to the ER like 3 or 4 times in the last few weeks due to bad panic attacks and fear of relapse.\n\nI have been having a vibrating feeling in my feet on and off for about a month, and also tingling in my fingertips. Along with that I have had numbness/pain in my feet.\n\nNow I definitely did have lasting nerve damage but I guess the reason I got scared all over again was because it seemed like it had stopped completely or almost completely, then a month after a September cold went away it came back. I might just be tripping because I have pretty bad anxiety. But, in my head that is how it seems. My strength and balance is fine, though sometimes my legs feel a little shaky, but that could be cause I am an anxious mess lately.\n\nMy PCP said they do not think I need a spinal tap as they do not think it is coming back, but boy am I scared. It is been an all consuming thought everyday for the last few months. I am terrified.\n\nAnyone know what symptoms to look out for or know if they are on/off? When I got it the first time it came on pretty suddenly. Was in the bathroom at the hospital due to another illness, suddenly fell and could not get back up. So I did not start off with tingling/numbness the first time.\n\nI am trying to keep my anxiety under control but every feeling is scaring me.. and raising my blood pressure which also is not good lol.\n\nI had what my doctor today said may have been a URI that lasted maybe a week and went away about 4/5 days ago. So, besides my cold I am scared all over again because of that. It was just right side chest irritation and mucus coming up, but still. And every time I go outside I have throat irritation/running nose for maybe the rest of the day and then I am fine. But, that is also scarring me. Ugh. Maybe that is just allergies though.\n\nDoctor seems to be confident stuff is good, but who knows. Guess I am just venting here and asking......\n\nJust looking for some other POVs and experiences. I hope you are all well. \u2764\ufe0f Ask your neurologist if you need another round of IVIG. I had a \"relapse\" about 9 months after I left the hospital with similar symptoms. Tingling in hands, some numbness, feet felt like they were vibrating. I went to see my neuro and she recommended another round of IVIG. Went for a week in the morning before work, symptoms stopped. I do not see them until a full month from now. I will call them about it though and see if it is possible to get in sooner.\n\nOriginally all this stuff stayed with me even after I got better because I now have nerve damage, but the vibrating in feet is what really make me question it. Thank you. My tingling never left. Try anti-anxiety medication for a while. Yeah, I think it is that. I say until it \u201ccame back\u201d it seemed like it left, but in reality I probably just got used to it and stopped paying attention. Now the nerve pain definitely got better. But the vibrating, tingling, numbness was there at least up until the summer time of this year. Kind Of do not remember past that in terms of this stuff.\n\nBut, yeah I am going to do that too. I am not a doctor, or a medical professional of any sort. I am 10 years post GBS and still have nerve damage in my feet. I was at a GBS symposium in Vancouver, Canada and the top specialist speaker noted that in her 35 years of practice she has seen two cases of someone getting it twice.  She also said is that what goes undiagnosed is PTSD.  I have no idea if you were an anxious person your whole life or if that came about after your GBS.  It seems like seeing a therapist might be the best thing for you.  Do not ignore your physical symptoms but seek some alternative help for yourself. Hang in there. Hey, yeah I have always been anxious but more so now I am the past few months. About many things. Went to the doctor today and they think it is just remaining nerve pain and also probably anxiety. But, I do see a neurologist next week.\n\nThis is something that was still happening even after I got better, I guess I got scared again because I am so afraid of it coming back. I am dealing with the same thing right now, I am in my head constantly and not I feel like the clumsy proprioception issues are coming back.\n\nWhat ended up happening? Were you having a relapse? No, I am fine thankfully. I think it is just my nerves acting up because I now have the nerve damage and I am not on meds for the pain and sensations. But, my feet sometimes hurt, same with my hands, other times they do not. The vibrating in feet still happens. It is doing it now, but it is also off and on and just a nerve thing, I suppose. Also, my B vitamins were kind of low and that can cause nerve pains too so that could be why. I hope you are okay, have you talked to your doctor at all? Thank you for replying! I have not talked to my doctor yet. It started about 3 weeks ago after I had a massive panic attack. I was diagnosed with GBS in May 2019 so I am over a year now of healing.\n\nI am just hoping my anxiety is getting the most of me and this will blow over. I am going to up my vitamins. No problem! Congrats on your recovery, you are over a whole year out now!\n\nCan I ask if you were sick prior or was it just at random?\n\nSo, what is it that you have been experiencing the last few weeks? Off balance?\n\nIt is scary, for a good while I was SO SO scared of it coming back. I still think about it, but not as much and not so severely. But, it is a fear. I hate even reading about the shit now. But, anxiety will do a lot to you and yeah, if you can get those vitamin levels checked that would be great, but I had mine checked in like December and they were pretty low. So, I am working on those. Thank you! It is definitely been on my mind a lot lately since it is now been a year and I pretty much feel 100%.\n\nI was sick last year, doctors think it was old chicken. I had a small stomach bug and then 10 days later I had tingles.\n\nThis time just a big panic attack and my nerves instantly started burning, that was 3 weeks ago, and since I have just had tingles, twitches, cramps, and random spouts of muscle exhaustion. I woke up last night and did not know how my feet were orientated, reminded me of last year. Do not really feel unbalanced or dizzy just cannot tell where my feet are in space. That is great!\n\nAh, okay. Yeah, mine followed being ill but I still do not know why I was ill, lol. So dumb.\n\nGotcha. Yeah, it very well could just be your nerves acting shitty because they are damaged now. I have vibrating, numbness, pain, tightness. Just all these weird, annoying feelings now because of it. Off and on sometimes, sporadic, sometimes worse than other times, but there. Definitely mention it to your doctor, though just to double check or make sure. When I made this post originally I kept being scared about it so I went to the doctors and such. It never hurts to make sure. Thank you, I really appreciate you taking the time to answer! Hoping the best for you! It is no problem! And same to you! \n\nBut, did mean you woke up and could not feel them last night or? I could feel them, I just could not tell how they were orientated in the bed like if one foot was on top of the other or which way my toes were pointing. It is a super weird feeling. Oh, yeah I think that is the numbness maybe. Like, not feeling them fully. I experience that. But, that is not new for me. Like, I can feel them, but they usually feel \u201coff\u201d or partially numb so sometimes I have that not being about the place which foot is where or the thing with the toes. Yeah, I agree, I think my anxiety just makes me more alert of what is going on. I will wait it out a little bit. Thanks again!", "COVID-19 Vaccine I know it is still a bit early, but I would like to know what your doctors advise you about the COVID-19 vaccine.  My doctors has made it clear that no more flu shots for me, and I assume that will include Covid-19.  I would like to know if any of your doctors have determined that it would be safe to take the vaccine. My neuro said absolutely get the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nEditing to add: my neuro has told me vaccines are case by case, and to discuss with her as they come up. For instance: a tetanus shot, if needed, she would recommend. The annual flu shot, she says I should not get.\n\nThe way she determines is how severe the risk is. Tetanus would obviously be pretty severe if I were to get it. The flu would not be. COVID has shown itself to be pretty intense, and I have a heart condition so I am high risk for it. Because of this, she said absolutely get it. Speak with your neurologist/primary care physician. GBS can occur for a variety of reasons. Best to speak with them I have talked to my doctor and when they have the vaccine I am going to take it. I think it is really worth it. My DO said probably about at most (worst case scenario) a 3% chance of any reoccurrence. I will take that action over a lifetime of joint, heart, brain damage, and possible death. I have not heard anything about this either As always, ask your doctor.\n\nI will ask my neurologist when we are closer to general availability. I think he is generally in favor of GBS patients taking the flu vaccine as long as they did not develop GBS in the 4 weeks following vaccination. I developed at 3 weeks so my doctor recommended I play it safe.\n\nBut the COVID vaccines I have read about are very different from the typical flu vaccines and, like others have said, you have to weigh the risks of vaccination vs risks of non-vaccination (which, as we know, are very bad). I have had covid (and recovered) and did not have a fun time. Given the potential risks for long term health effects, I would get the covid vaccine when/if it becomes available. I have actually asked my doctor about it and they tentatively recommended the concept of the vaccine, though there is too little known about future vaccines for the to say anything definitive. But I am beginning to appreciate that having had covid once does not give me immunity, and so whatever strategy I use to avoid getting covid again needs to be a long-term one.\n\nThe risk of GBS reoccurrence is low, which I weigh against the risk of getting covid again. But I also take in account what efforts I would need to continue to make long term to avoid covid, were I not vaccinated, and how that would greatly impact my life. My GB DOCTOR is saying to get the vaccine, but the timing will matter. Maybe I will be in the 3rd or 4th rounds I have heard from many of my non-GBS friends that they are thinking of waiting to see what happens when the vaccine is released. There has been just one study on this (risk of relapse):\n\n (", "Do I have GBS? Hello, I am wondering if I do have gbs or some other disease. Basically, one morning, I woke up with numb hands and feet. I thought nothing of it and thought that it would go away. But it did not. It started getting worst as my feet coordination was low and had trouble walking.\n\n\nI checked myself to the er and within 5 minutes of being checked out by a doctor, he diagnosed me with gbs. They admitted me to the hospital where I stayed for 3 days and they basically ran some tests. They could not definitely say it is gbs and they could not rule it out.\n\n\nThe reason why I think that it might not be gbs because the tingling and the numbness came at the same time on my hands and feet. They are also extremely colder than the rest of the body. Also, whenever I cross my legs or arms, I get an electric shock, not painful,  and then that part becomes numb. \n\n\nIs my experience similar to someone with gbs? \n\nThanks This sounds very much like GBS, but you must have a spinal tap to confirm. Not every GBS start on feet, sometimes tingling on hands and feet start at the same time (like mine). \nIm suffer from GBS about 2 months but my progression goes very well. now  i am clearly walk, also i can run too :))\nAs it was stated before, Spinal tap is compulsory in order to confirmation of GBS diagnosis.\nBy the way, early GBS diagnosis is so important for treatment.\nGet better soon to everyone... Ask a doctor. I do not think any response here is worth saying one way or another. Be careful of self diagnosis of ANYTHING Hey, thanks for replying with your experience.  I got the spinal tap results too and it was at the threshold of gbs, 4.5. 4.5 or above is considered having gbs.\n\nAs for the treatment, everything is on hold because of the virus going around I do not personally have GBS, but my brother and father did. This does sound similar to some of my first symptoms with MS. Did they do a Lumbar Puncture while you were hospitalized? Definitely trust what your doctor says over anyone on here, but for what it is worth, your symptoms sound similar to what I had with Miller Fisher Syndrome which is a type of GBS. My protein levels were only slightly elevated too. However, from what I was told generally GBS is diagnosed by ruling out other things that your neurologist probably tested for. The good news is that it is generally reversible and mild symptoms (i.e. no breathing issues) will likely clear up on their own in time even without treatment. Thank you so much for sharing your experience. I had doubts about the doctor's diagnosis because some of the symptoms that I have are not listed on websites where I was reading about them. I feel much better knowing that it is more than likely GBS. Yeah they did do the Lumbar Puncture and the results were just slightly elevated. One of the fears was that it was maybe MS. MS sounds brutal from reading about it online. No problem. The symptoms can be really weird and if you look at them in isolation they can look like something else. For instance, at one point I had this weird vibrating feeling all over my body. Almost like the feeling when your cell phone vibrates in your pocket, but all over my body. If I laid down it would eventually go away, but then come back if I got up and was active again. I also had paralysis on the right side of my face which my ophthalmologist (who I was seeing because GBS caused vision issues for me) insisted was Bell's palsy.", "First time being sick after recovery This is my first time being badly sick since I have recovered and I am panicking. Im not sure if it is in my head but my feet keep numbing and tingling, I am just really worried. I do not want to worry my family by telling them when it may be nothing but the alternative is not great either. Has anyone else had a similar experience their first time sick? I just got seriously ill (flu that turned into pneumonia) and had to be hospitalized for 3 days. I am 3 years post GBS. Whenever I would spike a very high fever like 103.5 or so, my fingertips would become numb and tingle. It about sent me into a panic, to be honest. But clearly I was not relapsing or anything. I think it really might just be from leftover nerve damage. Sure is not a fun feeling! Hope you are feeling better. Have you called your neurologist? That should always be your first step. You can call the office, let them know what is going on, and have your neuro let you know whether they want you to come in or not.\n\nI have not really gotten sick since getting GBS in 2017, but I have gotten 2 more IVIG treatments since leaving the hospital due to numbness and tingling. I am currently waiting for my insurance to approve a third. I remain terrified of getting sick, because I had \"viral syndrome\" which is what caused my GBS. My neurologist does not play around and would rather me call and ask to see if my symptoms are normal because she does not want me getting freaked out over something that is \"normal\" or \"common\", but also does not want me to not get help if I need it. \n\nAlways, always, always check with your neurologist and see what they think. It will cut down on your anxiety and is better than putting off something that could be serious. Thank you so much, I will try and and call mine but I have not seen him since I was bedridden and only just managed to get a much needed appointment.   If I cannot get ahold of him I will try my opthamologist as she is been more on top of my recovery and is basically filling his shoes. Thank you that makes me feel a lot better. I have only been out of hospital for about 4 or 5 months so that is very likely. I too am starting to feel like I am coming down with a cold - have grandchildren here who are sneezing and coughing.  I am only 1 month out from a 'mild' case.  I did have facial paralysis and could not walk while in hospital for 11 days - but my recovery has gone quite well, and I was told by my neurologist that I should have a full recovery - though it could take from 6 months to a year.  I still feel tingling in hands and feet and my blood pressure is all over the place.  I get fatigued far easier than before GBS, but again I have a mild case of which I am very grateful.  I think you have to believe that you will not have a reoccurrence that it was rare that you got it in the first place, and trust your body. Thank you, sorry for the late reply. I was very sick for a couple weeks but my body has recovered, remembering that the likelihood of a recurrence is miniscule really helped. The thought that I beat it once so I can do it again also helped alot. Again thank you.", "I think it is finally hitting me Hi! \n\nI was diagnosed a little over a year ago. The doctors could not give me a straight answer at the beginning and they still cannot give me a straight answer about my diagnosis now. \n\nAll my blood work and spinal taps came back normal. They only diagnosed me with GBS because of my symptoms. \n\nI have watched YouTube videos, searched online, and picked at my colleagues brains (I work in the medical field) and no one can tell me much of anything that I have not heard before. \n\nI have kept a positive attitude telling myself that it is only a matter of time. I have worked hard to be as independent as possible (which is difficult because I have a brachial plexus and a spinal fusion from a car accident four years ago) I even sought out legal help to get my job back just a month after leaving ICU. \n\nBut I am going crazy, I am tired of the looks. The feeling of embarrassment when I try to go out with my friends and be a normal 26 yr old. I need answer. I need to know why. I need to walk again!  To my understanding the Syndrome part of GBS means there is no medically accepted way to prove you have it.  So the diagnosis process is not something to worry about imo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI posted in another thread that  my bout of GBS was with a rare variant of a rare disease so it is possible I cannot help a lot with personal experience.  With that said what are you trying to learn?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy?  Something in your body made your immune system attack your nervous system.  \n\nWhat did it or why did that happen? I have not heard anyone make, what felt to me like a trustworthy, claim to have those answers. How long was your recovery? From the cases I have seen on YouTube and from what the doctors told be in the beginning was that recovery would take me between 3 months to a year... I am current a year and a half in.  Symptoms were gone in about 10 days after they started.  Muscle strength and coordination were back to normal in about 2 weeks after that.  Anemia, which I was told was a side effect of the Plasmapheresis, was also gone by that same time.  So for me, beginning to end was less then a month.  \n\nPhysical rehab, and neurologist follow ups, went for about 4 weeks beyond when I was back to my pre GBS state.  So by 2 months after the fact, I was largely just trying not to think about it a ton. I am currently going through this. No test or exam can directly prove GBS, they have only ruled out all the others to confirm. It was frustrating in the beginning not getting an absolute \u201cthis is what you have\u201d kind of diagnosis. But I am responding to treatment and I identify with every symptom so that helped with coping with the confusion. \n\nI am 26, I can walk but I walk funny now and cannot keep up with anyone. I also cannot go long distance or stand very long. I am only 2 months into recovery so hopefully it improves. But I definitely relate to your prognosis and struggles with keeping up with a social life. ", "News: COVID-19 jab trials for people who \"cannot have vaccinations\" due to existing illnesses. Hello all,\n\nI just thought I would share this article I found with this sub to anyone who may be interested on the impact of a COVID-19 vaccination for GBS/CIDP sufferers.\n\n*\"But the UK's Vaccine Taskforce chair, Kate Bingham, estimates hundreds of thousands people might not benefit from a vaccine because they do not have a working immune system.\n\nThis might be due to an immune deficiency, or because they are taking immune-suppressing drugs, for diseases such as cancer.\n\n\"It is crucial that we leave no one behind as we move closer to finding both a vaccine and developing more treatments for Covid-19,\" she said.\n\n\"We particularly need to ensure those who cannot be given a vaccine, such as* **people who are immuno-compromised,** *have alternatives available that will help protect them.\"\n\nAstraZeneca, which is developing the antibody injection, hopes it will offer 6-12 months' protection.\n\nStudy lead Prof Andrew Ustianowski said, while vaccines work \"by inducing a person's immune system to produce antibodies that inhibit or 'neutralise' the virus\", his team are investigating whether similar protection could be given to the immuno-compromised, by injecting antibodies which have been shown to neutralise the virus directly into the muscle.\n\nThis bypasses the immune system for those people who \"do not respond well to vaccines, or cannot be given them\".*\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nIt is tough having suffered a rare illness as it is hard to know what advice is actually correct, especially with such a new thing - Whether a standard COVID jab may by potentially harmful.\n\nI think the key word in that article is they are talking about \"immuno-compromised\" people - which I have heard often to describe GBS/CIDP.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you hold out on the COVID vaccine for something like this, instead?", "After almost 3 years of being on perminent disibility, I got diagnosed with Chronic Guillain Barre Syndrome, otherwise known as CIDP.  November of 2015 I was hospitalized for 3 months because I lost all motor function. I could not walk, feed myself, bathe or dress myself. I went into full renal failure, had sepsis and metabolic encephalitis. In the almost 3 years I have been diagnosed with 15 different ailments. During my most recent neuro visit I had an EMG done where my neurologist broke the news. He felt so bad that it took this long to properly diagnose me. He said that every diagnosis I had was an indicator of CIDP and that he could not believe the hospital refused to test me for it. The tests show that it is up to my lumbar so he put in a claim to my insurance for immediate IVIG treatments. I am really scared because I currently have difficulty walking up stairs, standing for long periods of time (similar to when I first got sick) and my neuropathy is at full force. My Gapapentin and Voltaren do not seem to be doing their job. My  neuro also informed me that I am to never get the flu or pneumonia shot because of the complications they provide to my condition. Well, when I was in the hospital, they forced me to get both, telling me I had no choice. I doubt I can go after the hospital for misdiagnosing me and forcing vaccines on me that that did more harm than good (do not worry,  I am not an anti-vaxxer) due to the fact that it is been longer than two years.\n\nIf anyone has advice for me, I would greatly appreciate it because I am worried sick of the final outcome to this disease. \n Wow - you have having it tough - you must be strong to get this far. How old are you?\n\nI had gbs 20 years ago and it took 3 visits before a sage Dr spotted it. Had some medical fuck ups whilst I was ventilated. I spent many years thinking they were to blame etc, but in the end had to make peace and hold onto fact I would be very dead if I had not been treated.\n\nThere is some very good health professionals out there, so when you recognise them hold onto them.\n\n20 years on - I get depression frequently, and my foot drop causes pain some days. Other than that live a full and healthy life. Realise I did not have the chronic form - but I know that recovery needs almost superhuman levels of patience.... but do able! My best advice is to find a psychologist or someone who has had GBS/CIDP (or both) to talk to. You have to take care of yourself first and that will help with a lot of the anxiety and depression that probably has come with being misdiagnosed for so long.\n\nAre you currently hospitalized? Or will they be doing the IVIG outpatient?\n\nI am sure you will be getting physical therapy of some kind...maybe you can ask someone if they have a GBS support group? I have one that I go to once a quarter that is pretty helpful. It is good to talk to people who understand.\n\nAs far as legal recourse.... You may want to consult with a lawyer? I was misdiagnosed like 3 times before I was actually diagnosed with GBS. Granted, I did not have CIDP. But many lawyers will do a free consultation.\n\nIf you need someone to talk to, you can always reach out to me! I know how lonely and frustrating it is to be going through something like this and not having anyone who understands what you are going through.  Hey there!\n\nFirst off - holy cow! I am so sorry that you have had to endure all of these ailments.\n\nI just wanted to share some (hopefully) positive perspective on the whole thing. When my wife had GBS and started receiving IVIG,  she saw improvement by day 3 of the 5-day treatment. You have gone through a much different illness than she did, but I hope you see similar improvements from the IVIG. \n\nIn my experience, it seems the diseases are different for every patient, and everyone responds differently. As others have suggested, find people who can sympathize and share experience and a therapist. :)\n\nAnd as always, we are happy to share in your experience and discuss if you are in need. I am 29, but I was 26 when all my symptoms started. I have basically been in constant physical therapy since I came home from the hospital. I was hospitalized for 3 months when I first got sick, but im home now and will be doing outpatient treatments. I am just concerned because of the fact that it is chronic because my doctor told me this will not be the only time I will have to have IVIG. Are you getting support for your mental health? When I was first hospitalized they would send in therapists to talk to me, but they mostly wanted to focus on the effects that my abusive relationship with my ex had on me, not my medical condition. I have not seen a therapist since, but I can say that my friends and family have been more than beneficial at keeping me positive. My best friend has been my strongest rock, pushing me to my limits just to prove to me that I am stronger than my disabilities, yet she knows when I need to retreat within myself and just regroup. My family gives me the best advice since auto immune diseases unfortunately run in my family. I cannot fathom the idea of paying to talk to someone who does not even know me when my interpersonal support system is so strong. Hi Staceface1789,\n\nI was diagnosed with CIDP in 2006. They confirmed it with lumbar puncture and I have been on IVIG since. The first few years on IVIG were rough but now I only go in every 9 weeks and my mobility is pretty much back to normal. Heat, like hot summer weather, bothers my legs and feet still (makes them feel tight) and I get pretty craptacular migraines post IVIG but I can deal with it. If you have any questions or just need to vent, feel free to email me. Hi staceface1789, I would like to share something that I believe is of benefit to all my fellow Gullian-Barre and or Miller Fisher Syndrome patients. I was diagnosed in March 2015, with GBS, MFS, and bilateral Bells-Palsy. Way too many hyphens in that diagnose. :) I was hospitalized for two weeks and received a few bags of Immunoglobulin. Then I got the proverbial handshake from the neurologist, letting me know that he could not do anything for me anymore, and that the nerves now have to heal on their own. The only medication to improve my condition were B12 complex shots that I received once per week. They were quite expensive, and I could not really tell if they were doing anything for me or not.\n\nI work for a software company and have to travel to Asia on occasion. It was not very pleasant to fly for 16 hours with a paralyzed face, but I felt that I had do to that, if I wanted to keep my career on track. While in Manila I suddenly experienced the symptom of double vision. It was the first time, and a bit strange. But I had one shot left of my B12 complex medication. I gave myself the intramuscular shot, and as soon as I pushed the medication into the muscle, the eyes started to work again.\n\nI realized that I might be onto something. I checked the Internet for possible negative side effects of B12 complex shots, and there are none. According to the Mayo Clinic  \"Your body absorbs as much as it needs and any excess passes through your urine.\" I decided that I needed more B12 shots, at least one shot per day, to improve my condition.\n\nHow could I get the necessary B12 complex shots?\n\nB12 complex is prescribed by doctor and paid for by my (excellent) insurance as a weekly shot. The price for me (deductible) is $25/month = $300 per year. They will not move me up to a daily schedule, because GBS MFS is just too rare to have any significant data that proves that a daily hyper dose does help.\n\nB12 for animals is cheap. 0.5 liter cost $20 at \n\nBut like with everything, if it gets relabled for humans the price rises astronomically. If I had access to the animal medication I would not hesiate to use it, because I am sure that it is made by the same machines, but even for animals it has to be prescribed, and I do not have a cow. :)\n\nSo I went to the local pharmacy in Manila and bought a yearly supply of B12 complex shots over the counter for around $80. And for one year now I have given myself 3-5 m^3 of B12 complex shots every day. It is one of those medication that you take and usually do not feel anything afterwards, however, if I miss a dose, I feel sluggish, tired, and have significant nerve pain. You can actually mail order B12 from Asian cock fighting web sites (no kidding), but I do not know if that is legal.\n\nDue to the B12 shots I can exercise for hours now. It is clear to me that hyper doses of B12 are the only wonder medicine that works. A weekly shot is not near enough. I have had days where I gave myself two shots. In fact with B12 I think it works better, the more often you take it.\n\nI wanted to share that story with everyone. B12 is helping with my recovery more than anything. After 3 1/2 years I still have nerve pain in my feet and hands. My face is still partially paralyzed, I still have an occasional cough, especially when I am under stress. But when I take my B12 I always feel better. I do not have to take pain medication. All I am taking are daily B12 shots. If you are stuck with your GBS recovery, or are a CIPD patient, I would like you to consider B12 as a therapy. It has helped me to exercise again. I still run very slow, but I can run for two hours.  This is actually really interesting information. Thank you so much for sharing. I will have to talk to my neuro and see what he says because so far I have not noticed any improvement with my IVIG, but then again I only go for my 3rd infusion on the 24th. My pain is starting to get worse in my body and I could really use anything right now that might help improve my symptoms even in the slightest. GBS patient here: thanks ", "Vaccines So what is the general opinion on getting vaccines post onset of GBS? The main problem is there is hardly any evidence on both sides that either refute or support vaccination. A lot of doctors stay silent on the matter, and are rather uneducated due to a lack of research. I understand it is advised that people who got GBS from a flu shot reaction should not get any other vaccines, but what about someone who got it from unknown causes? Curious if there is anyone here who got a flu shot and stayed fine afterward. My specialist, who has been a specialist for over 30 yrs has only seen one case of repeat GBS. She says that you should get the vaccine.  I did not get GBS from the flu shot but my neurologist advised me not to get them anymore so I have not had one since. However, I did have to get a tetanus shot after getting cut by rusty metal. Neither the nurse nor I noticed until after that the waiver form included something that said people with GBS should consult a doctor before getting the vaccine, so that was scary, but I was fine. I think it is pretty rare to have a reoccurrence after a vaccine. We are not exactly sure how I got mine but it was either from the flu shot or a stomach bug. I have not gotten the flu shot since but have gotten all other vaccines and luckily have been still good.  My neurologist told me I should come to her if I need any vaccines and we will take them on a case by case basis. I do not get the flu shot, but she said if I needed a tetanus shot it would be stupid not to get one.  I was at the GBS/CIDP symposium this past year in San Diego and every single doctor there said that it is ok to get vaccines after GBS. They said you have the same chance of getting it again either way, which is pretty dang low. All these doctors are top neurologists in their fields studying gbs/cidp/mmn and from all over the world. I have seen/had this debate numerous times and it seems the answers are always 50/50, but after hearing 10+ different specialists say its safe to get vaccines I myself now say go get the vaccine if you need it.  Same for me.  Good to know! Thank you ", "Restless legs? Hey guys. I had GBS April 2021.\nFully recovered in early may and the doctors declared me fully healed around July. \nI do have some weakness and tingles around my toes every once in a while, but they do not even bother me too much. \n\nThis past week I have had some difficulty sleeping through the night, and have felt some discomfort with my legs. Last night was very weird bc I woke up and I had this weird urge to move my legs around. \nI could not keep still. I kept wanting to kind of flex them and stretch my toes.\n\nI cannot fall asleep rn either. It is like my legs are tired but I need to keep moving them around. \n\nJust wondering if anyone else has experienced this? Get either weighted blanket. My gf has the restless legs. The blanket helps but is also a total pain in the butt. It seems to help I had GBS (Miller Fisher variant) in 2011.  I have chronically had RLS since sometime after GBS diagnosis. Not sure if it is related but nonetheless it happens to me nightly. It is worse when I am really tired. I sleep with a heat pad down by my feet/ankles made of rice that I microwave for a few minutes before bed. Seems to do the trick. I know they have Rx medications out there but I have not had to go that route yet. So like a heating pad right?? Wow thanks, idk if it is related either but I did also get this weird feeling before my symptoms went downhill. I will look into that! I hope I can get one once it cools down haha thank you! It is most likely your nerves still regenerating A heating pad would work just the same :) \n\nAnd although I am not a medical professional I would think that weird feeling you get that is similar to right before your symptoms worsened is from the nerve damage that may still be somewhat present. It will likely lesson with time. For about the first year after being released from in patient rehabilitation I experienced post GBS symptoms that were milder but still mimicked my symptoms immediately before my GBS hit me fast and hard. It would terrify me. They still occur here and there when I am anxious about things but for the most part have dissipated. Only thing that has lasted was the RLS. Thanks! I will definitely try that out tonight. \n\nI am so sorry to hear that, I understand how terrifying it is. I try to convince myself that I am not bothered by those random symptoms but they are alarming sometimes. I still have a lot of tightness in my calves and my feet, especially at night. On days when I remember to drink plenty of water and make an effort to stretch my calves and flex my feet multiple times throughout the day, it is noticeably better. I really hope it helps :) Does tightness mean like they are kind of sore? Thanks, I did try and drink more water throughout the day today! Gosh I cannot believe it takes this long tbh ): thanks though, I now realize how many people experience effects of this long term. Sort of. When I say \u201ctightness,\u201d to me it feels like I did a whole bunch of toe-raise exercises or took a really long walk. Hey, just popping back in bc when I consulted someone else that had GBS, they told me to try compression socks and they worked wonders for me! Just wanted to mention that in case you have not. That was really kind of you. I used them often in the beginning but have forgotten about them over the years. Thank you, I appreciate it. Oh I totally know what you mean. I am almost 5 years now and I still get the restlessness. I try to explain to my family that it is false signals to my legs saying they just walked a mountain but I have been sleeping. \n\nI am glad I read your post; I too find that stretching and exercising makes it disappear rather fast. At first I succumbed to thinking \u201cok do not move too much today\u201d but the opposite was the solution", "COVID exacerbating GBS symptoms I tested positive for COVID last Friday and am double vaccinated.  I got GBS in May and am still recovering physically.  I just got cleared to wean off my mobility aids the week before I got COVID. Since getting it, my mobility has significantly decreased.  I am having bilateral leg weakness again and feel so unsteady on my feet.  I am also having bilateral sensation loss in my feet.  Does anyone else have this problem?  I have almost fallen several times. Could be a relapse. Could be CIDP, cannot rule that out. I would definitely seek some treatment as soon as you can. The first few years after GBS, whenever I got sick, my GBS symptoms made a comeback. Talk to your doctor. It might be that you are still recovering, or it might be relapse. Only a medical professional will really know. Fingers crossed for you that it is not too big a set back. So you were diagnosed with GBS in May and you had the vaccine? Which vaccine did you have, if you do not mind me asking? Did you get the vaccine after you had GBS or after? I had GBS when I was ten, fast forward 20 years later and I still experience some muscle weakness etc. IMO, if I were you, I would not have gotten the vaccine regardless of what the CDC advised. My doctor is pushing for me to get vaccinated -he is no longer my PCP. No I got the vaccine as a part of the AstraZeneca trial in November 2020 before I ever had GBS or even knew what it was.  Contracted mono from Epstein Barr  in April, GBS subsequently after in May.  AstraZeneca did a whole study into my GBS and determined it was not caused by the vaccine. Well, I guess that is why they call it \u201cpracticing medicine\u201d. I hope it works out for the best. Covid seems to have caused my GBS so I am not sure. But I went from walking normally to paralyzed in less than 36 hours. Either way, I hgope you get better. I am a doctor of pharmacy. I had the Moderna after I got out of the hospital from covid/GBS. 90 days after my initial diagnosis with covid. I was worried, but I was more worried about getting covid again and spreading it to my family. I do appreciate you concern, and I would not blame anyone for making the call to not get vaccinated in this case. But I do not regret getting the vaccine either.", "3 months into CIDP diagnosis Its been a rough 3 months. Healthy 55-year-old m holding 2 jobs, I suddenly started falling. 8th time it happened, into an aisle of brandy at the store I managed, I went to Dr who got a neurology consult. \n\nAfter many tests, and my increased numbness in my limbs, CIDP was determined. And IVIG started ASAP. 3rd treatment, I felt some better, had some hope. 4th treatment,  week or so later, woke up and numbness worse, could barely walk without a cane. This past weekend I fell and broke a rib, tore some muscles. So looking into walkers this week and physical therapy.  Disability was applied for when diagnosed but takes time. \n\nWent for 5th treatment yesterday,  they increased the amount of IVIG, same low flow rate so it took 6 hours or so. Last nite was crazy, shaking all over, wired, up till 3 nauseated. Today was lots of rest, lots of nausea, shaking stopped at least. I get up feeling great, but down again 10 min later. \n\nHoping for better tomorrow,  I have a lot to do. My mind is sharp and list of household chores is long but body unwilling.  \n\nJust wanting to vent. Thanks for the space to do so.  Wish me luck! \n\n Hang in there. Vent as much and as often as you need. FWIW, IVIG always makes me nauseous. Can you ask your neuro for a Zofran RX to take while you are getting the IVIG? My neuro finally prescribed it for me during my third round and it made a HUGE difference.  Not sure if this is standard for everyone or not. My neurologist always gives Benadryl in my IV before IVIG. Says it helps with side effects (nausea, headache). In the hospital the ivig made me sick as a dog. But doing this I feel noticeably better. \nAnd yes Zofran is a god send as well. \n\n\nDrink tons of water and rest as much as needed! Hang in there You got this I remember IVIG being hell but you got to just take it one session at a time. Stay hydrated and try to keep a positive mindset it might not seem like much but it truly makes the world of difference!  Thanks! Will do, thanks. Had a light breakfast and darn it, nauseated again. Hopefully better later, I have stuff to do!  Thanks, today was better but lost feeling in my feet! Weird. Thanks, ill try that.  Got the dinner served, dishes done and clothes washed. Tomorrow it will be sheets and me! I take care of two adults with autism,  ones my nephew so me being down is a big deal. They can run on autopilot for a day but glad to be back! They did help as much as they can.  Yeah losing feeling in your feet is a totally weird sensation at first. Personally I can walk again but cannot bend my toes or feel cold or hot temperatures. It becomes something to laugh at at some point I promise! Also it amazes friends and family when you can put your bare foot on snow/ ice and not flinch. It will all just come in time and with a good outlook! You are welcome to rant - sometimes you just need to, and we get it! I really hope stuff gets better. Falls can be scary, so thumbs up on getting a walker! Absolutely feel you on the mind being sharp and body unwilling - feels like that is me most days! Look into ankle foot orthotics brace, \"AFO foot brace\". They keep your foot from flopping around.  Go to a podiatrist, who will refer you to an orthotician.\n\nI also used night splints to keep my foot at 90 degrees...  These are soft and do not cause irritation (I tried many) \n\n\n\nAnd get some grab bars for yourself in your bathroom when you get extra fatigued, IT WILL HAPPEN. Listen to your body and do not overdo it. Certainly best of luck! Thanks for sharing. My infusionist gives me Benedril and two ibuprofen.", "Treatment for lasting issues Hello all,\nI was diagnosed with GBS at age 12 back in 2012. I gradually became completely paralyzed in 2 months and was paralyzed for 5 months. I am now 22, my sense of smell, hearing, taste, and touch are all heightened to an uncomfortable amount (kindve like a super power so it is kind of cool). I also have been experiencing tremors in my hands that continuously get exponentially worse with everyday. I played sports and worked out a lot in high school and college, did not seem to help. Also, after continuous writing, or even playing video games back in the day, my hands get extremely fatigued quickly (even writing this). Lastly, I was unable to sleep in my case due to pain all over. I was giving heavy drugs every half hour to an hour to make me sleep through the night. I feel as though this has caused me to develop a sleeping disorder as well. I cannot fall asleep unless I am intoxicated or I lay in bed until 5am. I know the drugs affected me quite a bit because months after I recovered I experienced many withdrawals. All I ask is if anyone has experienced these issues and have any remedies to help it would be much appreciated.", "Intense swelling from GBS? I have been out of the hospital about a week and a half. I am finally able to very slowly move around using a walker. My feet and legs swell and terribly bad especially at night. Does anyone else suffer with swelling during GBS and any suggestions how to treat it? Whenever you lay down put enough pillows under your knees and calves to keep them above your heart. During the day compression socks. I would also tell your doctor next time you goin for follow up and they may prescribe baby aspirin or check for clots Yup - my dad has CIDP and he gets the intense swelling, all of this helps. A recliner that goes really far back can work wonders", "Recovery I am in the recovery stages of my GBS and the last few days I noticed a new development, when I wipe my hands in like a towel for example, my hands feel tingly like pins and needles. It only happens when I wipe them, they are fine otherwise. Does this mean anything? I remember when I seen the neurologist for the first time he asked if my hands were effected, they were not except for a little bit of shaking and he said that that was good. So I am a little nervous about this new development. I found that my recovery was not linear. I got better and then had some set backs along the way. Definitely mention it to your neurologist if you are concerned but hopefully this will be encouraging to you. Ah I believe that is what I had as well. It is called hypersensitivity of the hands. When I would put my hand in a bag of chips, it felt like reaching into a bunch of razor blades. I do not think it means you are not healing. Recovery from GBS is a super slow process, but definitely bring it up with your neurologist since you are concerned. Maybe your hands had lower sensitivity and now are regaining what was lost. Maybe you have been using your hands more? Maybe seasonal temperature changes / less blood flow.\n\nLike Cousinjoe05 said, mention it to your doctor for sure. \n\nI had had a nearly complete loss of motor function (all but eyes), and when I was recovering the increased sensitivity fluctuated and seemed to shift around to different parts of my body. That or my focus shifted to different parts of my body.", "Dealing with pain and soreness from being in bed Hi everyone my father was recently diagnosed with guillain barre he seems to be recovering quickly but we are currently dealing with constant back pain and soreness from being in bed all day. Can I ask how you dealt with the pain or any other tips for caring for a loved one with guillain barre. How long since he was diagnosed? Can he stand up? I spent one month in the hospital, with those pains. Once I left it and started rehabilitation, everything went better. \n\nI hope he goes better soon. Best wishes. Lots and lots of pillows and adjusting myself in a seated position, even at night unfortunately. I had multiple pillows behind my back and head, on each my sides and underneath my arms, in between my thighs, underneath my knees, and two or three from the end of the bed to the soles of my feet to maintain my feet in a flexed position.\n\nAlso, if you are able to massage him, Tiger balm was very soothing for me. However, I was not able to regulate my temperature and could not have blankets or covers afterwards or I would have horrible sweats. Deep blue and arnica oil are also good options.\n\nIn addition to massages, having someone stretch my limbs/muscles was painful in the moment but alleviated a lot of back pain, especially hip and hamstring stretches. \n\nStretching and massaging feet, toes, and ankles was also super painful but very helpful in decreasing pain in the long run. \n\nI am sorry your father is experiencing so much pain. I hope he is able to get out of bed soon! Once he is, I would recommend signing him up for aqua aerobics, it is a very gentle way to build up the muscle he will have lost. Good luck! Change positions at least every hour or two. Get a waffle cushion to relieve pressure when sitting or laying. Try taking neurontin or Lyrica to ease some of the pain Help him change positions every few hours -- from his back, to the side, to the other side, and even on his stomach (if he can bare it; also double-check with the doctors if he is allowed to be on his stomach). Awesome even if he can change positions on his own. When I was recovering, I did have a chair on either side of my bed to prevent me from rolling off the bed though. \n\nAlso, if possible, have him move to a chair at least once a day. If you have it and if there is enough room in the house, have him transfer to a wheelchair and have him slowly wheel around the house. Slowly wheeling yourself around helps build up arm strength. Also gives him a little bit of freedom. Or if there is is not a lot of room, just having him hang out in the kitchen in a wheelchair is a nice change of pace from being in bed. If he has issues sitting up on his own, I think there are seatbelts that you can put in a wheelchair. Having the leg rests in the wheelchair also helps keep the person steady in the chair. \n\nAnd also PILLOWS. ALL THE PILLOWS. \n\nAlso, would double-check with the doctor before massaging his legs. In my case, I had blood clots from being bedridden (was never given preventative care for it), and I was not allowed to get my legs massaged. Get a memory foam egg crate style cover for the bed. Make sure there is no wrinkles in the sheets. \nLike everyone else said, be sure he moves often. He was diagnosed about a month ago. He was transferee to a nursing facility but we had to take him home because he was being neglected. He is about to start in home therapy. Thank you for your reply. Thank you for your reply. I just bought a lot of pillows for him.  I give him massages about twice a day. They seem to help and I am seeing small improvements in mobility. I think his back is cramped up and need a deeper massage. But I am really nervous about it. Thank you for your reply. We got him a recliner. That allows him to sit and lay down we he chooses. It seems to help a bit. Thank you for your reply. We are working on him being able to use a wheelchair. Hopefully soon. I was diagnosed three months ago. One month in hospital (3 weeks in ICU), one month in a rehab facility, one month at home. A week after the symptoms started I was paralyzed from neck to toes. \n\nNow I can dona normal life, with some caveats, such as neural pain in hands and feet, muscular weakness and continuous tiredness, but I am improving on those fields. \n\nPatience, continuous and hard rehab work is all he needs. Best wishes! You are welcome. \n\nI am sad to read that he was being neglected in the nursing home. The same thing happened to me so I left. They need to reform the standards and practices at facilities nationwide. I hope he is doing better at home.", "Referred after two years of not getting better ", "(CIDP) Questions and concerns about symptoms. M/29/160lbs I had a GI issue in late September, started having peripheral neuropathy and gait abnormality a couple weeks later. I was convinced I had some kind of nerve impingement, until I had an appointment with my PCP on 11/2 and she sent me to the ER for GBS(which I had read about and written off). Basically after a lumbar puncture and a 3 hour long MRI, I was admitted and got 3 days of IVIG(Gammunex). The IVIG gave me headaches, and I vomited twice at the hospital. The neurology team I talked to seemed very positive about my prognosis and were confident that I had a mild case.\n\nAt that point I was only having pins and needles/numb sensation from my ankles down and in my hands, maybe a little up my shins. I cannot say I have noticed improvement in symptoms since the treatment. I did not take the Gabapentin I was prescribed after leaving the hospital, that could have contributed to my next week which was terrible with migraines and nausea. The headache was so bad that I went to the ER, I believe they gave me Dexamethasone, which helped for a couple of days I think. I also took the Gabapentin again for a about a week, and I have been off of it for a bit over a week now. Unfortunately, I also got very constipated from resting/dehydration and developed some bad hemorrhoids.\n\nI had an EMG on 11/17, where the doctor diagnosed me with CIDP. I felt very stiff and \u201csore\u201d the following day, and that never really went away. I have wild sensations up my legs to my knees, even smooth surfaces, and hands can feel sharp on the bottoms of my feet. My hands feel very tight or stiff through my wrists and elbows up to the sides of my neck. l am experiencing pretty consistent vision issues. I am unsure about what I am feeling, what is the disease and what is a side effect? What does a healing nerve feel like? What does high inflammation feel like? Spinal cord thickening? When should I be concerned?\n\nThe worst thing about this is that I do not really have a neurologist I trust or have communication with. I know I am probably leaving out a lot of details. I have been learning a lot from this forum, it is a good resource. I am just looking for some wisdom and maybe some guidance. I know it can take 6 weeks to feel benefits from IVIG, I just want to know if it makes sense to feel this bad at this point. Thanks for reading.\n\n\nP.s. I can walk around the house okay, but wearing shoes and walking outside successfully is a real struggle, cane should be here tomorrow.\n\nP.p.s. I am taking some supplements\n\n\t-Lion\u2019s Mane mushroom 1000mg \n\t-Liquid coQ10 15ml\n\t-Fish oil caps\n\t-L-Theanine 200mg\n\t-Turmeric, collagen, glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM blend\n\t-Alpha Lipoic Acid 250mg Hey I have CIDP and just wanted to welcome you to message me about trying to figure out paresthesia. I have a great neurologist fortunately. I am sorry you are going through so much and I cannot reply at length right now but wanted you to know I am thinking of you :) Hi I cant speak directly to your symptoms but my dad was recently diagnosed with CIDP. I linked up with  organization and was able to talk with several people who are living with CIDP. \n\nIt is a bewildering experience and I am sorry you are going through this. I hope the IVIG helps and you see improvement quickly. Hey I am also kind of in the same boat as you ..Still waiting for my ivig, I can walk around barefoot ok, but wearing shoes just makes me so uncertain about where my feet are going. I have all the other neuropathy symptoms as well, burning sensation, numbness. All this started about a month and half ago and I went from active and running long distances to not even having the confidence to go to gym. I truly hope the ivig works for you but even if it does not work with your neurologist to check if there are other causes for this neuropathy - sometimes vitamin deficiency, hypothyroidism, celiac etc can cause the same symptoms. We have rules out a host of other causes in my case so far and the wait is endless. Praying for you and we are too young to be going through this :( If at all possible please find another neurologist. The sooner you can get ongoing treatment the better. Check out Centers of Excellence for GBS/CIDP. Thank you, that is nice. ;)", "Hospitalized overnight, doctors not sure if GBS Hi, \n\nI was hospitalized this week because on Monday I started having extreme pain, weakness, numbness, and tingling in my legs and feet, and now extreme shooting pain (feels like nerve pain)and pins/needles in both hands and thighs. It is much worse in evenings but I am having a ton of trouble walking at all times, I feel very weak and have a lot of cramps/charley horses in my legs so my walking and balance feels very unsteady. I cannot drive because pushing down on the gas pedal hurts immensely and it is hard to feel my feet. \n\nI have recently recovered from an Epstein-Barr infection and am also experiencing urinary retention. \n\nMy brain and spinal MRIs and bloodwork were normal, neurologist said he does not recommend a spinal puncture at this time because it will make my severe headaches worse, and my reflexes are very reactive/normal which does not happen with GBS. \n\nShould I still be worried? I am freaking myself out by googling too much. Would I be getting worse by the day if it is GBS/at what point should I go back into the ER if needed? I have been having a bunch of other health issues before this, and he threw around the possibility of atypical MS or peripheral neuropathy but I do not know why that would come on so suddenly. \n\nI am supposed to follow up with a neurologist but they cannot see me until end of January. I have been on gabapentin 3x a day for awhile now before this so that is not helping whatever this is. \n\nThanks for any insight, much appreciated. I mean this sounds like typical GBS. Anyway you can get to see a neurologist sooner? They are your best chance at a diagnosis.\n\nMy spinal was normal but nerve conduction tests showed neuropathy. Thanks for the response. Yeah, this was the soonest they would get me in\u2026they originally said no openings until April, but that they asked him and he would \u201csqueeze me in\u201d in January since he is so busy\u2026 Are you in a hospital that has a neurologist on staff? I went to the ER the admitted me and I saw a neuro 8 am the next morning. Trust me its worth making a stink about...even changing hospitals if that what it takes.\n\nAlso dont let the headaches get in the way of treatment. Not everyone gets headaches from spinals. I had no issues. If you do get a diagnosis they need to start you on treatment asap. The sooner you get treatment the less damage you can end up having to recover from. Yes, I saw the neurologist on staff in the hospital. He saw me the morning after they admitted me. He said he does not think it is GBS because my reflexes are very reactive. They discharged me. So mine were fine at 8 am and by 6 pm I lost all my reflex's and could not walk. Are they reassessing your reflex's every so often? I was having mine checked every day or so. They discharged me, so they only checked my reflexes twice while I was there. The neuro on staff said it is very progressive so I wonder why I can still sort of walk at this point if so. They were understandably very short staffed and busy and there was a big lack of follow up instructions/did not tell me what to do next or when to come back if worse. The first time I was admitted it was for bilateral facial paralysis and some weakness. I could still walk but they still admitted me for a week of IVIG. Granted, this was after a lumbar puncture and my protein count being astronomical. \n\nIf I were you I would see if you can get an LP. That way you can confirm and start treatment sooner rather than later, if needed. Did you recently have the covid vaccine?  The same thing happened to me after Pfizer vaccine. I had the Moderna booster 2 weeks ago I was diagnosed with GBS, but yours may not be GBS, by neurologist, but have not received treatment.  He said all three vaccines are causing this.  Because I can walk, ER would not admit me.  A lot of other people are experiencing similar symptoms. Hopefully yours subside soon.  There is a website called VEDA which has a forum with people discussing the numbness and tingling they have been experiencing since vaccine.  Some people start to feel better over months. Do you have reflexes? (Knee, elbow)? The lack thereof was a major sign for me The mRNA vaccines do have far lower incidence compared to the viral vector vaccines and still have a favourable safety profile given the risk of GBS due to COVID itself.\n\nBut all of the COVID vaccines and COVID itself can trigger the illness in rare cases since the mechanism is B-cell cocapture of the foreign antigens (such as the spike protein) bound to sialic acid containing self-antigens (typically gangliosides). /u/Feyre24 I hope you are well, I am wondering if you could follow-up? Has this resolved itself or been diagnosed with something different we should know about?\n\nAlso, I find that /r/AskDocs can be very helpful for generating alternative hypothesis regarding diagnosis or treatment Hi, thanks for checking. It has not resolved sadly, going to see the neurologist in two weeks. I still have reflexes. I wish you the absolute best on this. Thank you! \ud83d\udc9c", "History of GBS - should I get the Covid booster? I am a 36 year old woman with a history of a GBS variant, Miller Fisher syndrome when I was 13. I was hospitalized for a week with paralysis in my left eye and most of my body briefly. I was able to walk again after several days, but had to wear an eye patch for 3 months while my eye recovered from paralysis (it turned inward and I could not see right). \n\nI have never had an official recurrence, but had some scares and weakness in the eye that was paralyzed over the years. I have not deal with anything particularly recent, but I recently found out I cannot have the flu shot with this history. I had a bad reaction to it the last time I took it (very very long time ago) and wanted to try and be more responsible only to find out that my doctor told me I cannot take it due to risk of triggering recurrence.\n\nAnyway... I had both Pfizer shots last spring and was planning on getting a booster, but the questionnaire asked about GBS history this time. This was not mentioned on anything during the initial vaccinations, but I did disclose this to the site volunteers asking about health history along with endometriosis, adenomyosis (not sure if there is any relevance, but wanted to include). I had no major reactions to the Pfizer vaccine aside from the \"omg my arm\" pain.\n\nHas anyone else with GBS history taken the booster? Think it is worth it? If you did not have a reaction to the first two doses you should probably be fine. I had Miller Fisher in 2019 and got Pfizer with no problems. I plan on getting the booster ASAP. I would ask your doctor specifically about the booster still. I had a very similar disease course, down to being 13 at diagnosis, and received my Pfizer booster 3 weeks ago with no issues. I had GBS 24 years ago and I do not know that I have had any recurrence of GBS since then, I do feel like either GBS or age has made it really difficult for me to run. Still feels like I am running in slow motion, barely running at all.\n\nMy experience was an onset of GBS that took about six weeks of increasing back pain and numbness, then a week in the hospital mostly paralyzed, including my face, but with 4 huge IVs of gamma globulin, back walking five days later, and mostly recovered after 3 months\n\nSo I got the booster last Friday afternoon (overall, three shots of Pfizer) and my immediate experience was:\n\n+ late Friday night onset of headache\n+ Friday night, could not get warm in bed, slept with electric mattress pad pretty much on high, however, no fever at all. Just cold... and slept fitfully for about six hours\n+ Saturday morning &amp; afternoon, did not feel great, just a mild/moderate headache and no energy to do much other than surf the web\n+ Saturday evening, feeling pretty good, really\n+ Went to bed at 10pm (sigh, rather for me)\n+ Woke up at 2am, watched some TV, fell back to sleep at 4am, \n+ Woke up at 11am, got out of bed, dragged a comb across my head... I would not. It seems your risk (from reoccurence of GBS) is greater than your potential risk from COVID (but of course, that is\u2019t considering whether you need the booster for employment, to protect vulnerable family members, etc) Get the mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna). Many thousands of us have been vaccinated, and the booster gave myself the same symptoms as shot #2. I had a terrible headache and some pins and needles for a few days. \n\n\nI will always be nervous about shots, but taking the COVID shot and boosters are a no-brainer at this point.Literally Billions have been vaccinated.  The risk of COVID to my family and community outweighs my self concern. I received both doses of Pfizer and I was perfectly fine. My GBS was just last year and I am actually still recovering. The booster is just another dose at least that is my understanding.", "Am I being overly worried? I got the JnJ vaccine against my personal beliefs last Thursday and I was sicker than I have ever felt for the next 36 hours. I felt great all day Saturday but started to feel a numb tingling sensation in my left arm and bottoms of my feet on Sunday. I know that statistically it is a very low likelihood that these are the beginning symptoms of GBS but I cannot help worrying that this is leading somewhere incredibly scary. I do not have any weakness as of right now so I do not know if I would just be bounced around the ED and sent home. Anyone who has survived this awful disease would you mind sharing what you would do in my shoes? I got GBS from AstraZeneca and I was in the same spot you were. The key is progression and weakness. When I showed up with numbness and trouble walking they sent me home and said if the weakness gets worse to come back. 12 hours later I could barely walk. I was admitted then. Keep an eye on your symptoms. If they worsen within the next 24 hours, go to the emergency room. Mention your concerns about Guillain-Barre specifically. It is entirely possible that you will be sent home, especially since so many ERs are flooded with Covid patients right now. \n\nIt seems like even before Covid, every GBS story I have seen here starts with going to the emergency room and being sent home only to be back within a day or two. I know mine did. Just do not be afraid to go back. Ask for a lumbar puncture to confirm or rule out GBS. If he keeps going seek care immediately I waited 5 months before I went to the hospital because I thought it was a sports injury for my cidp ,if it is not getting better do not wait. The longer you wait is another year, months  or weeks of progress you will have to do again. When i had GBS i felt very tired and could not focus on work, i noticed my legs were falling asleep while i was just sitting on my couch. I thought nothing of it really, until one day i collapsed in the shower and lost all feeling in my feet and legs. With GBS i do not believe you can be overly worried, definitely et checked out before it gets worse.\nEdit to add i was diagnosed about a year ago before i had gotten the vaccine. Has there been any progression with the numbness? I believe the key of GB is that the numbness is usually symmetrical. \nAny issues swallowing or talking? \nI would say go to the ER while you still can, bc I waited too long and basically wobbled myself over to a hospital when I could barely walk anymore. No I still just have tingling in the bottoms of my feet, my hands, some slight soreness behind my knees but no weakness anywhere and no trouble seeing, talking, swallowing or anything crazy like that And the tingling/ numbness has not gone away since Sunday? \nI mean, I really want to believe that it is not GBS but I would say keep a close eye on anything that changes within a couple days. Drink plenty of fluids and get those nutrients in your body!! \n\nI can give you a full breakdown of the timeline of what happened to me, but I do not want to scare you either. I would definitely keep a close eye on that. If the symptoms start to get any worse at all, definitely get into the ER and mention GBS. \n\nI was lucky, and my ER doc figured out what I had. As another user mentioned, ask for a lumbar puncture. I would not mind hearing that despite how scary it will certainly sound... I just want to hear as many of these stories as possible so I know what to really look out for. I guess the only other thing I have not mentioned is I feel like I am in kind of a brain fog but I have not slept well the past 3 days either. i will dm you then! Would it be okay to share here or with me too, your timeline.\n\nI am experiencing the same as OP post vaccine. Of course, I am sorry to hear that. I will dm you.", "GBS Again? I had a moderate episode of GBS seven years ago, it progressed quickly, about five days from first symptoms to hospitalization, weakness/paralysis of face and body, but no respirator. I was in the hospital for almost two weeks, then off work for another two weeks, rehabilitated quickly. \nI do not know if I am paranoid, but I feel tingling in my hands and now face for the past few days. I have not been vaccinated (covid, flu or other for years). Was slightly sick several weeks ago (cold). Terrified of it developing again. Anyone had it twice? Am still in recovery but i would suggest you go to the doctor's to double check to be on the safe side How was your firsts symptoms? Severe headaches? And they found the cause of the gbs? I did have very bad headaches, but I seem to remember it being more due to the treatment? They never found a definitive cause, just guessed it was the cold I had several weeks before Ooh ok, i am passing for a very rare case, in 2018 i met a girl on badoo. she pass me a infection but the exams are all negatives, i think can be a bacteria o something but i remember i came to my house the same day and i had night sweats and anxiety, my life never be the same from that moment but i was still grateful wit life. but the problem was two year later when i had a bad migraine and memory problems now im devasted, may be some days can i look normal but i know i have a infection wit no treatment and im too young, 21 yrs old and all my life was healthy but i do not know, that is the destiny? fuck i know i have a mild neuropathy.;( a lot pain in my heart \ud83d\udc94", "what the heck is wrong w my feet !! ", "Advice needed: Does anyone have any knowledge or experience with (about 4 months) slow progressing symptoms? Background: After a sinus infection (in March) and a round of antibiotics, experienced fatigue, random dizziness and bloodwork was done. (Also background - had a TSH level (thyroid) of 5.24 and started and stopped levothyroxine since fatigue did not diminish with it). Iron was low and now taking iron supplements.\n\nHave been monitoring symptoms and got a telephone appointment with a GI Specialist and waiting to do bloodwork again. GI Dr. said that I should keep monitoring my symptoms which are: head sensation (heaviness sometimes when standing), leg muscle weakness (after showering), tightness in legs when standing up/walking and random dizziness. For the past week and a half,  the symptoms seem to have progressed to my hands when I brush my teeth (hands feel weaker) and still have the leg (calves) tightness when standing and walking. The fatigue has lessened but having an odd sensation in my limbs (calves, hands) where it is not \u201cpins and needles\u201d but an awareness of a \u201cbuzz\u201d sensation. While resting on the couch,etc, I feel relatively normal but there is the awareness of the odd sensation in my limbs,hands from time to time. I have had the leg muscle weakness for months and my GP was more concerned with the fatigue and I am currently waiting to do a Holter monitor test (heart test). I have recently done my own research and came across this illness. \n\nSpoke with the GI Dr. on Friday who said that if the symptoms persist I could go to the ER. In the first televisit, the Dr. told me it could be BPPV (vertigo) but he was confused and since he could not see me, was more into ordering more tests. This is all rather confusing and I am concerned about COVID exposure in the ER (have not left house since March). Does anyone have any knowledge or experience with slow symptoms of GBS? Any advice appreciated. I got it back in 2010, I was sick with flu like symptoms for a week, then the tingling  in feet and hands, very weak, went to 3 emergency  rooms in 3 days by 3rd day could not walk ,doc did a spinal tap and said it may be gbs, spent 1 week in icu, got to my lungs had trouble breathing\nHospital took full advantage of ins took every test they could think of.went to rehab, could walk alone 3 months after.\nIt can effects all you muscles\nRemember your hearts a muscle.\nI hope you will be alright. Thanks for those details and glad you are better now. Was the tingling like pins and needles or was it more subtle? Your symptoms were quick. Did you get actual numbness as well where you could not feel your legs (and is that when you could not walk?) Yes it was numbness, by the time I could not walk. But a lot of pain due to the muscle spasms . With the numbness - was it where you could not feel your legs and feel any sensation when your legs were touched? GBS is not that slow unless it is a chronic issue. How are you doing now? Had no feeling by the time it reached where I was having trouble breathing Yes Still similar issues. Doctors are still confused and calling it \u201cpost viral\u201c because of the sinus infection. Waiting to do an MRI.", "I want to vent out. So I vented out on r/vent &amp; someone said I did not have the right to vent out about covid if I have not been vaccinated (they deleted the comment). So I spoke out about having GBS and that I cannot take vaccines especially if my doctors said no. It is just sad people do not understand ", "Brief informative rant on GBS Copied from my comment on /all where someone else mentioned GBS. I got kind of educational.\n\nGBS? 33, had it when I was 5, last 2 weeks I have been barely able to leave bed and have shooting pains in arms and legs. Fearing relapse or residuals. \n\nThe scariest thing about GBS is how little is known. They do not know the source - it is called an autoimmune syndrome because we only know the tertiary effects. What happens is that your body somehow thinks the protein around your nerves (myelin) is bad and undergoes demyelination where your own immube system attacks the protein around your nerves. This is painful, feeling your own body die, and leaves you with varying degrees of immobility, ranging from clumsiness and weakness to full paralysis which requires a ventilator because the body is too weak to even breathe unassisted.\n\nDiagnosis is a matter of excluding OTHER potential causes combined with a spinal tap to measure proteins. This is all painful, exhausting and nerve wracking (pardon the pun).\n\nRecovery can be quick (3-6 months) or take years and many patients have residuals effects throughout their life as they have had massive nerve damage. Treatment is not fun - plasmapheresis (blood is taken out, cleaned and pumped back in) and IVIG (infusion, kind of like the process of chemo). Other than that, there is not much to do other than make sure you do not die when weak. Time is the biggest healer.\n\nEven if you heal well, it is advised to avoid blood donations (for the sake of others, this one is up to each blood bank) and flu shots - since GBS almost always manifests after some sickness, even though the cause is unknown, avoiding being sick obviously helps and flu shots basically make you weakly sick. GBS got a bit of coverage with Zika but Epstein Barr (Mononucleosis, herpes) has a higher correlation. \n\nAgain to hammer home how little we know: in 1989 when I was diagnosed, we were told the rate of relapse was just as rare as getting it again, less than .01% chance. Nowadays with longer term studies and more research the known relapse rate is up to 5%.\n\nIt is a very scary condition to have had because it impacts my life to this day but the why, how and full extent is not known. Every time I am sick or feel weak, I have fears of a relapse.", "Hi all, did any1 try a vegan diet for cidp?  Yes people have tried it and no, it did not make any difference. How long did u try it for? Idk if u have heard of no egg craig .. cidp patient who is now off treatment thanks to vegan diet.. \nAnd since im ready to try anything ive been vegan for a week now .. still can feel anything and i still wake up with my fingers numb.. i have my ivig treatment on Friday..  i am hoping that the diet would support the ivig at least prolong the time between treatments \u2026 im at every 3 weeks and by the end of week 2 i feel like the attacks started \ud83d\ude13 I never had CIDP, I am talking on behalf of the few people I know with it. Yes, it can be helpful if you eat the right vegan foods. I eat organic Whole Foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and some grains.   \nStay away from the processed vegan foods. They taste great but are not any healthier for you.   \nI also recommend to stay far away from gluten. Gluten is horrible if you have issues with neuropathy and inflammation.   \n\n\nI know people that say a vegan diet did not help them. But they were eating vegan pizza, impossible burgers, and all of the vegan junk food.", "Our son's GBS+COVID story... ", "Meningitis vaccine? Does anyone know if it is safe to receive the meningitis vaccine if you have a history of GBS? I have GBS in 2009 after a lot of strep throat I do not think there is a problem. I take every vaccination necessary (e. g. Yellow Fever and Covid) except flue and never had a problem.", "Family member passed away a few weeks after getting GBS She got the flu shot, paralyzed the next day with trouble swallowing, neurological functions we like she had dementia, could still talk to a degree but memory was bad. 2 days later fever of 101-102 EMT took her to the hospital. They blamed cowvid of course like they do with most things as the Dr and hospital are in the same network.  In the hospital on oxygen &amp; meds for about a week. Released at families house temporarily as they wont allow visits anywhere which is extremely evil.\n\nStays in bed the entire time around 10 days, barely ate, has to change diapers, clean,  then one day the family saw her breathing really fast, charcoal black stool, then heart rate dropped so fast that if the EMTS did not show up in 30secs or so they would probably would have passed. Put her on oxygen, intubated in hospital, kidneys failing, blood pressure dropping, passed away next day.  Sadly the next day her family were going to send her to a facility for a month in order to do psychical &amp; speech therapy as they could not did in the home due to no room to work.  \n\n\nI was less than 3 weeks new to this GBS to try and help a family understand. We put the pieces of this GBS puzzle together as the Dr's would not even mention it was a possibility even tho it was 100% obvious it was GBS. All this happened so fast Im still in shock. To think that person would still be here if they had not taken that got dam fluu shot is one of the hardest things to process. An avoidable situation that lead to suffering  &amp; death. Some days I still feel like I am in a nightmare.   \n\n\nStill trying to find answers as none of the Dr's, nurses or EMT's listen. They all say rowna this, rowna that to EVRERYTHING, as if they refuse to tie the vaxx to what happened. Thankfully the home nurse treated a lot of GBS patients from the vaxxx. He diagnosed her with GBS as she had all the symptoms. One day you are walking, talking, driving, going to the bathroom solo. To the next day all that ceases to exsist all from a shot.  \n\n\nIm trying to find some closure as to what exactly happened that lead to her death. Some days I feel guilty that there was more I could have to done to possibly avoid this. A poster here recently mentioned dysautonomia from GBS. Did some digging on it which lead to some possibility that maybe that might have played a role in her heart function. Again Im just speculating here.   \n\n\nMy curiosity into the fluu shot lead me to dig into the vaers database to compare deaths from previous years as I saw enough articles of people saying they received the rowna vaxx instead of the fluu shot \"by accident\". Too many coincidences so I become suspicious. What I found was an eye opener. From 2017-2020 on average 105-120 died from the fluu shot. As of a couple days ago 2021 showed almost 96,000 deaths. That Is over 800 times more deaths ever. Something very suspicious is going on. Cause this month alone I know of 2 deaths from the rowna vaxxx, 1 with GBS &amp; 1 death from the fluu shot in my circle of peopel.   \n\n\nI just want to know what is going on. Im frustrated cause the Dr's are evil. They wont listen &amp; act like we dont know what we are talking about. My mind is all over the place. This medical system is so corrupt that good luck getting proper care by someone who actually knows what they are doing, let alone work from the heart with your best intentions in mind. I am sorry for your loss.  Lost my mom in 2003, to Miller fisher syndrome, a variant of GBS. She got sick after getting the flu shot and died three weeks later. She did not get sick right away. I think she got sick about a week after the flu shot.", "GBS and vaccines I have noticed an influx in posts from people who is developed this from vaccines - it is, unfortunately, a very rare side effect. Because GBS is still a bit of a mystery, anything which affects the immune system can be a potential trigger. \n\nI want to open discussion up to experiences about GBS in relation to vaccine reactions - however discussion should also bear in mind that vaccines *as a whole* are medically and scientifically sound. Outliers exist and we are unfortunately among them. This community supports the science behind vaccines while acknowledging there are rare edge cases and any extremely unscientific discussions will be pruned. Please be sensitive and understanding in discussion.\n\nIf you have had a vaccine response which has led you here, please feel free to share your story. The more details you can provide, the better you will help in creating a repository of experience for future survivors to lean on. I do not know if my case was related to  vaccine. \n\nI caught covid on April 4, got the first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine in May. \nI had a stomach infection and fever on 7-10 August\nthen felt weakness in my hands and feet starting 20th August. Could not walk by 23rd Aug and was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with GBS.\n\nDischarged a week later after 240g of IVIG and I am able to walk for 5 minutes now without too much discomfort.  I first developed GBS a week after a flu shot when I was in college. Since then no medical professional I have seen has recommended any vaccine. The second time I developed GBS was after a course of amoxicillin. So same thing, no recommendations for antibiotics unless it is a serious infection.\n\nOur of curiosity last week I asked a neurologist what their opinion would be. Doc asked me about my history, how soon I developed it after the shot, and how bad it was.\n\nI got the vaccine on a Wednesday. It was the next Tuesday when my left eyelid got weak (seemed to be a twitch at first), Wednesday my tingling began with late Wednesday night being the first signs of weakness,  and Thursday I had facial paralysis and limb numbness and trouble walking, and that is when I was admitted and almost immediately put into ICU. The symptoms I had did get a little worse while in the hospital but my breathing ended up being stable, maybe because they started plasma exchange as soon as they could which was late Friday. I think I left ICU for regular observation on Tuesday or Wednesday, and discharged by Friday when they determined it has peaked and was not going to get weeks. Then a month of physical therapy before getting back to functional on my own.\n\nThe second time I developed it, I recognized my eyelid as soon as it started and told my dad to take me to the hospital immediately, got IVIG started within a day. I did get weakness and facial paralysis again but never needed ICU, got discharged in 5 days, and was back to full strength within a couple of weeks. \n\nThe doc i talked to last week said that no one in the world is in a position to recommend me one way or another because there just is not enough data, since GBS is rare enough in the first place and a vaccine reaction is even rarer. His personal opinion is that I should not get a shot, or if I do want to get one then wait six months or more for more data. He said it is good that I work remote and to avoid covid as best I can, but I remember him also saying that there may never be enough data. \n\nWhich makes sense to me. I do not have any medical background but if it is possible that GBS is an individual issue that has triggers then it could be that vaccine or antibiotics are simply my potential triggers and that does not apply for other people who have different triggers. I know I have had food poisoning a couple of years after each episode of GBS, but my actual episodes of GBS had nothing to do with any gastrointestinal issues. So the risk may be specific to the individual.\n\nMy GBS followed a vaccine so I am currently unvaccinated. Since I can largely control my exposure to other people (like grocery delivery, only meeting people outdoors, no traveling) I will likely not get vaccinated and wait out Covid until early next year. Which sucks, I would like to go visit family. I did go visit once a few weeks before this current surge back when covid spread was not nearly as bad.\n\nMy family became very anti vax after what happened to me. But I told my parents I would never visit them unless they got vaccinated since I refuse to be responsible for giving them covid under any circumstance, so they both got their shots as soon as eligible. My sister remains a covid denier despite getting it herself and going to the ER when she had it (did not need admission in the end). My brother and sister in law are not vaccinated to my knowledge, but my sister in law is pregnant and due in a month.\n\nPlus that doc discussion was just a phone call, not a local neurologist. So I may want to set up an appointment just to establish with someone here and maybe get a more concrete letter saying I should not get vaccinated and to continue work from home, just in case my job wants a vaccine mandate.\n\nI support the idea of mandates and I think everyone who has not had a history of issues with vaccines should get them. There should be exemptions for legitimate medical reasons of course but that is it. And I do not expect I will go back to pre pandemic behaviors until next year. I miss going to the movie theater and getting a huge pretzel. Hello. I am not sure if this is a vaccine response in your regard, but I tried to get the vaccine at a local CVS. (Oh,sorry I have GBS/AIDP) I had the pharmacist ask the paperwork questions because I  cannot feel my hands and cannot write. The last question is \u201cdo you have GBS?\u201d \nSo, in short, she refused to give me the first shot and asked me to consult my doctor who then referred me to ask my neurologist if I should get the shot who I have not yet.\nBasically, is it ok to get the vaccine. I certainly do not want to backslide. I have had GBS for 5 months now. I have relearned walking and now have some dexterity back. I just cannot feel anything from my elbows down and from my knees down. I got the Janssen vaccine. Had GBS over 15 years ago. Had little to no side effects. Back when I got GBS, they had told me not to get a flu vaccine and this has been reiterated to me by a few doctors since then. I ended up reading up on the latest info last winter and it seems like there is a lot better research on it since when i first had GBS. I felt comfortable getting the flu vaccine after reading up on the NIH and CDC websites. Had no issue with the flu vaccine either. I got GBS in March of this year while I was in Nepal studying abroad. I got it after a course of amoxicillin as well. I did not go into the hospital until I was fully paralyzed because I just thought I was getting the flu and feeling weak. I literally slept all day and the next day could not even get out of bed. \n\nAfter a month in that hospital I flew back to US and was put in a hospital here so I could start rehab. I had a rough recovery being intubated and getting tracheotomy, pneumonia and all the good stuff. But while in the hospital in the US I received the covid vaccine. The infectious disease doctors recommended that I get it, but told me I should stay away from the flu vaccines.  Because the makeups are completely different with them. \n\nAfter two months in the hospital. I was discharged. I started being able to walk early august. Now I am just getting prepared to go back to Nepal. Is there a vaccine exemption for people with GBS? I developed GBS four weeks after receiving the Flu Vaccine.  I was in the hospital three months with full paralysis, vent/trach and my heart stopping twice.  I am now walking but have numbness in my lower legs and feet.  My neurologist has advised to avoid the flu vaccine but encouraged me to get the Pfizer or Moderna Covid Vaccine but to avoid the J&amp;J Vaccine.  When friends and family ask if I promote vaccines, my response is ABSOLUTELY.  All medicine can have an adverse reaction but the benefits far outweigh the odds of developing a rare reaction.\n\nI follow the advice of my neurologist, internist and try to stay up to date on CDC findings as well as what the GBS/CIDP Society suggests. My husband has CIDP (the chronic version of GBS). He was concerned about taking the vaccine in case it triggered a relapse, and at the time he was considering it his neurologists had no data to share, but ultimately he felt getting Covid would cause far more harm. He got the vaccine (Pfizer) and had no side effects. It helped enormously with the anxiety he was experiencing over the pandemic.\n\nETA: his condition was triggered by food poisoning", "My story It was 4 years ago. I was 27 at the time. \nI had an extremely severe respiratory virus before I experienced symptoms. I could barely swallow, and when I coughed my throat and chest hurt so badly that I would almost pass out. \nI did not go to the doctor because I assumed it would go away. (I do not like going to the doctor, and I feel like it is my fault I got gbs. )\nIt lasted for about a week and then went away. \n\nThen a few days later I noticed weakness in my left hand. I had a hard time putting my hair up in a ponytail because my hand was weak. \nMy now husband said everything was probably fine, and I assumed it would just go away. \nThe next day I noticed weakness in my thighs, and I could barely walk up a few stairs. I started crying and I did not know what to do. \nMy hands started tingling and got numb. My thighs were also tingling.  The tingling went up my arms. It was very scary. \n\nI ignored it because again I assumed I would get better. \nIt progressively got worse over the next couple days. I struggled to get out of the car, and walk up curbs. \nOne day as I was trying to get into my house ( up 3 stairs) I could not get up, and tried to crawl up the stairs. The stairs are made of concrete, so crawling was extremely painful and I could not crawl anyway. \nMy mom called 911 to help get me in the house. If I remember correctly, it might have happened twice. When the EMTS helped me in the house they used my belt hooks to hold me up. While they helped me, I remember thinking that with their help walking felt as easy as it usually felt. \n\n\n\nThat night I was sitting on the couch, and I could not get up. I tried rocking side to side to get up, but it did not work. My thighs were so weak\nI called 911, and started crying hysterically. \nThe EMTs were extremely dismissive. They asked why I was crying, and when I explained that I could not get up they still did not take me seriously. \n At the hospital they did a CT scan and then had me walk around the nurses station, then gave me flexeril and sent me home.  My mom was extremely angry that they sent me home. \n\n\nI still held out hope that it would get better. A day later I was much worse. I was on the couch and it took 15-20 minutes of rocking back and forth to get up. I was sweating so bad it was as if I would worked out. I had to go to the bathroom extremely bad. I finally got up and walked around the room. I thought maybe my walking was getting better. I went to the bathroom and got stuck on the toilet seat for a long time until I used the sink to pull myself up. \n\nI walked into my bedroom and fell to the ground. My brother could not lift me up and I had to call 911. My legs were so weak I could not move. I remember thinking  it is like that commercial where someone says they have fallen and they cannot get up. \n\nThey got there and asked me what medication I was on. I informed them I was on methadone, so they treated me like I was just going to the hospital to get pain medication. The EMT who I told was not very nice after he found out that I was on MMT. They took me out of the house on a chair type device. \n\nIn the ER I had to go to the bathroom. A nurse had to help me. I could not use my right hand because it was almost paralyzed. My left was still somewhat working, but it was still extremely weak. \n\nI was alone at the ER, because everyone was at work. \nThe ER doctor asked me if I would had a cold recently, and I think she might have mentioned gbs. I cannot remember. \n\nI was given another CT scan, and then my mom showed up. She said if they did not admit me then she would sue them. \n\nI was admitted, and given a bunch of tests. Multiple painful spinal taps, an EMG, and nerve conduction tests. It was all really painful. The needle sends an electric shock into your muscle. ( they were doing it to my right leg) also I was given breathing tests. I was hooked up to an EKG machine and IVs. One of the tests was squeezing a doctor\u2019s hands, but I could not really do it. \n\n\nI was getting bad extremely quickly at that point. The doctor asked me to raise my right arm, which I could barely do. It would not stay up, and I was crying and freaking out. \nAt this point I could not turn over in bed or get out of bed. The nurses were all so nice. My back was so sweaty from being stuck in the same position. \n\nI was also afraid to go to sleep because my feet were starting to get tingly and numb. I was afraid I would wake up paralyzed. \nThey diagnosed me with gbs on my second night ( maybe third), and then put me on IVIG. \nThe night after the first dose I felt noticeably better. \n\n( This happened possibly before I was on IVIG) My fianc\u00e9, now husband, stayed over night for a couple nights. One day when he was there we decided to go to the cafeteria. I was wearing pajama pants and the hospital gown. I had all the wires attached to me. \n\nI was barely able to walk down the hallway, and when we got to the cafeteria it was like a jail escape lol. A nurse showed up rather quickly, and she was a really good sport about it. She understood and was very sweet. She had to push me up in a rolling chair. \n\nAfter the IVIG was started they would have me walk up and down the hallway with a belt around my torso so I would not fall. It was terrifying. \n\nI was discharged after being on IVIG for 5 days. I felt a lot better, but I still could not walk up the stairs. I was crying and had to crawl to the couch. I was in PT for awhile. It took awhile for me to be able to get on my high bed, walk up the stairs ( I had to call 911 a couple times to get me in the house), and be able to get up without struggling. I was not able to get my strength back for almost 2 months. \n\nNow I am back to normal. When I get really bad colds my arm gets tingly, which the doctor said is normal. Gbs cannot be cured, and luckily I have not relapsed. I was also lucky I got it from a respiratory virus and not a stomach virus. Gbs can be much more severe if you get it from a stomach virus. I am very lucky I did not have bad long lasting damage. Just slight weakness on my right side. A lot of people are not as lucky as me. \n\nI am sorry this post was so long. \n\n\n\n\n Do not apologize, it was very interesting. My onset coincided with some bad belly business and I ended up with CIDP. I am glad they caught you and gave you the ivig, that was a smart MD. It took me several years to find a smart one. I have been turned away at the ER 4 times now. Each time I worse off than the previous. I plan on never going there ever again.\n\nAnyways, I am happy you are better. Do you still have some bad fatigue?  Thanks for saying that. I am so sorry that you now have CIPD. I would literally never heard of that until this sub. Did you not get IVIG or plasmapheresis? I feel extremely lucky that I was treated before I ended up on respirator. \nMy doctor told me that the sicker you end up getting, the longer and harder the recovery. \nOne of my biggest fears is a relapse. They are rare, but not 1 in 1,000,000. \nI was told by an ER doctor that every time I get really sick with a virus, I will get minor symptoms. \nI got a bad cold with a fever a couple years later and experienced tingling and numbness in my right arm ( my right side was more affected). So I went to the doctor that day, and they sent me to the ER. I was given the test where they shoot electricity into your muscle, and everything was fine. That is when the ER doctor told me that I will get symptoms if I get really sick since it is a chronic illness. What does CIPD feel like? Are the symptoms just like gbs? It is horrible that doctors can do that. I could barely walk, but since I could walk around the nurses station I was deemed fine. My mom was scared they would turn me away again. \n\nThank you I am just so glad it is behind me, but I am really scared I will relapse. I do not like going to the doctors office and I am afraid of the hospital. Not afraid exactly. Idk. \n\nSometimes I do yes. I get bad muscle aches in my legs and arms sometimes, and I have to take 800mg ibuprofen. My skin used to get tingly/numb sometimes. It would happen on my scalp a lot. \nIt took months to get back to walking normally. People would stare at me when I was using the walker. It was so hard. Pt was extremely hard. \n\nI cannot believe you were turned away 4 times. That is insane. Yes I would definitely never go to that hospital again.  I got turned away three times. Once for back pain with stenosis, once for bells palsy, and the third time for like, leg weakness. At this point my whole face was paralyzed and I could not stand on my own. My doctor had to threaten them too and when they did the spinal tap they diagnosed it as GBS almost immediately and I did not leave that hospital for over a month When my wife got GBS at 26, she was sent to the ER from urgent care and then admitted via the ER under suspicion off GBS. She had lost motor control in her hands and feet, and it was getting worse.\n\nOnce admitted, the DR went back on the diagnosis, called it localized muscle swelling, and discharged us. Told us to call if we had questions.\n\n3 days later, shes in a wheel chair and I call the hospital and they tell me they cannot help, call the PCP. Get an apt with the Dr who sets us up with the neurologist and says not to worry.\n\nNeurologist calls and says, 'get to the hospital now. I am having you admitted.' She had the lumbar and started treating before diagnosis. She was furious that we were ever discharged.\n\nMy wife made a full recovery and has had very few lasting effects, for which I am very thankful. But in my experience, it is not uncommon to be dismissed and you did nothing wrong. If there is one thing we both learned, it is that you have to be your own healthcare advocate.\n\nI am glad your recovery is going well, and I am sorry for all of the pain and frustration you went through. :) I went through 4 doctors trying to get IVIG or plasmapheresis. The 4th one said, \"Definitely CIDP\" and was fighting the insurance to get it for me. The weakness spread to my diaphragm and I was so scared! I got my first bolus treatment about a week later and it did not give me a full remission, the damage had gone on for 2 years. But it did stop the progression. I am on regular infusions now, not one of the lucky ones who got a remission. Viruses or breaks in treatment for insurance foolishness are scary. \nCIDP is weakness, needle and pins, foot drop, stumbling, falling, dropping things, muscle spasms in feet/legs/whole torso/neck/face. My blood pressure goes very low and I have to be careful when standing so as not to faint. There is a continuous dull ache from the spasms that lessens the morning after an infusion then gradually comes back over time. The fatigue seems to be the worst part. I just got some neuropathy pain mess last night.\n\nIt was actually 3 different hospitals.  3 different hospitals?! Omg that is horrible. I really feel for you. I am really lucky it only happened once. I am glad you got some medication. \nI cannot believe they would turn away people who are weak and can barely walk. It is shameful.  interesting that you say it is more severe from a stomach virus. Do you know why? That is how I got AIDP and yeah my case was medium-severe.. I actually do not know why, I only know my doctor told me that before I left the hospital. What is AIPD? Is that a more severe chronic gbs? I am so sorry that you are going through this. I was on of the lucky ones.  sorry meant AIDP variant. The most common form of GBS. It was a one time ting luckily", "I started feeling dizzy with weakness in early October Checked in to the ER and they did a bunch tests. Everything came back normal except for elevated protein in my LP In addition to weakness in my legs, I also had elevated heart rate (150 bpm just by standing) and light sensitivity. Had appointments with the cardiologist and neurologist. Based on the LP and additional symptoms and test from the neurologist, his best guess is a mild variant of GBS. Seems like GBS is diagnosis by elimination which is a bit frustrating because I feel like I am just waiting around hoping things get better. It is been about 2 months. My heart rate has gone back to normal and my eyes are a mostly better. I can walk around and I am willing to bet to the outside world I look fine, but I am still experiencing dizziness/balance issues and random muscle twitching all over my body but mostly in my feet. My question is, did anyone else experience the twitching and balance issues? If so, how long did they last? Was there anything you did that helped speed up the process?", "Recovery Hey everyone I wanted to update my situation, I finished my ivig a couple days ago and I am currently in a rehab facility. I feel slightly stronger but I just think that is because my mono symptoms are finally going away. I do feel very discouraged, everyone is talking about how great I am doing and they see improvement every day. I do not see that I can barely get dressed myself. I do not feel like I am improving, I just want to go home. I am trying to stay strong and do the most physical therapy I can. It just sucks not feeling any improvement. Thank you all for the support!", "How long did it take for the symptoms to from nerve tingling to much worse for you guys? I got my first J&amp;J shot about 5 days ago and since then, have noticed these tingling type of sensations on arms and legs where it feels like almost some weak needle or some sort of pin being initially stuck in you.\n\nFor those of you who had worst symptoms, how long did it take to go from these type of sensations to much worse symptoms for you?\n\nAre you fully recovered now? Tingling is one thing but for pretty much every GBS patient it is about weakness. I was 14 days post AstraZeneca vaccine and I lost feeling in my feet and then below my waste. I was able to walk at first but within 24 hours I was bed ridden. GBS is aggressive and if the numbness ascends or you have any weakness or paralysis seek help immediately. It is been 6 months and I can do pretty much everything but I am still weaker then previously. Most people recovery is up to a year. Most people have residual issues that flare up under certain circumstances FUCK. To make it worse in many jurisdictions GBS is not considered a exemption for the second shot\u2026 even if you got it from the first vaccine. Pretty insane At this point, I do not care. I am fully vaccinated for now but months down the road, they will require boosters for you to be fully vaxxed. I am ready to quit my job at this point. I posted here a couple weeks ago about the vax mandate and got a bunch of shit for it. (Which I have since been granted a medical exemption by my company. (A DOD contractor with no option for testing)). I honestly hope that you do not really get GBS from the vax; but if you do, hopefully it is not a severe case.  Good luck\ud83d\ude4f, nobody should have to go through that. Fuck how did you get that medical exemption? If you look at my post from a week or two ago it explains my MDs feelings toward me getting a jab after having GBS... he wrote a letter to my company on my behalf, and they approved an exemption. I have already had Covid as well, so I feel pretty safe now. I would have gladly taken weekly tests, even if it were on my own dime, but I work for a DOD contractor, and papaBiden says that is not an option for DOD. I am not getting the booster, willing to lose my job for those. Did you lose feeling right after the tingling or did the tingling first took about a week before it got worse? A couple coworkers are in the same boat... they got shot #1, but are refusing #2. My company did move the deadline out to January 4th instead of December 8th, so at least they are buying a little more time. Several have already left, but I think the mass exodus from contractors will be in January. This is why I am going all hands on trying to do an online business. I am working on doing my own thing as well. Even if I get to keep my job over this, I might not be as lucky the next time. I have been pretty fortunate in life and could likely get by on part time-self employment already. I do actually like my job now, if I did not, I would likely leave over this mandate.... I feel it is better for me to keep working if I can, and then I could still help a few friends and family that the pandemic have really hurt.. You would be already in the throws of GBS. \n\nIt is normal to get nerve-tingling after vaccination shots that last a few days. Do not freak out, you will be fine. I want to hug you. I feel like entrepreneurship is eventually the future. That is good to hear. Happy you got one. According to the Federal Register ( you can be tested weekly and wear a mask in lieu of being vaccinated.  So it is seems, if your company does not allow that, it is a company policy rather than a federal policy. Had gbs in 2010, from something within 10 days 3 er till someone opened a book. Go to er demand a spinal tap. noted I was super fine for 2 weeks or so. In retrospect I was having early signs that my nerves were under attack (itchy skin, headaches). The onset between tingles and weakness was 12 hours or so. Within another 24 hours I was bid ridden (couldnt move arms or legs). Thank you for your anwser! about 2 weeks", "Paid research opportunity! Hi all!  I have been a part of a paid research opportunity about my experience with GBS.  There is a 60 minute phone call and 30 minutes of pre-work.  If you are interested  the link is below.  They will pay you, and are interested in Spanish-speaking countries and Canada.  I am really hoping this helps get out stories out and some further research to help anyone struggling with this.  \n\n", "Guillain-Barre vs Multiple Sclerosis ", "Just got my first shot scheduled. Any advice from those on here who have already gotten it? Im a little nervous This is in reference to the covid vaccine shot Vaccinated just over a month ago.  My experience did not differ in any way from others without GBS vaccinated at the same time.  (Pfizer vaccine) good to know! Im also getting Pfizer The only reason for a cause for concern for GBS patients is if your GBS case was triggered by SARS-CoV-2 or a prior vaccine. \n\nOther GBS patients should not be at additional risk of relapse, at least hypothetically. I had GBS 18ish years ago and got the first Pfizer shot on Saturday. I am also 36 weeks pregnant. The data on both GBS following vaccination as well as the pregnancy tracking data released last week solidified my interest in getting vaccinated, especially with the potential of passing some immunity to my baby in utero. \n\nI had a minor sore arm the day after dose #1, but it was not anything disruptive to me. I feel great now 2 days out. I feel confident in my choice and I am excited to be fully protected in a few weeks. It was triggered by a flu shot when I was younger. I registered, have not gotten it yet.  CIDP was triggered by flu vaccine. Very interested in knowing how other people do.  Thanks for posting. I registered and am waiting. I have CIDP but I have been having a huge immune flare up from chemical exposure and my doctor wants me to hold on introducing something else to my immune system, which is over reactive to the point that eating food triggers immediate numbness in my face and extremities. I got my first vaccine 3 weeks ago and my hand has been hurting ever since. It feels like my nerves or tendons are too tight around my pinky knuckle and if I bend my hand the wrong way it hurts. \n\nUnknown of that is GBS related or not. I got my second shot a few weeks ago. I am a year out. GBS triggered by either Covid or a sinus infection. First shot my arm hurts for a couple days. Take plenty of Tylenol afterwards, NOT before! Second shot I got a migraine, chills, and muscle aches. Lasted a day. I just slept. I have felt fine since. My Neurologist would not have advised me to get the shot had my GBS been triggered by a vaccine. So there is that. (standard disclaimer for anyone reading: always ask your doctor about medical decisions)\n\nEven if you had GBS following a prior vaccine (like I did), that might not be a disqualifier. The Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines are very different from the typical flu vaccines.\n\nThe (\n\n&gt;People who have previously had GBS may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. To date, no cases of GBS have been reported following vaccination in participants in the ( clinical trials. One case of GBS was reported in a vaccinated participant in the Johnson &amp; Johnson Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine clinical trial (compared to one GBS case among those who received placebo). With few exceptions, the independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (\u00a0do not include a history of GBS as a precaution to vaccination with other vaccines.\n\nSome months back, I asked my neurologist about whether he thought I should get the COVID vaccine (at the time, only the Moderna and Pfizer versions were about to be approved) and he said that he had seen no risks and the obvious risks from COVID itself are clearly high.\n\nI will be jumping at my first opportunity to get vaccinated against COVID despite developing GBS after a flu vaccine four years ago. Great summary.  The most comprehensive study I have seen so far suggests that flu vaccines are safe even if a flu vaccine was what triggered your GBS previously.  We have much less data so far on covid vaccines, for sure, but so far there has not been a link. I had my second shot 3 weeks ago (Sputnik).  Some people report mild headache or fever the day after the shot, so you may want to plan a rest day just in case.  If you feel fine, you get a day off as the reward.  ;). I was fine after the first shot, but I did have a slight fever (37.5c) the day after the second one. Yeah, my understanding of the latest research is that the evidence suggests it is actually safer for people who had GBS immediately after a flu vaccine to get the flu vaccine than to not get it. But my neurologist said he does not believe there is enough evidence to suggest it is safe so I am following his advice since he is the professional and clearly keeps up with the latest developments in the field. Had mine 3 days ago (AstraZeneca) and I had the usual symptoms like a headache, chills etc. I had Guillain-barre when I was 5 so a bit nervous but so far so good! I received the first dose last week.  Other that soreness I felt great afterwards.  My neurologist encouraged me to get the vaccine and the pharmacist assured me that it was safe for me knowing my GBS was caused by the flu vaccine.  I wanted the vaccine but I was a nervous wreck with fear.  I am a year out and still dealing with issues.  But knowing I could get an extra layer of protection from Covid made my day. OTOH it is a potential unnecessary risk  depending on where you live. I am in Western Australia and my GP is adamant I not get one as covid is not as threatening here. I think it comes down to how likely are you to get covid vs how likely are you to have an adverse side effect. If you are in the USA, covid is the bigger worry...but in some places it is not. My husband is definitely getting the shot, however, to help protect me. any update yet? As of today (Tuesday PM US ET), most of my side effects of 2nd shot are gone. The tingling sensation is no longer there. The severe lower back ache has also mostly subsided. I have stopped taking Tylenol (was taking 2 500mg tablets every 6-8hrs).

Diagnosed in November 2020, and I have noticed that in cold weather, my muscles are more tight and my tingling is not quite as bad, but in warmer weather my muscles seem to be better and I can feel tingling more in my hands and feet. Anyone else have experiences like this? Sorry no one has responded.  I am from the CIDP camp and YES any weather change I feel like my grandmother telling me it is going to rain soon.  From what I am told it is the swing in barometric pressure and while I am no doctor or meteorologist it seems to be spot on.  Right now I am in let us just say not having a good night as  a huge storm is coming in a few hours. My real stress comes from my dog will not go out in the rain not because of her she knows I do not walk so well.  We just went out a few minutes ago and she did her biz because she knows tomorrow might be rough.  Worth noting she is a service dog.\n\nLong story short this is all super fun but adjust your daily reality unless you are one of the lucky ones and they do not post here. I am not sure if my muscles being tighter in the winter is from GB or the weather causing it in normal circumstances. I do get more tingling in the warmer weather. I have found that I must drink cooling beverages like mint tea or coconut water during the heat of the summer or I get fatigued from the tingles. \n\nDuring the dry cold winter I seem to have more tingles too, although recently I have had them just about everyday, it is changing the spring where I am. So I am not sure if it is the fact that I am just progressively having more tingles or the change of season. \n\nI do know the more stressed emotionally I am, the more tingles I get as well. Low grade Neuropathy is a pretty common long time after effect from GBS, I believe they found about 50% of people will develop it a few years after the fact. The first year after I was diagnosed I had a lot of tingles and physical/mental fatigue and then I started to recover from those symptoms over the course of 1-2years. I wish you rapid healing and full recovery!

I had pins and needles in both hands for about 10 minutes but that was it. The following couple of days I noticed my right hand and arm felt heavy and took more of a conscious effort to move. This was intermittent though, and the sensation would last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. \n\nA few days after that I noticed my right leg going through almost identical symptoms, along with my right hand/arm. \n\nI went to the emergency room and had a CT scan and blood work but nothing came back abnormal. \n\nFast forward about 6 days after initial symptoms and the sensations switched to my left hand/arm and leg. \n\nToday I woke up and my legs felt weak coming down the stairs and it was difficult to walk for a few hours, but it is severity seems to come and go. \n\nWhat I know about GBS is it usually comes on hard and fast\u2026it is been 8+ days for me and the sensations seem to come and go.  \n\nHas anyone here experienced anything like this??", "CDC guidelines for COVID vaccine and GBS  CDC says it is ok to get. There were no instances of getting GBS during trials (but that still makes me question the population of people who already have had it, if it would increase chances for relapse??).\n\nThey dont use live or inactive parts of the virus in the vaccine (which, to my understanding, was why we have been advised to not get the flu shot in the past). \n\nThis info makes me hopeful that I should get it, but still leaves some questions for me about relapse. Im a teacher in Utah so I will be getting vaccinated in the next few weeks. I will let you all know how it goes!! (in remission for CIDP for 6 years now) Let us go!!!! I cannot wait to get the vaccine. Very useful, thanks for sharing! :) So this specifically is about the mRNA vaccines, its my understanding from health officials (at least in Canada) that when you get vaccinated you will not have the choice which vaccine you get, mRNA or not. That said, at the moment only the two mRNA ones are approved for use in Canada, do not know about other countries.\n\nUnfortunately the Moderna one also just had its first case of severe allergy reaction like the Pfizer one does so both are out for me as I am severely allergic to fish. That said even if I was not I would still wait to talk to a Neurologist about it because if there is even a small percentage it can reactivate my GBS, I would rather move to the middle of nowhere and wait 10 years for herd immunity than chance that hell again, that is just me though. This is great news for people who have had GBS. I have read several case reports of GBS onset or recurrence after or during covid-19 infection. While covid-19 does not appear to be a statistically significant GBS trigger, it definitely poses a risk by instigating a strong immune response. The lack of GBS development in the Pfizer and Moderna trials makes me feel like the risks of a potential covid infection outweigh the risks of an mRNA vaccine.\n\nThis specific recommendation for MRNA vaccines makes me think that once vaccine choices are more available, it may be an option for someone in our community to specifically request and receive an mRNA vaccine rather than one of the others in development. &gt; (but that still makes me question the population of people who already have had it, if it would increase chances for relapse??).\n\nThey did not let people with allergies join the trial, right?\n\nI think the key question I have is did they let people with histories of gbs join the trial.\n\nIf they did not well they are the scientists and I am not, but they would seem to be making  educated guesses at best\n\n----\n\nregardless, I am happy they put this out, it will give me something to discuss with doctors not being a doc, I would assume for the US at least, making the point you just made would be sufficient to get directed to an mrna vaccine I have not been able to find data about GBS interactions being tested with mRNA vaccines.  AFAIK these are the first mrna vaccines to have been licensed for use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Before December 2020, no mRNA drug or vaccine had been licensed for use in humans, but both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech were close to securing emergency use authorization for their mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which had been funded by Operation Warp Speed (directly in the case of Moderna and indirectly for Pfizer/BioNTech).\\ On 2 December 2020, seven days after its final eight-week trial, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), became the first global medicines regulator in history to approve an mRNA vaccine, granting \"emergency authorization\" for Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine for widespread use.\\\\\\ MHRA CEO June Raine said \"no corners have been cut in approving it\",\\ and that, \"the benefits outweigh any risk\".\\\\ On 11 December 2020 the FDA gave emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech COvid 19 vaccine.\n\n( Since the internet is never wrong my memory must be correct. /s &gt; I have not been able to find data about GBS interactions being tested with mRNA vaccines. AFAIK these are the first mrna vaccines to have been licensed for use.\n\nI think that is true.\n\nAlso I cannot imagine (maybe I am wrong) they let people with a history of GBS in their test group, and in tests of 50,000 people they would be lucky to have one GBS person in there, surely not enough to make a valid statistical determination I lined up all my Epi pens so there would be one always in reach, rolled up my sleeve, and got that rascal. Going To do it again the first week of January, too. I cannot get a teensy cold without being wiped out for six weeks, so risking the virus is a big no for me.

CIDP, for more than a decade", "My two neurologists seem to have a very different understanding of GBS So I was diagnosed with GBS in the past, now experiencing same symptoms again. Anyways my new neurologist from a different clinic says you never had GBS you most likely had some other illness the last time and this time. You were probably misdiagnosed. He goes like you have good reflexes for someone who has GBS, majority of GBS patients do not make good recovery and they have permanent paralysis and have very weak reflexes. Now I am no doctor, but based on reading the experiences of other people with gbs and after reading various medical journals, I am not so sure that is true. Correct me if I am wrong, but from my understanding GBS affects people very differently from very mild cases to severe cases. It does not always lead to paralysis. The original neurologist I meet a while ago was like lead of their neurology department with decades more experience, she pulled out a textbook and explained what was going on with my body. As well as what medications would help in long term in alleviating my symptoms.\n\nJust looking to start a discussion.

Wearing quality shoes (good cushion, zero heel differential) makes walking and moving around a little less painful. \n\nWhile also difficult, keeping weight off and being active as much as you can also helps long term. Less pressure on damaged joints and a sedentary lifestyle just adds debt to your health \"credit card.\" \n\nAt the outset of my journey 20 years ago, I went from wheelchair to cane to just AFOs.

Before there even was a diagnosis, they figured he would be at that facility for at least a couple of weeks.

Now my siblings are (understandably) discussing the possible need to sell his house to pay for his care, my own future is also in the balance (something I knew before he was ill would eventually happen) and my siblings, who do not make a lot of money are also going to be severely strained by this.\n\nIf he needs long-term care, none of us can afford it, and his house would probably only get him into a government facility (old-age home) and I highly doubt he would get rehab there.

Even then, their neurologist may not have seen patients with GBS/CIDP before.", "CIDP Steroid Response. Has anyone had a negative  reaction to prednisone?\n\nMy neurologist is terrible.  He found neuropathic on my EMG and set me for an appointment  6 weeks  out for me to get my MRIs together for his review.  In the meantime I have developed  cranial involvement.  I can barely speak and sometimes can scream with only  whispers.   My entire limbs are on fire.  And I cannot  open my left eye half the time.   \n\nI called my neuro 10 times  and he wont  push me up.  My dentist would not  pull  a tooth  without  his signing it off.  I could barely speak during my appointment  and he helped  to my car.  So I drove  to my neuros office  yesterday to get the doctor to sign the sheet.   I could not  speak and he still  would not come out to see me.\n\nSo my GP have me steroids  only 20mg a day  and it is only making  it worse.    10 minutes after I take it waves of numbness and neuropathic pain pulsates through  my body.\n\nCidp  with  cranial involvement  was my strongest  suspicion but now I am wondering.  I have a neuromuscular appointment at UT Texas  with a center of excellence doctor in may and a neuroopthamologiet in June.  \n\nIf my doctor  does not admit me ON Tuesday after my appointment  I do not  know what I will  do  I cannot walk unassisted and can barely communicate.   Iv4 had every test except  a lumbar  puncture  and nerve biopsy I am sorry to hear what prednisone is doing to you. I was on alot of predisone during my cidp treatment but it generally made me just really really hungry and made me gain about 10 pounds (which I lost after 3 months after treatment). I am so sorry you are going through this.  I also have cranial involvement with my CIDP - burning scalp, twitching eye, occasional numbness on the side of my face, blurry vision, and occasional tooth ache that is really just the inflammation of the nerve.\n\nIf nothing else, you should go to the ER if your neurologist wont see you.  More than likely you will be admitted and get the help you so desperately need and deserve. I am only  on 20mg so I was not  expecting  any relief.   Just wanted to test to see if it was an inflammatory process.  My neuro is just too busy.  He is  sharp but he is  like 65 years old and sees 40 patients a day.  He is way overbooked and in a private practice. \n\nHow has your  recovery  process  been? Thanks for the response! If I do indeed have CIDP we will  be the rare ones with cranial nerve involvement.   I will not  go to the ER without a neuro sending  me because I am afraid of what I will do the next  time a 28 year old resident tells me it is psychosomatic.  Lol. \n\nHow is your recovery coming? Was yours ever  worse in the mornings? I will wake up with my limbs ok fire and I cannot  open my left eye for 30 minutes and some mornings  can only make \"g\" sounds for 30 minutes as well.   Then an hour later  I will  be speaking fine.  \ud83e\udd2f   \n\nMy neuro is actually very sharp but just too busy.  U see him Tuesday.  I am  no5 leaving  his office without  being admitted at a medical center hospital.   I cannot  get my spinal  tap then wait another month to see him.\n\nI feel like it is harder to get taken seriously for CIDP with cranial nerve involvement. I do not know about the prednisone. But I am struck by your story and how much it sounds like you really need better care. Looking at your post history, acute peripheral neuropathy / polyneuropathy that is been progressing for more than several weeks sounds like it *could be* CIDP. I have utterly no clue why they have not done a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) on you. I am not a medical doctor, but i believe that should have been one of the first tests they did. Basically while they waited for the first round of blood work.\n\nFor an acutely progressing condition, a neurologist needs to have a far greater sense of urgency. If your insurance allows it, I would start making appointments to all the specialists in adult neuromuscular disease you can while you wait for the current neurologist to get their act in gear. You have 2 aunts with MS, so an auto-immune involvement should be suspected, even if not MS in particular. Which is why I think it is all the more head-scratching why they never drew CSF. Maybe also check if getting a patient advocate is feasible and makes sense for you as well.\n\nIf you had CIDP it would be important to start treatment as soon as possible. Meaning it would be important to get the diagnosis as soon as possible. Meaning the neurologist should be properly motivated to see you sooner than later and *not missing potentially important tests*. At least to rule it out, if it can be ruled out. I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, but failure to diagnose, delayed diagnosis, misdiagnosis, and missed diagnosis may potentially open a doctor to a malpractice lawsuit. This could lead to compensation for the the damages caused by pain and suffering and directly incurred by the body (e.g acquired disability) as a result.\n\nIt may help to politely remind your providers of this. It may also help to keep track of all your correspondences with these people. Do more things in writing or by e-mail, or supplement phone calls with e-mails so there is a record of what was discussed and when. And maybe let them know you are keeping track of things. At the end of the day, it may not be CIDP -- it could easily be something else. All the more reason to be polite, yet firm. But there needs to be some sense of urgency here from them, in my opinion.\n\nAlso, I am not a medical doctor, but I do not believe it takes 6 weeks to get MRIs together. If that is what they told you then it is my belief they are, pardon my language, just completely full of shit and incompetent. MRI pictures are there basically as you are rolling out of the machine. The medical records can be sent electronically. They take minutes to review, not weeks. You could bring the hammer down on them. But you might also strongly consider whether these are the kinds of people you should be receiving continuing care from in the future, hammers or no hammers. It is possible it is not the doctor but the people holding the records currently who are incompetent and unable to do things in a timely fashion. Some hospitals are extremely bad at records requests. Not sure if HIPAA applies here or not. It sure feels like there should be some kind of time limit in these kinds of things...\n\nAnyway, I am sorry. This is a special kind of hell. I am sorry you are going through it. I do not know exactly what you are going through. I cannot see all the things you see or know all the things you or others know. So, I might be giving bad advice or being over-reactionary. So take everything I say with a grain of salt. But, yeah. Good luck! I hope something I said here helps. Thank you so very much for your response.   They asked me to collect my own MRIs form 2 hospitals and 2 imaging  centers.  I had it done in 2 days.  Images and reports.  All put on a single disc and organized for them. Called  to set up an appointment  and was told soonest was 6 weeks away \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nI have an appointment  banked with a neuromuscular specialist on May 12th and neuropthamologist on June 2nd.   I will be setting  up a 2nd neuromuscular appointment  with a different system to be safe as the waits are ridiculous.  \n\nIt blew my mind when I came to get the signature my dentist  required and could not speak that the neuro could not  come out for 2 minutes.\n\nI really appreciate the time you took to respond. Have a great  holiday weekend! Well I lost the ability to walk properly for 3 weeks, had horrible neck pain, was really weak, and had constant vertigo at the middle of Nov 2019 after I got a flu shot in October. Took 8 months to diagnose properly since they thought it was GBS (had to get a second opinion and did mri\u2019s, scans, lumber puncture, emg, etc). I did 3-4 months of treatment but had to go from IVIG to SUBQ. IVIG caused me to have aseptic meningitis twice in a month which was not fun at all.\n\nMy nerves and strength is close to normal now (I go to the gym regularly now but it was really tough at first) but the chronic neck pain is still there and I still have issues with it daily (but its tolerable now unlike before). Doctor is not sure why the neck pain came with the CIDP but it is what it is. \n\nIt is a long process either way, and I would not hesitate to reach out to other doctors if your current one isnt meeting expectations. I agree. In many cases it seems wildfire GBS/CIDP is the result of lousy doctors and lousy care. Going to the ER actually helped with my diagnosis.  I went because I couldnt walk completely upright, so I was given a MRI of my lower back.  It showed the inflammation of the nerve root, one of the signs of CIDP.  The ER couldnt explain it, and said to follow up with my neurologist.  He knew exactly what was going on.  My neurologist is a researcher as well, so he loves digging in on unusual aspects of illnesses. \n\nMy feet burn and cramp mostly at night while I am sleeping.  Weakness in the legs when I wake up.  IVIG has helped with some of the burning and pins and needles in my legs and arms.  More strength in my hands and arms.  I can open a jar and carry groceries now. Having balance issues because of my gait with inflammation in the lower back and hips.  So I have some good and bad things happening.\n\nI had a spinal tap as well.  My neurologist is very thorough, so he ordered a lot of tests that required a lot of spinal fluid to get collected.  But this also helped with the diagnosis because if the elevated protein level.  Make sure the person who does your spinal tap has done them before. Glad you are  seeing some forward momentum.  When were you originally diagnosed.  How long have you been on IVIG?  \n\nIs your weakness all over or just arms and legs?  My neck, back and butt are weaker than my arms it seems.  I do have a lot of trouble holding my cell phone though and opening  bottles sometimes. \n\nI definitely  plan on asking for an interventional radiologist  if possible for the spinal  tap but I am so happy to get one finally  I wont be too picky.    I stopped taking my prednisone  so as to avoid affecting my CSF protein  levels. I was diagnosed in Sep 2020 after a long illness with chronic lyme.  Even after 7 months of treatment for lyme, I was getting more neurological problems.  This is how I ultimately got diagnosed with CIDP.  I suspect the lyme triggered it.  I have been on IVIG since Oct, and I get it 1/week.\n\nI have weakness in shoulders, sides, arms, hands, hips, thighs, calves, and ankles.  I initially had to use a towel or something as a grip to open bottles.  IVIG has helped with that.  Same issue with my phone; it would make my hands stiff and cramped.  I bought a case that has the stand in the back, so I set the phone on that and use the speaker phone.\n\nI had an interventional radiologist to m spinal tap.\n\nWishing you well.  Dont hesitate to reach out. The stiffness!!!!  Yes!  You do not read much about it but its the worst!  Thanks a lot. I appreciate  you.  Happy  Easter! I became a grumpy man not from GBS, but from the horrible care and I received + the attitude of some care workers. \n\nTalk to your health insurance company (even if it is state or govt) and **get a \"case manager\" also sometimes known as a \"case specialist\". Tell them your woes, demand more assistance and some foresight so things go smoother for you.**  \n\n\nWith the fatigue of this illness, all the errands are too much to put on the patient. The whole non-communication amongst doctors, going all over town with their charts, making phone calls, and long waits to get into specialists (plus all the mess ups with referral numbers). Any update? Reading your story and hoping you got diagnosis and treatment. I relate to your frustrating experience. Thanks for asking.  I see my neuro on Monday.  My spinal tap revealed elevated pressure but do not know about my protein count yet.  Things are beginning to point back towards my brain possibly.  So many symptoms seem like cidp though.  I have not mustered the courage to look at my spinal tap results yet because I am afraid there wont be an elevated protein count.  \n\nDo you have cidp or gbs??? I was originally diagnosed with GBS and then the diagnosis changed to CIDP about 6 months later. I had to go thru 2 neuros and a neurosurgeon and finally be admitted to get a diagnosis and treatment. My spinal tap showed elevation but not crazy high. They really need to give more credence to your symptoms than a number. I will tell you this- i believe there is much more variation in symptoms than what i read in the literature. For example, my numbness started in my hands not feet. They assured me that wasnt the case and it never works that way, but it did. There is a webinar in May on CIDP thru the GBS foundation featuring a texas dr, so im paying the 25 dollars to watch that. YESSSS!  There is a much wider variation in symptoms than their little text books tell them.  We know much more about symptoms than they do from the forums.  I have read and conversed with hundreds of people diagnosed with cidp on reddit and on the gbs website.  How many neuros can say that? Let me know how your appt goes and what you find out. I think hearing about other peoples experiences helps keep us from feeling crazy.", "Is there a way for my mom to obtain health insurance at the age of 58 with Guillain-Barre syndrome or any other related options?  \n\nGood day Reddit community,\n\nThis is my first Reddit post so do not be to harsh on me! My mom is 58 years old and was diagnosed with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome back in 2008. My mom has always been a tough (grew up in Iowa on a farm) and smart woman raising 5 kids pretty much by herself while my father was out being untrustworthy and scamming people as a auto mechanic. My mom separated from him back in 2010 and was left with nothing due to my father disappearing. My mom was forced to file for food stamps which she always thought to be embarrassing and had to put her pride aside for her kids since she could not obtain a job due to her illness messing with her physical and mental state at the time. The food stamp agency told her she had to be in school or to get a job to obtain them so she always wanted to be in the medical field so she started Massage Therapy school and was hoping to make a career out of it. My mom has been working out every morning at home for the past 12 years and shes in the best shape I have seen of any woman in their 50's. Eats healthy, never consumes junk food or much sugar. Recently she started obtaining pain in her lower back about a year ago and i know its bad because I have never seen my mom cry before. The massage parlor she works at treats her bad and does not offer benefits but works with her schedule and shes starting to be in severe pain while massaging others. She filed for the free medical visits at a small Community Hospital but does not do anything for her and they only happen every 8 months. My siblings and I try to convince her to file for disability but she seems to be to embarrassed to file for it claiming other deserving people need it. That is a little info about my moms background.\n\nI am 26 years old and i am going to school full time while in the Army National Guard. I have Tricare Reserve through the National Guard and looked into adding her to my insurance which they have the option to but theirs no point since they have a very small limit of what they can do for my mom. The other option I have been thinking about is volunteering for a deployment since i read my health insurance while on active duty is better then the reserve insurance. I have tried looking into other options but thought id try making a post on Reddit to learn from other people experiences or to gain more knowledge on the situation. Thank you very much. If her job does not offer benefits she may be able to apply for Medicaid. What state are you in? Thanks for replying! Louisiana. I believe that is what she applied for which only allows for a hospital visit at a University hospital every 4-6 months and she does not even get to speak with a doctor, just a nurse practitioner/RN. The nurse just tells her to look into a physical therapist because the nurse states \"My dad hurt is lower back and that is what he did\". Which shows that the nurse does not know much about my mothers condition. My mother has been a chairman for a Guillain Barre group for the past 10 years and she has excellent medical terminology and knowledge. Shes been researching it for the past decade so she knows when medical professionals are talking non sense (at least in her opinion). I was informed that you have to be 65 or older or be disabled to file for Medicaid in Louisiana. That is for Medicaid. Medicare is for lower income. Here is a link to Louisiana' Medicaid Program requirements: \n\nAdditionally, if she does not qualify for Medicaid and her employer does not offer benefits, she can find marketplace health insurance through this link: \n\nThe enrollment period may be over, but I am not sure. It would still be a good idea to look. She can look at various plan offerings and, depending on her income, could qualify for tax credits to offset the cost of insurance. Hi! I am in Texas and went into the hospital uninsured. The hospital advocates set things in motion for me to get on Medicaid. It was a bit of a hastle. The hospital also applied for charities and grants through the hospital. I was in ICU for 14 days and a ventilator for half that. She can sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. I doubt LA has the Medicare expansion, but the subsidies are very nice.", "Intense nausea and green stool. Anyone else? I have had what is either some kind of GBS or CIDP thing for a few weeks now. I think some neurological symptoms, tingling and muscle weakness have reached roughly their peak. Maybe some things have gotten better? (It is so hard to tell)\n\nMy main concern right now is intense nausea and GI abnormalities. Started about 2 weeks after my hand/feet tingling kicked off. It started with diarrhea. Then stool that had these dark green spots to them. Then fuzzy dark green stool for a few days. Now it is slowly getting lighter green and harder, constipated a bit. Cannot tell if this is a good thing or not. \n\nNausea is pretty bad right now though. Easily my top complaint at the moment. Seated in my tummy area. An intense burning sick feeling. If I wait a few hours it usually seems to subside. Then I eat something, and then everything usually comes roaring back.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this kind of thing? Any insight into what this could be, if it will get better over time, or things I could do to help?\n\nThanks! Have you seen a doctor for this? I had that as well. But it I improved after IVIg treatment. Have you seen a doctor? GBS can effect your autonomous functions such as digestion, bowl movements, etc. I would see a doctor asap. I have. I am concerned my neuro was not taking me seriously though. Like, if I am not literally dying or currently in a wheelchair then how important is what I am reporting. Frustrating.\n\nI have an appointment tomorrow though. I will definitely pound the table and bring this up though. Thank you! Yes, but it is been wait and see so far. I think I am going to pound the table for treatment tomorrow. They have been putting it off and I have no idea why anymore. Fortunately, I know I can last another day. Something I learned through my GBS journey was that when it comes to doctors you have to be your own advocate. Good luck!! It took me too long to realize that I had to advocate for myself. So I finally did. It seems like the doctors you spoke to are like the ones I saw at first. GBS is really rare, so it is not always on the list of possible diagnoses. After a trip to the ER, I was told that it was \"Somatic Syndrome,\" and was also told to \"wait and see.\"\nBut I knew something was not right. So I went to the ER again. And instead of accepting my previous diagnosis, I insisted that something was really wrong. 8 hours later I was receiving ivig. \nSO, GO POUND THE TABLE! It does not sound like GBS (then again, neither did my symptoms), but if you know something is wrong, you deserve a diagnosis. \nBest of luck and keep us updated!", "What were your early symptoms and time frames with the onset of GBS? Hey guys, I just had a nasty throat infection (strep) starting a few days ago (5-6 days ago). The infection seems to be winding down but I noticed this morning my hands were going through pins and needles. This is not normal for me. The pins and needles have been steady in my hands and now my arms with some tingling as well. I know if it is is GBS I cannot do anything but I would still like to know if my super early symptoms seem inline with your experiences. When my GBS onset I was tired constantly. Like, have to log off work to go lay down tired. I felt the tingling in my fingers and toes, eventually my legs lost all feeling. My legs buckled from under me in the shower one day and I went to the emergency room. It sounds like you should go soon. I feel dumb for not going to a doctor sooner, as I might not have had to do so much physical therapy and IVIG if i got treated sooner, but with COVID going on i was scared to be in a hospital. I hope you do not get diagnosed with this but if you do I hope you get well soon. I am sorry to hear about your ideal. I hope you are feeling stronger and nearing full recovery.\n\nI am aware of this condition so I will continue to monitor things. If it progresses tomorrow I will head to the hospital. Mine started off with pins and needles and numbness with pain in my feet one day and it slowly got worse over the course of the next couple of days. I remember doing slow walking laps around my car because I was so sore and felt like I had run a marathon but I had not. Another couple of days and I had lost reflexes in my legs and looked like I had a stroke - shuffling, flat feet. All up about 6 days from onset til I was admitted to hospital.\n\nIf you suspect anything go to a dr - the worst they will do is say wait it out, but at least you will be on their radar. Yeah thanks man. Sorry you went through this. Hope you are doing good now.\n\nGreat advice, I will probably wait until the tingling spreads a bit (if it does). I know not to wait until paralysis begins but I also do not want to be sent home with a misdiagnosis. One of the early symptoms that I got are losing reflections. In my case, this is even before I started to feel weak but after/along with having pins and needles. My early symptoms was numbness and weakness starting from my legs upwards, it was rapid like less than 24 hours when i was paralyzed from neck down. if intetested you can read;  ( Sorry you had such a severe case. That must have been very traumatic. Thanks for sharing. Be careful. You can go A-Z real quick. I made it into the hospital with no feeling in my arms and legs and a day later I lost the ability to walk. They still did not diagnose me with anything even after every test leading up to a spinal tap. Safe to say I missed out on the plasma infusions etc.", "Has anyone gotten the Monoclonal antibodies for COVID? My teen daughter had an episode back in April &amp; was determined to Miller Fisher. She was successfully treated with immunoglobulin iv. She is fully covid vaccinated but tested positive for covid anyways. Has anyone here with gbs gotten the covid monoclonal antibodies? I am wondering if she can get them. Thanks! I was diagnosed with CIDP in May, conditioned worsened enough for me to go to the hospital to get IVIG instead of waiting for outpatient treatment. Found out at the hospital I was also COVID positive (got my second Pfizer shot in April) and because I was previously on steroids, was administered Ronapreve (Regeneron) on August 17th. Internal medicine and my neurologist both suggested it. I felt no classic COVID symptoms throughout, so perhaps it worked? Although COVID may have played a role in my CIDP symptoms quickly worsening the days before I was admitted. Thank you for your response, I appreciate it! Hope you are doing better!

Doctors say heart and bloods are fine getting tingling? ", "If I do not have CIDP, then what is wrong? I have posted about my stroke diagnosis, nixed by a neuro in favor of CIDP, CIDP nixed by a new neuro with no new diagnosis. So, as with many of us modern folks, I naturally turned to the Internet. Doctors hate us inquisitive patients because a) they care about us and worry we will get possibly harmful/inaccurate information, and/or b) we will ask them too many pointed questions, and/or c) we will ask too many polnted qestions (which might get us out of their clutches!).\n\nSo, researching by my symptoms (which reminded me of an MRI finding none of my doctors made much of), I ran across VBI (vertebrobasilar insufficiency).  Two vetebral arteries run up the back of the neck, joining to form the basalar artery, all to bring blood to the brain. Reduction of this blood flow can, not surprisigly, cause health issues. The worst of these can be a stroke which kills you. Basal artery occlusion (complete blockage) is very dangerous\u2014and cause a posterior circulation infarction (not good). I do not know if this type of stroke leaves a lesion visible on MRI of the brain. So, back to the MRI findings I *did* have (on multiple MRIs). There was complete blockage of one of the vertebral arteries at the vertebral artery/basal artery junction. Their was partial blockage (reduced blood flow) of the other vertebral artery at that point. So, reduced blood flow to the brain, or VBI).\n\nVBI could explain all of my symptoms.* The first doctor who pointed out the MRI findings to me said I should take daily aspirin as an anti-coagulant (and I continue to do that) and did not ascribe any of my symptoms to it, and went off on the theory of a spinal fistula (abnormal connection between an artery and a vein). He could not find one. The second doctor who saw the finding ascribed no symptoms to it, and eventually diagnosed CIDP (never did a nerve biopsy).\n\nSo, I am going to raise this issue with my new doctor as soon as I get the chance.\n\n*Even explaining the coming and going of some of them.", "Those of you with bilateral axonal facial neuropathies, do you continue to notice progress 1yr+ after diagnosis?

He also told me that after 12-18 months my nerves would stop growing/progressing. \n\nI have posted before about bilateral facial paralysis and a few of you mentioned that you were in a similar situation. I am nearly 6 months out from my diagnosis and have seen little to no improvement. Do you continue to see improvement, albeit slow? I am 3 years out (38 F, GBS 2017). The left side of my face was pretty severely affected. It has steadily improved over these years. I have of course tried quite a few things to improve it; e-stim, facial exercises, massage, and acupuncture. Now the improvements are slow and progress is hard to see but I think I am still improving. Would you recommend any of these treatments or is it just time that helps? I think that the facial exercise and acupuncture both helped. The e-stim was too painful and I saw no change. Acupuncture I started twice a week for about a month then down to once a week over several months.

She does not believe anything can help her. She wants to end it very soon and nothing I or her family says can sway her even a little. It might be a matter of days.

But it slowly got better and now I only have neuropathy in my fingers and toes. I can certainly live with it. I currently take Gabapentin in the morning and evening for the neuropathy and it really helps. I took Tramadol for a while, but the doctor took me off of that and I did not notice any problem with stopping that med. I also use Aspercreme with lidocaine on my hands and feet and it is soothing. I took up swimming after my physical therapy sessions ended and it helps strengthen all the muscles. I wish your sister luck. It really does get better, it just takes time.

Nothing was working for my CIDP, they infused it, two months later and I was feeling better and on the road to recovery. While I had a strictly motor presentation of CIDP (could not stand for more than 1 second), it could help her out. Please keep an eye on her and remind her things can get better. Argue with insurance or whatever you have to do to get that drug.

She was in the hospital for 2 weeks and a rehab facility until last Thursday. Total isolation, with no visitors during the pandemic... I am obviously elated to have her home. Just a day away from 2 months since diagnosis, I would love to learn more about things that have been working for those of you who had or have GBS. She was most effected in her legs and feet which are still completely numb and are probably the worst part of her pain, as well as a bit in her hands. We had our first in home physical therapy session that left us wanting a LOT more. We have access to a pool, and live in NYC so there are PTs around, but finding a good out patient that have experience with GBS has also been a rollercoaster, navigating around who is open during the pandemic. I am so grateful for this community as her caretaker, and look forward to your responses! Sounds like you are on the right track. You are getting the things needed for recovery. Mental self care will be important now. There will be plenty of days you both will need to stop, relax slow down. Allow for the days when you want to eat ice cream for breakfast.  Often the GBS foundation will have support chapters that are great help. Keep us posted. Thank you for your response! Right now our biggest hurdle is the pain VS. PT showdown that happens daily. Hope to circle back with some of the small wins along the way! The numbness in her feet and legs are normal. depending on the severity of her case it could take a while for feeling to come back. I definitely recommend pool therapy. You said you have access to a pool get her in it and get her moving around. The only cure for GBS is therapy. Keep at it every day and do not get discouraged. When I was diagnosed I was paralyzed from the neck down. Now I am slowly walking again and have full function of my body. Keep her spirits up and do not let her discouraged. The syndrome is a b**** but you can conquer it. Keep fighting, and reach out anytime you need to! That is so hard, so not fun. I do not know what her drug routine is, try upping the dose of whatever she is on, if that is an option. Try pot, some swear by it.  This hard time does eventually get better. Little bit at a time.  I had kids that needed me so i just had to do what needed to be done.  They were a huge distraction. Motivated me to get rid of the walker pretty quick. There is light at the end of this tunnel! She is on a crazy drug schedule right now and has oddly been guilted about using the optional opiates. \n\nDid you have braces while using the walker? How long were you rehabbing with the walker before you were able to ditch it? Tell me more about this ice cream for breakfast \ud83d\ude1d Hi! I also experienced pain in my legs and feet. What helped were massages with tiger balm or deep blue but only on my legs and back, my feet were too sensitive. \n\nI also wore compression socks everyday and still wear them on days the pain returns. You can buy a pack that are not completely hideous off of Amazon. \n\nTo supplement the PT, I bought water shoes/pool shoes and walked around the pool until my feet felt better. I also bought a kickboard and alternated strokes. And signed up for water aerobics, maybe you can find videos on YouTube. The lymphatic massage made a big difference in my pain levels. And being able to move more freely in the water brought me a lot of confidence. I would recommend you stay to watch her at least the first few times so she can gauge her energy and strength. She may also need help getting out of the pool if she tires more than expected. \n\nAnd lastly, therapy really helps. Not only for her but for you to work through your own trauma and responsibility of being a caretaker. Wishing you both the best! Something else I have been using is an electric muscle stimulator system. I have the HiDow XPDS 18 which is expensive but it works so much better than the $20 I was previously using. You can find it on amazon. Did she get GBS as a result of having Covid? Just curious, it really does not matter how she got it the fact remains that she has it.  \nIce cream for breakfast days are when you say  it\u201d. I am going to have ice cream for breakfast, not do anything I should do,  but every thing I  WANT to do today.  More technically called mental health days.   We all need them!  Maybe missing a day of therapy will not hurt.  I am not a Dr. Only speaking from experience.  \nOpioids are scary. I would be cautious with those.  But marijuana is not. Is it legal in NY? I do not use them anymore but I know many who swear by the edibles.\nI had GBS 10 years ago. My feet are still numb. The nerve damage was permanent. From the middle of my foot to my toes feels like they are wrapped in bandages that are too tight. Or like they are tingling, like they fell asleep. I am sure you did not want to hear that it lasts. A long time ago I learned not to call it pain.  But I was an extreme case. \nI got GBS a week after I had a brain tumour removed. I was already home from the surgery when I started feeling sick. My husband took me back to the hospital. I was there 97 days. I was paralyzed from my ears down. I was on a ventilator and life support. I had to have a tent over me because I could not stand anything touching my skin. I was on a crap ton of drugs. The first two rounds of IVIG did not take. They told my family to say goodbye. The third round took and I started to recover.  \nWhen I went to refill my first prescription for Lyrica out of the hospital, it was not covered and it was very expensive. I live in Canada. I did not get it. Within a few days I realized I did not feel worse so I did not bother renewing it. \nI had a walker when I was released. I found it to be awkward and cumbersome so I stopped using it around the house, eventually stopped altogether. I still went to physio a couple times a week for almost a year.\nOne day I put on my husband\u2019s flip flops to go out on the deck. They had very thick foam soles. It was a game changer. I found a woman\u2019s pair and have worn them ever since. The thick foam moulds to my feet and helps with my balance. Try leaving your wife\u2019s feet bare when she can. \nI wore braces for a while in the hospital but was able to do without them when I left. \nTo me, there was and still is nothing heroic about recovering. It was a matter of you do not have a choice so just get on with it. Terry Fox was heroic, people that are inspired by their experience that they go on to accomplish extraordinary things are heroic. For many of us there are just days where we feel happy to be here, or pissed that we got sick. Always there will be somebody better or worse off than you are. \nGBS-CIDP. org has a lot of resources. They can help you find a support group in your area.\nBy the way, you now get to spend the rest of your life explaining what GBS is. I was in the hospital for a few weeks and got out the middle of March. They sent me home. It took awhile, but I eventually got home pt twice a week. I went from full paralysis, to being discharged in a wheelchair. Outpatient is non existent here, aside from everything being closed. I had to go med free since I am med tolerant, and side effects were outrageous. I noticed that if I had a bad pain day, and do not do anything I regressed quite a bit. So, doing even a little everyday is a plus. Even if it is just stretches. I found a lady on YouTube that does chair yoga. It helped out a lot. However, I was only in a wheelchair for about a week. Graduated to a walker, and only used it for less than a week before I was independently walking. This is not typical though, apparently. Pool therapy sounds fantastic. I may be able to walk, but my coordination has not come back to run or swim yet.", "I got the Pneumovax 23 about 12 days ago I got the Pneumovax 23 about 12 days ago. Standard procedure right?\n\nAbout 7 days ago I started getting insane anxiety and insomnia. I literally sleep a couple of hours a night. My feet felt funny at this time. Figured it was nothing.\n\nNow I feel like I am manic at night, it tends to get worse then.\n\nTwo days ago my knees started getting weaker. Today both legs are weak. I can still walk just fine, just weakly. This afternoon my hands are sore. I have difficulty  I still do not think it is gullian-barre. I am definitely sure I had a reaction to the vaccine. I am pissed about it too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you all think I might have? Autoimmune reaction or flare up. Check with your doctor if you are worried.  This is always the safest Reddit comment. :). Sleep issues and insomnia are common listed side effects of the vaccine, but they usually go away after a few days. I am confused. Do you have a history of Guillain- barre? \n\n\u201cAutoimmune response or flare up\u201d\n\nFlare up of what? No history of gullian barre. I am worried it might be damage from an immune response. flare-up of allergies. I would call the healthcare provider who gave you the vaccine and tell them your symptoms. Have you tried taking an anti histamine and ibuprofen provided you are medically able to take that type of medication but definitely give them a call. It could be CIDP, a slow cousin of GBS.  It is worth getting checked out with a Neurologist if it does not disappear.", "How has GBS affected your hobbies? One way we tend to forget about GBS is how it affects our hobbies and pasttimes - sometimes something viewed as very easy or normal becomes much harder for us to do. How has GBS affected your hobbies? It is personally affected me in several ways: \n\n- My dancing articulation has become rather bad over time\n\n- I cannot use computers for as long a span as I used to when I worked in software without getting massive pain\n\n- My fine motor skills for hobbies like jewelrymaking are very bad and I get random hand twitches At first I could not literally play videogames, I guess my hands were affected too bad and could barely move the joysticks, it has gotten better and I can play again.\n\nI used to play the acoustic guitar, I can play a few simple exercises, but my hands get tired quickly. I would love to take it again, but now I have back problems and I cannot practice for long before my lower back starts aching. I hear that. I played guitar as a kid and then in college and I am trying again now (I just like to fingerpick). I got a foot stand and it helps a bit with the back pain! It is still hard to use it for long, though, agree :( I liked endurance sports. It stopped everything. I barely move anymore. I had to sell my bike and buy a recumbent trike after I fell off my eBike and broke 4 ribs. Should have bought a recumbent years ago, riding that thing is a blast! I find my sensory processing is quite bad since having it. Over the years it has calmed down but I could not go to a restaurant or sit by the pool in vegas etc . The competing noises and people talking messed with my nervous system and kill my ears. For a while I had to wear headphones with music playing to drown out the noises of public places or I would end up in tears. I also get super tired after social engagements and would spend the whole next day in bed sleeping. I used to really enjoy swimming, I would go every week and would be able to swim atleast 20 pool lengths minimum. About 4 months after i was diagnosed (with chronic version - CIDP) I went on holiday, got into a pool and could have almost drowned. None of my limbs could function anymore to do any strokes, I could just about \"doggy paddle\" but for no significant length of time. I could not run at all at the time and I walked with great disability but for some reason I guessed the water would act as support and be OK.\n\nThat and I had to give up football in school. I played for years and was pretty decent as a kid and used to go to the after-school club. I have not played football since. If moving was difficult, it was impossible to co-ordinate that ball too. I used to play volleyball and while I am not the tallest, I had decent vertical and was a good player. When I tried again after GBS, it was like my brain new exactly what to do but no body part would listen. Also, everything was exhausting, even the warm up. With workouts, stamina improved but I never was able to return to my previous form, especially when it comes to vertical. I consider myself lucky that I can workout and exercise and try not to be negative about. It just sad sometimes to lose something you love and were good at. Since most of my hobbies require fine hand movements I was not able to do them for quite some time. Drawing, sculpting with clay, sewing, building small houses for my pets and other play things, were impossible for a while. Now my hands are very shaky and twitch from time to time. I have also found my already present sensory issues have worsened, there are times were the feeling of my own skin touching is too much to handle.\nBut I am still hoping these issues slowly improve. Lul at my worst point in GBS I was still able to play Smash Bros fairly competently, which made me feel bad about how much time I had put into it. I had gbs in 2015 and it definitely affected my hobbies. I am an artist ( painting and multimedia collages) and I could not hold the brush well. My hands actually got weak before my legs. It sucked not being able paint or do any art for awhile. I also could not really do stuff on my phone because I kept dropping it. Stoked to hear your are playing again. Crash Bandicoot was honestly the best therapy for fine motor control in my fingers. The stakes were so high for messing up, so I was really invested in doing the therapy. I also got super into knuckle bones. I had to relearn guitar.      \n\nIt was necessary to pick up a 12 string acoustic as I had trouble feeling a single string under each fingertip.      \n\nIt is taken 5 years but I am getting on the road to where I was before. What kind of dancing did you do? I was a professional dancer until I had my first kid and still taught until last year when I got sick. I cannot ride a bike or walk for an extended period of time anymore. During the acute phase, I could not even write my own name so I am thankful to be able to write and make art again I would highly recommend people using lions mane mushroom capsules from iherb Oh man, that is rough. I am so glad you are regaining that! Have you changed mediums or how you approach art because of it? Thank you! That is so awesome you were able to get back to art!", "IVIg experiences and best practices for infusing Hi everyone! I was diagnosed with LSS and have been infusing a total of 120 grams of GAMUNEX-C over two days every 3 to 4 weeks at home for the last 8 years. My LSS symptoms cause some atrophy in my right hand (mostly thumb) and left calf, with mostly a numbing/aching pain in both feet. The IVIg has been effective in that I have not gotten worse, which I expect I would have without it.\n\nI am interested to know if people are having the same experiences as I am when getting infusions. It has taken me a while to learn what works best for me when infusing. Like staying hydrated, taking my meds, etc. Some of the things that I have been considering follows.\n\nI have found that different nurses approach delivery of their professional services quite differently. Especially with the location of the stick. I observe that about half the nurses begin looking for a vein on my arms, while about half go straight for a vein on my hands. One nurse wanted to locate the stick in a vein across a knuckle in my thumb, but I declined.\n\nI have also begun over the last two to three years, monitoring closely the rate of my infusion delivery, as I have become concerned with validating that the pump is correctly configured. For instance, if I stay hydrated both before and after infusions, and take my meds timely, and assure that my dosage each of two days is 60 grams at 133.3 ml/hour for 5 hours, and with 30 minutes of intravenous hydration first, then I do not experience any severe side effects. I do experience feeling tiredness. So it has become important to me to assure that this rate of infusion is maintained.\n\nI have experienced a reaction to the infusion, once, where my face became swollen, and my armpits began itching. This was bought under control with Benadryl, and my dosage was adjusted to what it is now, and the doctor added prednisone to my existing regimen of Tylenol and Benadryl.  \n\nDoes anyone have these or other concerns to share, or what works best for your situation?\n\nThanks so much for your attention. Let us put it this way: You are lucky to me. I tried IVIG twice and it caused aseptic meningitis for me both times and it was god awful (some people just cannot handle IVIG apparently). That being said, I was switched over to SUBQ later which caused me zero reactions but it had to be done weekly instead of monthly. Good to hear that the SUBQ was an effective option for you. That sounds like an awful experience with IVIg. Oh my god. Eight years and you have been doing injections this whole time?? \n\nI am on your same schedule but I have only had a total of about 6 months. My veins could not tolerate it (multiple nurses tried many tactics) and I got port surgery. Now the only infusion prep I have is putting on lidocaine in advance. I am curious why you have not gotten a port after all this time. Maybe you have awesome veins? Yes eight years. So far my veins have been tolerating the sticks, but the last two years I have been stuck more than what is historical for me. My doctor is not ready to let me have a port as long as the nurses are finding a vein successfully, I guess. I am expecting at some time soon to need to have a port installed. Likely within the nest 24 to 36 months, maybe sooner. It sounds really easy, and I am getting tired of being stuck even once every three weeks. Wow that is blowing my mind. Well take it from me... it is so so worth it. I had to do it because my veins were failing to hold the line. And I hated having to do it because I did not want a scar and I did not want something inserted into my body over this damned disorder. \n\nBut my IVIG sessions were actual torture. Not exaggerating. Some of the worst pain I have been through in my life, worse than the EMGs which put me in a world of horror. \n\nNow my nurse pops a needle into the port and as long as the lidocaine is working, it is just pressure. Best of all, I can FULLY USE MY HANDS AND ARMS. I used to have to keep them so still because my body was so sensitive and the needle would just roll out.\n\nI am really interested to hear what your results have looked like over 8 years of IVIG! Did you ever have a time when your doctors thought you would be going off it? The port sounds really awesome and happy to know you are not going through that torture anymore. More than one person witness to the benefits with me, including my regular nurse. I would like being able to use my hands and arms more too.\n\nMy results have been that I am not losing any functions at my current dosage. Physical therapy is assisting with getting improvement and I am with it, but I have just really committed to PT within the last 90 days. Currently I have problems with performing fine motor skills in both hands and foot drop in both feet. So the PT in combination with my current dosage and regimen is resulting in slight improvements in the movement of my hands, and particularly my trick thumb, and with the strength in my fingers and ankles. I am looking forward to continued improvement now that I have decided to make the PT a commitment. \n\nThe severity of my LSS is considered mild, given that some patients with it cannot move until they get their infusion. So I am encouraged by this middle-of-the-road severity. And I am encouraged by the improvements that I have been getting at this dosage with the regular PT mixed in. My doctors advise that I need to keep up this regimen for the rest of my life and while I can tolerate it. I also got aseptic meningitis! I went to take my final for a professor who refused to acknowledge my accomodations. Then had my sister drive me to the emergency room. They changed my brand of infusion and I was fine with IVIG after that. First of all, ask for a medical port. I got one after 3 or 4 months when my veins stopped accepting needles. \n\nSecond, ask for the company Infusion of Care to do your infusions! They come to your house and ALL of the nurses I had were super knowledgeable, kind and easy to work with. For sure made my experience much better. I am so sorry and I feel silly asking but what is LSS? I am 10 years out so not familiar with new terminology. \ud83d\ude2c &gt; LSS\n\nLumbar spinal stenosis.  Google / Wiki can answer the rest. Wow I appreciate so much that you wrote this up. That has given me a much better picture of PT for this type of health challenge. I am so glad it is helping you!!\n\nReport from me on the port - it took a full month to heal and another full month to become total background noise. My most recent infusion, I put on lidocaine, my nurse arrived, stuck me, and plugged in the bag and that was that. I continued as normal. She kept the needle in overnight and I was able to sleep with it no problem. The next day she just plugged me back in. Seamless. She is done 3 rounds of blood work on my this way. Have not had a needle in my arm since December. Again with your long long term situation, I feel like a port would make a real difference in your quality of life. I actually forget that I even have it now which is awesome and my arms are not bruised up for weeks after infusing.\n\nThank you for keeping in touch &lt;3 The main reason my neurologist has been giving me for delaying having a port installed is that she advises that the risk of infection is increased with the port, and that given the port\u2019s installation proximity to the heart, if the port needs to be removed because of an infection, that it is removal adds additional risks. My neurologist is the one who prescribed me PT and OT, but I am only getting PT right now. I use ATI Physical Therapy for my PT and they have been awesome. I will be discussing prescribing the port again with my neurologist to see what she is recommending. I do trust her as she is the one that diagnosed my LSS after 5 years of impairment, tests, more tests, and even more tests by all manner of experts. I am so glad you have built trust with your neurologist who has led on your medical care. I was also advised of the risks of infection, but that they were very low. However, there may be individual factors for each of us that impact that, so your doctor would know if you are higher risk. \n\nIn my case, my veins simply would not take infusions anymore. The needle was slipping if I moved even the slightest bit. Imagine having to hold your arm still for multiple hours. My whole arm would go numb. I would have to get stuck 7-8 times per day to get through.\n\nFor you, maybe your veins have tolerated it enough that your neurologist does not see the infection risk as a worthy tradeoff. Drop me another note sometime after you have talked with her more :)", "How do people get gbs from campylobacter and when ? Is it only when they try to recover naturally without antibiotics ? And do symptoms of gbs start acute or does it have a delay of few months after campylobacter infection? Asking cuz i had campylobacter infection 3 weeks ago and im anxious for consequences like this. Gbs symptoms are usually acute, can have an onset of hours to days. Cidp symptoms are the ones that develop slowly over time. I am confused by your concern though. Are you showing symptoms or not, and if you are what are they? You can have GBS after any infection or virus. It is a autoimmune reaction. To put it simply: When your body is fighting an infection with your white blood cells, the white blood cells do not stop (when they should after the infection is beat) but instead turn and attack the myelin sheath of your nerves. Usually 5-7 days post infection ( or virus). Not months later. It starts on fingers and toes and moves inward because as the covering of your nerves are eaten off the electrical impulse can not travel through your body. Note: everyone is different. Taking antibiotics or not may not matter ( though anything\u2019s to not activate white blood cells helps). No symptoms. Just was wondering if i could still develop these diseases. If im still in a risk zone GBS ist super rare. I do not think you have to worry about it. Then do not worry about it. It is extremely rare.", "Looking to get some information, dad (age 60) was diagnosed last night and it is hitting the family hard After a serious virus my dad\u2019s neurologist has started treatment for GBS. He has lost the ability to walk, can barely speak and I know this will be a long road. Any advice or knowledge that you can spread to me would be greatly appreciated  I can only speak to some things as I was a weird one off when it came to GBS.  I had a variant that took me from pins and needles in my pinky fingers to slurred speak and unable to get out of bed in \\~3 days.  My understanding is most other folks take longer to get into this state.  The fears as they were explained to me is long term damage from things happening over this longer period.  With my quick fall, I also had a quick turn around after starting plasmapheresis.  Since I did not have this longer damaging period, I turned around very quickly, and have very little in the way of life changes following my GBS bout in 2010 (aged 35).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that said I will answer anything I can or try and point you to information if you can give an idea of what you want to know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinding out I was dealing with GBS was scary, but at the same time having a understanding of what the hell was going on was also good. Hi, I am currently in the recovery process of GbS. Unfortunately this syndrome is so rare there is not much on it. I live maryland and I know the NIH with put you in a study group if you reach out to them the first few days after the first symptom. \n\nI was 25 when I got it and in matter of 8 hours I was paralyzed from the waist down. I was on a weekend getaway to New York and had just arrived 6 hours earlier. It is a pretty scary thing to go through. Just keep a positive attitude from what I have researched every patient gets better, to what extent, that depends on the person.  Every case is different. I equate it to your immune system going into overdrive and starting to tackle your myelin sheathing. As such, there is a general trend, but it can be entirely inconsistent.\n\nMy advice is to keep it light as best you can. Realize that dad is going to have to recover and no one has any real control over that until he starts doing PT. And even then, recovery is varied. Soft things (blankets, socks, whatever), simple pleasures (chocolate was my wife's), and audiobooks were things that kept my wife going. Find out what matters to him (maybe he wants a good, hot shave once a week), and do that - keep him feeling human and normal. Homemade meals help too. \n\nTLDR: no one has a lot of control, so just make him comfortable as best as possible. Its long, scary, and uncertain, but there is not much to do now.\n\nEdit: Again, recovery is incredibly varied - it took my wife 6 days to recover and be discharged, and then 3 months of PT. She has few lingering affects. Her mid-60s advisor had it later in life and her recovery was slower and her feet still tingle frequently. Dad will have his own variety.\n\nWe are rooting for you, Dad. \u2764 Since he has been diagnosed he will recover.  You are over the scary part, not knowing. My family kept a calendar by my bed and they would write what was happening that day. Sometimes it was world events, sometimes it was something happening to me. My sister wrote once...bad poop day..I had terrible constipation because I was bedridden for  almost 30 days.  You have family that is the greatest healing power.   I am currently recovering from GBS and my advice is based on my experience. I wish you and your family the best. \n\nCommunication: Between the tracheotomy and paralysed facial muscles, I could not talk. My hands were weak and I could not type. But I could hear, and I could use one hand to sign the alphabet (American sign language) to talk to my family. It was slow but it was something. \n\nComfort: being paralysed, I could not adjust position or blankets if I was uncomfortable. A spinal nurse showed my family how to pull and straighten the sheets for me because sometimes, it could be a tiny ruffle or fold that is causing a lot of irritation. Pillow position was a huge source of discomfort for me. Be aware and ask the patient, especially if they are in bed for most of the day. Hand or foot massages were also welcomed. \n\nSupport from friends and family: I was fortunate enough to have family who actively visited and helped on a practical level like canceling subscriptions, communicating with work or doctors etc. \n\nSupport for friends and family: GBS is a marathon, so make sure caregivers are taking the tine to recharge. \n\nEntertainment: I listened to a lot of books and podcasts. I had an iPhone with lots of data, and had voiceover turned on so I could use it while blind (I could not open my eyes). It took a lot of practice but gave me a lot of independence. I even taught myself to text while blind, which let me communicate to friends. \n\nI am sorry your dad is going through this. It sucks.

My wife is starting IVIG therapy soon for CIDP. I have Carefirst for health insurance and CVS Caremark for prescriptions. Is IVIG therapy through health or prescription coverage? In my experience, it will be rejected if they try to send it through your pharmacy plan because it is not on the covered formulary list. My IG infusions are covered through my health insurance.\n\nWord of advice...reach out to the insurance company before the therapy begins to make sure all the i's are dotted to give yourself peace of mind that it is covered and they have all the documentation they need. What country are you from? Questions like these are country specific. Sorry. USA Your doctors office will handle authorization and the Ig sent directly to wherever yout infusions take place.  Just be aware if you have not met your out of pocket / deductible you will be billed until you reach that. In my case I reach my $8500 by the first week of February I hope you have better insurance! I have $0 deductible luckily. Hi! We have carefirst thru Maryland and interested to hear your experience. My neurologist prescribed ivig 2 months ago (I have a strange type of sjogrens and small fiber neuropathy and muscle loss in my neck/tongue/arm that has only partially responded to a year of steroids+cellcept so IVIG was next step).\n\nCarefirst and CVS is a nightmare. Carefirst uses outside neurologists to review the case for prior authorization. They said the denied it first because they could not get ahold of my doctor. Then after getting ahold of him, they denied it again. They use \u201coutside neurologists\u201d to review it but after searching the name of the doctor that reviewed it, they use these doctors that testify on behalf of State Farm etc. \u201cneurologists\u201d. \n\nI am 33 with 3 small kids and previously totally healthy and the rheumatologist and neurologist at a top hospital said this was the best thing and Carefirst still denied it because there was not \u201cstrong evidence in clinical trials it provides benefit\u201d. \n\nI have never really experienced health insurance debacles so maybe this happens all the time and I am being unnecessarily harsh on them, but just wanted to share so you are prepared and work quickly. I kind of twiddled my thumbs the past two months thinking surely they would not let me just waste away and would eventually sort it out. But that is not the case and if you try to ask any questions to trouble shoot, it is as if they have specifically been told not to answer anything and he as unhelpful as possible so as not to say the wrong thing. \n\nThis practice really needs to change, it is a mess. \n\nBut this is the phone number to deal with prior authorizations:appeals for cvs/Caremark 888-877-0518 That sounds so awful. Hoping that you can get the care you need. I also have Carefirst in VA, and have always had good experiences with them ... until I was diagnosed with CIDP.  Your neurologist must do every test in the world to rule out other illnesses before they will approve IVIG.  It took about a month for me to get approved after 2 months of tests.  I am now on Hizentra which works better for me.  It took about 2-3 weeks to approve it.  \n\nI also was recently diagnosed with narcoplepsy.  Carefirst through CVS Caremark (name needs changed) absolutely refuses to pay for meds they know work.  They want me to try a stimulant that my doctor wrote a letter saying it was a health risk.

What differences did you feel ?  Here is a link for any of you that do not know  what IVIG is.", "Diagnosed a month ago. So Reddit never ceases to amaze me. I type in Guillain Barre and there is a sub reddit. So my story starts in November, right before Thanksgiving. At this point I was running 5 miles every other day, weight training the other days and in pretty good shape physically for a 53 yr old man.I was having problems stretching and feeling extremely tired for a few weeks. I ended up getting severe headaches, followed by a severe rash and swollen Lymph Nodes. I was given a course of Prednisone, which I had a bad reaction to. By the time I was at the end of the course I could not walk.I ended up in the hospital for a couple days and I had MRI\u2019s, CT Scans, and X- rays done. I was released from the hospital because I was able to get around without falling after a few days and everyone assumed I had Lymphoma, so I had to get on board with an Oncologist. I had a pet scan done and was told it was most likely Lymphoma. My walking ended up getting worse and my back was killing me, I had pain shooting down my arms and legs and also could not feel my hands or feet so I ended up in the hospital again. I had more MRI\u2019s, and Ct scans done along with bloodwork, 2 Spinal Taps and had 2 Lymph Nodes removed. 2 weeks in the hospital and it was determined that I had no signs of Lymphoma but had elevated levels of protein in my spinal fluid and I was released because  my walking had improved and to get some out patient testing. I had  no diagnosis from Neurology, Oncology and Infectious Disease.. I had a follow up with Neurology and it was determined I had Guillain Barre. The swollen Lymph Nodes were from what they determined was Mono, which triggered the Guillain Barre. The rash was from some medication they gave me. It is been a crazy ride so far but at least I know what I am dealing with and no cancer. I cannot believe how weak I still am after 2 months. Walking is still an issue, sometimes I feel like I cannot get one foot in front of the other. My feet are still a bit numb and I am still in a good amount of pain. I also have some issues with uncontrollable shaking. PT 3 days a week along with home rehab. I feel like I am never going to recover, very frustrating but I am staying the course. They have me Neurontin, Lyrica, and Morphine to deal with the pain. I am hoping to improve a little quicker and get back to work but I am a slave to this thing. Weirdest thing I have ever had to deal with.  Glad to hear you are doing better! Did they give you IVIG or plasmapheresis? It kind of sounds like they did not do much to actually combat the GBS, and both of those help. Maybe asking your neuro would be helpful?  It was brought up but the Neurologist said I seemed to be progressing pretty well without anything else. I have since felt like I have hit a wall and not made the leaps I would been hoping for. I am going to bring it up at my next appointment and see what he says. I feel like by the end of every day the nerves in my back are flaring up so I cannot get comfortable. All he is said is it is going to take time for the nerves to regenerate and be patient with it. He also said to not over do it at home until my body feels a little better. It is currently a chore to workout with 10lb weights where I used to use 40lbs. Soooo weak. Definitely advocate for yourself. I was really lucky with my neuro, she has given me 2 additional IVIG treatments after leaving the hospital because she said there is no point in sitting around and being miserable if I am still having issues. It does take time for the myelin to grow back, no doubt. It took about a year for me to not have constant nerve pain. I had back pain also, but after my 2nd IVIG that went away. I know exactly what you mean about being weak. It is super frustrating. Keep pushing through though! Feel free to reach out if you ever need to vent or anything like that!!  Definitely going to ask. I guess I am expecting too much too soon being only 2 months into it. Thanks for the support!!! It is a long journey. I have had two gruesome \"adventures\" with GBS (one totally paralyzed me another darn close to total paralysis) and it helped me to think about all that my body is doing to understand why it is so slow. When you are recovering what you are really doing is growing new nerve coverings (Mylan sheath). It is like being pregnant and growing a new body (baby) -- trust me, done that twice and I was super tired then too. Growing new stuff takes energy. It is like running a marathon every day just on the inside your body where you are not seeing it. Visualize the work your body is doing. Stay positive. This too shall pass. I am rooting for you.  Thank You, It is just a very frustrating process. Nice to know there is a support group here that understands what I am going through. Yes you are expecting too much. A positive outlook is good, but realize how much your body has to do to get better. With a disease like GBS there is so little to go on.  There is not an established unit of measure, or rate of recovery.  Everyone feels it and recovers differently.  Setting goal is good, but do not set yourself up for failure. I was told to set goal outside of the GBS. Make something, learn a new skill, take up an instrument, find something to set goal for that are not related to physical activity.  Especially if you were a physical person. You have to readjust your mind to know that you MAY never get back to where you started. But then you might. Lots of  support on this site. Hang in there. I am also 53, was diagnosed 4 years ago with Miller Fisher, GBS, and bilateral Bells Palsy. You will get used to the chronic pain, do not take morphine. You will get addicted. It is not worth it. I take daily B12 shots. You can buy it over the Internet. That is the ONLY medicine that actually does something. If you have trouble walking I highly recommend vibrant five fingers shoes   . The sensory feedback is like walking barefoot, and you will walk much better. Gabapentin did nothing for me. Give yourself daily B12 shots, and it will help. Doctors will not prescribe that much, and insurances will not pay for more than one shot per week, so you have to pay cash for it, but it will help the healing. Good luck and stay strong! You are very very fortunate. The fact that you were athletic before is going to make a tremendous different in the rate at which your recovery progresses. I know it sounds strange, but the fact that you can both lift 10+ lbs, and walk (albeit w difficulty) is an indication that you are doing fairly well. I was weak for like a year post onset as an example. This is a great community, and I would also suggest and encourage you to explore the GBS groups on FB as well. The ( foundation is also an amazing resource as well. Godspeed on your recovery. I am learning to not really set goals so much as see where I am at the end of the week. I guess small gains are better than none. Funny you mentioned an instrument. I have played guitar for 40 years and just picked it back up after this whole event. Now I have gone times when I do not play for a period of time, and get my chops back pretty quickly. I now feel like my fingers do not want to go where my brain is telling them to, so although I know the chords and how to play them, my fingers are not reacting. I feel like I am learning all over again on that front. I am hoping that improves with time too. Thanks for the support !!! Yeah I only take the Morphine when the pain is unbearable, usually before bed so I can get some rest. I have only been on the Gabapentin for a month but I am starting to feel like it does not do much too. I go to pain management next week so I will bring it up when I go. I will ask about the B-12. Thanks for the feedback !!! I will definitely check that out. Thanks for the information!!! As a GBS and TBE (tick borne encephalitis) survivor (ICU for a month + 5mos in hospital, was pretty much quadriplegic for a few months) who is had to learn to walk again, I also recommend the Vibram \"shoes\" for walking, if you live in some place warm :P \n\n2\u00bd yrs after my diagnosis I walk like a boss, but have worsening nerve damage in my elbows that leaves 2 of my fingers in both hands numb. Also, my shoulder muscles are pretty much gone, just bone there, so I cannot really lift my arms. My left bicep's pretty much gone, and so are some random muscles all around my body. In addition to that, fatigue is a major problem that I have been battling with for like 2yrs now. Working 50% atm, but that is too much. I will probably going to have to retire at the ripe old age of 37.\n\n&lt;- compared to that you are doing well, and I will keep my fingers crossed / believe you are going to make a full recovery!  \n A lot of the pain that comes with this, does go away. Although some can hang around. I am ten years out and my feet are still messed up. I define it more as a numbness rather than use the word pain.  One of the things the doctors did for me was to stop all medications as soon as they could. Especially the morphine. Once they thought the drugs were out of my system, I could establish a pain baseline. It was surprising how little meditation I needed, was not long before I quit the meds altogether. That is me, medication and pain management is a very personal thing.  Glad to hear you found your music again.  Keep up the hard work. GBS is terrifying. I got it when I was 27 from a severe respiratory virus. It progresses so fast. At first you cannot really use your hands, and then your thighs feel like they are filled with sand. \nOn day 2 I could not really walk up the stairs, and I had to call 911 to get me in the house. \nI got stuck on the couch and was ten to the emergency room. They had me walk around the nurses station and then sent me home with flexeril. \nThe next day I could barely walk and I got stuck again. It took an hour to get up and then I fell. I could not even drag myself. \nI was given an array of tests. Cat scan, multiple painful spinal taps, Electromyography ( which is extremely painful), Nerve conduction studies, breathing tests, blood tests, and reflex tests. \nBefore diagnosis I was becoming paralysis on my ride side. I could barely hold my arm up and it just went down. I could not move in the bed. My toes were tingling. It was terrifying. \nThe IVIG did wonders. I was still using a walker for a month and doing physical therapy. It took about  4 months to get back to normalish. It is been years and now I am fine. \nOP, I understand the terror and pain. I hope you feel better. I am so sorry you went through that. Stay positive even when you feel terrible. It is important to not focus on the bad.  When you got your first IVIG treatment, did you feel something right away? Nothing major, just a little stronger. I noticed something the next day after the first treatment. I did not have as much pain as I was still extremely weak after leaving the hospital. Did you have a stomach virus first, or a respiratory virus? As I said earlier stomach viruses cause much more severe gbs.  Thank you, I am taking my slow, small improvements as a good sign. I am starting to realize it is going to take a while to get back to normal so as long as I keep improving I am keeping a positive attitude. Starting to be able to walk without holding on to something and being able to go longer distances so I am hoping to get back to work in a month or so. I am counting myself extremely lucky I did not get it worse and hopefully it never rears it is ugly head again. No problem :). I get afraid that someday I will relapse as well. It is a slow recovery, but I did eventually get back to where I was before gbs. \nIt was so terrifying because in the hospital I could feel the paralysis starting to affect my feet. \nI was actually afraid to fall asleep out of fear that I would wake up and be unable to walk. \nYou are lucky, because if someone waits too long before they go to the hospital they can end up on a respirator. \nWith physical therapy and simple exercises you can do at home such as sitting up and down on a couch will really help. \nAlso if you start feeling a cold or getting flu like symptoms, go to the doctor. \nA year ago I started to feel tingling in my right arm, so I  went to the doctor. I had a fever so they suggested I go to the ER. I had an Electromyography, and it turned out I was okay. \nThe ER doctor told me that if you get sick, you may experience some minor gbs symptoms since it is incurable. Good luck :).  I did not notice anything, but my first 3 IVIG treatments were when I was in the SICU and I was not getting up for PT during them, and I also got them 3 days in a row. I noticed more after the 3rd one, only because I went from not being able to feel my arms to feeling like there were bugs under my skin lol. I do not know what virus I had, something that gave me a fever and a headache. That was all I had until the tingling started, but my GBS onset was really rapid, 5 days from normal to unable to stand and getting taken to the ER by ambulance.  Bugs under your skin omg! That sounds like torture. But it is better to feel something than nothing at all. I feel so lucky that I still had some feeling, and did not feel agitated from the treatments. I could still stand, but just barely. I had these red hospital socks on that meant I was at risk of falling. I needed someone to pull me out of bed, and walk me to the bathroom. PT was scary because I felt like I was going to fall. That belt thing is not reassuring at all. I remember being on IVIG for 5 days. \nMy throat hurt as bad as it ever had before. Coughing was excruciating in my throat and chest. Then it went away, and I swear it was one or two days later that I experienced symptoms. \nIt is so scary how rapid it was. The weakness started in my right hand, and spread like wildfire. \nYou will get through this. It is hard work. Really hard. But the majority of sufferers go on to make great recoveries. :)  i literally could not stand or walk on my own and had plasmapharesis and the next day I stood up.  I ended up having seven treatments of full body plasmapharesis and walked out of the hospital one month after I went in. I would definitely investigate it because it worked wonders for me. Good luck!  It is SLOW going but you appreciate things so much more.  Take care of yourself and do not rush!", "Could nerve pain mean GBS is striking again? Hey, so I had GBS in late 2017/early 2018. I dealt with nerve pain my feet and hands during and after, and after I got better I still had pain in my feet mostly. Would be pain, vibrating feeling, tightness. I cannot say when exactly but they had stopped hurting for the most part. Maybe random numbing spells or a shooting pain, but nothing consistent like before. For about the last week almost my feet have been vibrating off and on, there is pain off and on, and that tightness off and on. Mostly seems on.\n\nI am not on medication anymore as I hated having to crush up those big ass pills and eat pudding (swallowing issues). Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone knows if this means it is coming back? I feel fine beyond that. No weakness or tingly, traveling up, etc. I **assume** it is just the nerve damage I now have doing it is thing, but it is now making me kind of nervous/anxious.\n\nBut, the nerve pain was definitely there like all last year and I think some of this year too but earlier on. Up until now it was nearly gone and very sporadic as mentioned.\n\nThank you. I get nerve pain when the weather's cold. Could that be the case with you as well? Only a Dr who has examined you can reassure you - so why not go get checked? I know. That will be what happens. Been having a ton of anxiety and the DR is one of those places that I am anxious about. That was the case before yeah. And that is what I have been thinking. When it would rain or get cold last year I would. But, then the pain got so much better this year I honestly do not remember if that same pain would be there. I **think** there would pain when it rained.. but, yeah the pains I am having are not new.. they just feel like they are coming back because they had left for a little while. Ugh this. The cold this year is flat out kicking my ass so hard. Yup... the shaky hands and muscle cramps are back as well. I had GBS around the same time as you. As my neurologist told me, \"welcome to having nerve damage\".\n\nYou should call your neuro and ask them, if you do not want to go into the office.\n\nBarometric pressure changes gives me the nerve pain in my feet, and fingers sometimes. My neuro said I can continue taking gabapentin if it is getting to be a problem, but if I do not want to take anything, I have to face the reality that I have nerve damage now and will occasionally have pain. I forgot I could call them. I will do that!\n\nAnd yeah, I had accepted it was something I would always just have, but when it came back it really scared me. I have been very anxious about other stuff lately as well so maybe that did it too. Thank you. I get the anxiety, sometimes it is like OH GOD, IT IS BACK. Idk how your relationship is with your neuro, but mine is fantastic and she tells me if I have a question just call or email her assistant. No use being anxious over something they can easily answer! Hah, that is me lately! Edge of my seat. I do not see them often really, but I was told I could call I think, so that is a great idea. You are right about that! From reading this sub, I think that is an incredibly common reaction and fear. It is horrible to go through and relapse is a huge fear for most of us. Thank you for sharing your stories here - it is so helpful to see what \"normal\" is for GBS survivors and helps quell those fears. Cold AND heat for me. Yay! :/ Yup :/  \nCold = pain &amp; cramps  \nHeat = extreme fatigue but no sleep", "Diagnosed today. Caught it early! Still feel like shit tho any suggestions to ease the symptoms? ", "Active Forums for CIDP? Hello everyone, I am curious if besides this subreddit and the gbs-cidp.org forum are there any other active forums where people discuss their symptoms and treatments?

If you have not been there yet try  Sorry I have searched and been unsuccessful as well.  But as a long term member of this crappy club, myself and I am sure others would be glad to try and answer questions you may have. Welcome and I am sorry you are here! Hello! There is a few Facebook groups I am a part of. I usually post in there when I have new symptoms or questions. I have had CIDP for 15 years.  Ask any questions you want.", "Mom just got diagnosed with GB Hi all. My mom had heart surgery a few weeks ago, and while recovering from that, her feet and legs went numb and then she stopped breathing. After a few days on a ventilator, she is breathing again, and they said she has GB. The plan is to discharge her in a few days to a rehab facility.\n\nI am feeling so depressed and hopeless (as is she). The recovery from GB seems so random and unpredictable. And she is 81 years old -- no spring chicken. This heart surgery was supposed to make her better, and now she may never walk again. I just cannot believe this is happening.\n\nWould appreciate any words of support or encouragement or anything else. \n\nThank you. Do NOT give up hope. Yes, GBS is a horrible diagnosis and a tough experience but she could completely recover. She needs you to be positive and be her champion. I am in my 60s and have had it twice. Both times my children were instrumental in my fight to recover and rehabilitate. They helped me stay positive and encouraged me to work hard at rehab. They were my champions and made, what could have been a very dark time, one filled with love, stories, and good energy. They would turn the rehab exercises into competitions and get me to dance and laugh even when I could barely move. Your mom needs you to be strong. She needs you to be positive and give her a gift right now: an attitude that she can grab and hang on to that will help her survive an emotionally hard time. I am telling you from being where your mom is that every word, every reaction, helped me. Think of it this way: when you are in crisis it is like you are clay and others around you mold you. I truly believe the attitude and perseverance we brought to the situation helped me recover quicker and strong. I know it is hard. You are certainly allowed to be scared. Please know that today, I am completely normal and enjoy my life without residual effects. You do not have a crystal ball -- your mom could completely recover. Be strong. Practice mindfulness and every time you feel low, take a deep breath and control your thinking so you are only thinking about the breath. Then, get back to being positive and envisioning a good outcome.\n\nYou can message me if you have questions or want to simply talk. I care deeply that I can help others in this situation as there were complete strangers who helped me. Thank you so much for the reply! I know that positive thinking is important, and I assure you, I have not revealed these depressing thoughts to her! But recovering at 81 sounds like quite a challenge and I am just not sure how much strength she will have. Plus because of COVID-19 we are not able to see her at all, either in the hospital or once she goes to rehab. So it is all over the phone, which makes everything harder. But I do appreciate your perspective very much! I am hopeful that she will have a full recovery! This situation with covid is a whole different ball game.  It is going to be hard, expect that. You know your mom the best, rely on that. Do what you know works for her. If she has a phone and uses it, that is great, that is going to be a help. She will be facing a new normal, so will you. If you have access to counselling for the whole family, make use of it. Get her doing things that she did before she got sick. If she was a marathon runner, that is not going to happen again. But if she loved to read or do puzzles or knit or listen to music, make sure she has access to these things. Try to get her own things to her in rehab, maybe her pillow or blanket or a sweater she likes.  \nGet everything in order for when she gets released. Include her in as much decision making as she is capable of. Again, go by her personality. Does she like detailed explanations or is she a just do it kind of person. \nMost importantly is to let her know you are there, listen to her. My best wishes are with you. It is so hard and I can not imagine doing it without my family by my side. I was quite the baby at times and they ( and a whole troop of friends) very much helped me. COVID adds a whole layer to it all I can not imagine. So so scary. Be kind to yourself -- allow yourself to feel and worry and not feel bad about it. Take care. I will keep writing if you need it...  Stay strong. I am so sorry. I had GB 5 years ago and it was terrifying. But as another poster said DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE. IVIG is what I was given and in 5 days I could finally get up by myself. Some people are given another treatment called\nPlasmapheresis. Both are great treatments. \nAfter getting treatment your mother will probably need a walker as I did but I promise you it is a disease that when diagnosed fast and treated fast is something you do not need to worry about. You and your mom will get through this. I was on IVIG for 5 days and then discharged. I did need a walker for a month but I am totally recovered now. Be strong for your mom. I am sending you good wishes and good vibes. I am so sorry your mom got GB. It was a very scary experience for me but those treatments are excellent. Do you know which treatment your mom is getting? Im Just curious. \nBe strong for her. I am sorry you both have to deal with this but the treatments are excellent. If you ever need to talk Pm me anytime. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Thank you! Thank you for this wonderful advice! I am already doing a lot of these things, but this is helpful to see that I am on the right track. Today she said that it seemed like her legs were a little less numb than they were yesterday, so yay for that! I think she needed this to feel that there is hope -- she sounded a tiny bit hopeful this morning! Thank you so much for your reply! My mom got plasmapheresis, and they started it immediately, so I am super hopeful that it will make a difference. And I am being as strong as I can for her! My 70 year old mother was diagnosed in October....she was intubated after 3 days and continued to breathe on a ventilator after she received a trach 2 weeks in. She was paralyzed from the neck down. She also received a feeding tube. She was in 3 different facilities- 1st was ICU, 2nd was skilled rehab witch mainly helped her get off the vent, and a 3rd in which she did mostly physical therapy. She is still not \ud83d\udcaf but have hope ... because that is all you can do. My mother also suffers from dimentia which we believe has worsened because of GBS but even still, she is getting physically stronger. Your mom has a lot of way to go and she is already wrestling with recovering from her surgery, but be positive. Play music for her. Have the doctor speak to her as if she is listening....even if she is sleeping. This was a great forum for me when I was learning about GBS and I hope it helps you also. Make sure to take care of yourself...you cannot be there for her if you are not ok. Glad to hear that! Wishing you the best. Post when you you need to. Take care of yourself too. That is great that her treatment was started immediately. I was given painful tests for two days before they decided it was GB. It will definitely make a difference that she got treatment right away. I am not sure what the difference is between IVIG and Plasmapheresis, but they are both great treatments. I really hope your mom has an easy recovery. Just out of curiosity did she get a respiratory infection before she got GB, it a stomach virus? No, I do not think so. I read that GB can occur after surgery, so I think that is what happened with her. I am so sorry for what your mother has gone through -- and you, too! But I am glad to hear she is getting stronger. Yes, I will take care of myself. I am sure I will be checking out this sub a lot. Thank you for your reply! I got GB after a really bad respiratory infection that made swallowing excruciating plus excruciating coughing and my chest hurt so bad. It went away then a couple days later I could not put my hair in a ponytail. My hands were too weak. My now husband said it was probably nothing yet the next day I could not walk up the stairs into our house ( 3 stairs). My thighs were extremely weak. Then I got stuck on the couch. My mom called 911 and the EMTs found me crying hysterically but they were TOTALLY mean. One guy meanly asked me why I was crying. It is like dude I am stuck I cannot get up!\nAt the Er the doctor did nothing but have me walk around the nurses station and then sent me home with flexeril. I thought I would just get better but by the time I was back in the hospital after being admitted I could not even hold my arm up. It kept going down. I also could not roll over in bed or get out of bed. At the Er a nice doctor asked if I would been sick recently. I said yes. She said it was probably guillain barre but I had to have tests that were so painful. One was an EMG test where they stick needles into your muscles and send electricity through them( it hurt so bad). Another was a spinal tap but the person doing it kept stabbing my spine and missing my spinal cord. They eventually had to do it using an X-ray. Gb can get serious. They said if I would waited another day I would have been on a respirator. Your mom will have pt after she gets out of the hospital and if you do not have a bar in the shower I would recommend getting one. OMG that sounds just awful! I am so sorry for all you have been through. I am so glad you have recovered! It was the sickest I have ever been. Thank god I fully recovered. Thank you for saying that, I really appreciate it \ud83d\ude0a. It was terrifying how quickly I went from having weak hands to not being able to crawl or get up off the floor that is how I ended up in the hospital the final time. I fell and literally could not move. No one was home and when the EMTs got there, but before they carried me out they questioned whether I really could not move which made me start to cry hysterically. I wanted my mom and my now husband to be there to tell them that I really could not move. I made the mistake of telling them I was on methadone because From that point until we got to the hospital (which was really close but because it was a bad winter the ambulance was driving slow) the same EMT who literally told me to try and get on the thing that looked like a throne with four poles ( it looked like a throne a queen would be carried on by 4 people) was acting extremely judgmental in the ambulance because he assumed just because I was on methadone I was a drug seeker and faking my illness. He literally told me something I will NEVER FORGET \u201cyou know you are not going to get dilaudid or anything like that so this act of yours of not being to move will not work\u201d. I did not even say anything I just started crying even harder. The asshole EMT turned to the driver and said \u201cnow she is crying because she knows she is not going to get any drugs\u201d then he LAUGHED. However when they brought me in a female doctor immediately asked if I would been sick and I said yes then she said I think you might have guillain barre. Do not worry sweetie we will take good care of you.\nI told her about the EMT saying I was lying and wanted drugs. She asked who it was and I pointed to him. She asked him to leave the room and I heard hushed yelling. I could not make out every word but the jist was the doctor telling the jerk EMT that I was most definitely not faking. He came into the room and apologized to me but I was snotty and I asked him why he thought I was faking. He said they get a lot of drug seekers and I asked if any of them faked not being able to get up or really move. He said no and I said he was a terrible EMT to mock a scared crying girl.", "How I Manage My Nerve Pain  You made me realize that I am officially old.

Aww seriously, what a saint. I hope you get your senses back soon too!! You are not alone my friendddd!! I totally feel that,Italian ice was the literal only thing besides fried rice that id eat when I first got sick.They kept a pint of it in the rehab hospital freezer for me as they were begging me to eat.Yogurt is another good one,tastes sweet and creamy but packs some nutrients I did not have too much of this thankfully!

Cardiologist is convinced that GBS is the root cause due to the way how hard it was to medicate me. Yes. I was having a lot of tachycardic episodes. This can be common during the height of the illness because of how nerves are affected. Were you hooked up to a tele-monitor? It is probably benign, but definitely bring it up at your next follow-up. I still get a fluttering feeling but have been assured it is not harmful.", "Mon-Tues severe stomach flu, friday weakness and slight abnormal feeling in legs. What to lookout for Hi there,\n\nMy father had a debilitating bout of GB in 2017 so I am acutely aware of the syndrome.. maybe to much so because now I am worried about my own well-being. I am hoping some of you can help me understand what symptoms and feelings to look out for.\n\nOn Monday night I had a severe case of the stomach flu. I was only able to keep fluids down with doses of Dramamine every 6 hours. For the first 24hr I could only drink sprite and Gatorade. Second day I managed to eat soup and yogurt. Third day out I finally ate real food. I have been essentially bed ridden until this morning (Friday).\n\nSo this is about four days after initial vomiting and GI issues, and now my GI symptoms are largely gone. I am a major proponent of exercise, so tried to go shoot hoops for some very light exercise and noticed my legs were much weaker than normal. I shrugged it off initially, but now I am a bit more worried. I have some abnormal sensitivity in my upper legs (not my feet though!). My calves and thighs are itchy/warm, but I would not describe as pins and needles.\n\nI am a snowboarder so my leg strength is crucial, so hopefully I will be able to notice any more extreme changes in strength. I really hope I am just experiencing fatigue from the illness and dehydration, but I would expect to be more affected in stamina instead of strength, which worried me. Obviously keep an eye on it, but my GBS presented as both weakness in the legs along with a loss of coordination. My gait was wrong and I could not figure out how to make myself run. If you have someone around, you can have someone check your patellar reflex.\n\nIf your only symptom is weakness, it is likely just fatigue and/or lingering dehydration. Keep an eye on it and do not force a recovery, the stomach flu can wipe you out for longer than you are expelling bodily fluids. My first symptoms were extreme soreness in my knees and inability to steady myself. I soon started grabbing walls and furniture to walk around my tiny apartment. Even fell a couple times and needed help getting up. \n\nIf your symptoms persist or get worse then call a nurse hotline or go to an urgent care or ER GBS can present with only motor abnormalities, sensory or Both. I only got weakness with no pins and needles or any other sensory deficits. However, any form of GBS can be very severe that it affects the whole body. I am not trying to scare you or anything. I am only telling you this because if you catch it early, you will be grateful for checking it out. And if it is nothing wrong there will be no harm for checking it out! So my suggestion is that you check it out just to be safe.. Yes I would be very glad to have caught it early! Unfortunately the only way to \u201ccheck it out\u201d would be to go to the ER and get an LP. I am in a small town too so finding care during the pandemic may be difficult. I will continue to closely monitor and consider finding a neurologist What is an LP?", "A reminder to get a second opinion - CIDP My wife was diagnosed with CIDP 6 months ago. She has done 4 months of IVIG so far. Finally got in for a second opinion with a great hospital and this doctor does not believe it is CIDP.  Still trying to figure out what it is. Just a reminder to always get a second opinion for something as serious as this. Um, your post is missing the punch-line. It is hard to say it is a misdiagnosis if you do not find out the actual diagnosis.\n\nThe characteristic symptom of CIDP and GBS is still severe bilateral paresis or plegia in at least one muscle group, if she had sensory neuropathy (and especially unilateral neuropathy) without paresis then it probably is not CIDP.\n\nA look at your post history and it seems other medical practitioners have ruled out multiple myeloma and paraneoplastic (cancer related) syndromes. (there are other related diseases: \n\nRecovery of nerves can cause nerve pain in some cases. This is something that IVIG will not really help with. IVIG is not the best treatment for CIDP anyway, chronic autoimmune syndromes need the B-cell feedback loop to be broken altogether, which is why therapies like Rituximab are often used.  (whereas for GBS, treatments mostly focus on blocking the effect of the pathogenic antibodies temporarily) My point is to always get a second opinion, especially with something as serious as CIDP. The doc that diagnosed her with CIDP refused to do a lumbar puncture because he said it was pointless. This new doctor did a bunch of tests and said she has sensory neuropathy. Her muscles are fine. Going to do some more tests. Yeah she could come back and say CIDP was correct. &gt;The doc that diagnosed her with CIDP refused to do a lumbar puncture because he said it was pointless. \n\nThat is something I happen to agree on. For example, the sensitivity of the lumbar puncture protein test for GBS is much lower than most physicians realise (sixty to eighty percent range) - it can be used to support a diagnosis, but cannot be used to rule it out.\n\nIf her muscles are fine, I do not think it will come back with a CIDP diagnosis, but I am curious about the answer. I will post an update when we get one", "COVID-19 Vaccines and the GBS|CIDP Community - official statement from the GBS/CIDP Foundation International  I feel like their statement does not address people who have had GBS. Sure a vaccination can cause 1 additional person out of 1 million to develop GBS, but those odds are for people who have never had GBS. Do they know what the odds are for people who have had GBS previously and then receive a vaccine?? I do not think they do, pretty sure there has not been a single study looking into that (please correct me if I am wrong). Might be because the majority of people who end up getting GBS do not get flu shots. I have had GBS twice so the probability of it reoccurring is most likely higher than the average person. Can I ask how you got it the second time? And how severe it was? I am terrified that it could happen to me again. Of course. I had an upper respiratory virus and that is what the doctors think triggered it. Both times I developed it I was completely paralyzed and could not even blink. The likelihood of it reoccurring is very very low, so you probably have nothing to worry about and I hope you never get it again. I have a lot of anxiety about it, but I try not to let that get in the way of living my life. With Covid that anxiety has definitely increased and I do not like these general statements released when they do not have data to back it up. Thanks! Yes, it is not quite the full announcement we were hoping for. It is unfortunate. I do not think they are ever going to have an answer for this one though because there is no research on how much the probability for developing GBS changes when a GBS survivors gets a flu shot. They need to state that they do not have the data, and they probably never will. I do not know how many of us would willingly participate in a study just to find that out. Not after going through this one or more times. The anxiety thing struck a chord with me. I have had GBS twice in the last decade, and the last time it struck me, it left me mentally and emotionally shattered. I have been a borderline hypochondriac (not sure if that is a clinically acceptable term) ever since, and on multiple occasions I have had phantom pains and tingling in my limbs that made me go over the entire process of getting myself tested for GBS. My doctors have dismissed this completely and told me to suck it up. Any advice on how to deal with the anxiety that makes a comeback each time I feel even the slightest tingle in my throat? This is difficult to answer. I have had very similar experiences with the phantom pains and tingling which has caused some serious panic attacks. I am not sure how quickly you developed GBS, but my onsets with GBS were extremely fast. I was completely paralyzed within 48 hours both times. So with me if I can still feel below my ankles at the end of the day the anxiety diminishes. What makes the anxiety worse is that I cannot feel parts of my feet still and they tingle a little now in certain spots. So when I am having these uncertainties my brain goes into \"are you sure the areas you could not feel have not increased?? Are you???\" It is awful.\n\nThere are a few things that have helped. One being time. It has almost been 7 years since I had GBS last. The panic/anxiety attacks happened more in the first couple years. I take anxiety medication now and take something specific if I am feeling extra anxious. It honestly has helped keep me level headed. I try my hardest not to dwell on some of these thoughts that pop into my head or focus too much on the phantom tingling/pain. When that starts happening I generally try and find something to occupy my time/brain with. I draw, paint, play music and really sing along to it, play a video game, do something athletic, find people to hangout with, literally anything that will pull my mind away from focusing on myself. I have had trouble sleeping because of this also, that is when I tend to focus on it the most. I ended up turning on a tv show I have seen a thousand times (The Office) to give my mind something else to focus on, but do not necessarily need to pay attention to and can close my eyes and drift off. I do not really drink anymore, maybe a glass of wine every so often. I know I have anxiety, and the last time I even got remotely tipsy I turned into a blubbering mess. Everything just spilled out. That seems to make it worse so I mostly just stopped doing it. People have always told me I should talk to a therapist, but I personally do not think I will benefit from that. \n\nFor me, things have gotten better. Out of everything I think taking up a new hobby helped the most. Can be very therapeutic. Dr Fauci talks about GBS and vaccine near end of this piece. Discuss with your own doctor before you decide?  Thanks for the link! Appreciate it.\n\nI do already know that I will not be getting the vaccine, at least not until there is more information on it. I have no issue with vaccinations, I get all my shots except for the flu shot because the benefit typically outweighs the risk. Though I agree, it is always important to discuss this with your doctor. \n\nWhat is unfortunate for me is my primary care decided to retire in the middle of the pandemic. Do not blame her, I definitely get it. Though it kind of sucks because I have had the same primary care since I was 16. She knew my entire history and I trusted her opinion. Need to find a new one, which is a bit daunting in the middle of a pandemic. No it is a very disappointing, unsupportive statement.\n\nIt is a statement understandably pro-vax, fine, so am I, but fails to address their fucking constituency, ***us!*** completely. This is exactly what I was saying to my boyfriend. I feel like I am trying to not be mad about their statement but it does make me mad. It has nothing to do with us and everything to do with the general population, but that is not what this foundation is supposed to be for. Plus their statement can easily be misinterpreted to saying that the vaccine is fine for people with a history of GBS to take. They have no evidence to prove or disprove that so they should not even be remotely suggesting it is fine. to echo you, yes, what you just wrote, exactly, but yours was far better, very well put, my thoughts exactly, thank you My mother died of GBS and I have CIDP. Wish there was more research.", "What can I expect during recovery ", "Weight gain after illness? Hi. Last year our then 19 year old daughter caught a bad cold in her first few days at university and soon after found her walking ability started to deteriorate.\n\nThat progressed to losing the ability for both eyes to look the same way and she lost focus when looking at things and ultimately could not walk unaided or could not stand bright lights or read or even feed herself and she also lost her reflexes which still have not come back 11 months later. \n\nShe was diagnosed with Miller Fisher Syndrome which I understand is a rare variant of Guillain-Barre Syndrome. \n\nShe had four IVIG treatments and left hospital after about ten days and slowly has made it back to normal. \n\nShe dropped out of her course at university and is due to start a new course later this month. \n\nHowever since becoming ill these things have changed:\n\n1. She has irregular periods, often up to a month late. \n\n2. She overheats so we can be walking the dog and the rest of us have a coat on and she is wearing a T-shirt. \n\n3. Her face became more round. \n\n4. She put on weight around her tummy only and often has bloating issues after eating only a small amount of food. \n\n5. She has stretch marks on her stomach and legs. \n\n6. She is often very low emotionally and finds it hard to react to small things going wrong without taking it personally and seeing it as more evidence of why she is rubbish etc. \n\nSome of the above are symptoms for Cushings but she has had blood tests for that and all came back normal. \n\nI wondered if anyone else has suffered with any of the above after their illness?\n\nDespite any evidence to the contrary our daughter will not give herself a break at all and insists any changes are due to her low amount of willpower and over eating despite the fact she eats no more than the rest of the people in her family.\n\nIt may be even if people here respond to say they had the same issues she will not take any comfort from that but I feel compelled to act from the point of view of a concerned parent.\n\nAny advice would be very much appreciated. \n\nThanks! I think your daughter needs therapy. This is not just any other Illness. It is extremely traumatizing losing the ability to do basic things without the assistance of a nurse or caretaker. \n\nYour daughter may be depressed. I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD after being in the hospital (I also had Miller Fisher but was intubated and in the hospital for a month and a half). This disease can have seriously lasting effects. \n\nPlease have your daughter seek counseling immediately. Speak with her neurologist or primary care physician, provide as much support as possible to her, and be patient. \n\nI wish you and her the best of luck and I hope everything gets better. Hi  thanks very much for your reply. \n\nI should have said that she has tried a couple of therapists but without any success unfortunately.\n\nShe finds it hard to handle them because they are person centred counselling sessions and so the therapist does not provide answers. She finds she does not know what to say and so they tend to fizzle out. \n\nI agree though that I think she is depressed I am just unsure how to know how to proceed as she will not admit what a serious illness she had and what an impact it has had in her life.\n\nShe just sees herself as weak and will not give herself a break in terms of admitting that the repercussions she has suffered are due to anything except her own shortcomings. \n\nI am sorry to hear of your illness and the impact that it had in your life and I do appreciate you taking the time to reply and offer your advice. \n\nThanks I am glad she is at least tried therapy. Have you tried to find support groups in your area? It does not have to be specifically for Guillain Barre, but neurological disorders in general. \n\nOne thing that helped my recovery after I was discharged was going back to the hospital and speaking with current patients. I know this me tough given the current situation of the word, but it might be worth it. \n\nIf she has not already, I would consider medication as well. It is not for everybody, but it can do a load of good. Hello again :-) We live in a pretty rural area and the local hospital does not really get many cases like GBS unfortunately. She is also so sure she is being a hypochondriac that she would not go even if there were I do not think. \n\nI think the fact her body changed a lot after the illness had compounded the impact it has had which is why I was interested to see if other people who have suffered with GBS or similar noticed similar changes after the illness.\n\nShe had to drop out of university and sees herself as fat and greedy when these changes are not through any fault of her own. Trying to get her to see that though is easier said than done.\n\nWe will have to keep trying and to be patient like you say.\n\nThanks again :-) I will start off by saying, I am just a survivor of GBS, not a medical professional at all. When I had GBS, it was *extremely* traumatic. I often had panic attacks, and the rehabilitation hospital actually brought in a psychologist to speak with me. I also went to counseling after I was discharged. It is a huge life event, and I needed help getting through it. Have you/your daughter considered getting counseling to deal with the traumatic medical event? It sounds like she is being extremely hard on herself, which again, is echoes of some of the feelings I had during my GBS experience. \"I should just be able to...\" \"There is no reason I cannot just...\" all common thoughts that I had at the time. You understand that you *should* be able to do these things, and it is extremely frustrating to not have control over your body. It takes a while to get back to a place where you are not scared/worried that your body will betray you again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding the physical concerns, is your daughter still seeing a neurologist? I would HIGHLY encourage follow ups with a neuro if she has concerns. They will be able to tell you if the issues are within the \"normal\" range. There really is not a normal because it is all different, but if they are impacting her this much, I would definitely check in with a neuro, or even her primary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can tell your daughter, I had the irregular periods, overheating, and the emotional difficulty too. I had stretch marks before, so unsure if I had new ones after GBS. Remind her, and remind yourself also, she went through a traumatic medical event. It is truly a *traumatic* event. A little forgiveness for herself, while adjusting to the \"new normal\", is the best thing she can do for herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to message me if you or she have additional questions, or want some support. My periods have always been super irregular, so I cannot really help with that. \n\nI did develop serious temperature regulation issues. When I get cold, I am freezing. And I overheat like crazy. To the point where I cannot take hot showers anymore. \n\nAlso gained a lot of weight... I have tried dieting, supplements, and doing what exercise I am able to do. But no luck. Cannot lose, cannot stop gaining. I have stretch marks everywhere, have had to replace my entire wardrobe, and barely recognize myself. I hate it. I hate looking in the mirror. I hate looking at how big my clothes are. I hate how no matter what i do, I am helpless to stop it. Does not help that my husband is having some hormonal issues that have tanked his libido. So I know in my head that it is not that he is not attracted to me, but it FEELS like it is. The only plus side is that the weight has distributed evenly.\n\nI have been struggling a lot with depression too... And fear. Fear has never been a problem for me before because I could take care of myself. But now? There are a lot of things that have happened in my life that if they happened now I would not be able to walk away from. Or, y'know, survive. Then there is the absolute terror of \"what if it happens again?\" My husband and I still have nightmares about it. I honestly would rather die than go through this again. It is hell. Pure hell. I have never been so afraid of something in my life as I am of a relapse. Hi there. Thanks very much for taking the time to send such a thoughtful reply. \n\nOur daughter has not seen a neurologist since she was signed off in January. It would be interesting to see what a neurologist would make of the post illness issues she is experiencing.\n\nThat is a good idea re going back to the doctor about the issues she is having.\n\nThanks again and also for your offer of support, your words of encouragement are very reassuring. Hi. Thanks very much for your reply. I am sorry to hear of the post illness issues you have suffered with.\n\nGBS is an awful thing to have to go through and I hope that with time things improve for you.\n\nIt sounds tough for you and I appreciate you taking the time to reply.\n\nTake care and thanks again. And just to be clear she is not taking steroids currently? ^.^  We are getting by here. The big thing is to keep on keeping on. But it is also important to not sugarcoat stuff. Especially not with each other. It is one of those things that people on the outside can never fully grasp. And one of the hardest parts is knowing that you used to be easily able to do the things that you are struggling with now. And, honestly, it is important to see that other people are struggling too. That you are not alone. Hi. That is right, she is not taking steroids currently or any other medication. Thanks Has she had her thyroid hormone levels checked? I had GBS (Miller-Fisher) and that resulted in Hashimoto's Thyroiditis/ Hypothyroidism. I have been taking thyroid meds since. Hi. Sorry for the slow reply. Yes she has had that checked back in December 2019 and her thyroid levels were normal. Sorry to hear about your related health issue from getting poorly. Thanks again. Has she been checked for PCOS? These symptoms sound similar to that. \n\nI also second the idea for therapy - GBS can be devastating, as your own body turns against you and you lose autonomy. Check out CBT therapy.

It is a very relaxed role.", "Currently in ER potentially with GBS Last weekend I woke up but my toes felt as if they were asleep and the sensation never went away. Over the week the tingly feeling has traveled up my legs to the my torso and this morning down to my fingers. A couple days ago i noticed my right eye twitching pretty often and a strange pain when swallowing almost like I swallowed too much food at once. I dont think I have any weakness in my legs though possibly my arms do. I went to urgent care today and the Dr said he thinks its GBS and I need to go to the ER as it may continue to my lungs. With Covid it is a very long wait. I have already had a CT SCAN and blood work. Is there anything I should make sure to ask about when I finally see a dr? Plasma phoresis treatment can help and should be a short term treatment. IVIG is another but secondary treatment may help too. Your greatest weapon is a positive attitude toward recovery. Best wishes for speedy recovery! Most of the time GBS is diagnosed by ruling out all other options rather than a definitive test (although high protein levels from a spinal tap can be an indicator). A lot of general practice doctors are not familiar with GBS (in my experience) so ask if you can be evaluated by a neurologist (hopefully they will do this already). That being said you will probably have to go through a number of more tests and it might take a couple of days before you can start treatment for GBS if that is what you end up being diagnosed with so do not be discouraged. As u/cousinjoe05 said, GBS is often diagnosed after ruling out every other possibility. My husband had all regular tests done at the ER (CT scan, MRI, bloodwork, etc) and they showed nothing wrong... even though his arms &amp; legs were completely paralyzed. \n\nThe fact that you are having difficulty swallowing is pretty concerning. When my husband was in the hospital, the neurologist was worried that the paralysis would spread from his limbs into his chest, and so would always ask him to inhale/exhale, move his neck/shoulders, and swallow when he checked on him each day. \n\nSee if you can contact the doctor who saw you at the UTC and ask if they can get you an appt with a neurologist at a hospital, based on his observations &amp; diagnosis. If they cannot do that, call your PCP, tell them what is going on, and see if they can get an emergency appt with a neurologist. The two tests that can usually indicate GBS when nothing else does is a nerve conduction test and a spinal tap. \n\n\nPlease keep an eye on yourself and continue to monitor your symptoms. If swallowing becomes more difficult or you are having a harder-than-normal time breathing, please get to the ER immediately. Wishing you the best of luck and a speedy recovery. You got this dude. I dealt with this. You will recover!! Spinal tap. The fact that you are having trouble swallowing is problematic 100%. If I were you, I would not wait too much longer before heading to the ER, even if there is a long wait. Or start calling up neurologists tomorrow morning to get into an emergency appointment ASAP. \n\nAsk for plasmapheresis or IVIG. Neither is a cure (because there is not a cure for GBS), but it does help stop/slow the progression. As u/jrodermatt said, your greatest weapon is a positive attitude! And a little bit of patience too. With GBS it is a slow recovery, but recovery happens. You can do it! Are you in the hospital now? A nerve conduction study (EMG) can indicate GBS along with a spinal tap.  Good luck! Yup, I am waiting in the neurology consult now Great I could not tell by the post if you were still there. I am glad you are getting help. Hopefully they are able to make conclusive decisions and get you all the help you need. Advocate for yourself. Ask tons of questions, such as- explanation for a test they want to do, what does it help them determine, etc. When you are getting discharged make sure and ask what signs and symptoms should you look for that would be an indication you need to come back to the hospital vs. seeing a doctor. Tell them about every thing you feel, even if it seems minor. Agree! That is what worked for me in my diagnosis, as lungs and MRI were clear. Did your numbnesss or tingling come and go over the days?", "Do I have GBS or CIDP? Hi everyone. TL;DR: It is been just shy of 3 years since I first felt my GBS symptoms, and I am doubting that I have GBS and wondering if I have CIDP instead. I have always had a mild case of GBS and have had no hospital stays, treatment, or physical therapy.\n\nI got the flu shot in early January 2018 and started feeling strange a few days later. It started with pins-and-needles feelings in my feet and legs, and spots on my body that felt cold or wet even though there was nothing there. I also started feeling weak in my arms, neck, and legs during that first week or so. From the very beginning, my symptoms have come and gone throughout the day. I would go to work for a few hours and then all of a sudden, I would be unable to hold my head up or use my arms and had to have someone pick me up from work because I was too weak to drive home by myself. Sometimes I would feel pretty much normal only an hour or two later, and other times it would last for days.\n\nBefore my diagnosis, I saw a few different types of doctors and had MRIs and lab work and allergy tests. I also went to the ER once because my episode/attack was so severe that I could not even hold my mouth closed because I felt so weak and could barely walk. They ran a bunch of tests but did not suspect GBS at the time so I went home with no diagnosis. Eventually I got a referral to see a neurologist, who suspected it was GBS. I was fortunate to never be hospitalized because I had a mild case and so much time had already passed since I first felt symptoms. \n\nWhen I say \u201cweak\u201d I mean that I have a hard time walking, cannot use my hands or arms normally, cannot keep my head upright, etc. I also normally have the sensation of being underwater or like everything is in slow motion. I also sometimes have tingly feelings, feelings or burning or cold/wet on my skin, and brain fog. These are my symptoms along with extreme fatigue. \n\nDuring the first 6 months, I would be weak for a few days at a time and then normal for a few days and the cycle would continue. Then I went almost two months with absolutely no weakness or tingly feelings or nerve pain and I was SO HAPPY! On the 4th of July that year, my boyfriend and I camped out on the hills for a few hours above the golden gate bridge in San Francisco to watch fireworks and it was absolutely freezing cold (probably 20 degrees with the wind chill). I had also had some wine and then we got in the car and blasted the heater to warm up. This triggered the worst episode I have ever had. I could not use my arms or hands long enough to take a bite of food, or brush my hair, or go to the bathroom by myself and I could barely walk. This lasted about 4 days until I finally recovered.\n\nI told my neurologist about this and he started to suspect CIDP, and I finally had a spinal tap in November 2018 (10 months after I first felt symptoms) and he confirmed that I had GBS but not CIDP. Since then, my episodes have come and gone and have been getting less frequent and lasting much less time for the most part. The way I understand it, my symptoms have never been severe enough for treatment so I have never had any kind of treatment except a prescription for gabapentin to use every once in a while when I get those tingly or hot/cold skin feelings.\n\nIt will be three years in January since I started feeling symptoms and I am currently in one of the longest episodes I have ever had. I got weak again a few days before Thanksgiving and it has lasted until now (Christmas was a few days ago). In the past 5-6 weeks, there have been less than 5 days where I have felt completely normal all day. I am seeing a new neurologist in a few weeks to see if he thinks I can benefit from some treatment or if I have CIDP. \n\nI just have the feeling that this should not be happening if it was GBS, although I know my GBS is different from most peoples. What do you think? Mine also did not follow a normal course. Initially diagnosed as GBS then changed to CIDP. It sounds like most definitely you need some treatment. My understanding is the less severe and the more recurring the symptoms, the more likely it is CIDP. I had the worst case scenario GBS August 2018; I was sick the week before, felt better for one day, then my legs started collapsing out from under me. Within 48 hours, I was completely paralyzed and had to be intubated. I had both of the treatments because the first one did not work. I was in the hospital then inpatient physical rehab for 2 months, then had to stay with family 2 more months until I was able to go up and down steps. Fortunately I have completely recovered, besides the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (I include the brain fog with that), numb toes and achy wrists, I have not experienced any major weakness like you are experiencing, and based on everything I have read, I would definitely talk to your doctor, because you likely will need occasional treatments of some kind with CIDP. It could be something else. \n\nGBS is due to axon or myelin damage and the symptoms only improve slowly, there is no cycling between feeling normal and weak/paralysed in time frames of hours to a few days.\n\nHaving said that, prolonged severe fatigue including brain fog can be a long term consequence of both CIDP and GBS.\n\nA 'positive' result on the lumbar puncture would have revealed an elevated protein level, but this is non-specific and does not automatically imply GBS. One of the CIDP subtypes therefore is much more likely, or some other spine related pathology. That is interesting, I have never thought of it that way. Any guesses as to which subtype, or other disorder? Having initially being diagnosed with GBS and the CIDP what you have is CIDP. This is pure speculation and I am not a medical doctor, but...\n\nThe cycling of symptoms suggest something more along the lines of conduction block, rather than substantial inflammation. Perhaps akin to myasthenic syndromes (such as Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome).\n\nThe scholarly literature discusses conduction blocks due to anti-neurofascin and anti- contactin-1 autoantibodies. There have been cases of positive tests for anti-neurofascin antibodies in some CIDP patients even 20+ years after initial onset. (Which suggests a chronic B-cell autoimmune disorder and suggests treatments like Rituximab)\n\nThe problem in general is that these cases are very rare and neurologists have very little clinical experience to base their decisions on. Extensively reading the primary (peer-reviewed) medical literature can help, but most medical practitioners rarely do this, citing limited time etc. In puzzling cases, do neurologists tend to be conservative with treatment, i.e. do they not take risks if they do not know exactly what it is they are treating? Or do they usually take a stab at some kind of treatment just because doing nothing can be harmful? Hey, did you have any permanent side effects after the spinal tap? Nope, none at all! It hurt for a few days but that is the only thing. Cool. Just asking around to make a decision whether to do it lol I would say just make sure it is worth it to you! It is not a fun procedure, I cannot even really sugarcoat it. It is hurts and you are sore for days. But if it will help you get better, absolutely worth it I do not mind being on the bed for a week..I just do not want some lingering symptom in case they mess up haha I hear ya! Although I have to say I was not even in that much pain to stay in bed except for the day of the procedure, it was mostly soreness Cool. Thanks for your input!", "Could this be GBS. Started two and a half weeks ago after a Remicade Infusion. Now have tingling So on the 21st September I had a Remicade Infusion for Chrons Disease and later that night had some diherera and that is when the firdt symptoms started.\nI developed a rapid flucatiiting heart rate which went as high as 130 upon standing. This subsided and I felt weak for the rest of the week until it happened again and its been happening more frequently the last couple of days and has not stopped. When I stand up my heart rate jumps from a normal resting heart rate to a high one within seconds and my blood pressure goes up by a lot as well. 2 days ago is when the tingling and numbness started. It feels harder to walk and I have problems with bending my fingers to type as I do not feel like I have the strength in them. Can you get heart rate fluctuations upon standing with GBS. All my heart tests have come back fine and bloods are normal so they do not know what it is that is causing me to have a rapid heart rate and the tingling in my legs and hands That sounds like an allergic reaction. Heart rate, tingling, stiff joints all allergy symptoms. Been going on for some weeks now. If it was allergic reaction would not of it subsided by now. Just a thought. Thanks for your input through GBS generally moves VERY quickly. You would normally be on the walking like a zombie, wheelchair or well into a ventilator by now.

I feel like I have worked out hard but yet I def have not. I had telehealth with neuro yesterday and he was still not concerned. He said IF it is gbs it is likely mild due to being 11 days in of symptoms and things getting better in some areas, he believes it is sciatica or a pinched nerve plus anxiety. He said if I am not having issues breathing and I can walk he thinks we can Elim GBS. He does want a emg in 2 weeks if symptoms progress because c spine mri showed some slight spondylitis. \n\nI just find this so weird all symptoms began after the vaccine. I have had sciatica issues before and this does not fit that for me personally. From experience - do you all think he is right about being 11 and 12 days in with no super bad progression .

Long story short she was diagnosed with severe small fiber neuropathy and CIDP.  We just remembered about the food poisoning and will tell the doc ASAP in case it is related.\n\nGoogle search shows that Campylobacter is known to cause GBS. Is it possible to also cause CIDP? Yes, it is, but it is rare.  Here is one report from the National Institutes of Health: (", "Early symptoms? Hi, i have all early synptomes of the syndrome.

I have found the following information to answer your questions relating to Guillain Barre and just overall some general information.\n\nGuillan-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune process. The cause is unknown it follows an infection. Immune response caused injury to myelin sheath or nerve axon. Which then leads swelling and inflammation that causes loss of myelin sheath and exposes nerve membranes in nerve terminals. \n\nThe first symptoms of GBS include weakness, weak or absent reflexes. The feeling of \u201cpins and needles\u201d sensations, weak muscle tone, muscular aches and cramps, decreased appetite, and sleep disruption. \n\nIt can happen at any age, however there is a greater risk for those who are over the age of 50. Like I mentioned above occurs a few days or weeks after a viral or bacterial infection. So that can be getting sick from cytomegalovirus( most common virus), campylobacter jejuni (common bacteria) or others like Hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus. \n\nI hope this helped!

I was freaking out and asked if when you have this disease you can have up and downs instead of just downs. I was searching for an answer  but instead got told that you guys cant diagnos me, which anyone with a brain knows. I didnt ask anyone for a diagnostic, so i dont understand the point of telling me this. I was simply a bit pissed cause when i saw that notification i was so released that someone answered me just to see someone telling me i cant ask for a diagnostic online, which i didnt even ask. Im sorry if it sounded rude it wasnt my intention, i just didnt like that he assumed i didnt see a doctor which i did also. And im not rude towards \"these people\" . I wad pretty chill with the other ones It varies. Did you get a diagnosis? Or are you just having symptoms? If you received a diagnosis, you should be getting treatment. if you have not received a diagnosis and are this concerned, I recommend strongly advocating for yourself and/or getting family members to advocate for yourself. Because of this disease can go bad very quickly.\n\nFor me, I was having some mild viral symptoms for about a week. I went to urgent care with double vision and a numb roof of the mouth. I got sense to the ER for a spinal tap to rule out meningitis. however, because they were not able to diagnose my neuro symptoms, I was admitted to the hospital. My first night in the hospital I had double vision and numbness in the roof of my mouth. Those are the only symptoms I had. The next three or four days, my face became more paralyzed and numb, my right hand became hard to move and I was getting weaker. Not that much worse than you. Now, I do not mean to scare you, but my fourth day in the hospital I woke up with my throat muscles not working, I could not swallow, and I went into respiratory failure. I was intubated and med-flighted into Boston, where I finally received my diagnosis. A week later I was paralyzed from head to toe. I suggest following up with your providers and advocating for yourself Thanks alot for replying! Thankfully i am better now. It still comes in waves so theirs definitly a problem somewhere but theirs no way i have the syndrome cause i would not be able to walk by now. And yes its a shame that we sometimes have to advocate just to get the proper traitement or tests!  Im happy you are better now There is no telling that you didnt, but regardless, I would suggest getting some sort of medical evaluation. I am glad you are better but those are not symptoms to brush under the rug my friend. I didnt have it because when you have this theirs a degeneration in the symptoms but mine are better now.

I had GBS back in 2017 when I was 21 years ago. I was paralyzed in my legs and arms. After my recovery I only had lingering tingling in my hands/feet for a couple months. It has back 4 years and I am suddenly experiencing nerve pain in both my legs. I did not have any pain when I had GBS. It was quite the opposite as I felt nothing at all (except the tingling that occurred before the paralysis and after my recovery.) Could this nerve pain somehow be GBS related?

Do you mind if I ask if GBS can start as nerve pain? My current doctor (I have been to more than I can count) is doing a wide array of testing and believes my current symptoms may be due to GBS. However, all of my symptoms are related to nerve/muscle pain, not muscle weakness. Almost everything I am reading about GBS relates to muscle weakness though. Any thoughts you have would be greatly appreciated :) I had alot of nerve pain in my feet, esepcially on the top. Also accompanied by weakness Thank you for your reply! Do you mind explaining what you mean by weakness? I know that can differ from person to person Alot of the joints in my legs got pretty stiff and it was almost like I was cut off from being able to use certain muscles, like I could not really bend my ankles at all and could not flex my calve - like just was not able to get my nerves to fire. Almost like I forgot how to. So since I was not using those muscles at all, they got weak quickly and I lost alot of muscle mass in my legs. Ah okay that makes a lot of sense! I definitely experience the joint stiffness as well. Does not GBS have a very rapid onset though? I have had these issues for years but all of a sudden it is spreading really quickly Yeah I went from a competitive athlete to bedridden in a hospital bed over about 2-3 weeks. As soon as I had numbness in my feet then it progressed really quickly. Yeah that is what I thought. Idk what this doctor is thinking. Thank you for your help:) While gbs has a rapid onset,  cidp does not. The latter being a chronic condition and the former acute.  I hope your doctor is a neurologist and if so do an EMG to test nerve conductivity. Next step would be a lumbar puncture to test for a certain protien, if it is off the charts that is fairly conclusive. Final step is a nerve biopsy but avoid unless necessary.  I was slowly getting worse over 5 years but since so gradual did not pay it much mind. Those 5 years is about 1 day in GBS time. I am 1 year into IVIg and just now showing improving. \n\nIf your doc does not understand the above find a new one. Best of luck. Thank you so much for this info! We have the nerve test and lumbar puncture scheduled, fingers crossed I get some answers soon! Also, I really Hope you do not mind my asking but what were your symptoms over the 5 years?? Started onset of numbness, pain and tingling late July from feet to knees.  By the next week had made it to arms, week after was loosing muscle control in left leg and formal GBS diagnosis.  So for me it took a little over 2 weeks to get to something we could diagnose. Do not know if that helps. Thanks so much for your reply, sorry you had to go through this Day 1, I lost my sense of taste, and had tingling in my fingers and toes. Day 2, started having horrible nerve pain all in my back, tingling progressed to my whole hands and feet. The nerve pain was like my back was being stabbed and burning, all over my back, all the time. Day 3, stumbling while walking, started falling and having trouble getting up, could not feel feet or hands, tingling in my arms up to the elbows and legs up to my knees. Day 4, could not read because everything was blurry, numb to my shins and forearms. Day 5, could not stand up by myself, right side of my face went slack, could not feel up to my elbows, could not feel up to my knees. Day 5 was the day I got taken to the ER by ambulance, was intubated, and started a month long hospitalization. Glad to hear you have those two scheduled, that is the right step in getting some answers.  One quick thing, the lumbar puncture is totally painless fyi, some people stress over that.\n\nAs for me I was a life long runner, logging 65-85 miles a week and never once had any foot pain.  Then 12/12 I tripped and fell taking over nothing while taking out the garbage.  Did some damage to my Plantar Fascia ligament that was a long recovery.  I was never able to get back to running after that.  I spent 2 years dealing with ortho docs who all diagnosed me as having plantar faciutis and I should have surgery on both feet.  None of these docs did an MRI they just wanted to cut.  Thankfully I refused and found a neuro who was super nice but not the most experienced fast forward I am with the right doctor.  When they would do that basic exam where they hit your knee with the little hammer and your leg is supposed to kick, well mine did not and still does not.  I would describe where I progressed to as if I was outside in the freezing cold and standing in snow with no shoes or gloves for an hour then immediately jumped into a hot bath.  Numb and tingling in a less then pleasant way all the time.  This all resulted in experiencing a lot of falls due to the lack of feedback from my feet (and hands) and very pronounced 'foot drop' that was the real reason I was tripping over nothing all the time.\n\nNobody here can diagnose you but what I think everyone here will do is advocate that you take charge of your care.  Learn everything you can and do not be afraid to tell a doc that this seems over their head and refer you to someone else.  You are the only person truly looking out for you do not be afraid to use your voice.\n\nA great place to start is the GBS/CIDP Foundation   That I am fortunate to live in the same city as. They have tons of info including recommended docs and hospitals. \n\nI's be remiss to not mention CMT  that is the genetic variation of this wonderful disease.  A diagnosis of this would require genetic testing but most folk with CMT have multiple family members afflicted by this.\n\nGBS: Acute, generally onset from a virus or something similar\nCIDP: Cronic, an auto-immune issue.\nCMT: Cronic, genetiacaly caused. Thank you for the reply! I am so sorry you went through this, that is terrifying. How are you doing now? Overall much better. I have neuropathy in my feet, still some balance issues, still have not recovered my full strength. But I am alive and can still walk my pups so that is all that matters :) So glad to hear you are doing better. I wish you all of the best :) I cannot thank you enough for sharing this information and your story with me, this is a huge help!! How has your recovery been going?? No problem.  I hope others jump in as we all have slightly different experiences.  Also, feel free to DM with questions down the line. Mine started with shoot nerve pain from my upper legs to feet. Then I started to experience weakness and loss of control. PIcking up my bedsheets felt like I was benchpressing 300 lbs. I could not even open a car door. Remember your brainstem is basically getting crushed from inflamation so its going to manifest in all sorts of horrible ways. My barr\u00e9 first symptom was numb legs, one of my friends first symptom was loosing strength in his hand, this other person's first symptom was a strong head ache sooo... I had a very slow onset as well. Pai and numbness in my feet for months. Problems swallowing for years. But only a spinal tap will be positive proof. Watch out, if the symptoms get worse. If so, go immediately to the ER. Thank you so much, I really appreciate your reply! My GBS onset over night with paralysis from neck to toes. Nerve pain began as feeling and movement began to return. Gabapentin &amp; Motrin to manage pain now. Learning to walk with walker &amp; in wheelchair most of the day. Exercise and stretching muscles helps recovery.

MRI? EMG? Lumbar puncture for me. My third ER trip, doc called it as soon as he saw me, but officially with the CSF protein test.\n\nI choked on water in the ER because I had unilateral facial weakness, and was intubated before the LP so at least I was not conscious for it, but I remember the feeling even through the drugs. Whole body got really stiff, muscle aches, TMJ, weakness, could not put my own socks on. Went to the ER 2 times and was sent home - saying I need to see a specialist but I was not \"dying\" so did not need to be admitted. 2 weeks later my toes were completely numb and I showed up to the ER with a pillow and told them I was not going home. MRI, CT scan, EMG test and then Spinal tap within 2 days: confirmed with high protein content in spinal fluid. MRI did not pick anything up? No the MRI would not show anything for GBS. Was mainly a test for ALS/MS I believe, so it is a good sign if the MRI does not show anything. Spinal tap after 3rd visit to er in 3days ,could not walk by then They took a guess bc everything came back normal. They assumed it was GBS. I truly believe they missed some things on my chart MRI, then started treatment, then spinal tap the next day. They tried to do a spinal tap the first day but could not get it to work for some reason, so they waited until the next day. Still one of the most painful and uncomfortable experiences of my life. Hospital visit and spinal tab Spinal tap for me too Spinal tap on evening of 2nd day in hospital - I had been admitted with weakness all down my left side. Would never submit to a lumbar puncture so I had a conduction test in my legs. \n\nHurt like hell but no one is going to be putting a needle into my spine!!! Within 24 hours I had three MRIs (brain, thoracic, and lumbar), emg, and lumbar puncture all off which gave clinical data supporting diagnosis. An MRI can show nerve root inflammation which support diagnosis of GBs and CIDP but much like elevated protein and glucose in the CSF, you might not have that yet if they catch it early. The same is true with emg. Blood tests for antibodies can also give some evidence of what kind of GBS you might have but that land is a very complicated one. I had positive titer on my ANA and asialo igg (I cant remember if it was Ab) as well. So I hit every clinical marker. Spinal tap. And I guess a visual diagnosis? My neurologist had not even looked at my chart yet and he called it just from looking at me. Lumbar puncture, EMG, and a physical neuro test My husband had horribly sharp, stabbing pain in his hands &amp; feet for 4 days, then on day 5 was suddenly completely paralyzed in his arms &amp; legs. Went to the ER that evening and all tests (bloodwork, CT, &amp; MRI) came back normal. I asked one of the ER docs if it was GBS and she said \u201cIt might be but I do not think it is b/c I have never seen it present this way.\u201d The second doc on duty in the ER told me to get my husband a psychiatric evaluation since they could not find anything wrong. \n\n\nMentally I patted him on the head while saying \u201cBless your poor little heart\u201d (a really bad insult in the South); in reality, I smiled and said I wanted my husband admitted into the hospital immediately for further tests because sudden paralysis in all 4 limbs was NOT good. He was admitted around midnite and by the time I came back around 9am, he would been seen by a neurologist, had a nerve conduction test, and gotten a definite diagnosis of GBS.\n\n\nPart of me wanted to go back and tell off the second ER doc for his recommendation for a psych eval, but I decided it was not worth the oxygen. What a dumbass. Spinal tap; which ironically did not show anything. They basically just ended up deciding that all the symptoms matched up. Spinal tap in the ER.  That was 5 days after onset of symptoms and having lots of blood work and imaging.  By then my wife and I were pretty sure it was GBS and the ER Doc agreed.  He ordered more blood work, more imaging, then as they all came back normal except for the Sed. Rate he did the spinal tap which confirmed it.", "Anyone in Arizona get Hizentra?

I recovered pretty well despite the leg pain here and there throughout the day along with fatigue. However, over the past couple of years I have come to gather a list of symptoms that I go through on a daily basis. I wake up with a terrible stomach ache and nausea, but I never throw up. I have absolutely no appetite until (if I am lucky) around 2 pm. Some days I will not have an appetite until I am ready to go to bed. I still force myself to eat even if this causes more nausea. I also burp a lot throughout the day. Over the last few months I have lost 20+ pounds with no exercise at all. I am constantly tired and have always had on and off episodes of depression. I always assumed these symptoms were just GB related OR i was just extremely stressed from finishing up college but it was not until recently I read up on celiac disease and how it can be linked to peripheral neuropathy. It just got me thinking. Does anyone else experience symptoms like this, or is anyone diagnosed with celiac that was later on diagnosed with GB (or vice versa)? Sorry if this is a jumbled mess. I just get so beyond frustrated with the lack of information on this crazy syndrome. Thanks in advance :) The only thing anywhere close to this in my case has digestion problems with pork. But for me that started when I had my gall bladder removed, about 6 months before my episode of GBS, and I have never mentally linked them. Food intolerances and poor gut health have a correlation with autoimmune conditions.\n\nIt would definitely be worth discovering this with a doctor, and getting a referral to an immunologist. They by their nature work with allergies and intolerances, as well as have an understanding of autoimmune (even if not GBS specifically). \n\nI had mild food intolerances (amine), that have worsened considerably since GBS, and now have IBS. I have worked with a Gastroenterologist, and an Immunologist and have been able to build up a great life with variety in foods - something I lost for a while.\n\nGood luck! Hi!

The neurologist thinks I have a mild case of GBS based on my symptoms and test results. Early on a had a lot of muscle twitch (it has gotten a little better now) muscle weakness, loss of balance, light sensitivity and also have experienced a large increase in heart rate going from sitting to standing. My heart will jump from 70bpm to about 130. \nMy neurologist thinks that the GBS is impacting my parasympathetic nervous system which is why I have the light sensitivity and elevated heart rate. Has anyone else experienced this?  I am fortunate that I did not experience any paralysis, but most just very shaky/weak legs. I feel the strength in my legs starting to come back , but I am still struggling with balance issues and my heart rate. For those that have experienced nervous system issues , how long did it take for those to resolve? I have been dealing with somewhat similar GBS issues for weeks now.  Ever since I got my first dose of the Pfizer shot.  hope you feel better soon.  I too want this to resolve ASAP.  The elevated heart rate is terribly bothersome.  Did your neurologist recommend any treatment? The GBS has also messed up my sleep and given me insomnia. Nothing yet but he wants me to meet with someone that is a specialist with nervous system issues. I do not have that appointment yet. I am meeting with the cardiologist on Thursday. I also had the Pfizer shot. There is obviously no way to prove exactly how I got this because as far as I can tell, I was not sick before symptoms started. Good luck.  My cardiologist ran EKG, echo, holter, stress test, blood work and all normal.  He cannot explain my elevated heart rate issues other than it is probably related to Vaccine/GBS.  He had no advice on how to deal with it or how this will play out.  Very frustrating.  I hope your cardiologist figures it out for you. Did you actually get diagnosed or is it just speculation? It could be a plethora of other auto immune reactions which are just as bad BTW.\nYour other symptoms are also indicative of a major allergic reaction. A bad reaction can lead to years of issues. ..weakness, permanent fatigue etc. especially the elevated heart rate.\n\n\nHaving had GBS, my strength actually never fully returned. 30lbs feels like 60 for the last 7 years.  I still have days where my left leg and foot do not do what my brain says and I bail. The wife an I sometimes watch the home camera videos of all the funny ways I stumble up the stairs and fall over.  Got To look at the upside. The worst part for me was the seemingly permanent insomnia. I have only slept 3-4 hours a night for the last 7 years. No bueno... Being permanently tired sucks.\n\n\nGood luck. The only way I moved forward was with steady exercise. Seemingly easy stuff was brutal. I have been able to increase to some pretty great workouts. The good news is 30lbs feels like 60 so i am not getting any injuries from increasing my weight. haha. I feel ya there. 4 hours is the most I can sleep on a good day. I had wondered about that. I was only sleeping a few hours a day if even that. Sometimes I could not sleep for almost two days and then only sleep for a couple hours. I attributed it to the steroids or other medications and the nurses taking my vitals every couple hours. Those symptoms sound like POTS.  The curious one is the surge in heart rate from a sit to stand position.  That is more or less what the tilt table test shows in POTS patients.", "GBS relapse after 3 weeks Hello. Had first GBS symptoms c. 27 January, following covid diagnosis on 21 January Progressively affected lower and upper limbs and latterly face. Admitted to hospital on 1 Feb and received 5 days of IVIG. Discharged on 8 Feb and things were on the up for a couple of weeks.\n\nHad another mild respiratory infection (sore throat and mostly dry cough) last week and this week I have noticed measurable loss of function and weakness. For example, cannot open a bottle anymore whereas I could last weak. Walking is weaker than it was 1 week after discharge. Right side of face (which had largely recovered) now noticeably weaker, though not as bad as nadir in hospital (yet...).\n\nSpoke to neurologist and physio today who have advised watch and wait (come back in 4 days and in meantime go to ER if trouble with breathing, swallowing or vision). That is fine; it is tempting to always want to take action (pump me with IVIG again!) but I recognise that is not always necessary or the best. I was just wondering if anyone had experienced something similar as my understanding is that my experience of relapse, or at least partial relapse, so quickly is unusual. \n\nTry to avoid scare stories if you can as my mental health is in tatters from this! It is a real setback being back on walking frame and seeing asymmetry in face in again, even if not as bad as it has been at nadir (yet a you see what I am scared of here - complete relapse!).\n\nThanks Yes, I had relapse symptoms almost exactly 3 weeks after my initial symptom onset. The relapse symptoms were different than my initial symptoms though. My initial symptoms were numbness and tingling all over my body, unable to walk, etc. Those improved significantly after 5 rounds of IVIG in the hospital (I was in the hospital for 2 weeks). After I got home from the hospital I had a couple of days where I felt really good and then I had started having symptoms similar to Bell's Palsy (one side of my face drooped and was paralyzed, lost sense of taste, eyes dried out from not blinking properly). These were not symptoms that I had had before. I went to my neurologist and they said basically the same thing that yours did. After a couple of more weeks things started to get better and by about 2 months from my initial symptom onset I was feeling good. That is reassuring - thank you. Glad you recovered well. I had my relapse 4 weeks after initial onset. I absolutely panicked, as I was at the rehabilitation hospital, but they brought over a neuro who explained that it is very common to have a \"plateau\" or relapse at 3-6 weeks. You will push through it and go back to recovery \ud83d\ude0a This happened for me too. I went in to the hospital overnight, got sent home with a severe migraine diagnosis because they had no idea about GBS. A week or so later I could not walk up the stairs and went back in. They checked my reflexes in my knees and elbows, no response. Was sent up to the ICU. Over the next couple days could not walk. Did IVIG and physical therapy in the ICU. After a month I could walk very poorly with assistance and a walker. Still could not get up on my own but I was off the support machines and was able to go home. 6 months later I could walk on my own. Thank you! Happy to know that I am not the only one! Did you have a relapse after initial recovery? Yes but Not anything like the first time. Have not had to go back to the hospital at least. I did not have a relapse per say, but I pushed too hard at physical therapy a few days in a row and had a backslide in my recovery. It was probably 3 or 4 weeks out of the hospital by then. My PT talked to my neurologist, he suggested I just take it easy for a week or so and see how I feel. I ended up being totally fine after some rest! When I was admitted to hospital and diagnosed, the doctor said I would get worse before getting better, maybe is your case. Focus on moving forward. The best thing I ever did was read a book on stress and how it affects you body and being. It was so distressing I changed completely after reading it.  It gave me a mindset that dwelling on the past and worst case scenarios could actually make things worse. You will get through this just fine. You also have acquired a new life experience which give you new perspective on fellow humans with limited movement, paralysis MS etc. You empathy and compassion will be elevated once you are through this and you will be a better stronger person. Take care. I am now back in hospital for a repeat round of IVIG. Hopefully that puts out the fire again. It worked last time.\n\nI am totally baffled by it though, because all the literature says relapse is rare and usually years after recovery rather than during recovery. Did some research and now understand that there is such a thing a \u2018treatment-related fluctuation\u2019 which occurs in around 10% of cases. In short, you get treated, you improve and then within a few weeks you get worse again - and they usually repeat IVIg. Have started treatment again today. Fingers crossed it is that and not acute-onset CIDP. Hoping the ivig acts quickly so I do not deteriorate much further. Thanks all for sharing your stories. That is what happened to me! They admitted me to the hospital that night", "I Found My People I (27F) was diagnosed 4 months ago with GBS. Admittedly, I was treating my body like garbage. I was excessively drinking and barely eating for at least 4 years so when the symptoms started showing I chalked it up to the numerous health issues I was ignoring that went along with that lifestyle. Every day I would wake up and it would be harder to walk and let my legs stretch out. Finally I got up one day and fell and could not get myself back up. Cue me refusing to go to the hospital because maybe I just \u201cneeded to put my legs up for a bit\u201d. Eventually my family came and forced me to go.\n\nI was in the hospital for a week while they poked and prodded to find out the issue. They told me it was super rare and it was crazy that someone so young is experiencing it but based on my lifestyle not shocking.\n\nThen came my 2 month rehab stay. With that neuropathy kicked in on my feet. I am sure I do not have to tell most of you that it was the most excruciating pain I have ever experienced. Whenever I would do sit to stands in PT I felt like I had to vomit from the pain. Finally, the doctors switched my meds around an I woke up one day pain free but still tingly. \n\nI spent those two months working the hardest I ever have in my life. I was battling my own body, anxiety and depression, alcoholism, an eating disorder, a break up, and a move (I was hospitalized early April and our lease was up in May...try organizing a move when you cannot be there). But I took on every challenge the PT gave me and by the end of my stay I was basically completely independent on a walker and only took the chair just in case.\n\nNow I am in outpatient PT and they think by the end of this week I should be able to just use a cane at home and for short trips in the community. I had to change my whole lifestyle. I decided to look up if there was a sub for this on a whim and I am so happy this exists.\n\nFor me the scariest part is there is so little research and literature on the topic that doctors seem to not know how far you will rehabilitate. I did not know anyone who had experienced this and, by what the doctors said, I likely would not. I really was feeling isolated and a bit angsty if I am being honest so finding this sub feels like I am not alone is this scary situation.\n\nHow did you guys find out about your diagnosis and what did the doctors say the solution or healing time was?\n\nTLDR: Diagnosed with GBS and felt alone. I hope to hear other people\u2019s experiences. I was diagnosed at 18, healthy lifestyle. Never fully recovered (every person is different tho).\n\nYou are not alone. We are few and scattered, but we are here, and out there. You are definitely not alone , I experienced the same feelings such as isolation and depression just as any normal person would. It is so hard to try to keep positive and so easy to fall in to the negative. As much as it seems like we are alone through this there are lots of GBS survivors in the world living their lives to the best. Think of this as the world giving us a second chance to look at life. I was not in a good place before this, I used to isolate myself from people and I would do nothing other than work plus not eating well and drinking a lot. After this experience I am much more appreciative of everything life has to give. It opens your eyes on what is most important in your life and in that sense it was a blessing in my life. GBS is the hardest thing I have had to try to come back from but halfway through my rehab I already know I am not going to be that same person watching life pass him. If you need any support or just to chat let me know. We are all here for each other. I am always telling myself \"Hey, it is not cancer. \" :) Hi always telling myself \"hey, it is not cancer. \" :), I am dad. You are not alone. \n\nI was diagnosed at 36. Woke up with double vision and 3 days later, was admitted to ICU and put on a ventilator. \n\nI could not walk or open my eyes because of GBS. I could not speak, eat or drink because of the tracheostomy. My god did I miss drinking water. I had to relearn everything, even down to chewing and drinking liquids. \n\nLike you, it was a lot of hard work and I walked myself out of the hospital after 12 weeks. \n\nIt is almost a year since the first symptom and I have general weakness and tingly limbs still. But I can indoor rock climb again (beginner level) so I am pretty proud of myself. \n\nThe biggest lingering effect has been my face. I cannot smile or move my lips to kiss, which makes it tricky to eat and drink. My fingers are crossed that my face would fully recover. \n\nThe doctors initially said I should make a full recovery but it may take a year or more, coupled with a lot of Physiotherapy. \n\nAge is the only thing that reliably indicates how speedy your recovery might be. You are a lot younger than me so your odds are good. \n\nHope you feel less alone. It is a sucky situation but you are not alone. started showing symptoms early may, diagnosed mid june, and finally in the recovery stages and doing PT.  It is been extremely difficult physically even though i was lucky enough for it to not spread past my waist. but even through the physical difficulties, the mental toll it took on me was so much worse.  stay strong, know we are here, and good luck. You are NOT alone! I had GBS back in the late 1980s and almost nobody even knew what I had and tons of specialists had to see me before I even got diagnosed. It took days! Nowadays, when I go to a doctor, most GPs know what GBS is or have heard of it - this is a huge change and I am so relieved to see how much general knowledge has improved.\n\nYour reaction is the exact reason I created this sub. Knowing what other people have gone through is so important, especially considering the long recovery period. Please chime in on discussion topics and share your experience. It is really important to helping future people have an important repository of experience to compare their own to! DX at 15, 29 now. Took awhile for them to give the dx and administer IVIG. Was paralyzed from feet up to face, stopped before it hit my lungs. For me, the year out from when it happened seemed to be the window to make the most gains. I am good as new now, other than no reflexes and some facial weakness. If I could redo recovery, I would have followed my PT's advice better and really worked at the facial stuff instead of hiding from it. Good luck with everything and be sure to engage in self care and support from loved ones. It really is not easy.", "Constipation and GBS Hello! First of all, apologies for bad english.\n\nMy brother was diagnosed with GBS about two weeks ago, and underwent IVIG treatment for five days. For several days he had a liquid diet so the medics were not as concerned about constipation, but it is been 6 days since he was sent back home and still has not had any \u2018poop\u2019 yet. He has not complained about it as the food he is eaten is still pretty bland, but we are still slightly concerned. Any advice or help on this topic?\n\nThings to note:\n\u2022 Doctor prescribed Senna.\n\u2022 A friend sugested trying metamucil but I am not sure that would be too helpful.\n\u2022 He did drink a couple probiotic yogurt-ish drinks. Oh yeah constipation hit real hard when I was in the hospital, and lasted for like over a month (obviously I pooped during that time but it was veeeery infrequent). \n\nI tried stool softeners, prune juice, fiber supplements, the works. Just did not help me. \n\nYou know what did the trick? Grapefruit. Had a grapefruit a day for a while and BAM poop came like it was my job. Swear by grapefruit.\n\nAlso not joking at all. Best of luck to you and your brother!!! Prune juice!! Cannot recommend this enough. I had stool softeners, laxatives, the whole nine yards. One of my older nurses told me to drink prune juice and that was what finally worked. Yup. Unfortunately, if your bowel muscles will not work, you will not go. I was always bloated and constipated. I needed enemas to pass. It was terrible.", "Can you fully recover from CIDP I am an 17 years old and have had CIDP for about 4 months, is there any chance that I can fully recover? They do not call it recovery (they call it remission), but people get better all the time. I am in remission right now. Doctors cannot really predict the trajectory of CIDP, but the usual assumption is that you will recover once they figure out the drugs. I think your focus on the term \u201cfully recovered\u201d might fuck up your current recovery. I am about 8 months in remission and am back to functioning independently. I have a few things that are not how they used to be. However, I am also walking, shitting, and showering by myself which was a huge change from 8 months ago. Recovery is possible but it will take measurable goals. Hope this helps. I doni't know much about it, but my dad got it last month, was in the hospital for 2 weeks then a rehab facility for a week, they told him it would be months before he was walking.\n\nHe used a walker for maybe 2 weeks, has been using a cane only the last week, and says he figures he will stop using the cane very soon. Kind of amazing. (Hope this doesn;t make others' feel bad about their progress). My dad is 85 years old!\n\nThe reason I say this is it seems very individualized, but also because it seems that attitude and positivity is critical.\n\nI myself had to learn to walk again when I was 18 (from a different problem) and they told me I wouldnt be walking for months, and I was walking a week after I got out of the hosp. Dr.s said that I should not even be ABLE to walk, called it a \"miracle.\" (I am not religious, your mileage may vary)\n\nSo, stay positive, eat good proteins, and do not give up on yourself! :) Hi, I was diagnosed in 2008 when I was 12 years old, I am 24 now.\n\nFrom what i have experienced and heard; everybody's experience with CIDP is different. I do believe, though, that you are never truly \"cured\" - the 'progression' gets stopped, your symptoms get treated and you may have to learn to live some lasting damage. Relapses are also possible.\n\nPersonally, I have had no relapses. It took me about two years to be able to run and swim again (badly) and about 5 years to be able to walk without a stagger.\nI used to be classified as disabled and received welfare help. Now i am living a totally independent and active life as a manual outdoors worker, working with heavy machinery, on my feet all day and I am a regular gym go-er (weight lifter).\n\nDespite all this, remants of the disease still remain - I have an incredibly poor grip and I often drop things and smash glasses. I also struggle with delicate tasks involving my fingers, such as doing up buttons on a shirt. But pretty much everything else I can do just as well as an able-bodied person can.\n\nI must say, I do have an underlying tired and fatigueness - I realise I push my body hard with my job and lifting weights - I truly am tired all the time and do not have the energy for much more. It took a lot of time for me to get here though and I realise years ago it seemed impossible to be this active and strong. Do not give up on the recovery, it is going to be tough, but patience and motivation will get you far :)", "CIDP, COVID-19 Anyone have any info/insight into what risk there is with contracting COVID-19 if you have got CIDP?  Hi! We are putting all posts above CV in a monthly discussion topic: ", "Sore neck after central venous catheter removal My neck has been mildly sore for about a month since the subclavian central venous catheter (CVC) was removed after plasmapheresis.  It feels slightly tight and stiff when I turn my head to the side.  The CVC was sore and uncomfortable for the time it was in place too.  Anybody experience this?  How long did it take to resolve for you?", "Floaty Arms &amp; Legs? Hi All,\n\nPotential mild guillain barre sufferer here...I understand I am a lot more fortunate in terms of not being fully paralyzed, mobility restriction etc. \n\nNeuro says it is potentially GB and i am in process of doing testing and MRIs, but just wondering, has anyone experienced floaty arms and legs? Or waves of muscle weakness? \n\nDid this ever go away? What do you mean by floaty? I think I know what you mean! The sensations/tingling can be odd sometimes and everyone seems to experience it differently and describe things differently. I think I had and still do have sensations almost daily but I am so used to them. For reference my last onset was 2010, first in 1998 (when I was 8), paralysis both times. I am now fully recovered with little impact to my life currently, except for worry if covid and onset lol. It is hard to say what is I will and will not go away and it has a lot to do with severity and intervention (when and what mode of treatment). Trust yourself and keep being as expressive as you can! There is so many odd and sometimes awful sensations. :( sorry you are going through that! Thanks for the response! It feels like...its just weak? And like i can still move my arm and legs and grip things but it just does not feel normal? It feels as if you were to push a limb, it would fly far away. Have you experienced this? Yes I know that feeling exactly. I described it as walking through sand in the beach. Also there is often some surface/skin numbness but not necessarily pressure numbness and that can be confusing. I have a spot on the inside if my ankle that is permanently numb to touch like the sensation of touch, but can feel when I put pressure on the area. It is a surreal feeling and I believe it sounds like you are feeling the weakness and affects to proprioception, which is the word for how your nerves sense space around you! I cannot speak to the course of recovery for you but with treatment and as your nerves re-innervate these specific symptoms will likely lessen. Remember I am not a neurologist tho. Lol. Good luck!! Got it! Do you still have that feeling all the time? How often? Im having a hard time grappling with it and scared it will haunt me rest of life :/ No! But I know the feeling. That one specifically did go away. And if you are still getting diagnosed they will also tell you more. Definitely. Hoping to hear back asap. My limbs feel like they are water from time to time. Sometimes its my legs, next is arms...\n\nIs this the same as what you felt? I know you alluded to sand in beach, did your limbs feel HEAVY? Yes absolutely :( weirdest feeling ever For sure. They felt more heavy than weak? Trying to differentiate between floaty and heavvt symptoms. Did your limbs ever feel like water too? Mmmm...not water more like heavy which I just associate with weak. And shaky. Honestly sounds like it could be MS. MRIs came back clean...do not even know where to go at this point. I still feel the muscle weakness for like a second at times and just just let go of my nerves and ot goes away. It is annoying and painful at times Do you have an update since then? I have those feelings and I have had GBS for three years", "TGA adds GBS warning to AZ Vaccine - Article from Pharma  So the TGA is The Therapeutics Goods Administration in Australia, kind of like FDA in USA and they recently added a GBS caution warning to the AstraZeneca Vaccine which I thought was interesting. This is an article in Pharma in Focus which is for pharmaceutical news and might be behind a paywall but for personal use is ok I think. I went through GBS about 15 years ago. I just had a case of the Ronies that I just beat a month ago. The Rona was bad, but nothing in comparison to the 10 months of hell GBS gave me. I got GBS fro AstraZeneca, probably still would have got vaccinated even f I knew this risk", "Grateful to have discovered this sub I recently discovered this sub, and it is been fantastic in my recovery. I have only met one other person with GBS, so reading other people\u2019s stories and experiences has helped. \n\nI was first diagnosed a couple months before my 24th birthday with AIDP, then GBS, then Miller-Fisher, and now I am undiagnosed but they are treating it like GBS. It is been a whirlwind of a few months; I was in the hospital for a week, got IVIG, and was all better. Three weeks later I was admitted to the hospital, placed in the NCCU within 24 hours, on a ventilator soon after, and lost all movement/feeling in my arms and from the waist down. Thankfully, after heavy IVIG treatment I was taken off the ventilator within a couple days, was transferred out of the NCCU within a week, and then moved to a rehab facility after a couple weeks. I had to learn how to walk again and how to control my eyes (as I lost the ability to move my right eye), I lost 40 lbs, and had a lot of other things to deal with. Luckily, my wife and family supported me 24/7. \n\nHowever, it is been hard trying to explain to people what the experience has been like and how, even though I look 100% now, I get tired, I still have severe neuropathy, and I am suffering from what my psychologist thinks is PTSD.\n\nThis sub, though, has been a breath of fresh air. It is helped me cope and process and learn. I just wanted to thank you all for sharing your stories and providing the support to those who need it. \n\nTLDR; thank you for the stories and the support. Glad to hear you are doing better. \n\nI got really really lucky. My grandpa had it about 40 years ago before there was treatments for it. He was paralyzed for 6 months and took about 2 years to fully recover. When I noticed the symptoms on me I knew right away it was GBS because I would recognized sharing the same symptoms he would explained. I told the people and neurologist in the ER and they believed me and tests that first. Sure enough I was right and my neurologist said I diagnosed myself and without that it could have been awhile before they check that because it is so rare. \n\nI caught it in two days and was admitted while I could still walk. IVIG take a while to take affect so I eventually could not walk anymore in the hospital and could sort of use my arms. But that is the worst of it. Cannot imagine being on a ventilator. 10 months out now and you would never ever know I was in that state. I have sole weakness in my right side which is apparent when I do high strain activists with it and earlier on I would get tired easily. I remember early on after I would have to ask people to walk slower or take a break when I was with them. Thankfully I am past that now though. \n\nHopefully your stamina keeps improving like mine did! Best of luck to you! Thank you for sharing! I am glad you were able identify it quickly. It is been tough but I am actually able to run again. It helps that I was in fairly good shape before. \n\nBut thank you so much!  I wish you the best of luck in your ongoing recovery as well! I think being in shape helped me too. I have a very speedy and unusual recovery as well the OT said I was the fastest recovery she would seen in her career and within 2 weeks of the hospital you could not tell at all. I do a lot of spelunking and it gave me a bit of endurance. Although it was frustrating that I could not keep up with it for a few months afterward lol\n\nAlso shoutout to our wives (soon to be in my case) they were such amazing helps! Hey congrats on the engagement and the upcoming wedding! \n\nFitness helped a lot for me. I used to do a lot of powerlifting app it is been a big change but thankfully I still have some muscle mass. The biggest difference is fitting in \u201cSlim\u201d cut clothing for the first time in my life!\n\nMy wife was the real MVP throughout all of this. Cannot thank her enough. And now we are expecting so life is looking up! Great to hear of your speedy recovery and the upcoming addition to your family!  Love your comment about the slim fit clothes... that is where I am because I lost a lot of weight too.\n\nAlmost 3 years in, and I figured a way to share with people how I feel (since it is on and off).  \n\nI tell the computer people that my brain and legs have \"lag\".  I tell athletic people that my brain and legs react like I am walking or running in a swimming pool.  The fatigue side really sucks, but I have really been enjoying how I have adapted to nap literally anywhere.\n\nI have also learned more recently that when my legs send up the signal that \"it is tired\" and I follow those orders, then I lose muscle mass.  So I started to ignore those signals lately and amazingly, those are the days I am able to stay on my feet all day.  It has not been a 100% success rate though, so learn your body! I love this!  As someone who played sports all my life and who built his own computer, I am definitely going to steal those comparisons!\n\nI am glad you have been able to figure out something that works for you!  I am still learning how best to respond to my body.  I have started going to the gym again so I hope it helps with both muscle mass and fatigue. \n\nIm happy things are going well for you! I went into the hospital with double vision and headaches and was unable to walk they thought I had gbs but it turned out to be botulism. Which is even more rare I cannot even find a support group I was almost completely paralyzed at one point could just move a few fingers on my right hand. I spent 49 days in the hospital, it is been a little over 5 months and I am still in a lot of pain from the atrophy doctors do not really know what is wrong with my shoulder other than the obvious atrophy I am still on pain killers and growing frustrated. I know it is a separate condition but can any of you speak to the pain aspect of your condition. I am so sorry!  PM id be happy to talk to you about my experience", "Mom with GBS (49) My mom was diagnosed with GBS in 2012. She was hospitalized for nearly 2 months then and unfortunately she fell into the 5% that will never fully recover. She has permanent neurological damage as well as other symptoms that she deals with every day. Here comes my question, since she is immune compromised, covid is very dangerous, so I am wondering if anybody here is or knows someone else who fell into that 5% that has gotten the covid vaccine? I have done my own research that says the Pfizer vaccine is safe for people who have had GBS but all of the people who I have read have gotten it, have recovered from GBS. I know I kind of rambled on but I lost my dad 3 weeks ago and I need to know if the vaccine is safe for her, she is all I have left. I am also in that 5% and my neurologist, a GBS expert, says get the vaccine!  She has been seeing GBS patients for 30 yrs and has only seen a reoccurrence three times.  She is adamant that we get vaccines. She has given lectures and states that Covid, the flu are far worse than the slim chance that you will get GBS again. I got my first shot last month.  The AZ vaccine is produced in the manner that has been very loosely associated with GBS.  If it makes you feel safer get one of the other types. Thinking about this I realized it has been 11 yrs since I had GBS. I was 97 days in the hospital. Mine was triggered when I had a brain tumour removed. I still have nerve damage in my feet. That is just what it is. 5% here - got the Pfizer vaccine with ZERO neurological effects. Also got COVID last year and THAT had neuro effects... increased numbness, more tripping etc. If her doctors say she should get the vaccine it is worth not getting COVID.  It was scary. Man I got GBS from AZ. No way am I getting the second shot. It is definitely recommended to get the vaccine. GBS recurrence is very low anyway and there is no evidence to suggest the vaccine is linked with GBS. Better to make sure she is protected from covid! My daughter (16F) has CIDP (chronic GBS)  her neurologist said to get the Pfizer vaccine.  She had no issues other than feeling a little sick the day after the second shot.  It is definitely scary as she got GBS from a vaccine.  I wish your mom the best. Hope this helps I got Covid last Nov and Pfizer vacc in April. I had no problems with either (55 male) I am in that 5% and 46 years old. I got my GBS from a reaction to the flu shot which I got in late 2015 and I did not fully recover. I use a cane permanently to walk and leg braces when I can. I was very apprehensive about the vaccine but I got the Moderna shot almost 2 months ago and have not regretted it. The only odd side effect I had was my lips were numb for about 30 minutes after each shot, but I was okay after. Shortly after I got the 2nd shot, my partner got covid. We live in a 1 bedroom and he had a false negative at first so I was definitely exposed but did not get the virus. Everyone is different. Just have your mom be vigilant, but I do think it is a good idea. Thank you for all your information. My grandma has GBS symptoms and we are in CA. Do you mind me asking who is your doctor?? She sounds incredible! My grandma got the Moderno vaccine and no side affects! I am in Canada. She has spoken at GBS Foundation events, I have to look up her name. I will get back to you. You are so kind! Thank you!!  Hi bimbleberry hope your good my dad has been placed in the 5 percent saying there is 50/50 chance of survival if he survives what are the effects on everyday life", "xxxx xxxxx", "What does GBS breathing trouble feel like? Hi All,\n\nI had a relatively mild GBS episode in Feb/March this year. Very uncomfortable, but I could still walk throughout and did not have to be hospitalized. Since then I was able to rehab and a lot of things got better. Energy, nausea, weakness, tingling all improved. \n\nI got the second covid dose about 2 weeks ago. Flu symptoms disappeared after 24 hours. But then a week later, I started to feel bad again. I thought it was in my head. Just imagining, anxious, whatever. But, the last few days?\n\nNumbness really escalated in the legs. Especially today. Pins and needles came back in both legs. Then in the hands. Tingling to the point of burning or like an exhausted pain in quads. Hands getting slower. Getting harder to type. I could walk normal earlier today, but now it is like a shuffle with a slight knee buckling. Everything just feels so much more numb. Energy levels crashing. Though deep tendon reflexes still look okay on a test, whatever that is worth.\n\nDamn, I was hoping I was going to skate through this shot. Guess not. \n\nPreviously my neurologist refused treatment with IVIG because I was a mild case. I think that was the right call in hindsight. I do not want to go to the ER again without a good reason, because I know they will not do anything but treat or release. And if it is not life-threatening, I think they will just say release to be safe.\n\nBut... I am having a new thing. It feels like my chest is heavy. And I do not know. Maybe this is just anxiety. Cause, yeah, this is a really anxious time. I hate having to go through this again. But, it is like I have to think about breathing every now and then. And there is some tingling, numb, pins and needle crap in that area too. Like a small sense of pressure just below my sternum. And I am just like......\n\nOkay, step back. Is this nerves? What does trouble breathing actually feel like? I had a mild case before, but how do I know if I hit an inflection point and that this is 'different'? It feels like things are going faster this time. I feel like I could slide off a cliff.\n\nI do not know. Anyone have any advice or insight? Ideas of what to do or where to go?\n\nBtw: I reached out to my neurologist but they have not gotten back to me yet. Unfortunately not terribly surprising. I reached out to try to schedule and see more neurology appointments, but you can all guess how that is going.\n\nThanks for your time! Go to the ER. If you feel like you are losing dexterity in your hands and your knees feel like they are going to buckle, your GBS has not gone away. It probably does not have anything to do with the vaccine, but I am guessing that, without IVIG, your immune system has not leveled out. It is not worth waiting until tomorrow to hear back. \nI am not sure your breathing issues are related to GBS, but definitely seems to be anxiety around your symptoms returning. But, just in case, go to the ER and bring it up. They will probably put you on ivig for at least 1 night. \nGood luck and keep us posted! Even if you cannot get in with neurology, talk with your pcp. At the very least they can help you figure out next steps, or light a fire under neurology.\n\nYou may even be able to call your hospital system and talk with someone like a nurse. I am not sure where you are physically or if it is offered, but that could be another option.\n\nNerves are a hell of a thing, and can really make it seem like something us there when it is not. But do not ignore warning signs either. Do you live with anyone it have someone close by that can stay with you? I know covid is ever present, but what your describing sounds like having someone close by could help with nerves, or help you get to the hospital if need be.\n\nI am sorry I do not have anything better. I hope your doctor's get back to you soon, or these feelings pass. Try to work on some relaxing breaths, and try to find something to take your mind off of what is happening. That description sounds like a real deal attack is in progress. I would get yourself seen as soon as you can because that sounds like serious trouble.\n\nAnd...fire that neurologist who refused to treat you with IVIG. It is often the best weapon we have got and even if it is \"mild\" by his or her bullshit definition, it needs treatment. By the time I got a response to set up a consultation with a neurologist, I would been in a medically-induced coma on a ventilator for two days. I would already been through the emergency room and been admitted to the ICU when I started struggling to breathe. It felt like I was trying to inhale with a pillow being gradually pressed into my face. I would pull a deep breath but felt like I was not getting any oxygen, but according to the doodad on my finger, my oxygen level was golden. \n\nI went to urgent care three separate times and to the ER twice. They admitted me after my second visit. If I were you, I would go back. My breathing issues did seem to be anxiety related. I think they have gone away. My weakness and nausea got a little bit worse today, but I am still hanging in there. I am hesitant to go to the ER, since I have gone before during my last acute phase, and except for the first time, they basically did not do anything. \n\nThe first time, they took me seriously and did a spinal tap + MRI + lots of blood work. Then they did not know what to do next, so they referred me to a neurology group somewhere else. The neurologist was of the opinion that I did not need treatment, so when I got in worse shape and went back to the ER, they referred back to the neuro who basically said 'watchful waiting' and then the ER stopped being useful. Did not mind charging me thousands of dollars for doing basically nothing though. I went a third time and tried to beg for treatment or even just a second opinion from a different neurologist. That got nowhere, unfortunately. \n\nI think my next move is to get all my medical records from my current neurologist, so I at least have those in hand. And then if I wind up getting bad enough, at least I could try a different ER and hand them the medical records I did have so we did not have to go through certain things again. Maybe the result would be different, maybe I could gun for a second opinion, I do not know. Thanks, I like your idea of reaching out to my PCP. I think asking for their help in making a health connection could work. I have always trusted my PCP.\n\nYeah, anxiety is a killer with this. A lot of symptoms can feel 10x worse with anxiety. That is why after these messages today, I am just going to try to disengage and do my best to distract myself.\n\nFortunately, I have a wife and kids at home. My wife can get me help if I need it. We will figure out a way to get through it, not matter what it is. Thanks, I really appreciate this. I think my neurologist means well but that she simply does not specialize in adult neuromuscular disease which is sort of limiting a lot of things.\n\nOne thing I do not know is what treatment is really like, so it is hard for me to judge. I feel miserable. But maybe I will get better on my own. But if the treatment would make me feel double miserable... maybe it is not worth it? But then I hear other people and it sounds like they can tolerate some of these things well. ...just not sure I guess... They did not do much for me the first time, either. But persistence pays off. You got to go in if you think something is wrong, especially if you are having trouble breathing.\nIf possible, go to a different ER. If you live near a county hospital, go there. Or, one associated with a university. Payment options are usually better at those places. \nGood luck! Thank you for this. I am so sorry you had to go through what you did. That sounds really scary. And just generally exhausting. It is sad that so many people have to tell a similar story of having to go back again and again and again and again before we finally get help. I guess that is the way it is though. Have to keep fighting. How are you feeling today? Feels a bit worse but still manageable. Energy kind of gone, tired, shaky. The neuro sensations are about the same currently. Maybe the gaba is doing its job. But the general weakness is worse for sure. I have enough strength to keep going through the day for now though. And I am comfortable at least. I am also not nearly as scared as I used to be. I know this sucks. I know it could suck a whole lot more in the coming days. But I also have the feeling I will get through it somehow. I will endure and find a way to keep living. Life might change but life will not stop.\n\nUnfortunately, I feel like I need to get worse until I can prove to some hospital what this is doing to me. Like until I can just barely walk or worse, I do not think they will be impressed enough. They were not last time. Shaking unsteady walking and pain was not enough. 3 trips to the ER. The third time I felt like such a fool for trying. So maybe I will get better on my own or I will get worse enough to finally get the connection to get better. I have decided either way, I win. I will get through it. It is not impossible I could suddenly get better. Some vaccine people reported they had some tough scares afterwards that cleared up; maybe this is my tough scare. Maybe it is not just inflammation but a new or renewed attack. Well, if it is, I will deal with it as it comes. New days will bring new perspective and information.\n\nAnd, I talked to my wife. I asked for permission to break, basically. Of course she said I could if it came to that. But, I needed to hear that. I am used to making things work even in hard times. I am used to picking up the slack and taking care of others even with no energy. But as I have learned over the last 3 months or so... there are limits to everyone and everything. So, I will just keep going for now. And if I get to the point I cannot anymore, that is okay, too. Whatever comes next I am ready. Maybe it will be great news. Maybe bad. Too tired and sick to worry about it anymore. Bring it on, neuro crap; I am ready. If it gets a little worse, I go to the ER. If it just goes sideways for a few days, I have a regular neuro appt on Monday. If I get better, I will celebrate! With some kind of gluten free safe happy thing. Like carrots. Or a banana! A victory banana!\n\nThanks for reaching out and giving me a moment to get this off my chest. I hope you are taking care as well, that you are happy and well. Feel free to let me know how things are going for you as well. Have a good night. &gt;I would pull a deep breath but felt like I was not getting any oxygen, but according to the doodad on my finger, my oxygen level was golden.\n\nI wondered if those finger devices were any good. You buy them for yourself, do not know if they are medical grade quality and reliable. &gt;Unfortunately, I feel like I need to get worse until I can prove to some hospital what this is doing to me. Like until I can just barely walk or worse, I do not think they will be impressed enough. They were not last time. Shaking unsteady walking and pain was not enough. 3 trips to the ER. The third time I felt like such a fool for trying. So maybe I will get better on my own or I will get worse enough to finally get the connection to get better.\n\nI am sorry to hear you are going through this. I am going through the same thing. At least I finally have a doctor telling me it has to be a neuromuscular disease, but he is not a neurologist so it does not count.\n\nNeurologists and ER doctors are a disappointment. I cannot understand how they can see how I walk and not see that something is very wrong. I walk like a toddler. One neurologist referred me to a physical therapist who said I need to have confidence in my ability to walk and she would improve that in 4 weeks. Confidence!\n\nI have had symptoms for 1 1/2 years but they worsened in the last 6 months and my condition is now taking a nosedive. It is interesting that I had my second COVID shot a week ago, I wonder if that accelerated things, but I was getting progressively worse anyway. I cannot speak to the ones you buy for yourself, but I am confident the one at the hospital was working correctly. I *felt* like I was not getting any air, but I was still breathing. I could not breathe as deeply as I felt like I wanted to but I was getting enough oxygen from what air I was taking in.  \n\nAt this point I could not really move my legs anymore. I do not really know how this part works but I think the paralysis had started to spread to my diaphragm maybe? I do not know if any of that makes sense. It also could have just been panic setting in. Sorry to hear you are also suffering. I went to the ER again yesterday. It was better this time because I think I had better goals and perspective. Basically realized the ER is a blunt instrument. Our medical system sucks and sometimes you need to just use the ER (if one can afford it). It is confusing because a sane society should have a better mechanism for getting help. But they do not.\n\nMy use of the ER was to get a second opinion from another neurologist without having to wait 6 weeks. I went to a big hospital ER in the morning on a weekday to accomplish this. They did not help me much, but that was expected. But I got the other thing, the main thing, I came for: an expedited referral to a neurologist who specializes in adult neuromuscular disease. I am tired of talking to generalist neurologists who say things I know are wrong. That is not arrogance; I have a PhD in biology, and I have been reviewing the literature. I will resist the urge to self-diagnose, but I realized I need to demand someone who specializes in my kind of disorder and not another generalist who spends so much time treating so many other things they could not possibly give me the highest level of care if they wanted to...\n\nI am a snowflake. We all are. I think it paralyzes people whose job it is to categorize and put things in boxes all day. They cannot be wrong. Do not want to get sued, do not know, are not sure, do not have the time, so it is easier to punt on us.\n\nSo I think the game now is to get somebody who knows what they are doing, who is not scared by not having something fall nice and neat into a diagnostic box, and has the will and time to chase down what I have got, the courage to give it a name, and then, then, we can do something about it. And I will just keep going to neuros until I find one who I trust is doing this right.\n\nIt should not have to be like this. We should not have to work so hard to find help. But, yeah, I just went to the ER, not to get help, but to take one more step on the process of getting help. I am not there yet, but hell, it is progress; I will take it!\n\nMy advice is to keep at it. We both know that \u2018you just need confidence to walk\u2019 thing is bullshit. They have no idea. You deserve care from someone who has an idea. We just need to keep fighting until we find it. It should not be this hard, but I am realizing it just is. \n\nMy downslide started a week after covid shot #2. It has thankfully leveled off and is not getting worse in the last day or so, so I am hoping for better days ahead. I have heard it sound like other people on this sub also got really bad scares after their shots that sometimes just turned out ok. Hope that is true for both of us. Just keep going. Keep fighting. We will get through this, too. Good luck! I live near some of the best hospitals in the world and I am struck by how piecemeal health care is when it should be integrated, especially for tough cases like ours. There is no captain leading everything. Well that would be my GP, but he has little experience with this and is from another system. not the big world class hospital I am involved with now.\n\nSo we have to stumble around and try to beat the system and be our own detectives somewhat, which is terrible. &gt;My use of the ER was to get a second opinion from another neurologist without having to wait 6 weeks. I went to a big hospital ER in the morning on a weekday to accomplish this. They did not help me much, but that was expected. But I got the other thing, the main thing, I came for: an expedited referral to a neurologist who specializes in adult neuromuscular disease. \n\nYou are crafty, haha.\n\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I am tired of talking to generalist neurologists who say things I know are wrong. That is not arrogance; I have a PhD in biology, and I have been reviewing the literature. I will resist the urge to self-diagnose, but I realized I need to demand someone who specializes in my kind of disorder and not another generalist who spends so much time treating so many other things they could not possibly give me the highest level of care if they wanted to...\n\nBut these generalists should know what they lack and bump us up to experts. There is no shame in that. I do not understand the reluctance to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I am a snowflake. We all are. I think it paralyzes people whose job it is to categorize and put things in boxes all day. They cannot be wrong. Do not want to get sued, do not know, are not sure, do not have the time, so it is easier to punt on us.\n\nYes, I have been punted around. I started with spine surgeons because I had just had back surgery and assumed for a long time it was related to that. They all told me no, but two were very unhelpful about it, even rude, did not refer me to any specific neurologist even though they could have done so. They come from two of the best hospitals in the U.S. and this is how they treat patients they cannot do surgery on. I am sure I am getting respiratory symptoms too. It started months ago with my being no longer able to tolerate sleeping on my stomach, feeling out of breath when I did so.\n\nThen any time of day it felt like I was being squeezed in the upper back and rib cage, that intermittently I would find it hard to get a really deep breath, and the air would feel soupy. And that my windpipe is being pressured and that I have strange sensations in my esophagus.\n\nI went to the emergency room two months ago. They made me breathe into a handheld device. They made me do it over and over. They finally got the result they wanted and pronounced me OK to go home.\n\nThe doctor in charge understood what I was afraid of but did not think there was anything wrong and mentioned a spinal tap but did not think it was necessary to do one at that time.\n\nWhy did not I go back? I think I am going to get the same result until things get bad enough. My symptoms are getting worse, but slowly. And I have an oxygen meter I wear on my finger and it has not given any readings that are bad enough yet.\n\nI have an appointment in a few days and am going to plead with that neurologist to check this out. &gt;I do not really know how this part works but I think the paralysis had started to spread to my diaphragm maybe? I do not know if any of that makes sense. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Yeah, it stinks. If they do not have \u2018data\u2019 to prove your pain then, to them, it is not real and you are just a basket case. Putting their finger on the scale to see what they want to see, ignoring all the other signs of something real going on... yep, I feel this. I hear you.\n\nI think a big reason is they just do not know what to do. They do not understand, so it is easier to blame the patient as being neurotic and for making a mountain out of a molehill than confront the fact they are stumped, failing you, and leaving you to your suffering. Soooo much easier to imagine the suffering just is not real, or just exaggerated. Then they are not at fault, you are.\n\nToday was not easy for me. I am concerned I am not done with this wave of fighting yet. Shaking, numb, nauseous, anxious. The worst is the anxiety. But damn, I hesitate to tell the doctors that. If I tell them I woke up anxious and all day was like a day long panic attack then it is all the easier to write my confusing presentation as just smoke and mirrors. Feels impossible to make any doctor understand the anxiety is part of what this disease is doing to me; not how I feel about it; just another damaged system.\n\nI want to take a vacation from my body. But we have to fight instead. Tomorrow I will start fighting again. Calling to schedule another appointment. Going to one. Calling to transfer medical records. Then calling to transfer more medical records. Moving one chess piece after another. I just got to keep trying.\n\nOne thing that gives me heart is so many people on this sub tell a similar story. Unless you got wheeled in with classic absolutely textbook GBS, it takes multiple ER visits, urgent care visits, and neurologists until appropriate care starts being delivered. We are not alone. Keep pounding the rock. We can do this. Let me get this straight. The neurologist you were waiting to hear from 4 days ago, you heard from her and she  does not want to treat you for this apparent GBS relapse after the COVID shot? So in the meantime you went to the ER with her medical records so you could get expedited access to a different neurologist?\n\nDo you have an appointment with that neurologist yet, the one who specializes in neuromuscular?\n\nHow are the breathing problems you were worried about? Gone away? Pretty much, yeah. The current neuro is basically saying they do not know what it is exactly so they will not treat it. It is extremely hard for me to believe I do not have a subtype of GBS or CIDP. The symptoms and timing are too similar and nothing else is even close to fitting anymore. But without data.... And the way these people think is all tests are conclusive and never need to he repeated because they are perfect.\n\nI asked for a spinal tap at the ER the other day, but they would not. Okay, then. So I am lining up to get an appointment with a neuro who has a better shot of figuring it out anyway. Went to ER because I was concerned about walking ability deteriorating quickly and just trying to speed the everything thing up. Do not have an appointment with the new neuro yet because weekend, but hoping to leverage this into quicker action come Monday. If they push me off in the calendar, I have decided to call back every day until I get in sooner. \n\nI already had an appointment with old neuro tomorrow, which I will use to make sure I get another EMG either at that visit or a different one, because they should track this especially after an apparent relapse. Maybe we will talk and have some kind of breakthrough in our visit or something, but I am not counting on it. Whatever happens, I will make sure I take the records and send them to the new neuro and my PCP.\n\nBreathing is better. Some symptoms replaced by new symptoms. Crazy high anxiety and nausea. Green stool, which I had before during my last episode. Now lots of muscle fasciculations in the legs, but walking is better overall today. Cannot wait to see what tomorrow brings. I am sure it will be different lol. Hoping for not worse. Fingers crossed. I am in a similar position and getting similar results from medical people. Getting worse by the day. Tests show nothing much, no signs of autoimmune, etc. Pondering going to ER just because more limbs are involved and old symptoms are worse, can barely walk. I want to go to the urban world class hospital, not my local hospital, but my neurologist at world class hospital (who may or may not be a world class neurologist) did not make it sound like there would be any advantage to that. I will try to go through with my appointment with her tomorrow. Let her go through the process. She does have some ideas.\n\nWith me it could be surgical (I had back surgery a couple of years ago) even though several surgeons vehemently say no, my surgery was almost flawless. But I have extensive metal in my back so MRIs do not produce clear results. My neurologist thinks her hospital can produce a better MRI.\n\nHere is my latest idea. I want our water tested. I am worried maybe it is heavy metal poisoning. Not that I suspect the town water, just the pipes in our not so great house. Although we have been in the house many years the water tastes bad lately so maybe something deteriorated in the system. That of course would affect other household members. Keep plugging, it sounds like you are doing as well as you could. I am glad to hear the breathing is better. Your symptoms sound odd, though. Green stool? What could that be from?\n\nDo you live near a major urban area with a big, well respected hospital? Like NYC, Boston, San Francisco, etc? Not to be specific, just wondering if you see a difference between local hospital and big city hospital. I am pretty sure I have polyneuropathy. Sensory, motor, and a little bit of autonomic nervous system involvement -- and in this case the autonomic is the gut for me. I have intense nausea as well. And it tracks in severity with my other symptoms, so I am sure it is (somehow) related. \n\nSomebody on the sub at one point told me they had that as well. So it might just be one of those things. They also told me their stuff cleared up with IVIG. Recommended I get me some of that. ...hm... boy, I wish!\n\nI grew up in rural America and received such bad treatment from local hospitals for so many years, I learned my lesson. Never again. Unless it is something super simple like a cold, I am going big from now on. Fortunately, I live in a big city now, but even then, often I think this is not enough.\n\nLike, my neurologist basically gave up today. Said if I wanted to go further I basically needed a specialist in adult neuromuscular disease. I already thought that, but it was nice to hear some confirmation. But okay, how many neurologists in my area, even in a big city, have ever even treated GBS or CIDP before. And of the ones who have, how long will I have to wait to get in???\n\nSo I am casting a wider net now. My insurance allows it, so I am making appointments in my area, Boston, Mayo Clinic, etc. If I do not need them, I can push them back or cancel them. But I am just going to start making all the appointments I can until I get some traction. At least with the covid shot I do not have to be scared of flying anymore. \n\nUnfortunately, this will be expensive. But I figure it is my body. It is my most precious thing. So I am going to do my homework to keep the cost down from now on, but I am also going to do whatever it takes to get help. I am sorry to hear all that. \n\nTesting water makes sense. It is relatively cheap and it could at least close the door on one possibility, if nothing else. Have they ever tested your blood for heavy metal poisoning? If you have a lot of metal in your back, have they considered metallosis?\n\nI think the main thing is not the hospital itself but finding a neurologist who specializes in your kind of disorder and who is motivated to track down the cause. Those will usually be academic hospitals and needing to specifically screen physicians to make sure they have clinical interests and experience that line up with your condition. But even then, I know it will be a crap shoot. They can have all the experience in the world, but the fit has to be right, the personality, etc.\n\nA nerve biopsy could be helpful in a complicated cases. Have you considered it? I am on the fence. It can help to establish a diagnosis and pave the way towards treatment. But it is a long process and itself could potentially produce a source of chronic pain. And in the end, it requires sort of a motivating force beyond that, I think. Otherwise, it seems like we are just naming our disease for physicians who are not inclined to do anything about it anyway. One problem with a skin biopsy is it takes weeks to schedule. And weeks to process. So if a person is at all inclined to take that step, they pretty much need to get started yesterday.\n\nOh, by the way, my trip to the ER looks like it will be worth about 4 weeks in bumping myself up in queue to see a new specialist. At least that is how much they told me they are bumping me up in queue. And they will call back tomorrow... or maybe the day after... to talk about scheduling that appointment's exact time. And maybe I will get in within 10 days or so. All that for an 'emergency referral'. In hindsight, not sure if I would not done much worse by just making an appointment and calling back every day to look for a cancellation.\n\nI contacted the Mayo clinic and they will call me on Friday to talk about appointments. I reached out to another doc somewhere else -- that requires a referral from a physician -- who I contacted and snagged that referral. I will have to call that office back tomorrow. I imagine those appointments will be 4-6 weeks out at least. And I will call back regularly to look for cancellations and....\n\nThe theme I am noticing is that everything just takes weeks. It is starting to make sense to me to just do all the things as soon as you can. Get as many balls rolling as possible. If I do not need them - fine - cancel the appointment, etc. But everything is just so glacially slow, I think it is going to pay off to just try to do everything at once.\n\nHey, I know! It will be fun. I will start a game at home with the family and call it neurologist racing. People place bets on which neuro will see me first and the winner gets a cookie or something! &gt;Testing water makes sense. It is relatively cheap and it could at least close the door on one possibility, if nothing else. Have they ever tested your blood for heavy metal poisoning? If you have a lot of metal in your back, have they considered metallosis?\n\nI was thinking of being tested for metal poisoning, too, it would go hand in hand with bad water. No, I have not been tested for that.\n\nAlso, a brain tumor might be a possibility.\n\nI have to get creative. &gt;A nerve biopsy could be helpful in a complicated cases. Have you considered it? I am on the fence. It can help to establish a diagnosis and pave the way towards treatment. But it is a long process and itself could potentially produce a source of chronic pain. And in the end, it requires sort of a motivating force beyond that, I think. \n\nI might have heard about nerve biopsies but nobody has recommended one. I will bring it up with my neurologist. My motivating force would be that complete paralysis, which is where I am heading, is worse than pain. &gt;I think the main thing is not the hospital itself but finding a neurologist who specializes in your kind of disorder and who is motivated to track down the cause. Those will usually be academic hospitals and needing to specifically screen physicians to make sure they have clinical interests and experience that line up with your condition.\n\nMy husband says doctors are like porcupines. Porcupines want to treat everything by shooting it with quills (from a Dilbert comic). In other words, doctors want to treat things they are trained for and have blinders on otherwise.\n\nWhen you go to a new hospital, be aware that some of them will not let you change doctors once you choose one. Check that policy out first. &gt;The theme I am noticing is that everything just takes weeks. It is starting to make sense to me to just do all the things as soon as you can. Get as many balls rolling as possible. If I do not need them - fine - cancel the appointment, etc. But everything is just so glacially slow, I think it is going to pay off to just try to do everything at once.\n\nYup, that is exactly right. We are forced to overbook. Oh wow. I did not realize that was a policy at some places. But that explains a lot. I have been getting that vibe for sure. If you get stuck with a bad doc at first, that is really hard to shake. Yes, get creative! Like, what if that metal implant is \u2018perfectly safe nothing to worry about\u2019.... buuuuuut what if the people who made that implant never expected your water pipes would rust and you would be exposed to  which *could* cause a problem?\n\nAs a trained biologist / scientist I can say even if you are educated and thoughtful, even the most reasonable sounding or creative explanations will basically be wrong 9/10 times in biology. Because biology is just messy like that. But the way I see it, you miss 100% of the shots you do not take. So just got to takes those ideas and test them out.", "Second opinion or just anxiety/coincidence? So I got my flu vaccine Saturday morning. I woke up this morning lightheaded and some neck pain. I went and got a massage and now my feet and hands are both tingling, almost like they want to fall asleep. I am under the care of a neurologist for migraines so did a telehealth. He says this is coincidental and if I had GBS the tingling would be intense, mine is rated about 3 out 10 I would say. He also said it would progress within hours. Tonight, tingling is no worse but my anxiety def is. I have also had some random itching in my face and legs like a feather tickled me, it is so hard to explain. I googled which was a mistake so thought I would get the honest opinion of someone willing to listen. It would be appreciated!\n\nAlso for reference every since my covid vaccine in August I have had a positive ANA which makes me paranoid my immune system is confused.", "GBS or MS? Should I go to the ER? TL;DR: tingling in hands and feet started 2 weeks ago, 2 weeks after Moderna booster + flu shot. Have since experienced numbness and tingling on my back, calves, hands and feet, stabbing pains on hands and feet, increasing weakness, difficulty drawing straight lines and opening packages, and abnormal sensations throughout body. My patellar reflex is present right now, unclear if it is diminished or not. Normal B12, HA1C and TSH. \n\nOn December 2nd, I started feeling tingling in my hand and legs, and I have not felt normal since then. The tingling lasted several days and then mostly went away, but not completely (it still shows up sometimes, almost always in my feet, but is now easily relieved when I change position). \n\nAbout a week after the tingling started, I noticed that I am weaker than usual. I was holding a cup of coffee with my left hand, and it felt heavier than cups of coffee usually do. I also have some difficulty opening packages that were easy for me to open before. \n\nI walk very little, so it is hard to assess how my ability to walk has changed, but I do feel like my legs feel weirder than usual, perhaps the left more than the right. \n\nOh, also, I now feel some strange sensations around my body often. They feel as if someone splashed water on my skin or something, and last a few seconds at a time. \n\nI also get shooting, stabbing pains that last a few seconds in very random places (e.g. my tongue and right middle finger). I have also experienced longer-lasting strong pain since my symptoms started, in my right hand and then left foot.  \n\nAlso, I feel like drawing straight lines (with my right hand) is harder than usual. I am a physics minor, so I draw coordinate axes all the time, and recently it is been taking me a few tries to get them to look neat. \n\nI got my Moderna booster (after being initially vaccinated with Pfizer) and flu shot on November 15th, both at the same time.  The timeline of my symptoms seems compatible with GBS, so this makes me wonder if I should go to the ER. \n\nI have sought medical attention, but only before the onset of weakness. One of the things my doctor brought up was MS, so I will get a brain MRI and EMG test on Thursday. I have had a lot of blood tests, including for B12 and diabetes, all came back normal.\n\nAt the moment, I still have a patellar reflex (I made my boyfriend test it) but we are not doctors, so we do not know if my reflexes are diminished.", "Is this Gulillain Barre? So basically a few days ago I had a flu that went away after 2-3 days, however at the end of the flu I had a weird feeling in my mouth when eating. Almost like a numb feeling but not quite numb. I also started now having weird tingling in my entire body, leg arms, even under my hair, this tingling itches when it comes. I also feel a little week on both hands (this could be anxiety). Do you guys think this is Guillain barre? I am currently under a lot of anxiety and an answer would be much appreciated. It could be, but your best bet is to call your physician and ask, or go to urgent care and ask. Better than trying to diagnose yourself. What do you think it is. I am kind of leaving it off as anxiety. The tingling comes and goes. Your symptoms sound a lot like mine did. I had a cold/flu, then full-body tingling for a few days, then started getting muscle weakness and stumbling a little. When I called the nurse help line and told them my symptoms, they told me to go to the ER IMMEDIATELY.\n\nEven if it is not GBS (and I hope it is not) these are not symptoms I would brush off.\n\nI strongly urge you to call your doctor/nurse help line or just go directly to urgent care to get checked out.\n\nI hope you the best! Did your tingling have any itching????? Did it come and go. Mine comes and last for a few seconds. It is mostly in my hair too I do not remember itching but symptoms for GBS vary wildly.\n\nPlease get checked by a medical professional just to be safe. I will but what did the tingling feel like. Was it like ants crawling on your skin? Similar to that I do not remember itching but symptoms for GBS vary wildly.\n\nPlease get checked by a medical professional just to be safe. Initially, it felt like my arm feel asleep but my entire body. I do not feel that. I just feel tingling and itching. I do not have any sort of pin sharp pain or back pains. This is my fourth day with the tingling Go to the doctor. None of us can help you diagnose the tingling. \n\nWorst case scenario, it is GBS (or worse) and you are where you can get medical attention.\n\nBest case scenario, tingling is related to your anxiety (a symptom of hyperventilating) and you are still in the right place to get help with your anxiety. \n\nSuper best scenario, it is nothing. You spent a bring afternoon at the hospital or clinic and have an otherwise uneventful day.", "Hello everyone I am just here looking for guidance. I have a neurology appointment next week due to some progressive weakness, decreased reflexes, and decreased balance. I also have fasciculations. Has anyone had fasciculations with CIDP? Fasciculations is muscle contractions/twitching right? If so, yes. My muscles used to twitch like crazy after my episode of gbs, it is gone down quite a bit in the 3 years since but I still get them. Thank you for answering! I am sorry you had GBS. I have a cousin who had a severe bout of it and now I am dealing with something. Not sure what it is yet. Well good luck in figuring it out. Gbd/cidp can be a hard thing to get diagnosed. Try checking out the foundation website for some more info/resources.\n Do you have tingling? That is a big one. They can diagnose GBS with a spinal tap. There is a protein that is elevated, but I cannot remember which one. Yes! It cycles up before an infusion. Lidocaine patches, k-tape, magnesium malate supplements, and tens unit are your friend. 6 months out and I still twitch like crazy sometimes. Neurologist told me it is all part of the nerves healing. Hi. The Doctor thinks I have CIPD. I have numbness in both feet and both hands. I also have fasciculations in my calves non stop. I recently have started to have facial numbness and dizziness. I have to jump through some more medical testing ie. Another EMG, More blood work before I get my lumbar puncture. My face feels like I have a mask on. I cannot wait till they figure out what is going on with me. I am with ya man.", "Hair Donation Hey all! As the title implies, I am interested in donating my hair as I cannot donate anything else apparently. I went to go donate plasma after I found out how many donations it takes to make a single  IVIG treatment and was told that I am unable to donate anything anymore. Which kind of bummed me out tbh. Since the pandemic hit I have been growing out my hair due to a combination of being lazy and nothing being open lol. But it just hit me a few days ago that I could donate my hair to kind of give back to someone that may have donated plasma to me indirectly or for some poor cancer patient who needs a little boost of hope. Do any of you have experience with donating hair? What should I do, and how do I go about actually donating it? I have done hair donations in the past but not in the US. In my country, there are plenty of nonprofits that give you instructions on how to cut your hair properly for it to be able to actually be used. \nI was able to cut my hair by myself, and just put them in a ziplock bag and mail it in an envelope.  A quick google search for your area should do the trick! \n\nBut wow I did not know that we cannot donate plasma anymore\u2026 That is a huge bummer. I am wondering if it is the same for donating blood? I am including a link in regards to donating blood and/or plasma. \n\n\n\nSome areas are begging for donations as current supplies are in the critical stage.  If you can please consider donating.  \ud83d\udc9c I donated mine to wigs for kids since they do not charge the recipients That is awesome! Are they US based? Oh cool, I did not even think that would be an option. Thank you for bringing that up.  \n\n\nAs far as I was told from the person I spoke to at the plasma donation place, it is because GBS is an auto-immune thing that they cannot risk it for other patients. I do not know if that was the company covering themselves liability wise or if it is actually true. As for blood, I am not sure, I will call the redcross to see because there is a blood shortage. Yes they are\n\n(", "Diagnosis How were you guys ultimately diagnosed? A lumbar puncture or nerve conduction test, or both? What ultimately told the doctor you had GBS/CIDP? Still technically undiagnosed after over a year. Did everything: spinal tap, nerve conduction, the whole nine yards. They label what I have as GBS, but I show the symptoms of multiple variants (Miller-Fisher, AIDP, etc) that should not show up together. So they just gave me a fuck ton of IVIG, steroids, propofol, and breathing tubes and called it good \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nEdit: lumbar puncture had my protein counts suuuuuper high.

Why twice?? To be sure I guess. I was in a coma. \ud83d\ude00\nI remember the first one and the second one red it afterwards in the reports.", "Progression back to health  Just wanted to show my progression in a pictorial view and how I used cycling to keep myself motivated and track my progress.  Tracking my recovery was really important because I could easily look back and quantify how far I had come.  This was really motivating for me and \"added fuel to the fire\" to keep going.\n\nMy biggest advice to anyone going through GBS is try and begin the physical rehab aspect as soon as you are ready and be consistent with doing a little bit more each day. During the recovery, you will need to re-learn a lot of movements but do not get too discouraged on progress from one day to the next.  I needed to look at my progress vs. 2 weeks ago to truly get an appreciation for how I was progressing and I found that my healing was not necessarily linear.  Sometimes it seemed to me that I would feel the same for 3-4 days in a row which was discouraging at the start but if I kept up my excersizes, on that 5th day - I would see an improvement.\n\nIf anyone is interested, I was on a mental health podcast last week talking about my recovery and mainly how I dealt with things mentally but also a bit about my physical rehab.  Take care everyone and let me know if you have any questions!\n\n( This is inspiring and should give others a ton of motivation. Glad you are back on your feet... er, on your bike seat. That is outstanding.  Great to see the visual of your progress. Do you think being a fit athlete, muscle memory, knowing what training it takes to be at that level, aided in your recovery? It would be interesting to measure recovery between non athletes and athletic people. Absolutely, I had pretty strong legs going into this and I always thought to myself during that period of time where I could only stand for 30-45s - If I didnt have that base strength/fitness, I do not think I would have been able to stand at all. \n\nSo it forsure helped that I was never fully immobile, I was always able to stand up and walk from my bed to the washroom unassisted, assuming no stairs or any obstacles inbetween.(I would litterly shuffle my feet like a penguin to get there)\n\nOnce I started to work out again and have that routine, the muscles themselves came back really fast, like very noticeable physical adaptations in a short period.  The power in my lega came back non linearly. I chipped away at it for a few weeks without seeing too much progress(but oh man it felt good to ride my bike again) and then I kind of had a breakthrough week where I did multiple 3-4hour rides and felt really strong so I just convinced myself at that point that I was \"back\" and there was nothing that was going to stop me from continuing to work my ass off to get back to where I was (and beyond). What a great graph. I am proud of you, my fellow sufferer. :) Thank you! One of the toughest things early on was feeling alone and not really having anyone that I knew who I could to relate to. And I could find little to no information online about other athletes that had went through this and made a comeback. So hopefully this can inspire someone down the road to not lose hope \ud83d\ude4f This is great to see! I am just 3 weeks out of the hospital and sound similar to you with the shuffle. Did you work up to being able to ride in terms of getting feeling back? I am having so much numbness still that I have big stability issues since I cannot feel my feet. I actually found that riding on the recumbent bike was EASIER than walking, the bike helped me get some blood flow in my legs in the early stages and helped start to get some mobility in my ankles back. I found that my legs would actually feel better after riding and being on a stationary bike was great because I did not have to worry about stability issues - which I also had because like you said, you cannot really gauge or feel with your feet.  Another thing that really helped in the early stages: My parents would physcially bend my ankle back and forth with their hands for 15-20mins 2-3x a day (I could not touch/reach my feet because I was so stiff). At the start I could only let them bend my ankle about 1-2 inches each way due to pain and discomfort but eventually the range of motion came back after a few weeks of doing this.\n\nThis essentially helped me re-learn this movement, because at this point I could not move my ankle at all by myself. Thanks! I have more mobility it sounds like than you did. I have been doing PT but have found that I cannot plank too well because my feet are just so weird I cannot really keep them in the right alignment or support myself on them. I also find myself moving my ankles and toes all the time in order to keep things moving. I have also been trying to stretch which is just hell. I was very athletic and also very into yoga and it just shocks me how I lost all of my flexibility overnight with this. It is good to know that our bodies are stubborn but learn when we make them. It certainly inspires me. GBS is affecting my soul, and my motivation to do anything. There was a point that I was so depressed with it that all I wanted to do was stare at the ceiling, hopefully you have a good support network around you to get through this and let me know if you have any more questions or want to talk \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc", "Guillian-Barre Syndrome I posted about this two years ago. This was when a player for the Dallas Cowboys got sick with gas.\n\nThis young couple was giving birth to twins, a girl and a boy.  That family is doing fine now btw.   But back before the births the mother had everyone who planned to hold the babies to take a T-dab or whooping cough vaccination.  I took one.   This other guy I knew took one as well.\n\nOn the day of the births that guy and myself were sitting around in the hospital discussing this and that.  The guy confided to me that ever since he had taken the vaccination he had been experiencing numbness in this legs and even complete paralysis from the waste down.   What he said did not register with me right away.  Then a month later that guy had to be rushed to the hospital because he could not breathe.   The off and on paralysis had reached his lungs and breathing system. \n\nThis kept happening for weeks.  The Doctors did not have a remedy or known cure.  They kept telling him that more than likely it would eventually go away.  From what I have heard that is usually the case.  I heard the guy's son say that the disorder is named the Guillain-Barre disorder. That is the first time I have heard of it.\n\nEventually the guy died. He had a breathing or none breathing episode and he could not get to the Doctor in time, and he died.  The Doctors nor the medical advice I had researched  did not mention much about it being fatal.  But it is fatal, at least some of the time.   That guy's death is proof of that. You are coming to a conclusion without having his complete medical history. GBS *can* be fatal, yes. However, this is typically only the case in less developed regions of the world as a well equipped hospital should be able to keep you alive long enough for your body to recover well enough to begin breathing on your own again. It is also not very fast (it is fast, but not \"die before they intubate you\" fast).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not a doctor. All I know is the guy had GBS.  It paralyzed his lower body.  It on occasions cut off his breathing.  Unless someone lives in a permanent wing of a well equipped hospital, that can be fatal, and it was.   It is rare that GBS is fatal.  But as you said yourself \"GBS can be fatal, yes.\"  The doctors in the first world countries do not know everything.   There are many diseases and disorders that they do not have a viable clue about.  It also depends on how affluent you are. This person was at his ranch. He sent his son to the store.  His son came back, saw he could not breathe and could not resuscitate him in time.   It is simple as that. p.s. they performed an autopsey on this person and they found no other cause of death.\n\nAnother thing. Me and this guy 1st discussed his condition  one month.  The next month we visited him in the emergency section of a hospital.  I heard that he had other occasions  where his breathing stopped.  All the while I went on the assumption that GBS was rarely fatal and that he would shake it off and be fine.  The month after that he died as a direct result of GBS.  I know what I saw and witnessed.  Hot air to the contrary will not change my opinion. However, your description of his symptoms does not match GBS. I have read about GBS.  I am comfortable that what I read about and the symptoms this person suffered was indeed GBS.  Some people, like you, love to be get on social platforms and be contrary.  I am certain this is this case now. The irony Get lost troll. GBS is acute in nature. Meaning, the paralysis would not be on/off in nature. It could have possibly been CIDP but I do not know if that can affect breathing. Unless you know for a fact that he was diagnosed with GBS than you are just speculating. People do post here with what they think was GBS and later find out that is was something else. People do not just start having paralysis and shortness of breath without a reason.  You do not have to a Doctor's license to draw some general conclusions as to what happened.  I do not know exactly what caused the guy's death, but from what I have heard and what I have read I feel certain it was GBS.  No one here has offered anything to change my mind.  This guy was in his late 60s.  He led an active lifestyle.  He managed a ranch, him and his wife.  He had his own business. He pursued active hobbies like horseback riding, rodeos etc.   He takes one shot and he notices changes.  He feels paralysis and it gets progressively worse. It progresses until it cuts off his breathing.   I have read about GBS and that sounds like gbs to me.  I am speculating.  I do not claim to be a Dr.  But based on what he told me, what the Doctors told him at the hospital, and what I have read on the subject he suffered from gbs.  \n\nBesides, this is not some official scientific Doctor's forum.  This is a friigging reddit message board, no more,  no less.  Everything here is speculation.  The other clown's commentary to the contrary is speculation.  If you can speculate I can too.   I speculate that this person suffered from gbs.  I could be wrong.  Nobody is paying me to write this.   I certainly have not heard anything from anyone on this board to convince me other wise.  I have read enough.  I got enough sense to know when I am facing constructive information and when I am reading idle time contrariness from some anonymous message board clowns and want to BEs. They would not discharge someone who was having trouble breathing if they thought it was GBS. If your lungs get paralyzed and you stop breathing you would die. Again, GBS is acute in nature. It is not something that starts and stops. The guy was in a hospital.  They helped him out as best they could.  His breathing got better and they sent him home.  He was in a wheel chair.  In fact the only time I saw him and he was not in a wheelchair was on the day we talked and the babies were born.  He and everyone else was hoping his gbs situation would get better and that he would walk again.  Instead the situation got worse when It started affecting his breathing.  \n\nThere is a reason they call it a syndrome instead of a disease.  Doctors and other scientists do not have a full grasp of what this malady is about.  If they do not fully know you do not either. Speaking as someone who has had GBS, AFAIK, it does not get better and then get worse. I know that you are convinced that he died of GBS. But again, GBS progresses in a very specific way and it does not sound like that is what happened to this individual when they passed away. that is actually not true . I just got diagnosed with gbs and i am being discharged next week while still struggling to breathe badly I knew the guy that I have mentioned, but we were not fast friends. We were more like cordial friends. Sometimes months and maybe years passed before we crossed paths again. So I do not have a day to day description of what he went through.  I personally see a progression, enough so that I can conclude that it was GBS.  I am not going to waste time laying out that progression to win some silly argument.  It appears to me the people here have made up their minds to contradict what I say.  If that is what you want to do go ahead.  This is just a message board.  All I set out to do is share.  I have read scholarly articles about gbs and its symptoms. I see no disparity between what I have read and the conclusions Ive made. Right, but it did not get worse, start getting better, and then get worse again correct? That is what the OP was claiming happened to someone they assumed had GBS. Furthermore, if you were admitted to the hospital with trouble breathing, and they thought it was GBS, they would not send you home. they did \n\nso many doctors have no knowledge on this disease", "5 days in on mom's GBS diagnosis.... 5 days in on mom's GBS diagnosis....not seeing any improvement.....this is her 7th ivig treatment and the last one is tomorrow....anyone in a similar boat....I desperately need hope. Today's dosctor( we see a new one everyday) says he probably would have started on plasma therapy instead of ivig but it is too late for that and it kind of felt like a shitty thing to say but......let us hope her current course works soon This syndrome takes time, so much time. I know it feels like the sky is falling but you have to be patient. My sister in law is on week 5 of being in the ICU and ventilator but she is making progress slowly. Hang in there, praying for you and your mom. Keep being there for her.   That over everything. \n\nTry to keep in mind when dealing with staff, they (mostly) choose this work to help people.  I doubt the Dr was trying to be rude.  Personally I would rather hear this feedback so I can ask the next one about it, but everyone varies. \n\nGood luck. Thank you....yeah we have been so lucky with all the nurses and everything....this new guy just kind of irritated me...trying not.to take every little comment personally..... Sorry you are going through this - today\u2019s Dr was an idiot to throw in an \u2018if we would...\u2019 - just shows they are insecure and want to look more knowledgeable to yourself and family. Had this a few times when I had GBS - and learnt to ignore the Drs who slagged others off Gravitate to the staff that works for you as best you can.  I had nurses that did not work well with me, and nurses that did.  I never really talked to any of the Doctors for very long at the hospital so kind of wrote them all off.  I went back to my Primary Care Doctor as soon as I could.  Sadly the neurologist I got, a GBS researcher, did not care much about my case of Miller Fischer, guessing this did not fit into his research. Do not be too discouraged. I did not \u201cplateau\u201d until 3 weeks. Not everyone responds or responds as much to IVIg. I only had one round but it certainly was not enough to turn me around within days as it does with some people.\n\nShe mostly needs your support and advocacy right now. Thanks for being there for her. Good luck! Oh my gosh 3 weeks....you must be one tough cookie....we are used to medicine that works either instantly or within a day or two....this is going to take some getting used to. I really appreciate your words....I know I cannot fix this for her but I can just be there and be her daughter....\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f Miller Fischer...ill have to look into this as I am unfamiliar. The nurses have been such great advocates for my mom's care and have been so helpful and willing to answer any and all questions...they have also been incredibly honest and truthful which I have really appreciated....My mom is a retired nurse so she knows exactly what she is doing ans what is going on with her body which is scary and comforting at the same time Yeah this was a really young guy(and I am trying not to be too agist here) but you could tell he was trying to prove himself to us.....sadly that was the wrong way to go about it and gain the trust of the patient and the patients family. Overall though, the nurses and doctors have been great. If anyone has to deal with this, I hope they do so in highlands ranch Colorado.....uchealth has been a godsend Thank you so much...oh boy 5 weeks...I hope that you continue to see progress great and small. Today my mom was able to be off the respirator for 30 minutes AND she held her head up all by herself....just really makes you think about the everyday things we take for granted....praying for your sister in law and sending positive vibes your way GBS is very unusual in a number of ways and also varies so much person to person. So, I try not to say definitively whether something will or will not work, how long it will last, etc. My doctors were not willing to commit too much to any expectations either, I think because there are just so many unknowns.\n\nIs your mother able to talk? If she is intubated or ventilated, I can give some more suggestions based on my own experience that might help with communication. Sorry to hear that. I know it is got to be hard seeing it from the outside as well. I was in the ICU for four weeks and, especially early on, it was a nightmare.\n\nIs she able to sleep at night? Can she get the attention of a nurse if she is in pain during the night shift?\n\nIf you can, please ask her if she is had trouble with that.\n\nSorry if the next section is a little disturbing but I think it is important to share.\n\nThe first week, I could not sleep at all, had spiking pain, and no way to ring the nurse call button because I was paralyzed from the neck down. They tried putting a special call pad next to my head but it always slid down so I could go for hours in pain without anyone checking in on me. When it got really bad, I discovered if I thrashed in bed, I could raise my blood pressure enough to set off alarms. Thankfully, my wife and mother were fantastic advocates for me and pushed to have a nurse stay in the room with me overnight since I could not call for attention. And, thankfully, my doctor was incredibly caring and made sure that happened.\n\nHow are you handling communication? Early on, I had to point at letters on a sheet using a straw held in my mouth which was really tough. Later, another GBS patient gave me glasses with a laser pointer attached and it helped a lot.\n\nBut I think there are apps that could be even more useful because they let you spell out important requests with just a few looks. I have not tried it myself yet but Speakprose seems like it could be useful. If you try that, I would be very curious to hear about your experience. I might create an app for the very specific purpose of spelling with limited eye movement (especially in a hospital setting). But if there is already something usable enough, I will just recommend people use that. Yeh overall they are good - though at the time it could ruin your day! But here I am 20 years on and alive and working when I would have been dead so overall - all the best for your mum \ud83d\ude42 She is on a respirator and unable to speak....she can hold her head on her own and move it from side to side. She can blink, has a tight hand squeeze....she is unable to move her legs but can move the lower part of her arms a bit..... Happy to hear it is 20 years later and you are thriving.....gives us hope That is tough. I imagine she has periodic breathing treatments. For me, they got fairly exhausting and could cause strong headaches so you might want to ask her about that.\n\nFor communication, please see my other comment in this thread that includes suggestions ( Can I ask you a question....you were intubate d correct? Were there any particular thoughts or feelings that you had during that time? Needs that were not being fulfilled or ways in which you could have been made more comfortable? Just trying to figure out what is going on in her mind..... Intubated briefly (1 week?) then got a tracheostomy and was on a ventilator until about 2.5 months from the beginning. I transferred from the ICU at 1 month to a hospital that did rehab while on a ventilator. If that is at all possible, I highly recommend it. My understanding is that that is not a common arrangement though.\n\nBeing on a ventilator can be scary, especially wondering how long you will rely on it. When I was asked to consent to the tracheostomy, I barely hesitated because I was confident in my doctor and medical staff. The only time I got really worried (had panic attacks) was when the ICU staff tried to get me out of the room for a change of pace. They had to put me on a portable ventilator and I could feel a difference in the air (even when they matched the pressure; some or all of it was imagined). So, I got worried the portable vent would fail and I would be unable to breathe. This was even though I was confident in most of the staff.\n\nWhen I was in my bed with the regular ventilator, I was not worried about that.\n\nSo, you could ask about her confidence in the staff and equipment to see if anything could be improved.\n\nI also had symptoms where muscle-deep pressure was extremely painful and I felt extremely hot. They are both related to the neuropathic disorder but not everyone gets those symptoms. Ask if she has had those issues. I think the pressure one is common. I have not heard of anyone else having temperature perception issues.\n\nAnd I also had some very vivid hallucinations that I remember better than most dreams I have ever had. No idea what portion of it was GBS, stress reaction, the many drugs I was prescribed, and serious sleep deprivation. But they stopped before I left the ICU and had weaned the prescriptions somewhat and was getting better sleep. The entire 3-month ordeal, I only forgot 2 days very early on. The rest was clear,  including the hallucinations. Thank you for responding. Shes been intubated for 5 almost 6 days and will do a tracheostomy possibly tomorrow. She was not able to take any breaths on her own today so much worse than yesterday. I guess she has not plateaued like everyone told us....trying to stay positive...not sure how much more this illness can rob her of......she has he wits about her and knows everything that is going on since she is a retired nurse..... Sorry to hear that :(\n\nIt is a horrible place to be in - not just for the person suffering from GBS but also their family members. So, please make sure you have other people help you out so you can take some time for yourself as well.\n\nWhat helped me was being stubbornly optimistic. I knew most people recovered significantly in time and I kept telling myself that I just needed to wait it out and do as much as I could in rehab to rebuild my strength. And when things did improve, the excitement really helped me through. It can seem to stall for a little while but then you tend to notice a new improvement and it just builds slowly over time.\n\nGood luck! We started out the day with news that she might have c diff but thankfully negative. She was off the vent for 2 whole hours! We all needed this good day- it is been super tough on my aunt , my dad and myself. We are doing our best to take care of us.....our neighbors have been amazing......I have to steel myself that tomorrow night not be as positive but two steps forward and a step back....I will take whatever we can get. Appreciate your getting back with me- Its so so helpful to have your perspective Hi again- just reaching out because my mom has been moved to a long term care ICU facility (it is been 2 days).....she is incredibly tired although she is not sedated or taking any pain meds.....the doctors and nurses are having trouble weaning her off the vent due to this fatigue.....they did brain scans 3 days ago and she was fine.....did this happen to you? Or anyone you know of..... :(\n\nThinking back on it, I think my doctors were overly ambitious at first. I think they started with an attempt at a 10 minute \u201cleak\u201d and I had to get them to stop it early. So, it was very slow at first but I think once I got going, it only improved.\n\nI only think I had trouble with fatigue very early on when I had tons of medications and had not slept for days. I know fatigue is a common problem for people after recovery though I have not experienced it myself and what I have heard of sounds much more mild. As in, if they push their wheelchair a long distance or walk a few miles, they need a lot of rest afterwards.\n\nI definitely experienced my muscles being tired (being in my wheelchair early on took a lot more effort than lying in bed) and when I started walking, my feet got tired very quickly. After a short walk, it felt like I would run several miles. But that improved a lot over time to the point where I think it is worse than pre-GBS but it is close enough that I am not certain.\n\nI really hope things improve for your mom soon! I was in the hospital for botulism but had a very similar issue with the call button I could only move the fingers in my right hand and could not see or reach the call button so I always lived in fear of not being able to get ahold of the nurses. I also would mess with sensors to get help. Eventually when I could move my hand a little bit more I had my wife tie the call button around my wrist. \n\nTo communicate my wife would say the alphabet and I would squeeze her hand on each letter to spell out each word, the laser pointer glasses is a good idea if she is able to open her eyes. They tried to give me a keyboard that you could point to letters and had pictures of basic things but my site was not good enough to use it.", "Possible return of GBS ", "I have never talked to another person who has suffered from GBS I am (35M) on year 2 of recovery. I do not know why I have waited so long to reach out to anyone else who is experienced GBS. The past two years have been been wild. I had just released a record, played an amazing show the day after my birthday and a week later I was laying in a hospital bed trying to make sense of it all. I would say recovery has been pretty rough. I was not expecting so much frustration to build post hospital stay, considering I had been sooooo optimistic in the hospital. Honestly would love to just talk to another person who has been in the same position. Feel free to DM me! I would love to talk to someone about it as well. I am only about 4 months out from my hospital stay and would love to get perspective from someone who is further out than me! December will be 2 years since diagnosis for me. Feel free to reach out! This December makes for 9 years since my GBS bout. Life with two kids 7 and 9 makes my time a little chaotic, but feel free to DM as well. Feel free to DM me (24/M)!  I am 6 months into recovery!  I would be more than happy to discuss everything with you. Talking with another person with GBS helped me tremendously. It gets better! I am 6 months out and it is been tough but things do improve slowly. Biggest thing for me was making sure those around me know I am still healing. Yeah, that was the hardest thing to get people to understand. Thank you so much for reaching out. I try to describe to people how I am feeling/doing and they do their best to understand, but unless you have been through it, you do not really know. \n\nHow is your recovery at 6 months? Do you feel your peripheral nerves are healing? I hear a lot about residual exhaustion, but not so much if people have been able to regain total ability in their feet/hands/face. \n\nFor me I only had symptoms in my hands/feet. My hands have come back to almost 100% (they were also the last to start feeling the symptoms) but my feet still feel like blocks of ice. I have done PT and have built up muscles to compensate for my lack of nerves (so am able to walk without aid (walker, cane) go upstairs without crawling, get up off the ground, etc. but still look like there is definitely something wrong with me when I walk and I cannot go fast or I will fall....\n\nIn your experience do you feel you have gained full ability again? Close to it. I was paralyzed from the waist down and lost most mobility in my arms. Was on a breathing tube for a few days. I started walking with a walker after about 3 weeks. After about 3 months I could jog again and now I am able to run short distances. However I get tired very easily. I can work full time but endurance is still a problem. PT has helped a lot. I am doing more athletics-based PT instead of neuro-PT. It is tough as someone who has played sports all my life, but things get better. But my ankles and parts of my calves are still numb, I have lost dexterity in my hands, and general weakness is a problem. But things improve! Time is your greatest ally, and I have learned to be my own advocate. Close to it. I was paralyzed from the waist down and lost most mobility in my arms. Was on a breathing tube for a few days.

Feel free to DM as well, would love to help and share what I can!\n\nI have made significant progress but the fatigue continues to slap me in the face. I can totally relate to the frustration and the physical pain. I am 18 months out and it really does get better. I went through depression and had suicidal thoughts in silence while putting a tough exterior, it was exhausting. But I finally started to see progress and got my confidence back along with physical strength. It is a very slow recovery but you will get there, just do not give up. Hi I had gbs from a respiratory infection in 2015. If you ever want to talk you can Pm me. I was not really positive in the hospital. I was terrified because before I was put on ivig I was going down hill fast. I could not feel my toes or turn over at all. It hit my right side harder so before they officially diagnosed it I could not hold my right arm up. After the hospital I had to use a walker for a while. Gbs is so scary because you can get it from a virus that seems to go away. You were jogging at 3 months??? I am so jealous! If I attempted to run I would fall for sure. My ankles and feet just do not respond as I would like. \n\nWow, paralyzed from the waste down, that is rough. \n\nAnd that is what I am scared of when going back to work, the residual fatigue and not being able to do anything besides working. I am also an active person and before this happened was going to the gym at least 5 days a week. I have stopped my PT for the time being and am just started back at the gym working on building muscle again and doing what I can there. \n\nThanks again for sharing your story! I am kind of a weird case as my recovery was much quicker than expected given the severity of situation. \n\nThe biggest thing is just being upfront with your employer regarding your fatigue. Make sure you take breaks when you need to. Stamina has been the thing that takes the longest to come back. Just doing whatever you can helps! Thank you!! Very much appreciated advice.", "Sudden onset hand tingling Hello I have been in the hospital for a week now for very bad headaches. My whole body sometimes burns, mostly in the head area, chest, and back. Since a few days I have tingling in random areas, but mostly located in my right hand/arm. It does go away, but comes back randomly. The doctors did a lumbar puncture before tingling started, so the LP was performed about 5 days ago. An MRI and CT was also done. They still take blood daily and I had some kidney pain and they are looking in the urine. Also I had a rash at the beginning of all this. I am hopping it is not GBS since the tingling comes it goes, yet sometimes it is painful. I was having heart trouble before all this, which maybe was some sort of infection. The doctors have no idea why I have burning pain and suddenly the tingling in hand. Would you consider GBS? Doctor did not seem to think it was, but I am staying here, lying here, praying it does not progress to it. \n\nThank you all so much for your input. i asked this long ago and no one answered lol , but that sounds like a more serious thing with the chest involved! that means the chest muscles could , or may not be going to feel numb , the diaphragm, which regulates a lot of breathing can become depressed and use of a ventilator is required . i had this on for 3 days , but thanks the lord it did not progress (only could not feel my feet and part of my right hand , and somewhat my chest , bc after waiting 15 hours at the er watching everyone go in but me ?? i walked out not feeling my feet That sounds really scary. I have had the heart problems for 3 weeks, but it is going away there. Still random burning pains sometimes with headaches (migraines??), but the sudden tingling really worries me.  I wish I had a good answer for you. As a doctor of pharmacy, my knowledge was \"5 days of IVIG\". I knew jack shit before it happened to me. I hope whatever is happening to you they figure it out and can give you appropriate treatment. can i ask what your age is ?? Im 29", "I am sorry I could not find a health sub to post this I broke my foot and it is excruciating. I am going to the hospital tomorrow but I am really scared. Hospitals scare me especially when I had gbs. \nI am also scared because of covid. People in their 30\u2019s, 40\u2019s, and 50\u2019s are not having respiratory symptoms they are having massive strokes. No one knows why either. \n\nAnyway I can barely walk and I usually wear sandals around my house but my broken foot will not fit in it. I really do not know what I am going to do. I think it would be gross to wear a sock in the Er waiting room. I broke it from falling. \nI only have Tylenol and ibuprofen and it is not helping and neither is ice. Slow down, it is a scary time but try hard to slow down. You need to get your foot fixed. Hospitals are taking every precaution, they know how to do that. Tell them you had GBS, tell them your fears, let them know how anxious you are. If you do not have an objection let them give you something to calm you. It is hard to deal with the pain. Honestly, unless there is a reason you have to wait to go to the hospital, go now and get it done with. Positive vibes coming your way. Your apprehension is valid, do not let it control you. You conquered GBS, you are strong. I know I need to relax. I am really freaking out though. But you are right that they are taking every precaution. I forgot I definitely have to tell them I had gbs considering that makes it my re easily to get covid. I will tell them my fears and how anxious I am. I definitely do not have an objection to them giving me something to relax and definitely something for my excruciating pain. There is a reason I have to wait until tomorrow. My husband is driving me and we are both about to go to bed. Thank you for saying that my apprehension is valid. And thank you so much for saying I am strong because I conquered gbs. I really appreciate your message. Please go to the hospital. They are taking all precautions to keep people from getting it. It is dangerous to not go in for something like this. Wear a mask, wash your hands, and do not touch your face. Did you get your foot fixed? How are you doing? I am going to the Er now. I really appreciate you asking. I am scared but if I do not get my foot fixed it could be really bad. My brother was snowboarding and he broke his ankle. He was screaming and crying for help and man saw and heard him and he just walked over my brother like a total asshole. He had to crawl to my mom\u2019s car and my brother drove home w a broken ankle. He waited a week then went to the hospital. He had to have surgery and pins in his ankle and because of that he is in pain all the time, so I know I have to go. Thank you so much for saying that. I am going to the Er very soon. I do not want to take an ambulance, and my husband did not sleep last night so he is sleeping now. My dad is taking me. I just hate that since my foot is so swollen I cannot even wear a sandal. My dad said to wear two pairs of socks. I can barely walk now so it is getting worse. It has these huge black and blue marks. I am so scared it is so excruciating and I am afraid they are going to do something to fix it and make it worse. I have a mask, and I have been washing my hands a lot, plus I am trying to not touch my face. It is hard to not do that. Idk why. But I really appreciate your comment. \ud83d\udc99 Let us know how it goes I definitely will. I am going to be on Reddit while I am there. Did you get your foot looked at? Yeah I have a slight break. Sorry it is been awhile. Sometimes I take a sm break. No painkillers though because it is not a big break. They just prescribed a small dose of norco for a week now I am just stuck on crutches and it fucking hurts like hell. I take a LOT of ibuprofen. I assume it is because of what I am already on. I am just glad it is not bad because I did not go to the hospital for days because I am afraid of hospitals and catching covid.", "Longer term PTSD So, it was nearly 35odd years ago I was diagnosed at 5 years old.\n\nNearly 4 weeks in intensive care, several months in hospital. Do not know the scope of the treatment.\n\nI have always had fear of things in my mouth. Specifically dentists. It kind of clicked a few months ago, this is likely from the tracheotomy and the \u2018vaccuming\u2019 of my lungs and various feeding tubes I had. \n\nReading here I picked up why when I am unable to communicate correctly I struggle hard with anxiety.... it is likely based around the frustrations of the trachea and being non verbal for most of my time in hospital. \n\nI know ptsd might be a little strong, but I am also not sure what the correct term may be sorry.\n\nDoes anyone else have longer term lingering mental health things they struggle with?  Thanks. I am ok. Just slowly breaking down some long standing mental barriers.  \n\nAfter stewing on finding one here the other day, I kind of figured I should ask.", "Discussion Topic: How has GBS affected work? Did you have to take time off? Do you find anything different or harder to do with nerve damage? What parts of work have changed since your diagnosis? My GBS onset happened in October of last year, and I had been working from home already due to COVID. I exhausted all of my medical leave and even took an unpaid leave of absence until i felt I was in a good enough position to work. I have to take more frequent breaks during the day because my legs will hurt if i sit too long. That is the main problem. Other than that i do not find it to be all that different. I needed to take about two weeks off after being hospitalized and subsequently diagnosed. After that I began working remotely (coincidentally a few months before everyone would begin working remotely because of the pandemic). \n\nI am a developer so my work is very sedentary. This proved to be very useful while I was trying to re-learn how to walk. Some of the nerve damage had extended to my hands which affected my typing pretty significantly, but this improved gradually over time. Physically there was no reason I saw that I could not continue to work at my usual pace, but I was wrong.\n\nThe fatigue impacted my work significantly. It took me much longer to complete tasks that, a month prior, would have taken very little time. This was pretty frustrating because I felt like I should have been only slightly impacted given that my job is not really physical at all. I was pretty concerned that I would lose my job because my throughput had declined so much, but my workplace was incredibly understanding and I am lucky to be a part of their team.\n\nNow I feel that I am back at full capacity, after almost two years. If you are in my shoes now, know that you will improve and you will not always be operating at a new limited capacity. Make sure to take care of yourself now, follow PT and OT guidance religiously, and be patient with yourself. GBS is no joke, but you will likely improve and recover if you give yourself what you need to do so. I required months of OT and PT and weeks of time for infusions to recover after 10 days in the hospital. Gripping things like a pen and lifting my leg up over the bathtub were big achievements. Starting from scratch. Walked with a cane for some time in public which I always felt embarrassed by.  I still feel self conscious about my gait. It is still difficult to stand in place. \n\nHeavy steroid treatments would make so irritable. I would take a day off here and there during the thick of those  just so I would not lash out at work. \n\nThere were also new things like needing a button hook for buttons and putting on AFOs every day. No more fancy dress shoes, now tactical or hiking boots. Muscles would tire fast. Anything requiring thumb strength has remained a challenge.  I have been on medical leave since the end of March, i stopped getting paid in April and my job is protected until the end of June. I am not sure my mobility, ADLs and fatigue will be up to par by then. I was out of work for 9 whole dang months. I work for a major auto insurance company in medical billing. I have been working on a modified schedule after we quickly realized 40hrs a week was not going to work. Went down to 4hrs/day now up to 6, and should be back to full schedule in 3 weeks. Job modifications for less typing since it is painful, but also no sensation in my finger tips to tell what is going on. The company\u2019s been awesome with me. Let us just say they really know how to go with the FLO I was diagnosed the first week of 2/2020 - did 8 days in ICU and am thankful they caught it early so I avoided a vent but nothing else.  Took 3 weeks off after my release and started working from home, then Covid so I was able to continue to work from home (and still do to this day!).  I work in IT so I am on a computer, all day.  I found that I had issues with my feet, tingling, numbness, pain that is alleviated by pretty much working all day with my feet on the desk, reclined... not sure that would fly at the office.  So work is work, not much change except pretty exhausted at the end of the day.  What kills me is that I was very active up until this, I would hike at least every other day and that is no more, maybe one day.  I have chronic fatigue and between hitting the trails or sitting on my ass, well the couch has won out lately. I had GBS when I was 10. It started at the legs and could not walk and before I knew it I was paralyzed. After months in recovery and PT I regained most of my strength and grateful I can walk, exercise again. Fast forward 15 years later I started having random muscle spasms that continue 5 years later. Not sure what it is or why but a few times a week my left hand more than my right will go numb after getting pins and needles feeling that only lay for a few seconds but the \u201cshake\u201d or spasms seem to last for about 5 minutes. I get it in the legs and foot but not as common. When this happens I try and stop whatever it is I am doing and try to control it but I cannot so I just get up and walk around if I am at work. Like most I spend 100% of my shift seating behind a screen diagnosing vehicle issues via phone/email/chat etc. It is also followed by a numbness. I have not brought it up to my PCP only because I do not like doctors and because I do not want to be on any medication. Went to ER 6/6.  Finally \"officially\" diagnosed w/ MFS 8/13.  Thankfully no pain, no difficulty breathing, and have been OOW since.  But short-term disability about to run out, so will need to soon talk to employer.  But can otherwise relate to comments here.  Big thing for me was neuro put me on Gabapenten, but I did not like the way it made me feel more wobbly.  So he said he did not care if I continued with it or not, up to me.  So I have weened myself off of it and wonder now about whether it was indeed helpful.  But it felt like it masked things.  I do not feel wobbly as much, but head feels swimmier.  So jury is still out on it I guess.  But yeah, definitely a head-game as much as a physical.  And I have wondered about what it looks like to return to work.  Right now, my gut tells me it would take 8 hrs to do 4 hrs of work. What do you do for work? Videography. But here lately mostly project mgmt.  I worked as a crew chief for an events company. Everything from building and taking down temporary stadium seating to concerts, private parties and functions. I got hospitalised 5/19 with extreme weakness and was on a vent within a day. Double dose of ivig. Blind in one eye. Spent 6 weeks in ICU. Lost over 30kgs. Told I would never walk again and be in hospital/care for at least two years. I left after six months and stopped all prescription medication at same time. At time of writing (9/21) I am walking few km every day, cycling and pushing hard to regain full function of legs and feet. Fatigue is biggest issue but I am hoping to be fit for work again by 2023.  Thank you. Trying to Leslie Knope it! I have a long way to go but firm believer that we should accept the diagnosis but never the prognosis. The mind is a powerful thing", "GBS in WLS Just curious, has anyone experienced guillain barre syndrome after weightloss surgery? It is not something you hear of in the weightloss surgery world when you are doing your research, but seems to be more common then one may think the more I read and post on forms. \n\nThanks. \u263a\ufe0f", "Is a COVID vaccine safe for us? I had guillan barre as a teen (about 15 years ago) and am now fully recovered. I do not get a flu shot, just to be safe for a relapse. Do we have any risk in getting a COVID vaccine when it is available? Some of my more paranoid family members think I should opt out. There is no guidance on this yet. My suspicion is that there will be an increased risk, however, and we will just have to decide personally whether it is worth it. I just got a 10-year tetanus booster this week and the guidance was that even that shot could raise the risk for a relapse -- I had never been told that in the past. I got it anyway (and have not had any issues).\n\nPresuming it all comes to market, I will probably get the Covid vaccine and consider myself a guinea pig for other GBS survivors! Yeah I did get some other vaccines including tetanus several years ago in order to travel to Chile which required them. I did not have any issues, I want to get the COVID vaccine to \u201cdo my part\u201d but i am definitely worried a relapse as an adult would be much more severe. Thank you. I hate how terrified I am of this. I am going to be watching what the foundation says and other official sources for guidance. My doctor said the highest probable chance of a secondary reaction is about 3%. I will take that action over COVID Talk to your neurologist! They are the best person to help you answer that question.\n\nMy neuro has already told me to get the vaccine when it is available. There has been just one study investigating \"risk of relapse\" of vaccination in GBS/CIDP.\n\n(\n\n3.5% of GBS patients and 7.7% of CIDP patients reported a relapse (though the CIDP sample size was much lower). Though not statistically significant (due to small sample size), those who received a vaccine within 6 weeks of the original onset were more likely to report a relapse after later vaccinations. Like others suggest, talk to your dr.  \n\nI do follow the research, and for all other types of existing vaccines, there has not been any data showing an increased risk (\n\nBut saying that, some of the covid vaccines are using new technologies, and we will not know for certain.  Even if there is an increased risk from the vaccine, remember we have to weigh that against potential problems from getting the virus itself, and remember we could also get a relapse from the virus! Since I had it so long ago I do not currently have a neurologist but thank you I appreciate the feedback. Thank you for posting. This was helpful :) I am keeping an eye out for official statements from the ( when a vaccine is available. Also, like others said, talk with your neurologist/specialist prior to getting it. Thank you, since I had GBS as a teenager I do not have a current doctor for it and most primary care I have seen have never heard of it. I will get more in touch with current info through the foundation. Much appreciated. I was told I cannot do vaccines anymore period. Guess I will have to talk to my doctor when they finally start rolling out the one for COVID\n\nThat is been one of my big questions. what happens if you already got Covid are those people supposed to be taking the vaccine too?\n\nAs much as I do not want that shit, I really really do not want to get GBS again. Going on six years and I am finally just getting to the point I can get myself off the floor onto a flat surface Yes and you can ask questions directly to them through the ( page. They say they answer questions within 2 business days.  Hopefully we will all be able to receive it without issue. I was told not to get it, because of my gbs diagnosis. I do not think it would be safe to get one to be honest. Gbs is a horrible disease so no thank you. Yes, my personal opinion - and this is personal, not in mod role - is that is really depends on what GBS was like for you. There is so much unknown and so few long term studies, so the best \"case study\" most of us have our ourselves. I personally will be avoiding any vaccination for a while, but I also avoid flu shots - my husband on the other hand gets them ASAP. I had GBS very young, a very long time ago (1980s) so I did not get the full treatment people nowadays get and my source infection is unclear.  For me, I have been avoiding exposure and will be slow to adopt vaccines but my personal experience with GBS was back when treatment was rudimentary. This is a huge difference from modern patients! But this is where I am frustrated. You, someone with an auto immune disorder, wants to do their part to help others. While so many others who can, refuse for them or their kids. I am a teacher at a school where almost 15% of the students are not vaccinated and have \"exemptions.\" Talking to several of them.... They saw a video about how dangerous vaccines are. Or one time their friend's best friend's daughter's whatever got a bad reaction. So many people are focused on the one or themselves and do not care about \"the greater good\" or \"doing their part.\" Sorry. Rant over. So to clarify, because I am not sure I understand- if someone started showing symptoms and had a vaccine within those first 6 weeks, any time they got a vaccine after would be a higher chance of relapse? Is that right? I totally agree. I was just talking to someone today about how this it pretty much the worst possible scenario to throw at the United States\u2019 \u201cone above the many\u201d philosophy. Maybe it is gotten us a lot of money and innovation, but putting yourself before the community is definitely causing our downfall right now. If they had a vaccine in the prior 6 weeks to developing GBS, then they would have a higher chance of relapse after future vaccines.\n\nIf the trigger for a case of GBS was say, a Campylobacter Jejuni infection, I would suggest there probably is not any additional risk of relapse if that person was to have vaccinations in the future. (for anything other than a hypothetical Campylobacter jejuni vaccine)", "Need some advise (so confused) I had the astrazeneca vaccine 3 months ago, two weeks after that my toes tingled then hands then my legs were very sore within a day or two.\n\nSitting on a chair for 5 mins made my legs tingle and hurt alot. I the struggled to stand but could stand just in pain and could walk but in pain. Then my arms got sore that resting my 1 month old daughters head on my arm hurt so much.\n\nI went to so many doctors and one neaurologist who did MRI and suggested anti depressant. My wife is thinking I am going abit nuts trying to find a doctor to diagnose this. My doctor said it is anxiety. I lost alot of weight and muscle.\n\nFast forward today (6 weeks later) I am not as sore I can walk but at times I get tingles and leg pains that come and go.. I am  worried that I may have GBS but cannot find help in Australia to  be taken seriously or maybe I am not likely to have GBS..\n\nI can keep insisting on a spinal tap but would it detect GBS if symptoms are now just tingling from time to time?\n\nWhat are your thoughts, my concern also is my wife is really getting abit tired of doctor visits, she is very supportive and kind but I can see how this can be anoying for her. How are your reflexes? If your reflexes are responsive, it is unlikely that you have GBS. Reflex is good, wife enjoyed hitting my leg .. The reason I asked is I had a bad case of GBS in 1995.  I got the Pfizer mRNA vaccines and had some tingling and neuropathy after the second vax.  I was nervous about it and my original neurologist has died in 2016, so I went to the ER just to make sure it was not a flare up.  The ER doctor was thinking about admitting me for a spinal tap, but the consulting neurologist had him check my reflexes.  She said if my reflexes were ok, then I should just monitor.  She did prescribe me several weeks of physical therapy and lots of hydration.  I was unknowingly very dehydrated.  Now I am fine.  I hope this helps you somewhat. Good luck. Hi did you figure out what it was?", "My 19 Year Old Son Got Diagnosed Last Wednesday. What a roller coaster we have been on since then. Luckily (there is no luck but....), it does not seem to have moved from his legs, he has slight weakness in his hands/arms. I cannot believe how debilitating it is.  Sounds like they caught it early. Hang in there.  He is now going in to have to explain GBS for a long time. He is young... hopefully strong and will move on from this. If you have any questions ask, you will get answers.  I would say good luck and question everything. Push the Neuro's to get as much help as you can. Everyone is experience is different.  Hopefully they get him turned around quickly and limit the nerve damage, which in theory will speed up the recovery. Man, that is lucky compared to what it could be. Sending good thoughts to your son and yourself... Feel free to reach out if you want someone to talk to!  Thank you for those that have commented, the hospital my son is at only saw 6 cases last year. We have been reading a lot since his diagnosis as we knew nothing about it previous to that (as I guess would be the case with everyone) and we do consider him very lucky compared to what some people have gone through. He had an MRI and a nerve conduction test yesterday, nerve test was very good, neurosurgeon said should make a complete recovery, had a slight bit of swelling in the spine but have been told that is conducive to the illness. He has gone from me having to lift him out of the bed into wheelchair to being able to get himself into one with relative ease within 2 days however, we also realise he has a long road ahead. Just as a side note, we were worried about his job but his company has been fantastic and extremely accommodating. Can not thank them enough.\n Hey!

I have really been thinking on how I could impact this community, with what I learned from my experience that not many can relate to outside of here.\n\nFeel free to reach out if your son has any questions! I would love to give him some positive words. Hey Gus. Thank you for your offer. I consider my son one of the lucky ones. 10 days in hospital, 3 or 4 of those were really just there to do his daily physiotherapy sessions. He was back to work within two weeks of getting out of hospital, initially just doing 4 hour days but is now back full time. From initial diagnosis to today has been 5 weeks. Considering the stories I have heard it is been miraculous. Was 19 years old when diagnosed as well. He has quite a life ahead of him. Make sure he realizes that the pain meds are meds, not free drugs. Good luck to you all. &gt;how are you coping with fatigue now?  Good to hear he is back to full-time.", "Need advice on shoes I do not think I have seen this discussed, my apologe if it has.  I am from the CIDP camp and just realized I have been wearing size 12 when I am actually 13.  I have a pair of Allbirds that have been good to me and I tried to order the same as a replacement and they no longer cut it.  \n\nWith Neuropathy anything I can do is huge so would love to hear what works for the rest of you. Do you have foot drop?  Cannot lift your ankle? I wear high tops or AFOs if I have to walk more than 50 feet.  My AFOs are made from Nike tennis shoes with wide soles for better balance. Yes I do have foot drop but never was comfortable with high tops.  I do not know what AFOs are.  I have a high arch and narrow feet size 13, the perfect storm of sorry we do not have those... I wear Eccos almost exclusively. Holy crap they are pricey!  Lucky it seems I have several local places I can try before I buy. thanks. Ankle Foot Orthotics, you can go expensive with a prescription or order yourself on the market.  Sports places have a lot of support for ankles, most you can wear with normal shoes, it just needs to pull your foot back up. I wear Richie-design custom AFOs daily. I have drop foot in both feet. I have found New Balance sneakers offer the best for toe box width and overall width for orthotics. Hiking boots and tac boots are my daily go-to. A shoe with zero heel drop works best for me. Anything with a heel will make my knees ache after a few hours on my feet. If you have health insurance, I would suggest visiting a podiatrist. They specialize in foot issues and will get you AFO braces to support your feet and keep them from dropping. They also have access to special shoes and insoles.\n\nEdit:  The podiatrist is a foot doctor, orthotics is the people that do the AFO braces and shoes. I think podiatrists usually work in orthotic clinics, sry it was 6 years ago and was not fresh in my memory. \"Hanger Clinic\" is who I used on the west coast of U.S. , they were reputable and friendly\n\nCheck your feet daily when you are trying new techniques because any blisters or calluses will be catastrophic to your recovery. If you do get any wounds, there is a health department called \"wound care\" or sometimes \"wound clinic\". \n\nYour feet do not heal like normal with neuropathy, the signals to heal the area get scrambled.\n\nPropet is a company that makes shoes that are neuropathy friendly. Try Amazon, always stuff on sale. Also. Thicker socks are great for keeping pain, agitation  and rubbing to a minimum. Dickies makes a workboot sock with extra padding, so does Carhartt. Another company I have found is \"Wells Lamont\".\n\nGrab some toe spacers if your toes are rubbing together. \n\nPM me if you have any additional questions, I ran the recovery gauntlet with size 16's. I have gotten the \"we do not have that\" my whole life hah. If you get them, you will wonder how you got along for so long without them. I could not be anywhere near as active as I am without them. I have gone through a few sets over the 20 years Ive had CIDP.\n\nNeurologists do not talk about AFOs enough. They really make life so much better. FWIW the All Birds Tree Dasher (their running shoe) is what I wear when I will be doing lots of walking. I do not have foot drop though, just some lingering neuropathy in my feet from GBS. &gt; All Birds Tree Dasher\n\nI just got a pair of those to replace my 3 year old pair and hate them.  The lack of a tongue and having to slip them on is sooo painful and they feel like they are crushing my feet when on.  That is what started this whole post actually! Interesting, I own about 20 pairs of sneakers and they are the most comfortable pair to do any sort of walking in. Most other shoes cause the bottoms of my feet to start hurting after a while. I actually find it hard to believe the soft breathable upper of the Tree Dasher could feel like it was crushing your foot unless it was way too small. Hush Puppy. Good for big feet and also very comfy. They also have some disability friendly designs like Mary Janes with Velcro closures! Hush puppy.  Valorous f'r big feet and eke very comfy\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`", "Muscle weakness and pinching pain at the spine - GBS? Hello, I still have 20 days until neurologist appointment so I am anxious to know what is wrong with me.\n\nI got one of the mRNA Covid vaccines in April 1st and it was 4-5 days later that I noticed my body was not as strong. Since that time I have had difficulty raising my head in the mornings and had a stiff neck with pain.\n\nBut the muscle weakness worsened and in June I started having trouble walking and even swallowing. Adding to that, I feel like a knife is pressing on my spine, just under my neck. I am an ankylosing spondilitis patient too but this thing is clearly new! One thing I notices was my symptoms diminished after taking NSAIDs. So I think it is some kind of nerve inflammation but which one? I will preface by saying I am not a doctor, but I had GBS in 2014. It is my understanding that it basically results from the immune system overreacting to an infection. Symptoms usually develop quickly following whatever triggered the response, within a few days. In my case, my right thumb went numb on a Tuesday night and I was in the ICU on a vent by Friday.\n\nSymptoms also usually start as tingling or numbness in the hands, arms, feet and legs. And I know there are variations among cases, but taking NSAIDs/pain relievers never made a dent in any of the symptoms I had. So, not a diagnosis, but your case sounds drastically different from what I experienced.\n\nIf you just got one dose of the covid vaccine, you must have gotten the Johnson &amp; Johnson one? I think it is worth noting that as of July 31st, 2021, 100 out of 12,500,000 people who received that specific vaccination were reported to have Guillain-Barre. None of the other varieties have had any statistically significant increase in occurrence of GBS.\n\nI hope you feel better soon, friend. I had my second dose on August 19th and within a few hours has muscle fatigue and tingling in a my limbs, as well as a net like rash under my skin, nerve and joint pain, and blurry vision.  After a trip to the ER, multiple doctor appointments, and a meeting with a neurologist, I know a few more things about warning signs for GBS. \nIn my case, my muscles still have all their strength, they just feel tired. Meaning I can still walk on my tippy toes and stuff like that.\nAlso, they have said reflexes are the first thing to go with GBS. If you hit that special spot on your knee and your legs react, then it most likely is not GBS. \n\nI am also experiencing the pinching pain in my spine so I have a referral to get an MRI next week. Today I did lab work so they can test for auto immune disease. \n\nThe basic answer I got from my neurologist is that he is seeing a lot of people with symptoms that do not have a diagnosis for them, but they will resolve on their own with time. So I am hoping all my tests come back normal\u2026 although I would love to have an official diagnosis for what is causing all this. I am not a doctor but have been in the community 10+ years and have suffered with it. Judging by what you said, I (personally) think it is not GBS. The nature of the disease is a rapid onset of severe symptoms, which is a medical emergency with paralysis being a main symptom, this usually reaches a critical point within days to weeks, and this is when a GBS sufferer will typically need intensive care due to becoming paralysed and disabled mobility-wise. It sounds like the timescale does not really fit, and as someone said previously, NSAIDS usually would not make much difference in the nerve and muscular pain with someone with GBS.\n\nIt might still be another auto-immune illness and it is worth noting that there are variants of GBS such as CIDP where symptoms appear over a longer-term period, but I would say it is unusual to have any CIDP symptoms just 4 days after a vaccine (this disease is characterised by symptoms normally taking months to first appear).\n\nI hope this helps a little, good luck finding a diagnosis and get well soon. No, I received one of the two mRNA vaccines. I think they also bring a wide range of complications. Thank you for your input. NSAID effect is a key indicator I think. Yes, I get a systemic muscle weakness and even reflexes like swallowing and breathing get lame. Do you have a mechanical or rheumatoid problem at your spine? I am not a doctor here, but it sounds like anxiety symptoms, try meditation and if during the meditation you feel better than its likely anxiety but check with doctors. My first neurologist said the same thing. But I am experienced enough that I can realize it is not psychosomatic. The problem was, all nerve conduction and electromyography was done on a day I felt normal. So it was hard to detect anything. Next time I will go without taking NSAIDs and they will see a crawling man. Not that I know of. But I will know more when I get my MRI next week", "Share your stories! I know this sub is tiny, but I am currently going through what may be a relapse and it has me realizing just how little info there is out there! Please do share your stories - Google will turn them up and people can and do find this sub through other means.\n\nStories are very useful because they give more insight into this syndrome, from its onset and how it feels (try googling symptoms - very vague!), to what the experience is like, to what recovery and long-term effects are. All of this is very useful to others!\n\nPlease feel free to share your stories and experiences, both for yourself (this is a traumatic, life-disrupting syndrome!) and for others. My story:\nFive years ago I had an abscessed tooth that they had to pull after trying to save it with a root canal. Soon after I got the flu (actually diagnosed after labs). I got over the flu  but felt like I might still have a sinus infection. Then one morning I woke up and my hands were tingling -- like they were asleep but when I shook them they remained tingly. I ate breakfast, thinking I might feel better: no change. Then I jumped in the shower, thinking it might help. As soon as the water hit my body I realized something was VERY WRONG.  I headed to the clinic and a doctor there called it immediately: GBS. She sent me home and said it might not progress. By that later afternoon I was at the emergency room and they did not believe me -- actually laughed at me telling me how rare it was and no clinic doc could diagnose it. All night in ER and the doc there finally apologized and also diagnosed it. Checked in the hospital and had to go through it all again: laughter from floor doc who said emergency room doc did not know. Takes them three days to call a neurologist. Four more days and I am completely paralyzed. When it hits your core it is the worse. Could barely open my eyes. My voice affected -- barely able to talk. It was all through my body and they felt it was starting to affect my lungs. They finally decide to treat with IVIG. On the third day of IVIG it never progresses any further (lucky). Did six days IVIG.  Total in the hospital over 30 days. Had to learn to use my hands again, walk again. Took months to be able to walk to the mail box but by month six I was back at work. \n\nHad a relapse last year in July. Had only a cold this time but again, thought I might of had a sinus infection (both times confirmed) and had that same old feeling one morning: tingly hands. Not as bad the second time but it did progress to my core. They treated faster. Now a diagnosis of CIDP. Seven days in hospital. I have good insurance but the bills still rack up. \n\nNext time it happens the neurologist stays he can treat me at home. He also promises to not have to wait for symptoms like he had to the second time -- he believed me but nothing in the tests could confirm for a few days as I could feel it progress.\n\nI would be so happy to help others. Anyone need anything I will try to help. Such a scary journey. The second time I took control of my experience in the hospital and was surprised at how much more in control of the event I was -- made it much better.  CIDP is so rough. That is the fear all of us have, I think - could these residuals be something more? Could this weak episode be something lingering? How are you coping with it? Any tricks/tools you find especially useful?\n\nThank you for sharing. I sincerely believe that a repository of stories and experiences is very helpful, especially for those of us wondering \"is this a relapse or just residual weakness?\" so I super appreciate you sharing your experiences. First-hand accounts are so useful and they are so rare to find! Was diagnosed 12 years ago  following a flu vaccine for work. Could not walk, had spinal tap, diagnosed with it. Also had an episode of paralysis when I was young. Parents said high fever following the German measles vaccine. Healthy now but cannot get flu shot. I am suspecting there are links between vaccines and GBS. Any research on this?  My mother recently was diagnosed after getting a flu shot with an \"immune booster\". We are still looking for more resources. Diagnosed 7 months ago, still recovering. I stopped getting the flu shot a few years ago after living abroad for a while. Simply forgot about it, I am not anti-vaccine. In the months before onset I was pretty overworked, on a steady diet of coffee and occasional take out, often not eating all day and not getting great sleep. In the week before onset, I had a bad case of the flu. I left work early one day with a bad headache and leg pain. The next day my body ached, and I was vomiting up any food or water. Had to eat popsicles to stay alive that week. \n\nDoctor prescribed a bunch of meds: cough syrup, lidocaine, advair inhaler, couple others. As I started to get better, I took about 7 or 8 really hot showers to clear sinuses and pass the time. That night, my feet started to go numb/tingly, and my face was twitching around my nose and eyes. I thought \"did I take too many hot showers? Is that a thing?\"\n\nThe next morning when I woke up, my feet were worse and the numbness/tingling had spread to my hands. I was fatigued and m body ached. Overall just felt like shit, hard to describe. I thought \"ok, something is wrong.\" Called the advice nurse and they recommended I go to the ER. After much questioning and a spinal tap I got a preliminary diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome. I was sent to ICU where they begin monitoring my condition, and informed me that respiratory failure would likely occur. I authorized them to put me on life support, which happened after about one day. My last memory is getting a feeding tube shoved down my throat just before I went into a coma that lasted over one month.\n\nThe coma was quite an experience - a gigantic string of really crazy dreams. Too much to write about here. During the coma I had IVIG treatment and a blood transfusion called plasmapheresis that cleaned something negative out of the blood which was responsible for attacking my nerves. Also my lungs collapsed twice and had to be re-inflated. The hospital staff said that was likely from being a heavy smoker. I have since quit smoking, which I found is really easy to do when you are paralyzed and live in hospitals; however, 7 months later I still want a cigarette. Especially when I smell it on the CNAs who smoke during their break.\n\nMy first memory after waking up from the coma is being in a dark and crowded ICU room. I could not move anything except my head and neck. I knew what had happened to me because in the dreams during the coma I also had had Guillain-Barre syndrome. I was extremely uncomfortable and just wanted to move.\n\nIn the next month or so after waking up, I was a bit hazy mentally. I had trouble separating real memories from those in the dream world that took place during the coma. I still have trouble remembering things that happened during that time.\n\nFor about a month I was in acute care in the hospital. I could not talk because of the trach, and the ability to move other parts of my body was slowly coming back. Not talking is one of the most frustrating things I have ever experienced. I was in a lot of pain, especially in my arms and legs. Something as simple as a nurse laying a pillow on top of my legs would cause the nerve pain to increase. Getting turned on to my side to be cleaned up after a bowel movement was excruciating. I felt like screaming at the nurses when they were not gentle, but I could not say anything. Not even a grunt.\n\nFinally I was weaned off of the trach, and began speech therapy with the goal of being able to eat and drink and pronounce words properly. Not being able to eat and drink with the second most frustrating thing. I just wanted water. My mouth was so dry all day everyday. I used to have dreams of eating fruit. I was also doing physical therapy. The first motion that came back was my ability to shrug my shoulders. After that I started moving my arms, then hips, then my hands started to get motion, now finally my legs are able to move and the last thing left is my feet. \n\nWhen the trach was removed, my insurance decided to send me to a nursing home. On a side note, it is funny how much say the insurance has in your medical decisions. They said that because I did not have a trach, they would no longer pay for me to stay in a real Hospital. They decided on several nursing homes that they would allow me to stay in, in an area that was not convenient for me. Now, they have decided that I no longer Get Physical Therapy even though I cannot walk. My flan offers 100 days of physical therapy for a year and I have to wait until the new year to get more physical therapy. BUT, I have to be re-hospitalized and re-diagnosed in order to get more physical therapy. Despite the fact that I CANNOT WALK and HAVE A DIAGNOSIS. \n\nTransitioning to the nursing home was a nice change. Living in the hospital, with all the beeping and people screaming and constantly being woken up was really stressful. Living in a nursing home is still unpleasnt, to say the least, but it is a lot better than Hospital life. I usually get a good night's sleep and it is relatively quiet when the CNAs remember to close the door. \n\nThese days I am just trying to pass the time before I can walk. Really glad that I saved up for nice noise cancelling headphones before getting GBS. I am considering going back home, but there are a lot of things to figure out before I will know if I can: how to get an air bed to prevent bed sores, how to get a home health aide, how to transfer me into a wheelchair if needed, what is covered by my insurance, and how to get physical therapy. ", "The Pins and Needles feeling. So about 4 or so days ago, I got the J&amp;J vaccine after practically being forced to get it to keep my job. I had missed the deadline for the 1st dose of either Pfizer or Moderna and plus it was only one shot so I thought I would get it. \n\nAs soon as the pharmacist put it into me, I felt a slight tingle on the back of my neck towards the left side. On the drive back I also felt this on my left foot.\n\nI have not had any other symptoms since other than a sore arm for a few days, also noticed feeling nauseated too.\n\nI have read that symptoms from the vaccine are the worst in the 48 hr time frame after you get it. I was wondering if I was to get GB, if the early symptoms would have been a lot worse. Slight tingling is not a huge concern. Additionally, you would not have a reaction as soon as the vaccine was administered. \n\nYou should be concerned if you start experiencing severe weakness, loss of range of motion, fatigue, any sort of loss of feeling, etc. \n\nIf you feel like you are developing those symptoms, go to the hospital and request some diagnostics. When does the fatigue become intolerable? Even before the vaccine I noticed that I had to nap every day during the workday (thank god for remote work) but it was only for 30 min. I mean a lot of people suffer from chronic fatigue before the vaccination. In terms of fatigue from GBS, something as simple as a walk around your house can be difficult.\n\nFor me, it was when I did not have enough energy to eat. My first major symptoms, though, was the inability to run (could not even jog) and bilateral paralysis of my face.\n\nIf your movement becomes restricted within the next few days, that is really when you should be concerned. I will keep this in mind and I do appreciate you helping me here. Will keep all of you posted too. The tingling sensations, they do feel like that pin or needle pain here and there. I started to notice them after the vaccine. Of course. Best of luck with everything. I will add one more thing, that I had some pins and needles in my hands, but most of my pain was in my feet (felt/still feels like walking on Legos all the time), inside of my legs (as if someone had punched me a bunch), and soreness in my arms. I would not describe it as a walking on Legos pain, it feels more like a some annoying little pain of being poked by a needle but in a very gentle way. My arm where I got the shot on has been sore since even though a few days have passed. Got it. The soreness in your arm is pretty standard for all of the vaccines. I got Pfizer and the first shot was not too bad, but the second shot I had a lot of soreness the following week in my arm. I got the J&amp;J because it was one shot and do not want to get another one, pretty sure they will mandate boosters in a few months but I am going to quit my job then lol. Still a bit worried though as I have never had the pins and needles sensations before the vaccine. Sure that is your prerogative. I will be getting the booster.\n\nIf the feeling spreads to other limbs get checked out and specifically ask for tests for GBS. I do think you are fine for now though. About 4 days have passed since the vaccine, would you say the second I feel like I cannot walk around my home as easily is when I need to seek medical treatment? Yeah I think so. If you feel like you cannot walk as easy, or runnign is almost impossible, that is when you go to the hospital Got it, that should ease my naturally worried mind :) Dude, calm down. ???? Why do you think you have guillome barre just because you got a vaccine shot? It is normal to feel some side effects for a few days after a vaccine but if you had GB, trust me, it will be much worse than some tingling. That is relieving to hear. I just looked up my symptom of the needles and pins feeling on my limbs and wondered what was going on, somehow it took me to a post about early onset of GB. Worst thing you can do is google symptoms and self diagnose. You will probably be fine.  Most people do not get GBS from the shot.  It is rare.  But I am one of the unlucky few that got Guillain Barre from the Pfizer shot.  I had brain fog, joint pain, eye pain, palpitations and muscle pain for the first week. Then I developed insomnia and peripheral neuropathy two weeks out.  I have had burning sensations in my limbs, pins and needles, tingling, etc.  I was eventually diagnosed a month after my shot.  I am 12 weeks out and still having issues.  I had to get the shot for my job.  Now I do not know if I can do my job.  I am no doctor but your symptoms do not sound like GBS. I hope you are going to be okay and am praying for you. How bad was the joint pain and eye pain? I also did not know you could get GB from Pfizer or Moderna, thought it was only a J&amp;J thing. GBS does not start within 48 hours because it is antibody mediated (the B-cell processes take more time). It typically starts at around 10-14 days after initial exposure to the antigen.\n\nNonetheless, I suggest seeing a medical doctor to discuss your concerns. It is much rarer, but it can be due to any of the vaccines or COVID itself, since the underlying mechanism is most likely to be ( \\- classic examples are the ( but ( and indeed the ( which is the vector used by the J&amp;J vaccine.\n\nThe actual likelihood of developing disease depends on stochastic factors (luck), and the kinetics of the overall cocapture process over time in the lymph, versus inhibitory process (such as siglec receptors that bind sialic acids and inhibit B-cells and T-cells) I had tingling in my legs for a week now after the vaccine. You sure that it would be worse if it is GBS? I got tinglings in my legs and hands about 48 hours after vaccination and have this for a week now. My left leg also feels slightly weaker. But it cannot be gbs then? And back to worrying I go. How are you now A lot better but still waiting a couple more weeks before coming to any conclusion When did the tingling go away? About a week in but I cannot say it has gone away for good tbh.", "Can get the vaccine! Persons who have previously had GBS may receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

This meant that even with three months of planning, I have missed an infusion due to my old insurance refusing to ship meds to my new address. Our new insurance has not given us cards yet, and will not tell us our id # for another week, so I cannot even get the process started for approval again. I have not had symptoms of CIDP in three months, but now the burning and tingling is coming back in my hands and feet. I am honestly really scared and feeling kind of hopeless.. Can u get them to ship to your old residence?  But hold at ups/fedex and have someone you know who stills near where you lived to pick it up and ask them to ship it to you. \n\nIf that does not work. I would say be patient. I know it is difficult and it sucks. You will get your new insurance soon. In the meantime if you have a medical emergency you can find a low cost doctor that you can see temporarily until you get your new card. Just google it. Good luck to you.

I posted this on another GBS discussion.\n\nI have a son that just went to Thailand so I asked my neurologist about this. I am paraphrasing so bear with me.  We got an autoimmune disorder but that does not mean we have a compromised immune system.  AIDS, HIV, people undergoing cancer treatment that is an example of compromised immune system.  We are within the same risk factors as anyone else,  like age and general health.  However. We could have the genetic makeup that makes our bodies over react to a virus by turning it into auto immune. Allergies, eczema are a couple of examples of everyday autoimmune, your body working against itself.  That is how the discussion with my doctor went. I feel a little better after his explanation.

I am also going to repost my reply (NOT made as a mod, as a normal person):\n\n-----\n\nThat being said, we now have bodywide nerve damage, which includes our nerves on organs like our lungs. When our nerves regrow, for some of us, they do not regrow as strongly - I experienced this when I had pneumonia recently and had to be hospitalized. The doctors were very confused - they had sent me home because they needed beds and I am young, but then a day later I was back in the ER needing oxygen and I explained that I had been on a respirator as a child due to GBS. They still shrugged it off until I passed out and (from what my husband says) all the alarms started blaring. Our residual effects are still very unknown because GBS studies are new and long-term studies are rare and not extensive.\n\nIn some ways, things are way better for us as GBS survivors because doctors now know about our issues - when I was younger, GPs had never heard of GBS. On the flip side, a little knowledge can be more dangerous than a lot of knowledge, and I have found doctors dismiss it as a potential issue because they are not aware of how it affects us long-term and do not include things like weakened nerves or residuals into their advice.\n\nI, personally, am concerned - I saw how pneumonia went for me. It should not have been as bad as it was, according to doctors, and their confusion over why it was bad (despite me repeatedly trying to explain residuals and GBS) meant that treatment was delayed because they were not listening. I nearly died.\n\n----\n\nIMO we need to be vigilant about our own health - GBS is rare and almost every doctor we see is not going to be a specialist in it. I do not think we are particularly at risk for contracting CV over anyone else, but should we get it, it could hit us harder and doctors may not know why or treat us accordingly. I am NOT saying this in a panicking way. I am saying be VIGILANT about your health - if you have been on a respirator for GBS, make that clear from the start. I did not with my pneumonia and once I did their treatment changed.  ( Just a useful link I found earlier Details concerns in regards to the coronavirus and Guillain Barre Will we see an influx of people being diagnosed with GBS with th9s virus going around? That is when I got my case, after a supposed flu I never had any symptoms of... Would you mind elaborating on that last point please? Was it that you were diagnosed with the flu but had zero symptoms whatsoever or only mild symptoms, or that you doctors were not aware of GBS and just guessed that you may have had a recent infection with that being unlikely? I would be particularly grateful if anybody has any experience/input with the acute form of GBS in particular.  Doctors in my country seem to only be familiar with the chronic form, and the one specialist who diagnosed me with AIDP has not gotten back still when I asked for advice about how this impacts/is impacted by the coronavirus. Sure. It took forever for them to figure it out, but after the spinal tap, it was Guillain-Barre. The doctors ruled out everything but the flu, but I had symptoms whatsoever. I guess I had just had the flu and not noticed it. Something to keep in mind.  AFAIK the same breathing systems that they are saying are going to end up rationed if hospitals get swamped with Corona Virus patients is what many GBS folks end up on.  It would be important to identify GBS earlier at times like this so they can avoid the need for breathing assistance if possible. I had my immune system tested because of my GBS/TM history by my allergist and I found that my IGG levels are lower than they should be. I thought GBS did comprise immune systems but maybe I misunderstand. If my immune system is compromise then I suppose GBS could have been a result not the cause. I work in hospitals, long term care facilities and labs as an electro-mechanical tech. \nI had Miller-Fisher GBS 12 years ago (on my 18th birthday... happy birthday! :P). If you guys worked in that environment, would you consider working? I am able to take time off if I am considered higher risk.\n\nLuckily, I was only hospitalized for a month. I was fully paralyzed and on a ventilator with a tracheostomy. I recovered very well, I just get tired out easier now. I still have a lot of vivid reoccurring memories of being treated for GBS. Whenever I hear talk of ventilators I cringe and imagine being on one again. I am still actively recovering from GBS, so maybe it is different, but both my doctor and neurologist told me that I was high risk and to be extra careful I predicted this would be the case due to the nature of GBS being trigged by the flu, also because the 2015 Zika Epidemic led to a huge surge in GBS and CIDP. News outlets/medical reports are starting to report GBS brought on by coronavirus.\n\nSo far I have seen reported cases in China, Italy, UK and US.\n\nBut whether this is leading to a \"spike/influx\" in GBS cases I am not sure.\n\nHere are a few sources:\n\n\n\nIn this tweet an American musician explains how he is been left paralysed by \"GBS induced by COVID.\"\n", "Got my booster today! A full dose of Moderna rather than the half. Happy to answer questions or address concerns anyone may have. Stay safe out there! Until today, I did not realize I was eligible for my booster 30 days after my second dose. I only scheduled today due to the **CDC\u2019s new recommendation that those who received Pfizer can get boosted at five months instead of two.** First two were Pfizer, opted for moderna this time. \n\nNo noticeable side effects so far. \n\nI am terrified an upper respiratory infection like omicron, even if it is a mild case, could cause a relapse. I never want to go through that horror again. I am still trying to recover 18 months later. I do not want to start over and feel that way again. I cannot.", "GBS Recovery Going VERY Well for 26 yr old Cyclist :) Hey guys, I made a post a few months ago called \"My ride through gbs\" and just wanted to give an update as of today (link to previous post below):\n\n( \n\nI have been ramping my training up again for the past 2 months on the bike with my coach and this past week I just finished:\n\n*  426km distance\n* 15hr12min saddle time\n* \\+3,486m of elevation gain in 1 week\n\nI rode close to 5 hours today and set ALL-TIME average power personal bests for any ride over 4 hours and 25 minutes(snip of the ride attached for any fellow cyclists).  So what I am trying to say is do not put yourself in a box and say, I had GBS - I am only capable of X.  You need to believe you will recover and things will come around, maybe not right away but they will.  If I am already putting up these numbers this soon after being diagnosed (approx. 6 months ago), I cant imagine what things will be looking like later this summer!!\n\nThanks for all the support on my last post and stay safe out there everyone, I almost always ride alone which becomes important especially now with social distancing! I also do a fair bit of my riding in my condo on the trainer. Update: today I did my first real power testing since I have been sick. I really took it easy getting back into it and did not want to burn myself out early (my coach played a huge role in helping me with this). I managed a hold a 342W average over 12 mins which is 94% of my personal best for that duration after only 2 months of training(I was training hard for about 7 months before I was diagnosed with GBS ( 10-14hr/week on average)\n\nMy feet are still numb/tingly from GBS and that even extends into my lower calve still but riding my bike helps alot and whatever nerve damage I have, I do not find it limits me and if it does, I am making up for it by being so much stronger mentally now.\n\nI would love to hear from any other athletes recovering from GBS, whether it be with a Paralympic goal or whether it be trying to still aim for the top level of the sport.", "Am I experiencing early GBS symptoms? I am a 26 y/o male who exercises regularly. Four days ago I was on a run and started experiencing tightness in both of my calves. Shook it off as being sore from my run previous day. The following night my feet started to get very cold and clammy/sweaty. The day after I went for a run and my right foot went completely numb, felt like pins and needles. Since then, I have been experiencing numbness and prickly feeling in my feet and lower legs while trying to exercise and occasional numbness in my hands, but the latter might also be due to anxiety. Also my feet get very cold and sweaty at night. I am extremely nervous because I have never experienced leg issues like this before. Not to mention with COVID going on I am worried about not being able to seek proper medical care. Side note: I have been lying in bed a lot lately while working from home. Could constantly sitting in that position cause the feelings I am describing? I am very worried and not sure what to do. Thanks all You should call your doctor before you do anything else. It is important to speak to a medical professional, as we cannot diagnose you on this subreddit. I spoke to my doctor. He told me to take a multivitamin and monitor my symptoms. That was two days ago. Has not gotten better since Doctor should have safety netted and told you what to do if no improvement - so if that is lacking go back and ask what the plan/working diagnosis is.\n\nGBS diagnosis is not straight forward, there is no definitive test - it relies on history, examination and possibly lumbar puncture - no one on the internet can diagnose it for you....\n\nGood luck!. See an internist or a neurologist. Is there any reason what I am experiencing might not be GBS? Again, I have been lying in bed a lot lately while working remotely. Could that lead to lower circulation in my feet/lower legs? I do not want to go to the neurologist unless absolutely necessary given the COVID situation right now, but I am also scared of waiting too long if this gets worse My doctor is an internist. But he is only doing telemedicine right now Did you have any recent sickness? Not to my knowledge. I did have diarrhea a couple times a few days ago, and my cold feet started that night. But could also be a coincidence There is lots of things it could be - vitamin deficiency is one. I will not list what they all are because you would naturally concentrate on the worst sounding and convince yourself you have that.\n\nMain thing is whether your breathing is affected - that is an emergency so you get urgent help if you are becoming SOB. Also is it progressive - is the weakness/numbness getting significantly worse each day -I would definitely see a neurologist if that was the case GBS usually starts after a sickness. I had the flu when it started. I did not feel \u201csick\u201d either before my symptoms started. I had extreme fatigue and diarrhea for a few days before my feet tingling started. Before that though I noticed when I was shaving that both of the inside of my calves were numb. It is not easy to figure out what is going on, however, once I started falling and not being able to get up, and my hands were starting to weaken is when I finally got diagnosed. If this happens to you, you need to get to a neurologist. Good luck and I hope you do not have it! I have not felt fatigued either, just diarrhea that happened to occur the same day as when my feet got cold I would not say significantly worse. Maybe a little worse every now and then but who knows. I could be overthinking it too. But it is a combination of weakness, numbness and pins and needles, on and off. Usually made worse when I try to exercise, is that a common problem? Only a dr who knows and has examined you can answer that \ud83d\ude42 go to ER, unless the pins/needles disappear all together Sounds exactly like my early symptoms! I was a regular at the gym, 5 times a week, and after waking up around two years ago my calves were in pain as if i killed them during the exercise, which i didnt.\n\nCouple of days later i could hardly walk.\n\nIf you cant walk on your toes or heels go see a neurologist and insist they do a spinal tap and emng! \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. Also keep an eye on your hand grip. If it gets weeker than its 100% GBS. I just read all your posts, my gbs trigger too was raw fish / diarrhea, around a week before the sore calves. Just know that everyone has different symptoms and that is why it is so hard to diagnose this. Some people get symptoms and deteriorate quickly, for me it was almost two weeks of symptoms before it got so bad that I could not take care of myself anymore. Like said before no one can diagnose you but monitor your symptoms and try to stay away from alcohol, as that can also cause issues with nerves. Thanks everyone for chiming in!  I have been thinking a lot about this and put together a timeline of when my symptoms started and how they have progressed since then.  Keep in mind that I had no visible illness or issues in the days/weeks prior to onset.  Overall my symptoms persist but have not gotten substantially better or worse.  My coordination and breathing remain normal.  I could go for a run if I really wanted to, but the sensations that come with exercising would make it uncomfortable.  Hopefully the info below paints a better picture.\n\n**Fri, 4/3:** 5k run on treadmill, felt fine afterwards\n\n**Sat, 4/4:** calves got very tight/sore during a 3.5-mile outdoor run. Chalked it up to soreness from yesterday\u2019s run and not stretching enough\n\n**Sun, 4/5:** went for a walk, calves still felt tight. Also had diarrhea twice that day but I have a sensitive stomach, and this happens to me on occasion with no other consequences. That night, my feet started to get cold and sweaty.\n\n**Mon, 4/6:** called doctor (internist) in the morning and described my symptoms. He told me to start taking a multivitamin and check back with him later in the week if symptoms did not improve (to rule or rule out vitamin deficiency). Went for a 4.5-mile outdoor run during which my right foot went numb a little more than half of the way through. Lower calves felt tight afterwards. At night, cold and sweaty feet returned.\n\n**Tues, 4/7:** intermittent pins and needles in feet all day. Better when sitting up vs. lying down but upon trying to exercise (shooting hoops in driveway), prickliness/numbness in both feet came back. Feet and lower calves occasionally feel number than usual but still sensitive to touch. Cold and sweaty feet at night once again.\n\n**Wed, 4/8:** similar symptoms to the previous day. Pins and needles/tingly feet were on and off during the day and intermittent tightness in lower calves made worse when shooting hoops. Cold and sweaty feet at night.\n\n**Thurs, 4/9:** woke up with feet still cold and sweaty along with very cold hands and body in general, especially in my arms.  Was very cold in the house so might have something to do with that, but concerning nonetheless.  Hands feel a little heavy and strange but sensitivity is still there. Some prickliness in feet but sensitivity remains.  Pain in left shoulder but I have rotator cuff issues so might have just slept on it funny.  Calling my doctor this afternoon. Since you started to experience this after running 5k, please also take into consideration Myasthenia Gravis  \nEither way, only a Doctor can diagnose you Any updates? Symptoms have been more or less the same over the last few days, not better or worse. I spoke to a neurologist over the phone today. She thinks that it is small fiber neuropathy caused by some kind of virus. Which is absolutely bizarre because I have been social distancing for the last month and have only left my house to go run (my parents leave once/twice a week for groceries and whatnot, but they wear masks and gloves and no one else in my home has shown any symptoms). The last time I was noticeably sick was in early February with flu-like symptoms for a couple days, though I tested negative for flu and strep. I have also noticed recently that my legs get heavy and tingly when exercising. Neurologist said to take it easy. Nonetheless I am scared that this could be the early stages of something worse, but that could be my anxiety talking Can you walk on toes/heels? How is  your hand grip strength? Shoulder/scapula pain stronger during nights? Everything you listed above is normal, albeit with some pain from the cold feet when walking. The cold feet are the primary driver here, it is causing other problems in my feet and legs, particularly when I exercise (pins and needles, heaviness/tightness, etc) I had some left shoulder pain two nights ago, but I already have major issues in both shoulders from sports injuries. No shoulder pain last night Classic GBS onset typically you feel persistent numbness aka pins/needles\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyour symptoms seem related to blood circulation, i would consult a doc to see what is up Hey any updates?", "Electrical stimulation for GBS Hello, all. Has anyone heard of electrical stimulation being used for strengthening muscles in GBS patients? \n\nI know TENS is used for pain relief, but I cannot find much about stuff for muscle strength. My recovery physiotherapy certainly included electro-stimulation, especially in the early stages when I was not able to even do many body weight exercises.  This was decades ago, and you got me curious about whether it is still used.  I did not find anything about GBS in particular, but it looks like in benefits muscle recovery in general.   I also could only find information for TENS in regards to pain relief.  I found an interesting document about physical therapy on the GBS/CIDP Foundation website. It mentions TENS (page 14 on mobile, or page 12 if your looking at the number on the bottom of the page), but only as a pain relief tool to use along side an exercise routine. But, it also had some good ideas and things to remember when doing exercises. (\n\nAlso ( shows some tips for exercising at home. I had some limited electrical-stimulation early in my recovery. It did not do much for me except tell me something about where my nerves were connected and where they were not. But maybe it was too early and/or yo infrequent in my case?", "Should I absolutely avoid Prednisone if my case allows it? Hi, guys. I believe I have a very mild case of CIDP, nothing major but tremors and twitches. My doc then suggested me to take Prednisone for a couple months to see if I improve. I am here because I do not know if I should accept being treated with Pred in my case. The side-effects, short and long term, are really nasty and I have read countless times that it should be taken only in very emergencial situations, which is not really me, yet. Since I cannot just wait for my disease to create more damage, I was thinking that I should get treated but only with IVig. What do you think? IVig is pretty difficult to get for me and I am not entirely sure I am always going to have it when I should have it, but considering my particular case and alternative treatment, I really feel it is only thing I can take. Did you post on here recently? You cannot have \"mild CIDP\" I know, I have got it. It will get worse unless treated. It will be a insidious and slow descent, but it will happen.\n\nYour options are as follows:\n\n1. Prednisolone. Generally this works. And it is super cheap. If you cannot get to a low enough dose it will be followed a steroid sparing agent. Methotrexate etc, which comes with its own list of shit.\n\n2. IVIG - effective, expensive, every 2-3 weeks having a day in hospital.\n\n3. Plasmapheresis. Borderline last resort. Also work. Involves more hospital time.\n\nWhy are you so against Prednisolone? Yes, it is not good for you. You know what is else is not good for you, dithering for a age over treatment, to realise more damage is done and you will have to be on drugs even longer. Sorry, I did not understand your response much. CIDP can definitely be mild, I may be a  example of this and so are others (have talked to them). I do not know what you meant by saying it eventually burns out. Not all CIDP cases are remissive as far as I know. Lastly, would you mind to inform me on this great danger of IVig you warned me about? CIDP can go into remission for some people, but there is no time frame for that and its not guaranteed either. I am almost on year 20. CIDP manifests many different ways, everyone should know that because it is unfair to yourself and everyone else to assume your disease is just like someone else's. \n\nIVIG is an incredibly safe medication. It can have nasty side effects right after infusion, like migraine and nausea, but it does not hurt the body like steroids do. In the medical field we consider steroids a \"save you today to kill you tomorrow\" drug. That does not mean it is not beneficial to many people though! And when used short term the side effects can be minimal. It is very reasonable that OP is worried about going down that path because the side effects are so serious.\n\nIVIG is a \"clean\" way of treating CIDP for people that it works for. You are right, it is expensive and time consuming, but it does not do long term damage. \n\nOP is exploring his options and doing research before agreeing to what his doctor suggests and I love that. I think we should be encouraging everyone on this sub to do that! I think you should try to get a second opinion at the very least. \n\nEvery case of CIDP is so unique that it is hard to have any real information for you. I think you have got to come up with a plan with a neurologist that is familiar with CIDP after they look into your case very seriously and get to know how the disease manifests itself in you. You said you are not sure it is CIDP, well that is step one honestly. You need more tests and your doctor should be initiating that.\n\nIf you do not want steroids then tell them why. But also know everything that goes into getting IVIG. Doctors will listen to patients that come in informed. But still try to keep the discussion open, ask is there a reason they think your case would be best treated with steroids? \n\nNot every case of CIDP gets worse. Some people can take steroids for a few months and see a full recovery. Some people see a steady decline and need a permanent solution. Some people are remitting relapsing and need occassional treatments throughout their life. There are a lot of variables here that you are going to figure out over the next few years that really affects how you treat the disease. \n\nI hope it works out for you Hi, meep! Thanks for the support and understanding. Do you work in the medical field? You using the plural pronoun in \"we in the medical field\" makes me think you do. I am not but I truly have heard so many bad stories that I am quite honestly terrified. \n\nOn the top of my head I think of a woman who was on 5mg Pred for 6y and lost all her teeth to decay and a guy who in a high regimen like the one suggested to me for relatively short time developed diabetes. \n\nThese are just two stories and they are unfortunately common, embodying that phrase you just gave, \"a save you today to kill you tomorrow\". \n\nSo, do you advise me to keep persisting on Ivig and resort to steroids only when absolutely necessary? That is going to take some convincing for the doctor but I am sure that if I know the risks steroids can bring, he surely does too. I always try to show myself open to everything in medical appointments but all doctors I have seen are too egoistic and smart-ass to realize that and as soon as I open my mouth start saying I am being biased when analyzing evidence, that all I bring is to support my own hopes instead of reality and all that crap. \n\nThanks for the help, I I will keep trying to get better diagnoses and treatment :) Sorry I just realized I never responded to you! \n\nI am a nurse, but not in neurology, so I am not medically qualified to be giving too much advice on this issue.\n\nBut let me address your questions as best as I can!\n\nI would not be terrified of steroids, especially short term as your doctor suggested. But I would be weary, as in go in eyes wide open, research side effects and do not be afraid to nag your doctor if you feel like something is wrong. Remember, there are way more good outcomes you are not hearing about for every bad outcome you do hear.\n\nI cannot tell you whether or not to take steroids or go solo with the IVIG because it really depends on so many factors that are unique to your case. Listen to your doctor for sure, but know that you do not have to follow their recommendation. You said it would take some convincing to not take steroids, but you as the patient are ALWAYS allowed to refuse treatment. If you tell your doctor you understand the risks and benefits of steroids and youre choosing to refuse treatment then that should be the end of the discussion. I think not enough people know this. It is then up to the doctor to do his best to treat you without using a treatment you refused. AKA he cannot hold your IVIG prescription hostage. \n\nI am not saying you should refuse steroids, but if that is what you want then just know that option is available to you.\n\nOne of the biggest things to consider is how long you plan to be on steroids. Steroids long term are what really starts to degrade a person in later years. But short term they can be really beneficial with minimal side effects. Consider that your disease is also damaging you every day that the inflammation continues and that also has long term side effects. \n\nLastly I am not going to tell you details about my disease only because I really want to encourage you to get out of the mindset of comparing because of how unique this disease is with each person.\n\nGood luck! I ended up having to do everything\u2014ivig, plasmapheresis, and pred. But I started with IVIG alone, and I think that is pretty standard for most cases. It is possible your doctor think insurance may give you some difficultly about paying\u2014I had to fight to get them to pay. \n\nI ended up being on prednisone long term, and just went off recently after 20 years. But I tried everything else before I gave in and went on prednisone.", "People outside of the US to take part in GBS Research    \nI just got an email from a guy who is research I am participating in saying \"I was hoping that you could help with some global representation for GBS patients.

Recently discovered I did not get the full series when I was a teenager and want to finish it, but (for obvious reasons) am hesitant. Will def talk to my doctor, but any personal/anecdotal experience is helpful to my conscience. ", "Revisiting GBS, mysterious chronic illness. Hello, \n\nI have been dealing with illness since the very end of september. I am hoping I can share a bit of my experience here, as I have recently read quite a bit more on GBS, and now am left wondering if I could have some form of this, or something related. Granted, it would fall into the more minor severity group of disease. \n\nSome of my first symptoms of disease were at end of september, where I started getting migratory joint pain. Different wrists, ankles, knees, etc seemed to have a strange pain and fatigue flare up. Around that time as well I was starting to get some pain and coordination issues with my left hand. Notably, I did not have numbness and tingling. Typing mistakes, dropping things more often, felt like it would behave as if my hands were very cold. Just clumsy and awkward. \n\nPain moved to my left elbow, where doctors promptly diagnosed me with tennis elbow on my non dominant arm even though i was resting for 2 weeks. \n\nEventually the neck pain increased quite a bit, my spine hurt and I started having strange sensations in my head including some burning, twitching facial muscles, and a sensation like someone was quite often flicking my hair above my right eyebrow. I started having some intermittent low grade fevers around here too, but I think this was due to sinusitis. \n\nAbout 2-3 weeks after initial symptom onset, things were at their worst. My whole body had a persistent sensation like I had worked out extremely hard, and felt like my muscles were jelly and very weak. At this point I was having some difficulty walking, although I could still get around fine. My knees would buckle getting out of bed in the morning, and often buckle on stairs, I had to move around really slow. Things seemed especially bad in my quads for a while, they had a very funny strange feeling to them that is hard to place. Like the muscles were not firing correctly or something, very weak. \n\nIve had quite an extensive workup since then, seen by my primary, physiatry (for neck and spine pain), a neurologist, rheumatologist (both of which said consider CFS, more on that later), and a orthopedic doctor who had initially noticed I had joint pain in my wrists. \n\nI got tested for lyme multiple times, did multiple courses of antibiotics during this period (which thankfully got rid of the massive pressure in my head), tested for MG, autoimmune panels, a lot of CBCs, metabolic panels, thyroid, parathyroid, everything always came back normal. Borderline high calcium at times was the only irregularity, but ionized calcium normal. \n\nI also developed what I think may be 'red ear syndrome' a relatively harmless phenomenon where usually my left ear (sometimes both) gets very hot and filled with blood and turns very red. The non contact thermometer reports temps of 103.5-1.04 during these flair ups that last half hour to an hour. I dont have a real fever while they happen. I also once had a chest temperature increase in the same fashion, where my chest around my sternum all of a sudden flushed out and felt very hot, reaching 103.5, going away in about in hour. \n\nThe recovery has been extremely slow for me, I still am experiencing almost daily fatigue, tiredness and weakness. I had a great day yesterday. Today I felt the weakness and fatigue hit hard, along with spine chills (which I get intermittently this whole time). I feel like I am trending in a positive direction, but the intensity of the symptoms vary quite often. There is absolute improvement from the knee buckling and trouble walking week in October. \n\nDoes this sound like anybody's experience with GBS? I think it was ruled out relatively early for me, since I did not have numbness or pins and needles sensation, but then I also had read that may not always be the case. \n\nAs for the note on CFS - from what Ive been able to determine based on discussions with cfs folks the hallmark of their disease seems to be the post exertional malaise. Where I feel ok doing light activities and often feel a little bit better after doing some mild activity. I just do not have stamina like I should for an otherwise healthy 36 year old. \n\nI am looking back at this wall of text. If you got this far, thanks for reading. Ive just been sort of lost and never had an illness like this. I am continuing to see a variety of specialists, their wait times are out of control with this post covid situation. One of my following appointments with a different rheumatologist is not until September.  I can only speak to my own experience, but my GBS came on very suddenly and very intensely.  I had one night of weakness followed by the morning where I literally could not move my legs or arms.  In the beginning they were very weak and jelly like which is similar to what you are describing.  Everyone is experience is different and unique with GBS.  I think it is possible yours could be a mild or atypical version.  Mine they said was atypical but that was only because it did not show on the lumbar puncture (they caught it early enough that it did not show).  I personally think there is not enough literature about GBS to definitely know 100% what is or is not (only 3,000-6,000 cases in the US every year).  I also have epilepsy and I drop things when I have absence seizures.  Have they performed an EEG?  \n\nAnyways, I am so sorry this is happening to you.  The fatigue with recovery and weakness is so relatable.  Especially what you said about having a weighted blanket on your limbs.  I hope you find answers soon. have not had an EEG. luckily the coordination issue in my left hand has improved much since that early onset. its probably 90% now so I do not have much for complaints, I rarely notice it unless i am doing something that requires fine dexterity. Does not sound like GBS to me. Sounds more \"lupus\"y. Are you male or female? Lupus tends to hit women more than men. \n\nIt would be interesting to see if you improved with a short course of steroids. I had a sudden onset and I did not improve until I had plasmapheresis, which I was given when the IVIG did not work. Within 48 hours of the first time the knees buckled, It moved up to my arms; a day later I could not breathe on my own. It does not sound like GBS, but there are many other variations that have a less severe onset, but recurring complications needing treatments later on. I got sick 3 years ago with a worst case scenario (needing to be intubated and paralyzed for 2 months) but have not had any further issues since besides CFS and numb toes. If you have not already, check out GBS-CIDP.org for more info. male. I did a double Medrol taper as part of a sinus treatment. Not a huge difference in symptoms although I did feel mildly better. \n\nMy primary said basically everybody feels good taking medrol so it may not indicate much In the absence of neuropathy this does not sound like it would be likely to be GB. This does however sound very much like textbook Lyme disease. If you have delved into Lyme in any capacity, I am sure you know of the unreliability of generic testing for Lyme. Less than 20% of cases are actually caught. I would pursue testing through IGeneX or a lab of that caliber just to have your bases covered in the even you do actually have Lyme. Also, have you had any recent vaccinations?", "Please help! Covid vaccine gave my mom GBS. Now seeking vaccine efficacy test. Please note: I am in no way an antivaxxer. I have been vaccinated, I encourage others to do the same, and I believe in science. With that disclaimer out of the way, my mom got her first dose of the covid vaccine back in February and about a week later developed what they believe is GBS. She is in a lot of pain, very at risk, no one can give her answers, she is not allowed to get the 2nd vaccine, and they cannot be sure of the efficacy of the first vaccine due to the treatments she received in the hospital. I am seeking info on any studies/trials that are quantifying vaccine efficacy. So far all her antibodies tests have come back negative. I read some stuff on T cells and the UK's t-spot discovery kit. We are in the US. If anyone has any leads, I would be eternally grateful. Hi and welcome to the subreddit! First, I am so sorry about your mother. As someone who has GBS, I know how terrifying this can be, especially during the pandemic. Know there is a way forward. \n\nThe only study I have heard about is one regarding Pfizer. Apparently, the first dose has an efficacy up to 85%. The study is located ( \n\nYou are in the US, so your mom will be able to get good care. Feel free to continue asking questions as we are all here to help. \n\nBest of luck to you and your mom and I hope she has a swift recovery. Thank you for the kind reply. Your link is not working for some reason:/ I do know that there are studies on how effective the vaccine is typically, however, with the infusions (??) my mother received in the hospital, and the nature of GBS, they are not sure if her vaccine dose ended up being effective at all. Sorry if I can not speak on these subjects in an informed manner! No worries!  Let me see if posting a different source works better. This one is an article from the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: \n\nYeah if your mom is already going through IVIG, there is a good chance the vaccine may not work for her. The reason being is IVIG can kind of be thought as a \u201creset button\u201d on her immune system There is not a solid medical opinion on if the yearly flu vaccine should be administered to GBS patients, and that is a much better understood vaccine.   There just is not going to be a good data anytime soon.  With that being my opinion, I think finding a doctor that works well for her and getting information about options and risk is better spent effort.  From the data your shared it would seem quite likely she becomes part of the community that is relying on everyone else getting vaccinated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince you are saying no 2nd dose, I am going to assume she did not get the J&amp;J?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will also add, this stuff was not fun for me or my family 10 years, and there was not pandemic in effect.  I am sorry for you mother, and everyone who cares for her.  Good luck and be strong. Thank you for the reply. I should clarify, I am not looking for info on whether she can/should get her second dose. General consensus seems to be no on that, certainly at least while she is still symptomatic. We are just trying to figure out if she is protected at all against covid, from her first vaccine. She had Pfizer. Honestly we just have some small (size-wise) but important family moments coming up that we are hoping she will be able to safely partake in. Not a medical person at all, but like others in this subreddit, GBS left me some desire to try and understand a bit of this fun...\n\nSo my treatment was IVIG and as referenced in another post the basic idea was your antibodies are confused. If we flood your body with antibodies from other healthy people it stops attacking itself. This means when the Pfizer vaccine should have had your body making antibodies that know how to attack Covid-19 the IVIG flooding in antibodies likely slowed or halted that.  So rather then try to research data I again suggest finding a doctor who can help discuss the options and risks (by edit - in regards to small social gatherings). \n\nAll that said, I stumbled on this Australia site for instructions about people with ongoing IVIG treatment schedules saying they should get vaccinated between treatments.  This implies to me a belief that IVIG should not block the vaccine outright at least.  \n\nGBS is rare not 100% understood thing. Covid-19 is so new it is not a well understood thing. mRNA vaccines have never really been used at this scale, and are a new thing that is not well understood. Your mother is sitting amongst all of these things at once, there is not going to be a lot of trustworthy data to find out there. Hi, sorry to hear your mother is going through this, but I am sure she appreciates you looking out for her.  I think the best advice would be to act as if your mother has no immunity at all to covid.  It is probably the safest assumption.  IVIG does seem to interfere with vaccines, but I am not sure how much.  The fact that your mother shows no antibodies adds support to this.\n\nThe best you can do is encourage everyone that has contact with your mother to get the vaccine as quickly as possible.\n\nEdit:  this paper deals with the MMR vaccine and IVIG, but we will not see anything published about covid for a while yet.  \n\n2nd edit:  this is again with a different vaccine, but your mother may retain 'some' immunity if her first vaccine was 2 weeks prior to the first dose of IVIG.  Again, I would be very cautious reading too much into this and err on the side of caution.  \n\n3rd edit:  I am not a doctor!  Just a good handle on reading scientific literature :) Oddly my doctor advises I skip the flu vaccine each year, but was on the fence about covid. I ended up getting the vaccine based on the risk of getting gbs again seeming to be higher from a covid infection than the vaccine. Still really scary stuff though My GBS was not related to the flu shot, so I was advised to keep getting them.  That said I have to get them from my doctors office since none of the clinics will provide them for me.\n\nAs for this mRNA vaccine stuff, it is interesting alright.  I would feel better if we did not have this damned if you do not feeling around it. Thank you for sharing this info. We are all just very saddened because we have all been vaccinated but have not been able to have contact with her all the same. I have not been able to give her a hug or sit in her living room or even show her my new house in over a year. We had planned a trip to our beach house for july, just our immediate family (5 people including her and her husband) and now we are thinking we will not be able to do that either. Her father also passed recently and she could not go to the funeral. Just a lot of disappointment and sadness surrounding this whole thing. Yeah, mine was never officially linked to the flu vaccine but my doctor at the time was overly cautious. Going forward I think all my next doctors have just followed that same path. Only had 4 in my life over the years, but none of them were wanting to rock the boat &gt;My GBS was not related to the flu shot.\n\nNeither was mine but I do not get the flu shot anymore since I had GBS. Any time you rev up the immune system, whether from a virus or a vaccine, it is a chance for another GBS episode. We are at higher risk than the general population since we have had it once. I get maybe one case of flu every 10-15 years so the risk-benefit analysis says to me it is not worth it. I would have to get 10-15 flu vaccines to avoid one case of the flu (and that is 10-15 opportunities to get GBS versus only one if I get the flu.) I have heard a neurologist basically say the same thing - get the flu vaccine if you are the type to get the flu. Otherwise, it is not unreasonable for someone who has had GBS to skip it. I am in my 40\u2019s, healthy and do not work with the elderly but your situation may be different. Incidentally I had the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine as that is a different risk-benefit calculation. With COVID you have to worry about not only getting GBS from an infection but also the long term consequences of COVID itself if you get it (lung/heart damage for example.) This does not address the IVIG impact, but here is a study for basic Pfizer effectiveness, which includes some single dose data: (", "Has anyone who got GBS from a vaccine ever been compensated for their damages?  First rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club? I felt like destroying something beautiful No, it took too long to get an accurate diagnosis. Vaccine manufacturers have a \"no fault\" clause, so, unlikely. Most G20 countries have a vaccine damages payment system. Canada has not rolled it out yet. I was interested in other peoples experience in their countries Interesting. I just listened to a quick 5 minute podcast about it where they talked about vaccine injury, but not GBS specifically It was not recognized till 2017 in the US but the avg pay out was 200 k. That would help with rehab By the time I learned about the VICP, I was already beyond the three year window statute of limitations. I do know of a woman who received 500k from the program for flu shot related damage. She is permanently paralyzed, and young. She had a sharp attorney who knew how to navigate the program. \n\nFWIW, in the US, all covax vaccine products are currently not in the VICP. If you get injured by a covid vaccine in the US, you are largely on your own. Those vaccines are in the CCIP which rarely pays out, and of course, manufacturers enjoy immunity provided by US law.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the government ever moves covax into VICP. Nothing prevents them from doing that at any time, so you be the judge about what that says.\n\nUpdate: OSHA also announced it will not enforce the regulation that would require employers to record vaccine reactions as \"recordable injuries\" until May 2022. In short, if your employer requires a vaccine, and you are injured by it, it is not considered a workplace injury. I am hopeful that I am Canada that sense the program is being brought online specifically for COVID that it would cover the COVID vaccines but one never knows... it is the government. My hospital stay was $45k lol I received compensation from the NVICP. Did you wait for a period of time to file? Was the process difficult? I was diagnosed in October 2014, started the process November 2014 and was compensated around January 2017. I had easy time and an excellent attorney. In the UK you can claim \u00a3100,000 for permanent disability caused by a vaccine - you have to be 60% disabled I believe. Unfortunately for my family member, her GBS (now CIDP) cannot be proven to be a lifelong disability as they may recover enough to walk and live independently, so no payout.", "My In Home Physical and Occupational Therapy Exercise Routine  Love this!!!", "My dad was diagnosed with Gillian barre apparently it is the worst form just prey he lives the dr said it is 50/50  Once you have a diagnosis they can start treatment.

We have a relative who is 71 &amp; has said there were GBS symptoms in 2018 after vaccination ( flu vaccine?). The individual believes that the GBS was a \"mild case\". The individual's high risk for COVID19 is greatlyworrying us  I did not get my GBS from a vaccine but my neurologist had me get Moderna (or Pfizer) because it was specifically developed differently than the flu vaccine. The warned me to definitely avoid the Johnson &amp; Johnson because it was developed similarly to the traditional flu vaccine. Moderna did knock me down with exhaustion and fatigue for about two-three weeks but for me, the risks that getting Covid poses, outweighed the risk the vaccine posed. \nIn case it makes a difference, I do live in a more populated area and though I do not go out and have much exposure to people, the risk of exposure was still higher than if I lived in more farmland/rural area so that helped contribute to my decision. \nWe also considered that with the vaccine, I had all my doctors informed and ready to go if I showed signs of a relapse. When I first got GBS, I was fully paralyzed and on a respirator and even though I knew I could possibly end up back to that, it was worth the risk that Covid posed. Three of my family members got it and once they had stopped being contagious I helped care for two of them in their recovery. Being that close to it and seeing the lasting damage they suffered made it worth the risk to me. Your relative should speak to a neurologist about their concerns.\n\nIt is a totally legitimate hesitation, I do not think personally they are being anything but reasonable for hesitating. However, a medical professional is going to be the best for giving advice or guidance on whether or not they should get the vaccine.\n\nI spoke with my neurologist and she flat out said to get the vaccine, because having COVID is worse than getting GBS again (and I was on a ventilator for my first 3 days hospitalized with GBS).\n\nFor what it is worth, I also was pregnant when I got my COVID vaccine, and my OB strongly recommended I get the vaccine also. I got Moderna, but was told that Pfizer would have been ok to get also. Both my neuro and my OB told me not to get the J&amp;J. \n\nBut any questions or hesitations, definitely consult with a doctor. I do want to mention that after my vaccine, the same day, I did have a couple very short lived (under 1 hour) neurological side effects that came and passed quickly. My left leg went numb for 5 minutes and my right leg turned red and hot with neuropathy for about 15 minutes. I also had the metallic taste that lingered for a few days which sounds like it happens to people with strong immune responses. Everything went back to normal. I reported it to my doctors and like myself, the agreed I should get the second dose. I had no neurological responses with the second shot and I also bounced back faster and mainly just had a fever for a few hours. \nAnother consideration when weighing things, I was hit by GBS in 2009. So I am a few more years out than your father but I also have residual nerve damage that I still deal with. \nGBS is such a beast, I just wanted you to have those extra details. I got my first ever symptoms of GBS three days following my first Pfizer shot in March. The neurologists were not willing to speculate the shot contributed to my onset, but they reported my case to the CDC. I did not get my second shot as a result of this ordeal which from which I am still suffering. bWalsh312 I hope you feel better soon This advice to seek consultation with the neurologist and not just with the primary care doctor-will be passed along to our relative. Thanks. I hope you feel better soon. Sundersylph thank you very much for sharing your valuable experience. I am sorry for what you have been through. Your input will be shared. We have sent unsolicited advice to the individual that the neurologist should be giving guidance about the covid19 vaccine and should be made aware of the date of the upcoming covid19 vaccine in case there is a setback. We sense that this person will never get vaccinated due to anxiety. (..And may not have truly been diagnosed with GBS by a neurologist). We shall see how this unfolds. Thanks to all of you and I sincerely hope you are on the mend soon. Today the relative admitted during a telephone conversation that no doctor has given a diagnosis of GBS. We had strongly urged that the individual get guidance on the COVID19 vaccination issues only after consulting the neurologist-- and only then did we discover that no neurologist has been involved. Because of your comments we were able to get to a kernel of truth. Thank you. It gets better with patience and time, but no denying, it sucks.  I developed it after a minor surgery and IV antibiotics that has been suggestively linked to GBS (had to do my own research).  I could not and cannot get a doctor to even speculate what could have caused it, it is so disappointing and at times infuriating. Definitely talk to their doctor about this specific case. COVID can also cause GBS, so the vaccine risk (if any) may still be worth it. I got GBS after the flu shot 15 years ago. First time ever getting a flu shot! I do not care if these vaccines were developed without an active virus. Just not going to risk it. I have severe nerve damage and a crappy immune system already. These news articles are making think I made the right call. I am sorry about your GBS. GBS is extremely serious. We have friends who have family members who had GBS. We have visited GBS patients in medical rehab. Our relative ( an extended family member) never was diagnosed with GBS by any MD . Claims of past paralysis and presumed GBS were made only recently when the decision about whether to get covid19 vaccine was at issue. This person admitted did not see a doctor about said GBS paralysis after other vaccines to get any treatment. This individual has a history of having stress when traveling and stress about more situations. It sounds like a tough situation. Hang tough. I know someone who is a senior that recently got GBS from the flu shot. They are now paralyzed from it. Very sad and very difficult to be around them as it is sad. One day they were walking and the next they turned into what feels like a vegetable, a baby whos diaper I help change.\n\nThe rona vaxxx does not protect you from catching or spreading it. So some of the adverse effects like blood clots, stroke, seizures, bells palsy, heart attack, GPS, myocarditis and death to name a few are not worth the risk. Unless you live in fear and want to take it to psychologically trick yourself into thinking it is protecting you.\n\nI know a lot of people who took the shot who now have rona. They are confused as to how they got it as I tried to tell them it doesnt do what they are saying it does but they are quick to do what they have been brainwashed to do, call that person antiiii vaxxxxxer or conspiracy theorist. When the very people who created this event came up with those terms to create division. \n\nI also know one person in particular who was in and out of the ER after taking the 2nd shot.  Being this is one massive human experiment they dont know what is going on as this is all new. Another friends nose was bleeding like a faucet while he was driving. The same thing happened to some of the animals in the trials that died. They developed auto immune disease and bled out from certain organs.  Have people asked themselves why so many front-line Dr's &amp; nurses dont want to take it? Its due to them seeing all the damage it is doing on a daily basis. They wont tell you that on the fake newss.\n\nBest thing one can do is to try to live the healthest lifestyle they can. Zinc, Vit D &amp; C, walk out side, eat healthy, dont live in fear. Fear is the #1 driving force in this entire narrative. Fear fogs the brain which prevents one from critical thinking as the mind uses so much energy focusing on the thing they are scared of. It comprises your immune system. It makes you more prone to comply as they trick you into thinking  their solution (the shot in this case) will save you from the thing you are scared of when they are the ones who created it to begin with.\n\nIt is all a war on  your consciousness.

It thankfully did not travel up and to my midsection or lungs or anything. Mostly affected legs and hands. However, lately I have been extremely anxious it is coming back.\n\nI had lingering nerve pain in my feet and hands a long time after I got better, but it seemed like it had stopped. Then suddenly about 3 weeks ago my feet started hurting and being numb again. And now I have some symptoms in my hands. Random pains on tingling in my finger tips. Like I said it is been about 3 weeks since this started again, so idk if that means anything.\n\nFor the last week I had something.. I do not know what. But, the right side of my chest hurt/had discomfort similar to when you are coughing really hard and I had some phlegm coming up. Those were the only symptoms. They were kind of off and on but mostly on. During random times it started to feel like my throat was \u201cclosing\u201d or being \u201cblocked\u201d and that would last a few minutes then go away. The throat thing, and nerve feelings are still happening. I also have some random off and on tingling that I can feel in my knees or lower thighs (at this exact moment). It all ways ends up going away but I am terrified constantly.\n\nI went to the hospital yesterday due to constant panic attacks I have been having and I was fine (they did not test for GBS though). But, chest X-ray and blood tests were good.\n\nI have a Doctor\u2019s appointment Wednesday but that is nearly a week from now and I am just extremely scared it is coming back.\n\nI definitely do have anxiety disorder and it is being made pretty shitty because I am scared it is coming back.. idk if all this is my anxiety or if it is actually coming back. And I feel like I am annoying everyone so it makes me not want to say anything anymore. A lot better to ask and get tested than to not and it get significantly worse. \n\nHave you had a spinal tap previously? You may need to get one.

Idk how common that is in GBS. My most recent illness was not bad at all, but it was still there.\n\nI am terrified of being fully paralyzed or being unable to breathe. I thank God that did not happen the first time. I do have pretty shitty anxiety but it is only been bad lately as I have been scared of getting sick this year.\n\nI guess the thing that really had me on edge was the sudden \u201creturn\u201d of the nerve pain/numbness and cause I was recently sick.

Any insight is appreciated Ask her doctor about plasmapheresis. It helps folks who do not respond well, or as well, to IVIG. I am sorry your mom is going through this. \n\nI had a trachy but did not have any mucus except for saliva. The trachy should be preventing any saliva or mucus from entering the airways, until she is able to manage it herself.  As long as the mucus is from above her trachy and not out of the main breathing hole, she should be ok (obligatory, I am not a doctor. Talk to her doctors, especially one specialising in respiratory functions. This is just based on my experience as a patient). \n\nGetting the trachy out was an arduous process for me. After weaning, I had to prove to multiple professionals that I was not at risk of aspirating (having anything fluids that is not air enter the lungs), by consistently not having any fluids build up above the trachy. Probably took 7-8 weeks to get the trachy out after weaning off the ventilator, and another 2 weeks for them to allow me to drink water and eat solids again. \n\nI am sorry to say, she sounds like she is in for a long stay.  :(\n\nFeel free to PM if you have any questions.

", "Reading/Studying Through Pain Tips (CIDP) Reading is hard enough. But studying is harder because I keep losing the thought I am holding in my head when I am trying to repeat what I just read.  It is hard. I kept a pencil and developed a system where I would write key words as I went along. The words would reflect when you are thinking. At first there were a lot of words but it gets better. So will you get better at concentrating. Hopefully the pain will lessen. How long since your diagnosis? I will try something like that.\n\nIt is been a month since my diagnosis. I went 4.5 months without a diagnosis, and will start Ivig treatment next week, hopefully.\n\nI have some uncommon symptoms too such as: constant nausea, burning scapular/back pain, upper right abdomen pain, and this feeling I am just going to fall over at any moment even when I am sitting besides the typical bone and muscle aches of neuropathy.  It is rough. Hopefully your IVIG will help. Massive B12 shots (3 ml/day) help me with all symptoms. ", "Has anyone had GBS relapse after tetanus shot? It is looking like I will need a tetanus shot after cutting my toe on some dirty metal, and wanted some advice if the shot can cause relapse?\n\nI had GBS (miller fisher variant) back in 2013 and read conflicting info on the safety of vaccines (tetanus in particular) for people with previous GBS.\n\nI had the Pfizer shots with no problems. \n\nHas anyone got any advice?", "From Diagnosis to Recovery It is been about a year since I posted anything here, but I wanted to share my story.\n\nI came down with my first symptoms of GBS May 8th, 2015. I had had a persistent cough that later matured to a sore throat and dual ear infection. I treated it with antibiotics and observed that my taste had gone away, though at the time I assumed it was Omnicef - the antibiotic prescribed. The morning of the 8th I woke up with legs extremely sore as well as a sore back. It felt as if I had tried to move a couch the day before, but I had not done anything out of the ordinary. That day I also noticed it was significantly harder to get out of my chair at work, get into the shower (stepping over the border of the tub to get into the tub / shower combo), and I observed an instance or two where my fingers did not go exactly where I told them to.\n\nOver the next week, I noticed that walking was a lot harder, my strides were much smaller, my legs and back were sore or painful, standing from a seated position was very difficult, and I continued to have no sense of taste - except for chocolate. Eating was very difficult as everything tasted like numb tongue.\n\nI fell Monday the 11th and had to wait until that Thursday to get to see a doctor. I knew something was wrong, but was not sure if I was coming down with diabetes, if it was some form of potassium deficiency, or what. My feet were numb and tingly and it seemed to be progressing slowly upward. I also observed some numbness in my fingertips.\n\nThat Thursday, the general practitioner I met with ruled out neurological symptoms and suggested that it could be blood clots in my legs. He also ran a blood test which I was hopeful would find something concrete as I disagreed that it was a blood clot issue. Honestly, it was very deflating as I was consumed that week with fear and hope of getting answers.\n\nThe next morning I was getting ready for work. At this time I had to resort to dressing laying down on the bed due to difficulty lifting my legs. I went downstairs and sat down to put on my shoes. When I got up out of the recliner, my knee buckled and I fell to the ground. I got up a little bit later, got back into the chair and tried again, only to fall again. At this point I called off of work, notified my wife, and asked my parents to come over and make sure I was safe. I was hopeful the ultrasound the doc had ordered on my legs would be carried out that day.\n\nMy wife came home and drove me to the ER, where the attentive nurse practitioner quickly observed that my mouth was not moving properly and that I could not smile. They ran a CT scan to assess that I had not incurred a stroke and then transferred me to the local hospital that featured a very good neuro unit. The nurse practitioner was convinced she was looking at GBS.\n\nAt the hospital they ran a lumbar puncture (spinal tap), MRI, and eventually an EMG. The lumbar puncture was very intimidating, but absolutely painless and without complication. The EMG was tough, but ativan helped. The diagnosis indicated that I did indeed have GBS.\n\nWe began treating me with IVIG and monitoring my breathing with a mind to put me on a respirator if it degraded. All the while, the numbness crept up my legs, down from my fingertips, and down from the tip of my tongue.\n\nI was not able to eat much, walk, or bathe. I could still move, though my legs did not lift very much and it was incredibly hard and exhausting to even sit up in bed.\n\nThe IVIG helped and infused fresh strength into my legs. After treatment completed, I moved to an inpatient rehab facility in town that worked frequently with neuro cases. This place was amazing and my therapists were fantastic. They set me up with a wheelchair and I could wheel myself around easily, despite the numbness and imprecision of my hands.\n\nI worked hard in therapy, doing anything I was asked. My goals were to stand for short periods of time, walking with a walker (or on the parallel bars) and being able to handle stairs. I worked on endurance on the hand bikes and hand/foot exercise bikes.\n\nThings were looking very good for me and I was even allowed to transfer to the toilet on my own at the end of my rehab stay, 5 days before I was to be discharged, I noticed that I could no longer smile and my range of facial expressions was way down. I alerted the nurse and talked with a doc or nurse practitioner the next day (a Sunday). The next morning I was given another CT and sent back to the hospital for treatment as they believed that the GBS was reasserting itself.\n\nThat stay they put a port in my artery in my neck and  performed plasmapherisis (plasma exchange) every other day for 11 days. It absolutely drained me and took the life out of me. I could not do much at all and the strength and skill I had rebuilt in inpatient rehab degenerated rapidly in that hospital. It was a dark and tough time, but eventually I was released back to inpatient rehab.\n\nThe second inpatient stay was okay, though I was not as strong as my first stay and I was not in as good of shape by the time I left. After a few weeks I was released back to home and returned to my faithful and loving wife after a 45 day total stay composed of 4 different hospital / rehab stints.\n\nWalking around home was hard with a walker and I fell somewhat frequently (often my strength gave out on the stairs as I had to rely on my hands to pull me up for the most part at first).\n\nOutpatient rehab took some adjusting as the first day they challenged me to go even when I was exhausted and felt unsafe to go on. I fell and that really hindered that relationship as good trust with a therapist is important.\n\nPain and hypersensitivity were an issue. My feet were extremely painful and were swollen by the time I left the hospital. Compression stockings and knee braces helped a little, as did velcro shoes that I could fasten myself (though I had to tape on some tape to make the velcro straps accessible).\n\nMy wife and I would go out to the movie theater to give me an excuse to walk a decent amount of distance. I would need to rest on my walker periodically, but would eventually make it in. We would find many similar excuses to get out and get exercise every day in order to work on my strength and endurance.\n\nOutpatient therapy worked on my technique, posture, and balance. They also fitted me for AFO devices that supported my feet and combatted my \"foot drop\", helping me walk without tripping the feet on the floor. I kept pushing things trying to move from a walker to a cane and eventually I succeeded with a cane with a triangular tip (good for applying pressure from any direction) and discovered that I could use a cane in some circumstances. \n\nAs time went on, the circumstances grew and I was able to move entirely to a cane by late August or early September. That meant a huge quality of life increase for me as it let me go to places I could not otherwise reach and carry things with me in my off hand.\n\nI began working remotely part time for my employer (I am a software developer) and tried to increase the number of hours in a day or number of days in a week every week based on what I was seeing.\n\nBy the end of September I discontinued occupational therapy and took up assembling legos instead as very good dexterity work. My facial weakness had resolved itself by early August and I never did any outpatient speech therapy.\n\nBy November I was walking to some extent without a cane in some circumstances with my therapist. It was difficult and awkward, but I had accomplished the goal of being able to walk in safe circumstances and short distances unassisted. We discontinued my therapy as my technique had arrived but things would continue to improve as my nerves healed and strength returned.\n\nNovember also saw a large increase in the pain as my feet healed more. I was at my highest pain levels from November to January and it required constant elevation of the feet in the evening, icing them to help silence the pain and both continuous release and acute pain medication.\n\nBy mid-January I returned to work full time on site and ended long-term disability. My wife would drive me to work and pick me up at the end of the day and this time together was nice.\n\nBy March I was driving again and my wife and I had moved to a new house. During this time I was also tapering down various pain medications. By late March I was on no medication. This was also around the time when I felt truly myself again and uninhibited and without significant handicap.\n\nWe let my handicapped placard expire in late June. My wife and I also began the practice of walking at least half a mile each evening.\n\nAll in all, from initial symptoms to return to normal function, it took me about 10 months. I still have numbness on my feet and mild pain, but if I do not touch my feet much and wear shoes that do not put much side or top pressure on them I am okay (I wear mesh crocks with socks underneath and these work very well).\n\nJust recently, the inpatient rehab hospital asked me on as a volunteer to talk with GBS patients they encounter. I am thankful to be able to share my story, coping mechanisms, be a listening and understanding ear, and help others going through what I have gone through.\n\nI anticipate full healing in my feet and an eventual return of my full endurance, but recognize the importance of investing in that by reasonable exercise and working for the capabilities I want.\n\nIf you are going through GBS, I recommend taking life day by day, relying on God for strength, seeking to bless anyone who you get to interact with, and focusing on the task at hand, whether it is to try to take a step or working with a tech to get dressed for the day. Life was all about meeting the challenge of the hour, whether pain or rehab exercises or self-care. It was about relying on your support system and trying to find new ways of meeting challenges - whether trying a different walker, taping feet that curl up at night otherwise, icing to address pain, or knee braces to address wobbly or hurt knees.\n\nTalk to others too. GBS is weird and the symptoms and side effects can be bizarre. Other people have seen the same strange stuff and can help you through it.", "Neurologist vs. Rheumatologist Has anybody ever needed to see a rheumatologist for their ailment?\n\nI am not having much luck with neurologists and another doctor recommended I see a rheumatologist. Anyone know much about them and how they differ from neurologists? I consult with a a neurologist and a rheumatologist for my conditions but both are different kind of autoimmune conditions. I have Ankylosing Spondylitis and GBS. The first one is a kind of arthritis and that is where rhuemys come into picture. They primarily treat inflammatory diseases related to bones. Neurologist treat different kind of nerve diseases and are not limited to neural autoimmune conditions.\n\nI am not entirely sure why your doctor wants you to consult a neurologist if you have been diagnosed with GBS. A consultation will not hurt but I am not sure if it will be of much use in case of GBS. I have not yet been definitively diagnosed with anything despite seeing four neurologists (probably none of them neuromuscular experts). I am here because there is something neuromuscular going on and there is no other place for me to go on Reddit. AskDocs is no good, it gets thousands of diverse threads and no one has answered me there and there is no focus on neuromuscular there.\n\nBetween GBS and CIDP it would have to be CIDP that I have because the progression of my symptoms has been over a year, not weeks. But it could be some other neuromuscular disease as well.\n\nI originally thought my problems were related to spine surgery I have had, but I no longer believe that. They are too global in nature. A surgeon told me if I am not having luck with neurologists then maybe I should see a rheumatologist. Also a physiatrist. Depends on what your complaint is.\nIf the main complaint is weakness. A neurologist should be able to solve the case.\nIf you have other complaints as well, another specialty might be helpful.\nI honestly do not know why you would need a rheumatologist for the weakness. Do you have joint pain/Back pain that started long before the weakness? There is a discussion going on on other threads about how long it can take for a neurologist to uncover anything. If you have GBS which progresses fast and dramatically they can solve that. They cannot ignore it if someone is fine one day and cannot breathe or walk a few days later.\n\nIf you have something that progresses slowly over months or years like I have, the doctors seem to have a tough time with that. They doi a lot of watching and waiting. There are many things that it could be, a lot of them very rare from what I hear. You need not just any neurologist but one with experience in neuromuscular diseases.\n\nI do not know if a rheumatologist is appropriate but a spine surgeon recommended I see one as well as a neurologist. I think they can diagnose and rule out things like scleroderma. To be more specific I have all kinds of complaints. Gait problems, balance problems, weakness, numbness, tingling, a variety of pains and feelings of rigidity. It started in my lower back and worked its way up and out as opposed to some diseases which seem to start with the extremities or the face. If I may ask, what state/country are you in? My Neuro specializes in gbs and like Neuro disorders. I have only been telemed for a year because of the pandemic, but he is fantastic. Albeit hard to get an appointment. Massachusetts, U.S.", "Weeks 5 and 6. Am I getting better? Do I even have GBS? I do not know what I have. The doctor thinks it might be GBS. But they really do not know. My spinal tap was clear. My blood work (so far) was clear. It is possible I have a pretty mild case of GBS. I have been able to walk for over 4 weeks. I have seen literature that patients who did that also had clear CSF. So maybe GBS? But, the neurologist did an EMG test. No large fiber neuropathies were found. Main motor reflexes were intact. Neurologists suspected small fiber neuropathy (SFN). Not unheard of GBS... but....\n\nThen I looked up SFN. I got scared. There is a lot of stuff that just is not well known. My condition is acute. Whatever it is, it has progressed over days and a few weeks. I am afraid it will not slow down. I have polyneuropathy as well. Sensory. Motor. Autonomic. Mostly sensory. But the whole package is there. It has been slight. But growing, growing, growing.\n\nI received antibiotics for a infection in early February A few days later, tingling in my hands. Then my feet. Slowing drifting upwards. Bilateral ascending peripheral neuropathy. Weakness and worst symptoms in the legs. Nausea and changes in bowel consistency. Weakness seemed to reach its peak at about Week 4. Maybe symptoms had stabilized. Maybe that was wishful thinking? Week 4 was last week.\n\nI felt lucky at first. I had been able to walk throughout. Maybe I was out of the woods. Maybe this was not as deep of a nightmare as I thought it might be. But now I can feel the weakness spreading. In my shoulders and wrists now. The tingling numbness is going basically all the way up my quads. I can feel it all over my back. The tingling in my face, weakness around my jaw has returned. \n\nRight now I am eager to start all the treatments. I told my neurologist so. She is still let us wait and see. But I see things sliding. I feel like I am falling off. It is so hard to wait. This feels like such a hard time. \n\nPeople with GBS stabilize. Right now... I am afraid I will not. Maybe I am freaking out? Maybe I did stabilize. Anxiety makes it so hard to tell sometimes. I guess I am just reaching out right now. Anything anyone can say. Any experience. Any insight. Any words of anything.\n\nThank you. My own experience sounds very similar to your own - you will get better, and each individuals path to recovery is different \n\nMy 'presumed GBS' was brought on by a case of campylobacter and all of my tests were unremarkable.\n\nI am currently 7 months on from initial onset and still suffering with extreme fatigue, occasional weakness, muscle twitching, and occasional nerve pain - it may not feel like it on certain days but I know there is improvement.\n\nYou will know your own body and have to be your own advocate if you feel you need treatment more urgently.\n\nThe biggest battle for myself, forgetting the physical effects, has been around the anxiety of what we all go through when suffering with GBS - it is a tough journey but I am sure you will get better, the fact like myself you were able to walk throughout the acute stage should give you confidence.... it can be significantly worse.\n\nSomething that I have started doind is keep a diary of how I feel in the morning and evening. This way it allowed me to track my recovery but will also give you good factual detail of how you have been from week to week for your neurologist.\n\nHope this helps and wish the best recovery.\n\nP.s something that people suffer with after they stabilise following GBS is 'radiculopathy' which is basically means your nerves are inflamed and can cause symptoms you have described. Sounds exactly like my mother\u2019s symptoms. Her diagnosis of GBS was switched to CIDP after a second hospitalization within the first 3 months of symptoms. Everything you describe is exactly what she experienced. With monthly IVIG, prednisone, and immunosuppressant she has stabilized, after nearly a year. Sounds rough. How is she doing now? I agree, the anxiety is the worst part. If I could just flip that off and just deal with my symptoms on their own, I do not think it would be so bad. Benzos help with that - but sadly not a long-term solution! lol\n\nI really like the idea of a diary though. Every day feels like a head game of figuring out where things are going. Sometimes things feel improved. Then sometimes it feels like nothing has improved and maybe it is slightly worse. I think some of that spins with diet and anxiety levels. Thinking the diary is going to help a lot. Thanks! Thank you. She is much better now that she can predict her symptoms based on how far out from infusions she is, meaning that she knows if she waits too long for IVIG the weakness will come back and she will lose the use of her legs. The tingling and neuropathy are still issues but milder and less frequently. Her neurologist considers \u201cstabilized\u201d when she is able to walk, eat with utensils, etc. She uses a cane or walker most of the time now just for a sense of security. At her worst she had paralysis from waist down, slurred speech, could not write or hold a fork. Hang in there, it is a long road of ups and downs, but it does get better. Thanks for sharing. It makes me feel a lot better. This can be tough stuff. But even if it gets bad, people find a way to keep living and going on. Life goes on. And we push through. Yes! So important, though sounds cliched, to stay upbeat. There will be good and bad days but it is manageable and there are continually advances in treatments. I just read something new from Pfizer for GBS/CIDP, will try to find and post. Have you been tested for Lyme disease? Not sure. They have taken so many blood samples for a bunch of different things. I have not seen all of them yet. But I will ask! Good idea. My csf was also clear after 10 days of symptoms. Because of that  they stopped ivig and sent me to a transitional care home.. But then I had a relapse and went back to the ER, where they did another lumbar puncture which showed 3x the protein levels as before, which was 10 days prior. \nThe progression was weird for me, and I assume it is never the same from person to person. Maybe repeat tests need to be performed. \nI always suggest this to people who have symptoms of GBS:\nGo to the ER. It might not seem necessary, but go. The only way to stop the progression is at the hospital. \nBest of luck Really interesting! What happened after your second test? How are you feeling now? Hope you are well. I 2nd LP, which was 10 days later, showed high protein levels. More than twice the amount of the first one. The EMG (done earlier that day) showed significant latency. My deep reflexes were diminished the first time I went in, but completely absent when I went in for the EMG.\nSo, at that point, I had been having symptoms for 20 days. I am so glad they retested, because I think I was relapsing. I was admitted for another 5-day round of ivig. I got back to the transitional care home a few nights ago and I have been kicking ass in PT. 3 standard sized stairs today! 13 minutes standing and reaching. Doing everything on my own (I do not need to ask for help pulling my pjs up after the bathroom!). I am starting to think I might get to go home in a few weeks, rather than months That is awesome, man. Keep going! That is inspirational! (I am a lady, but I will take it! Lol)", "My experience with MFS Hello, just wanted to share my current experience with Miller Fisher syndrome in hope that it could be encouraging to someone else.\nI am a 32 year old male. I was in good health before all of this started. On Monday, June 10, I started to notice some problems with my vision. It is hard to explain, but basically my eyes were not focusing properly and I had to concentrate really hard anytime I changed the depth of my field of vision. I still went to work, drove, etc. and figured it would pass with a night of sleep. The next morning I started feeling very dizzy and was unstable while walking (which I attributed to the dizziness). I took the day off of work and went to my primary care physician. He diagnosed me with a sinus infection and prescribed an antibiotic.\nThe next morning (Wednesday) when I woke up my vision had digressed significantly. I could not focus on anything. My head was spinning and I was seeing double. My face, lips, mouth, hands, and feet were numb. I could barely stand up my legs were so weak. I went to the emergency room and they rushed me in thinking that I was having a stroke. A CT scan confirmed there was no stroke and they were about to send me home (the ER doc said the dizziness was due to the sinus infection and the numbness was my sympathetic nervous system going out of control). Thankfully a neurologist intervened and admitted me to the hospital for further testing.\nOver the next 48-72 hours I went through several tests: MRI, Spinal fluid sample, and an EMG. They began to suspect that I had GBS so on Thursday night they transferred me to a larger hospital in the area. On Friday, the neurologist returned and said that based on the preliminary test results plus my symptoms they were going to diagnose me with Miller Fisher variant of GBS. During this time my symptoms had continued to progress. I also began to develop a problem with my speech because my soft palette was not closing properly so when I spoke most of the air was escaping out my nose (this also happened with liquids when I drank). I needed a walker and a standby nurse anytime I got up and when I did all I could do was take a few steps to the bathroom and back to the bed.\nOnce I got the diagnosis, they began IVIG treatments that evening. I had five treatments in total. Once the treatments began I started to notice steady improvements. I began working with physical, occupational, and speech therapy in my room. I started being able to take short walks around the halls with a walker. My speech started to improve gradually. After my fourth treatment  (Tuesday, June 18) they transferred me down to inpatient rehab so I could get started the next day while I did my fifth and final treatment. After I finished the fifth treatment on Wednesday (June 19) I started feeling great. The next morning (Thursday) physical therapy cleared me to be independent on the hall (I could walk around on my own without a nurse which was huge!). I was still slow walking and did not feel normal, but I was significantly better. On Friday, they discharged me to go home. My only restriction was no driving and I was going to do outpatient therapy. I had a follow up appointment for August 15th with the neurologist, but it seemed like it would mostly be a formality. The only symptoms I had at that point were vision problems (similar to the first Monday way back when) and some minor tingling in my hands.\nWhen I got back home I mostly settled back into my normal life. I have a wife and three small kids so there was no easing back in. I began to notice an odd, but not problematic symptom that if I \"overdid it\" my body would get a mild vibrating sensation. Similar to a cell phone vibrating in your pocket, but it was all over my body. Once I sat down or laid down, it went away.\nOn Sunday (June 23), I began to notice that I was having problems chewing. My face just felt odd, not necessarily numb. By Monday, I had lost almost all ability to taste foods and the right side of my face was paralyzed. My right eye was extremely irritated and would water a ton throughout the day. I tried desperately to get a sooner appointment with my neurologist, but they claimed that had no openings. I was able to get back into my family doctor on Tuesday (June 25). When he came into the room he said \"Wow, GBS, I have only had 1 other patient in 35 years that had that! What do they even do for that anymore?\" He pulled out his phone and began Googling and looking stuff up on mayoclinic.com. So needless to say he was not much help. I continued to try to follow up with the neurologist and thankfully with some help from my insurance company I was able to get an appointment on July 3 due to a \"cancellation.\" \nOn July 2, I started my outpatient therapy. The occupational therapist recommended that I see an ophthalmologist about my eye issues. Thankfully, he was able to see me that same afternoon. He did a full neurological test and said that they eye looked good it was likely just drying out since my eyelid muscles were not blinking and closing properly. He recommended I use eye drops and an ointment overnight. I have been doing that and it has helped quite a bit with the eye drying out. On July 3 I finally saw the neurologist again. He confirmed that the facial paralysis was not concerning and should clear up \"in time\" so that was a nice reassurance.\nSince then my facial paralysis has improved and is almost completely better. My taste sensation is still not 100%, but it is close. My eyes still have issues focusing and the right eye still dries out sometimes. Physically, I feel strong, but my endurance still is not what it used to be and I tire out easily. I am continuing to do therapy and hope that will help. Welcome to the community, although we would all rather not have to be here! Now you get to explain MFS to anyone you meet. Glad to hear you have it under control. Glad to hear you are feeling better! It is a scary process when your body starts failing and you cannot get immediate help. This is a rare club to be in, but it is always nice to know we are not alone. Wishing you the best in your recovery! New to this sub. Also have MFS. Crazy to see others have same exact symptoms and experiences with this. Hang in there. I am a little more than 3 months out from the initial onset of symptoms and I am feeling back to normal now. How did it feel when your vision improved? Did you just wake up and notice it was better one day or did you feel anything? It was very gradual for me. At first I noticed that I could focus on objects if I stared at them for a few seconds. Then slowly the amount of time I had to stare before the focus was right got shorter. Then I had a period of time where my eyes would get very dried out and irritated (this was around the time of the facial paralysis so presumably this was because the eye was drying out from not blinking). Eventually that cleared up over time. All that to say everything was a very gradual process for me and at some point I just realized it had been a while since I thought about it so it must be all better.\n\nI hope that makes sense and is helpful. I went and saw and ophthalmologist but it was not much help. He just said it would get better in time.", "Voluntary Research Study for Chronic Pain Hi everyone!

(1 year+ sufferers preferred) NEED HELP with daily life and marital struggles Initially diagnosed GBS,  now CIDP due to recurring symptoms. The past year I have gotten treatment every four weeks. \n\nGet treatment . Feel shitty day of and day after treatment. Feel great for a few weeks. Feel shitty from treatment wearing off. Get treatment again. \n\nThis has been life for the past year. I\u2018m okay w/ this because I\u2018m happy I can walk today. But it does cause me to be pretty much absent from life in general for 5-7 days each month (due to treatment days and feeling shitty week of treatment). \n\nI am working, but still on doctor\u2019s restrictions (6 hour shifts instead of 8). But, I am COMPLETELY DEPLETED after work and the next morning. It makes it nearly impossible to tend to home chores. I am so tired &amp; in so much pain that the last thing I can think about before/after work is cleaning the house, or moving period. Not to mention the depression I have been trying to keep at bay since all of this started. I see my only goal as getting back to work with zero restrictions &amp; that has been my priority since the end of December 2018. I do not want to lost my job because I have good insurance. \n\nMy spouse has stepped up immensely &amp; is supportive. But lately (past 2 months or so) I can see resentment starting. They say things like \u201cyou use this as an excuse\u201d or \u201cit is been a year, you should be able to do this\u201d. I do not know how to explain or make them believe what my body feels like on a daily basis. I feel like they think I am lying about how I feel and I have no way to prove it unless I have my doctor talk to them. \n\nShould I be able to do all of these things a year later? Do others with my condition feel like I do or am I behind? Am I not pushing myself hard enough? I thought I was, but now I do not know. \n\nI feel this becoming a serious issue with my spouse and I worry they will want to leave me. Any advice or feedback will help. I feel like your partner needs to meet or read more experiences from others to gauge where you are at, and what is ahead - particularly with CIDP.\n\nIf it was GBS, I would expect that you would be improving more, but CIDP is more ups and downs. The fact that you are working in any form is great, but it is going to be a longer road, losing a few days a month is better than losing the whole month and it sounds like the treatment is working.\n\nExpectations seems to be the hurdle here, unfortunately there is no set rule for recovery periods. \n\nCan I ask where you are based? Support networks exist in different forms around the world I am in north Texas. So far I have only read stories online. I have not ever met anyone else with CIDP in person. What kind of networks? There is walk and rolls that happen around the USA. There was recently a patient summit on GBS / CIDP. I am in Australia so do not have the full details but am in a couple of really good Facebook groups with thousands of members interacting  :) Okay I will look around on there. I am just trying to find a general idea of where I should be compared to others. I know it  varies so much person to person. \n\nThank you very much for the feedback.

Others exist as well, there is a group video that gets shared across the pages regularly where people discuss their own stories and experiences.\n\nIt is been a massive wealth of information, and you will probably gain a lot of information and support from plenty of others going through this.\n\nIt is an isolating condition so any networks are brilliant Awesome, thank you! I can share that I pushed myself so hard to get back to work and pretend like nothing happened just to become normal again, and unfortunately I have continued to learn that this method has dragged my physical health and mental health down a lot.  I am 3 years in now with GBS.\n\nWhen I took the time to finally reflect, I realized that I placed work at the top of life priorities, and as a by-product, family became second.\n\nI can totally understand and relate to where you are coming from, and reading your post makes me ponder if you have the same priority as I do.  Worry and stress can deplete your mental energy as well, so perhaps the question is, would you like work, or family, at the top of your list?  \n\nWith our condition, sacrifices will need to be made, but which one is the real question.  I am going through a similar mental battle right now.  A good friend of mine shared that if this stress kills us, our family will suffer greater than work will.  I hope that is a nugget of encouragement. I feel like work and family go hand in hand (for the time being). Me working less has put additional stress on my spouse to work more. I guess I see getting back to work as helping. So I am not sure if that is the solution or the problem. Thanks for sharing this, it is a good question to ask my spouse. I work 8-11 hours. Go home. Sleep till work the next day. Every day. So drained by 5 of the clock. It is wearing on me.", "Update on recovery! I just wanted to celebrate the fact that today I was cleared to be independent with a walker! That means I do not need assistance when using it! \nI was diagnosed with GBS on the 18th of February, did 5 days at the hospital, was transferred to a transitional care home, relapsed on the 4th of March, did 5 MORE days at the hospital for ivig, got back a week ago, and am feeling like I might be able to go home in 2-3 weeks! Congratulations! Best wishes for your continued recovery! Congratulations and best wishes!  We are all cheering you on!! Congratulations! Wishing you the best of luck for your recovery. Baby steps!

Best wishes and long may your fantastic recovery continue!", "GBS After 3 months of going to different doctors I was finally diagnosed with GBS. I have horrible pain and numbness in my legs and on pain medication. My neurologist is saying it is too late for IVIG or plasma exchange.  Is it the case? Too late for IVIG? Not really sure I buy that. Did they explain why?\n\nI would probably try to meet with another neuro either way. Absolutely get a second opinion.  My daughter has had GBS/CIDP for over 6 years and takes 45grams of IVIG a week and probably will for a very long time. Immunoglobulin is a miracle drug.  She started treatment almost 9 months after developing GBS due to mis diagnosis Thank you so much! Get a second opinion!!!! Thanks! My neuro said that I should have gone to the hospital right away and got IVIG right away and he is saying it also can be dangerous. \nSo his idea to sit and wait and see if GBS improves by itself. \nThe wait time for any specialists like 2 months... Trying to see rheumatologist too. Maybe he will be more helpful. Yes, it is too late to make a difference. I was in the same boat as you. Took 4 months to finally diagnose. Was put on daily regimen of gabapentin and Vitamin B Complex. I am now 8 months in and still very very slowly recovering. If it is getting worse, or comes and goes probably CIDP. Ask for a spinal tap to prove it.", "GBS or peripheral neuropathy? Hey people so Iv been dealing with peripheral neuropathy for the past 3 years. I am currently waiting to see a neurologist I diagnosed myself with PN for the moment as I have all the symptoms described the tingling numbness shocking stabbing pains in my skin etc. this past couple of months my muscles have started to get real weak like Iv been working out in the gym. Hard to walk up stairs etc. my question is do you think this could be gbs after 3 years and no paralysis ? What should I expect from here ? And is it an easy disease to diagnose? Also I would love to hear some success recovery stories of your gbs or any neurological conditions for some hope.  There is a possibility that it may be CIDP, Guillien Barre 's chronic form. That can be really slow forming sometimes. Go to your GP and request a referral to a Neurologist if you have not done so already. They can then start testing to see what you have.", "Am I coming down with it? Hi, apologies if this is the wrong place for it, but my anxiety is spiking and I am hoping someone here might be able to help. \n\nM/29/US\n\n(TL;DR Got Pfizer booster and flu shot, and I have pins &amp; needles in my right ring finger and little finger that has persisted for hours the next day)\n\nI got my Pfizer booster and flu shot last night, and went to bed immediately after getting home. In my sleep, I did not toss or turn, but I kept repositioning my hands on top of my belly, and getting tingling fingers/pins &amp; needles from it (it happens to me sometimes), but after I woke up, my right hand (flu shot side) ring finger and pinky/little finger have kept having pins &amp; needles for several hours. Normally it should have gone away hours ago. The fingers do not feel any weaker than usual.\n\nI am not experiencing tingling, numbness, or weakness in any other extremities, and do not have any other symptoms except sore arms from the vaccine and a little general fatigue. It has not spread to anywhere else.\n\nShould I be concerned with this symptom?\n\nOnce again apologies if this is the wrong sub (just let me know and I can delete post), and huge, huge thanks to anyone who gets back to me. Hey there and welcome. No need for apologies. It does not sound like GBS currently. Tingling/pins &amp; needles are not necessarily anything to be concerned about, especially so soon after a vaccination. \n\nI developed a variant of GBS two years ago after the flu shot (24 at the time) and my first symptoms were reduced mobility and bilateral facial paralysis. If your symptoms start progressing to other limbs and you notice additional fatigue, soreness, weakness, or anything similar, that is when you should be concerned. \n\nAs of now, I think you are okay but I would just be aware the next couple weeks!  Agree with pinched nerve. Fourth and fifth digits are your ulnar nerve which can be irritated easily near you elbow. Of course happy to help. And symptoms DO show up soon after a vaccine, but the symptoms you are exhibiting do not seem out of the ordinary from just regular side effects from the vaccine. \n\nBut yeah, you could have slept weirdly on it, but definitely keep an eye out for it. And if things get worse, go to the hospital and get tested  It could be that you slept wrong but it is also normal to have some inflammation due to your immune response after receiving a vaccine so it should resolve in a couple days!", "Cannot Find a Neurologist Soon Enough There is a weeks- or even months-long waitlist everywhere I look. Especially for the ones who specialize in these kinds of diseases.\n\nIs there a way to impress upon them that your symptoms are severe enough that you need attention soon?\n\nI let this go too long because I thought it was something else. My symptoms are scary now. Why do you think you have GBS? Typically it starts by going to the ER. If you think it is that bad, that is your best and fastest way to seeing someone. I schedule my neuro visits 3-4 months in advance. I second this when I first had symptoms my doctor did not really know what was wrong with me and it was a 6 week wait for a Neurologist I went into the ER saw one and stayed for a week I had spine surgery a year ago. I have had pain, numbness, tingling, ever since, in my back and one leg. And problems walking. Then muscle wasting was noticed. I thought it was all due to something that went wrong with my surgery and I have been seeing spine doctors.\n\nThey all think it is neurological, not anything to do with the spine. It was hard to accept, but I think they are right.  I wasted time waiting to see them. Now that I need a neurologist I have to wait even longer.\n\nIt could be anything, it may not be GBS or CIDP necessarily. What drives people to the ER? I have had symptoms for so long I guess I got used to them. But now they are getting worse fast. More intense and spreading. I guess that should send me to the ER, huh?\n\nWhat happens then? Were you admitted to the hospital or sent home? I was admitted and did 5 days of ivig treatment And that helped because your disease is auto-immune related. Mine may not be. I just do not know where else to post about neurological problems on reddit.\n\nI did see a neurologist months ago, actually. He did blood tests which I presume test for auto-immune diseases and they must have been negative. And an EMG test. But he could not diagnose me and sent me back to the spine doctors. Gbs is not typically a thing that \u201cflares\u201d up. Are you having it come and go? If so you need to get evaluated for something else\n\nI stayed in the hospital for 20 days my first stint. Ended up back less than a month later. I ended up having periodic paralysis. We will never know if my first round was that or GBS How are you doing now? Good it is been 2 years and I am fine I do not have any reflexes still and I have the occasional fatigue but that is about it It does not completely come and go, it is just less terrible sometimes than others. \n\nIf you had periodic paralysis, is not that coming and going? Do they think you have GBS now? I am glad to hear it. Are your reflexes expected to come back eventually?\n\nThanks for replying to me. If you have symptoms of GBS then you need to go directly to the ER. This onset of this condition is extremely fast. Tests need to be run immediately to receive a diagnosis and treatment needs be administered quickly. IVIG or plasmapheresis would need to happen.\n\nI know it is daunting going to the hospital during a pandemic, but I am urging you to not wait any longer. I really hope you do not end up having GBS, keep us updated. I have no idea have not really talked to my doctor about it been meaning to and no problem Is the onset fast, like from zero symptoms to strong symptoms in a short time? Then that is probably not what I have. Mine started out gradual a year ago then accelerated 3 months ago.\n\nIt helps to hear things like this from other people.\n\nYou know what is bad about the pandemic? You call the doctor's office with certain symptoms like breathing problems and immediately they think you have COVID.  It is the first thing on everyone is mind. I am not a medical professional, but I am speaking as a survivor and what I have personally experienced. Some people have variants and others have a different timeline and varying onset symptoms. If I were you, I would still suggest not waiting weeks or months to see a neurologist when you are experiencing serious neurological issues. Yes, GBS is characterized by rapid onset. If I go to the emergency room they will send me back to the neurologist on their staff, the same one I had before. I want a new one.\n\nI am sure you are right about not waiting. I have an appointment in a week with a new neurologist. It is still not the one I prefer to see. That one, an expert in neuromuscular diseases, is just not available for months. So many tradeoffs and decisions to make.\n\nThanks for your advice. Can it affect your lungs? Yes, artificial respiration can be necessary in extreme cases. I needed it, but I had GBS in the 80s and treatment was not as advanced back then.\n\nIt is not like a cold or pneumonia, however. The nerves which made my lungs work stopped working.\n\nYour comments suggest something other than GBS. It does not linger for months. GBS is rapid onset - I went from normal to respiration within a week. Because of what GBS is (your body attacks itself) it progresses rapidly.  &gt;And that helped because your disease is auto-immune related\n\nGBS basically is an autoimmune syndrome so I have no idea what you are trying to say here. GBS occurs when your body attacks the protein encasing your nerves, leaving you paralyzed.\n\nI understand that you are dealing with an unknown malady but you are basically telling survivors you know better than them. For the well-being of our subscribers, I am sorry but I have to issue you a warning. We are not here to give you all the answers and belittling others - even if through ignorance - is still harmful.\n\nI encourage you to check out other subreddits such as /r/askdoctors.

I am closing this thread.", "Slightly elevated csf levels Can even slightly elevated csf protein levels or cerebral spinal fluid levels cause problems of having guillian barre?", "When did your numbness stop? Hey you all. How long did it take for your numbness to go away? I was diagnosed with GBS in September and received IVIG. I still feel numbness in my legs. I am taking Gabapentin, 1800 mg a day. If I am late on a dose and/or when I wake up in the morning, the numbness is worst. I just want to be back to normal. I had Miller Fisher syndrome. It was about 2 months before I would say I felt like the numbness was completely gone. I felt significantly better after about a month. I am a year and a half out, and I still have some numbness in the hands. I was diagnosed with GBS when I was 19/20 years old. I am 38 now so it was a while ago, pardon me if my timeline is a bit off. \n\nI started getting the tingling in my feet on day one, by day 3 it was most of the way up my legs, and into my thighs. I was admitted to the hospital and was there for weeks. \n\nI got several spinal taps, and they gave me some kind of series of shots. Different treatment back then I guess. I did not get ivig as I remember. \n\nAfter those shots, it seemed like it was several weeks before the tingling stopped. However ever since then it seems like my arms and hands fall asleep really easily. Laying on the couch, or especially when sleeping on my side, it gets really bad. \n\nThe active numbness subsided that same year, but there is still residual effects I feel almost 20 years later. Little things that I notice on a daily basis. I get sick very often. Sometimes my knees do not lock when I am walking. Just little things that you feel here and there. \n\nI am not sure if the the demyelination has anything to do with it, but I have had several big things happen over the years. Erethyma nodosum for years, a TIA, myopericarditis, upper respiratory infections (bronchitis as well), dysphasia, GERD, severe sleep apnea, etc. I have had pain management specialists tell me I have trimenal neuralgia, but I am doubtful of that as I would know..  \n\nI do not recall getting sick all the time before GBS, but again it was a long time ago. I may just be like Eddie from IT lol\n\nSorry for the rant, but not many people in my life know about GBS and what it does, so it is good to know there is a place where people get it. I am five years in, and my feet, hands and face still hurt/,tingle. Another Miller Fisher, largely the same as above. \n\nThe MF folks seem to in general have a different experience, with a faster descent and recovery though. I am 25 years out. The numbness and tingling will subside. However, I have noticed that if I do not manage my stress, or overdo it, it comes back. So all I can suggest is moderation. Hang in there. I am nearly 3 months out, and I do not really deal with numbness but stiffness that makes me feel 80 inside of 25. I am curious if any of you had any significant atrophy and if so what was your pain like. I was diagnosed with botulism but they thought I had mfs because they are similar I had nerve pain and was taking Gabapentin but now I am mostly dealing with muscular pain. My numbness and tingling took about a year to go away, but everyone is recovery process is different. Just stay positive and patient. I was just diagnosed with miller fisher also. I was 36 weeks pregnant and had an emergency c section followed by 5ivig treatments. I am trying to find a community specific to miller fisher but I have not had much luck. I was discharged from hospital after 7 days and am about to start outpatient OT PT and speech therapies. Any advice or anywhere to point me to for more information? I wish you all the best in your recovery. Unfortunately, I have not found a good community or much information for miller fisher. The one piece of advice I would give is to try to get a follow up appointment with your neurologist as soon as possible even if you are feeling good. When I got out of the hospital my neurologist treated me as a new patient even though I had seen them in the hospital and gave me an appointment for 6 weeks out. I started having relapse symptoms a few days after I was discharged from the hospital and it was very difficult to get help. I tried seeing my family doctor, but he was not knowledgeable enough about the condition to be able to offer any help. Long story short I was eventually able to get into the neurologist earlier and now I can get appointments sooner, but it was a stressful experience. I was discharged Tuesday and Immediately started outpatient therapy 3x/wk. Unfortunately the earliest I could get in to my neurologist was 1/13 so I have a few weeks to wait, but I am taking my recovery very seriously. Best of luck to you with the therapy and I hope that it will be helpful for you. I was on 3200 mg a day of gabapentin (4 does daily of 800 mg) and my tingling and numbness went away after about 8 months.", "Anyone else have this weird side effect? I survived GBS last August - spent about 10 days in the ICU with a feeding tube and another 14 in rehab. I have fortunately made a full recovery - except for one really weird souvenir!\n\nEvery time I get a small hangnail or cut on my fingers - I ALWAYS end up with a small infection. Never anything too serious, but I have never been this sensitive before. Even the smallest cut also hurts/throbs wayyy more than pre-GBS.\n\nThis is potentially unrelated, just found it super weird and suspicious that it only started happening after &amp; obviously fingers/toes were the first place I started feeling the beginnings of my GBS-related paralysis!\n\nHope everyone is well - I think about GBS/CIDP sufferers often and will always feel a strong connection to this community of warriors. I do not have that. You only spent 14 days in rehab but were tube fed? That seems speedy as hell. Yup! Here is my recovery video:  I actually had a similar experience. On breathing tube and in NCCU for 15 days then another 15 days of rehab. Granted I used a walker and came for a while before I could walk on my own again but it happens. Glad OP is doing better. Yeah, I was in the ICU for only 7-10 days but I stayed in rehab for about 1.5 months so everyone seems to be quite different. Well I hope you are doing better now! Yup, thanks man I do not have that issue but I do have a kind of hypersensitivity thing going on.     \n\nFor example carrying anything in a bag causes the handles to cut deeply into my skin in a way that never happened before. It is bizarre. I was in the ICU for around 8 days and was in hospital for the next 110 days!! Wow! Cannot even imagine how hard that must have been. Glad you made it through - GBS is hell. Sounds related! So weird!! You are one of the lucky ones\u2026. I spent close to 5 months in hospital 20 years ago as a result of the flu shot\n1 in ICU\n1 in intensive care\n3 in rehab\nI had to learn how to do everything all over again like a baby \u2639\ufe0f Guillain-Barr\u00e9 never goes away, anything can trigger it at anytime. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK... I felt like a winner at 50+ days. The only weird side effects I have are taste disturbances, and I do not know if that was due to Covid or GBS. Soon after leaving the hospital, my skin felt so sensitive sometimes I could not even bear anything touching it. For instance, my own beard or other body hair, clothes, glasses... It was not only the pain, but it also made my skin irritated. Luckily that does not happen that much now. However, i do feel everything much more painful and it takes longer to stop hurting than before the GBS. I think it is similar to what is happening to you.\nI have got some other \"funny\" side effects, like fast dehydration, bad body temperature regulation, fatigue, cramps, eyes and mouth dryness, numbness, lack of reflexes... I could follow, but I do not think it is necessary. Doctors say it is due to GBS, and it is \"normal\". I tell you what - the outside world did not feel like reality for a week or two. It was surreal. I begged them to keep me until I could toilet myself. I am the primary care giver at home with an elderly mother and a disabled brother. No one could have rolled me over, not to mention put me on a toilet. Even after I was discharged I still could not use the toilet or shower alone.     \n\nIt was a nightmare. Sorry man. That was some scary shit. ", "Nerve Pain several years after onset Hey everyone, I was wondering if anyone has experienced onset of nerve pain several years after having an episode? I am close to 8 years after and while during winter &amp; summer, I experience a low level nerve tingling, this past year I have noticed more times were I experience a slight disconnection with my nerves, I am not really sure what to call it. Ghost disconnection? In these times, my touch will feel slightly numbed and I have to consciously check that I am feeling my toes, moving my body because my brain almost second guesses it. \n\nThis happened earlier this week for a solid day which is longer than normal and the next night I woke up in really intense muscle and nerve pain from my mid abdomen down, especially my hips and thighs. The pain was able to be relieved with extra strength Tylenol. I had to retake once and then it was gone. The next day (today) the nerve pain in my hips and thighs is back, not as intense but very uncomfortable. The type of pain reminds me of when my nerves were initially turning on after my GB episode. \n\nHave you ever experienced it? What has your neurologist said? \n\nI plan to go to a neurologist but I wanted to have some more experiences to reflect on, the neurologists I have seen have not been helpful. \n\nThank you! Any surgeries, big illnesses (like a stomach bug) or shots in the days/weeks before the episode? Nope I get nerve pain along the side of my face for 10 days to two weeks once a year or so. It feels like it is an impacted tooth but for all of my top molars. I can control it with Ibuprofen and codeine, dentist cannot find any issues and it goes away after a couple of weeks.\n\nIt was one of the places I had severe pain when I had GBS so I think it is a flare up of the nerves. I wear a bite guard and have no other issues apart from some residual soreness in my feet at night.\n\nJust one of the wonderful long term tail issues from this truly weird disorder. I have severe pain at random times (but several times a year) in my left ankle still 25 years after GBS.  That ankle was one of the places I had the worst pain when I had GBS.  I was told it is just nerve damage/nerve sheath scar tissue. I have had x-rays on it and no one can find anything really wrong otherwise. Thanks for your input! Thanks for your story. I was thinking similarly that it is probably long term effects", "Coming up on 1 year anniversary of GBS diagnosis I was diagnosed with GBS on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2019 after a long stressful pursuit of trying to get answers to questions no one understood. This year has been the most difficult of my life, and I came here looking for some support from others who had experienced this disease and all of the ways it can take control of your life. My mental health suffered tremendously while dealing with this disease. Anxiety and depression crept into my life while dealing with being immobile and severe pain. I was 30 when I was diagnosed. I have GBS for 5 years now. Still hurts, strength and vitality is gone, but no depression. Try daily B12 shots. It helped me a lot. And take your time to rest. GBS sucks, but it is possible to live with it. It is a case of, sucks for us, but could be worse. We go up and down and it is quite a roller coaster ride. I am 10 yrs post onset. Dealing does get better. Do not let the disease dictate to you how you should behave. Do not let it control your thought process. That is how I think. I was diagnosed with GBS in 1995. It is a definite life changer. I went from walking and talking to three days later on a ventilator. I had to learn to accept that I needed to slow down, but I am a better person and today I walk, run (kind of- I am old) lol. I love life and my family. My birthday is Feb 16, so I got placed on a ventilator for my 32nd birthday. Learn to read your body, slow down when necessary and do whatever makes you happy! Thank you guys for your responses. I truly thought I would kick GBS\u2019s ass in a couple months and be back to normal, but that did not happen. I still deal with weakness and nerve pain. I am always tired, so I think I will definitely try the b12.", "12 years after GBS.. Are these normal long-term side effects? Am I imagining things? I had an onset of GBS in 2010. I lost strength in limbs so rapidly that within hours, I did not have enough grip to open a water bottle or open the door. I could not stretch my fingers. I was stable enough, however, that I was hospitalized for a week and did not receive any treatments. \n\nBecause my case was relatively contained, doctors said my prognosis should be good. It took me about 6 months to somewhat gain strength that resembled the old normal.\n\nHowever, I still feel the side effects when I am tired. First, I have no knee reflexes. My fingers feel numb when I am tired, my knees buckle when I am tired, and my eyes lose focus and I have double vision when I am tired. It is as if my eyes do not have enough muscle support to hold them still. My reading speed becomes much lower, up to 3 times as slow.\n\nMy condition is so weird - some days I feel completely fine and normal; but some days, when fatigue hits, I lose balance and my body (and my eyes) do not move the way they want.  \n\nI am really worried because I soon need to take an exam for license that is very grueling and spread over multiple days. I can take 2 or 3 hour exams without any accommodations because that is within my limits; but I know that my body (and especially my eyes) cannot handle 8-hour exam and repeating that the next day. \n\nWhen I asked my neurologist for an accommodation (nothing much, just breaks every hour to make sure I stretch to manage my eye condition) and just a bit of extra time to compensate for double vision (25%-33%), she said she does not know how to justify the extra time. She said it looks like I do have some mild residues from GBS, but otherwise fine. She treated my vision issue as \"I sometimes have double vision too\" and minimized my struggles. \n\nI feel like living with a neurological condition really makes me to doubt and question myself. Am I imagining things? Am I overreacting to my condition? Am I excessively worrying? I am just so frustrated that a doctor will not listen to how a patient feels about their body and their experience.", "How to support newly diagnosed?

I was excited to see a GBS subreddit. \n\nI was 2 years old when I was diagnosed with GBS, I am 48 now. I wondered if anyone else has experienced this.  All throughout my life I start getting really achy when winter approaches or when there is any type of atmospheric pressure change.  My legs hurt,  my hands and fingers are achy,  and most recently my spine has started hurting too.  It is not debilitating or anything like that, I tolerate (hide) it well enough most people would never suspect I am in any amount of pain, but the older I get the worse it is becoming so I am wondering if it is from GBS or if it is something else... like something age related *sigh*  If you experience anything like this too, have you found anything that helps?  \n\nThanks!  And again,  I am super excited to find this sub.  I have never talked to anyone else who has had GBS so it is pretty cool to meet all of you. I have a shoulder that does this that predates my GBS event by almost 20 years.  My understanding is the shoulder pains come from joint damage. The one Dr  basically told me I dealing with arthritis type issues even though it is technically a bit different.\n\nFrom a Quality of Life point of view, do any of arthritis coping methods help with the pain management?  Are you able to work with a Dr to rule out arthritis? Up until now otc meds have done an adequate job of taking care of the pain; I guess it is time to talk to my doc about it though.  \n\nThank you! I have that. The nerve damage in my feet makes my feet really sore whenever the barometric pressure changes. If it changes rapidly enough I get the nerve pain in my fingers too. My doctor offered to put me back on gabapentin but I do not want to take it just for a few days a month. Wow!  I am new to this sub too and it is so rare to find someone who had GBS so young too. I was 2 years old as well when I was diagnosed and I am almost 40 now.  \n\nMy pain level definitely changes with weather changes - although I live in California so the changes are mild.   I have had a lot of Orthopedic surgery, so I also have resulting arthritis which is definitely heightened by cold.  I manage mostly with otc meds or really it is just been a part of my life for my whole life I do not notice it much. Every weather change hurts me. 53, GBS with 48. Right?  It is hard to know if this is the norm for everyone or if it is GBS related.  \n\nVery cool (in a sad way) that we were both two! Are there any side affects from gabapentin?  What about it makes you not want to take it for just a few days a month?  I am sure there are, but I did not experience any side effects. I do not want to take it because it is cumulative. You have to take it on a regular basis for it to work effectively, I cannot just take it on days where I actually need it. That makes sense.  It is too bad you just cannot take it like you do Tylenol or Aleve. I had it when I was 5, so similarly young. Treatment was a lot more rudimentary back then in the 80s, and from my research it seems that early treatment helps a lot with mitigating long term effects. :( Welcome to the sub! Sorry for the late reply, been dealing with health issues and RL.\n\nTreatment has improved since we were young - I had GBS as a 5 year old in the 80s - and from my research, early treatment helps a lot with long term effects. \n\nI have pain in cold, heat (extra weakness in heat) and pressure changes (flying makes me ache, for example).

I do not relish getting it again (i am a musician, that was forced to retire becuase I could not move my hands).  \n\nYour % chance of dying to covid (2.5%) is higher than a re-occurrence of GBS. Not to mention all the horrific lifelong repercussions if you get a bad case.\n\nEDIT: Being exposed to the virus is getting higher again with the latest surge.  Being exposed poses nearly the same risk as taking the vaccine regarding a possible relapse. I am getting my second Moderna shot tomorrow. mRNA vaccines are recommended by the CDC for those with GBS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\" People who have previously had GBS may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. To date, no cases of GBS have been reported following vaccination in participants in the ( clinical trials. One case of GBS was reported in a vaccinated participant in the Johnson &amp; Johnson Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine clinical trial (compared to one GBS case among those who received placebo). \"\n\nSource: ( I had GBS also in 2010... I was partially paralyzed. Hospitalized for a few weeks. \n\nI got my first short of Pfizer few days ago and everything seems fine.  I get my 2nd one in 3 weeks. \n\nMy logic is better to get the vaccine, than getting covid-19 in the wild and risk a relapse.  Good Luck! I got a mild case of GBS starting about 2 months ago now. Though it got harder to walk, at my worst I could still walk unassisted. Still very early in recovery but decided to take the plunge and get my first Pfizer shot anyway about 1 week ago. \n\nMy symptoms flared up and I felt icky and regretted my decision for a day. But then everything calmed back down and I went right back to my familiar recovery trajectory 24 hours after the shot.\n\nGoing to get my second shot when I can. My thinking is that it will make my GBS feel even worse again but that it is not actually going to make it worse in a lasting way. I am still slowly getting better day by day and no relapse so far. Honestly less worried about relapse at this point and just treating this as another unfortunate thing I will have to endure and just get through. I have had my first Pfizer shot two weeks ago and have not had any problems. Hi there- just checking to see how your second shot made you feel. My daughter had gbs 12 years ago at age 10 and is thinking about getting the vaccine. I will most certainly be the minority dissenting opinion here.  \n\nI have no intention of getting the vaccine for many years, if ever.  I personally do not think doctors take into consideration what happens when you put that such new technology into a body that is been modified by many years of powerful immunosuppresion and has sustained significant damage from the attack.  I am concerned about the mixing of all those agents in a damaged body.  \n\nMy CIDP is from a flu shot, my one and only.  I am the living manifestation of the 1 in 100,000 chance so I am wary of putting anything into my body I do not have to.  \n\n I hope no one in our community has any problems with the vaccine.  I hope it protects and provides peace of mind.  We have all suffered enough and we all have climbed our share of mountains. I am not sure yet. I just had GBs last year- and for the second time.  I got a medical accommodation from work to continue teaching from home- but I am also thinking I should just do it otherwise I will be at constant risk from covid This technology being used for these inoculations are over 20 years old. The process for evaluation is very rigorous. This is why it was a relatively short time to create the vaccines. IF this was some 'mysterious' new technology it would be more of a 5-10 year lifecycle to get the product to market. In fact its so commonplace they did not have to build any new 10 billion dollar manufacturing facilities to create these vaccinations. They could use the existing ones.\n\n\nI have been in the Pharma/Biotech industry for 30 years specifically in the manufacture of medicine and ensuring product efficacy. I do not take medicine unless absolutely required to. Ever.  \n\n\nYou are literally talking to a bunch of people who are the living manifestation of the 1 in 100,000 chances.  However Your chance of re-occurrence is 1 in 6.8 million. And yes,  Its OK to be freaked out. I have the next 12 days marked on my calendar.  Everyone of us here does not want GBS or CIDP again ever. \n\n\nYour CIDP was your bodies over reaction to an outside influence just like my GBS was (I got the flu). It happens.. and its shit luck. In fact if you get/become ill with COVID19 you could personally be responsible for a mutation that brings us back to square 1 again. \n\n\nA mosquito with west-Nile , a common cold and the flu, exposure to COVID19 can do the exact thing and kick your CIDP off again. In fact your chances are much higher of it happening doing nothing. some states have 7% infections rates still. Your chances of dying or being permanently maimed from COVID is over 1000 fold higher than a re-occurrence of CIDP.\n\n\nWait 3 months, you will feel better.and again its normal to be freaked out we all are.... My original plan was to wait until July, But the emergence of the J&amp;J becoming a go-to vaccine freaked me out.  World-wide data is showing exactly 2 cases amongst hundreds of million of vaccinations. I had both Pfizer injections and only had minor head cold symptoms a week after the second shot. Went away after a couple days. GBS in \u201809 GBS in \u201809, and only had minor head cold symptoms about a week after second Pfizer shot. Hope you fare as well! Sorry, I am I am getting it today on the 9th. I misspoke. Hopefully I will be okay! No problem. I hope everything goes well. Hello my wife currently is getting treatment for Guillen barre. Could you describe me your experience? I am so worried for her. \n\nShe took a nap and then woke up with her entire body feeling like pins and needles. Her face was numb and she had intense brain fog. She is getting IV treatments now...\n\nDid you make a full recovery? I was hospitalized for 2 weeks, 4 doses of the IV stuff but started to have an allergic reaction after the 3rd dose. I spent the next 6 months in physical therapy helping walk correctly. Half my face was paralyzed for about 6 months but eventually bounced back.  \n\nThat being said\n\nI made a FULL recovery, I am able to walk with zero issues, my face went pretty much back to normal (very slight droop that I notice), the back pain subsided after a few years.  My body has changed and I cannot lift as heavy as I used to, if I sit without back support for 15+ mins I have crazy back pain, but I get my wife to use her elbow and apply pressure and it relives it.   \n\nIt sucked and was a terrible terrifying experience but it will get better it just takes time, every case is different so your doctor will tell you how much permanent nerve damage she has and you can go from there. \n\nGood luck! Thank you! She comes home from the hospital today so I hope things get better as well. We jumped on it early, so no paralysis. She is very tired though so hopefully she will get her energy back. Here is my concern.  \nThe CDC does not say how many participants in the clinical trials had GBS.  Could be 0?\nAnd seeing anecdotal responses here is nice, but even if all 60ish responses are positive, that is not nearly enough for those who are worried about resurgence. You mean had it before and now have it again? I would be surprised if anyone with GBS was even included in the vaccine Had it when I was 2.  I do not have it now.  I am 35.  My understanding is that of you had it before and recovered, the condition can resurge from the flu vaccine.  Im not sure about the covid one.", "Pins and needles 2 weeks after Remicade Infusion So on the 21st September I had my second Remicade Infusion for Chrons Disease \n\nOn the night I had some quite nasty diarrhoea and a high heart rate. Since then most of the time every time I go to stand up my heart shoots up to 120bpm. My blood pressure has been flucatiionong alot and a a day or so ago I started to get pins and needles in my hands and feet. The pins and needles in my hands feel quite painful and it feels werid to type on my phone is it is very hard to bend the fingers. My balance is slightly off and it is concerning me as they have not found anything in bloods and say my ecg is fine but high. When I go to stand up my heart rate shoots up and makes me feel quite dizzy.", "17 year old sister had 3rd GBS attack The first time was she was nine. It started with her eyes being super dilated, taking her to the pediatrician and he noticed she had no knee-jerk reflex. As symptoms progressed we went to the hospital and eventually got the right diagnosis. Highlight for her was when she was \u201ctransferred\u201d to another building that is technically another hospital by the life flight crew. The nurse with her was bemoaning to her friend on the flight crew that they had to wait around for a doctor to do the transfer since she was connected to equipment. No calls had come in so the three of them in full gear wheeled her across the walkway. \nSecond time was two years ago when she was 15. Started feeling weak and since she had previously been diagnosed GBS was spotted quickly. An ivif treatment very quickly took her from almost complete paralysis to moving again 2 weeks later and recovered 100% 6 months down the track. It was a tough 6 months and took a lot of work to gain everything back but, she kicked its ass and was playing tennis on the high school team that fall.\nFast forward to last week and it starts again. Only this time it has progressed much faster and far more aggressively. On Monday they had to intubate her and they identified pneumonia on Tuesday. I know she is being taken care of and I know we are doing everything we can for her but, it just breaks my heart into pieces to see the pain in her face as they do the cough assist machine to help clear her lungs. It devastates me that she is going to miss a school trip in 2 weeks she has been so excited for. I cannot imagine having to go through months of physical therapy again just when you think it is all better.\nSorry for the pity party but, it is just really awful right now. I have found hope and healing by reading all your posts about your experiences so thank you for sharing. We are still a few days out from needing to do a tracheostomy so here is hoping we see some improvement and do not have to put her through more. I am very sorry your sister is going through this :( Has her neurologist looked into CIDP? It is a chronic form of GBS. I am so sorry she is going through this again!! She is lucky to have such a supportive family. I agree, talk to her neurologist about CIDP, she may just need to have regular infusions to keep it under control. It is has come up in conversation. I am sure it will be discussed more fully during recovery planning. Right now the main goals are keeping her comfortable and calm.\n\nUPDATE: very slight torso movement this morning. This is the first positive trend so far; very grateful. I am sorry you are all going through this, again. I have CIDP  from 3 relapses of GBS.   Have not heard of someone getting relapses so far apart in time. That must be scary. I have a port for my IVIG infusions every 6wks for 2 days. GBS/CIDP has left me with  much pain in my feet and calves. Sounds like your sister is active and I pray that she can continue being so.  If I do too much i am in such pain from the  neuropathy  I had a spinal stimulator put in my back in December and still trying to get it fine tuned to eliminate some of the pain. ...Please let us know how she is doing. I was jogging a week before GBS paralyzed me and spent 99days in a traumatic spine and brain unit to recover enough to come home.I really miss jogging and riding a bike.....good luck to her.. *hugs* I am so sorry you are going through this - how is she doing now? She is home and recovering her strength through rehab. Dr\u2019s are still unsure on a prevention plan as it is not technically chronic. So proud of how strong my little sister is. She is a celebrity around the ICU, I think with all the terrible things staff see there it is a breath of fresh air to see someone recover and thrive.", "In your experience, what did it feel like when your nerves were healing? 2 months into my recovery, and I still have tingling in my hands and feet, and sometimes twitching as well. The twitching has become a little more apparent recently especially in my feet. Also, in between the joints of my fingers feels funny. Like for example, this morning I was washing my hands and went to put hand soap on and when I pressed down on the pump I felt a feeling similar to when you hit your funny bone. Not painful, just strange. Pretty much everything else has gone back to normal, and my hands and feet were definitely the most affected so I did expect them to take longer to recover. Just painful. Agreed, painful which is how I knew they were healing.  Before that they were just numb, or cold.  Then there started to be tingling and shocks which I attributed to the nerves trying to reconnect in a useful way, then a little warmness because of the internal activity, then finally movement. It is a victory kind of pain, the myelin is healing, if the axon was damaged I do not feel anything, those buggers do not heal well.\n\nForgot to mention twitching was prominent... From what I remember, that is how it felt for me. Sporadic tingling. Sporadic pain. Just like you and others have said. I get a feeling like numb gloves and socks, then a remission is pins and needles, large muscles twitching and spasming, then tiny zaps and twitching. I dont experience chronic pain, but when I hit my toe on something its pretty intense. 8 years with GBS and my feet are still numb Painful in hard and feet. Gabapentin helped with the pain. Feet and hands are numb and fingers feel stiff. Excruciating pain at night.. like growing pains, but so much worse. Numbness, tingling, sharp nerve pain like lightning bolts. Ankle drop too. Still have most of these several years later I am going through a recovery period (I hope).  At first I thought it was a relapse.  The sensations like burning, needle pricks, tingling, numbness, and spasms that all had diminished, started coming back, but this time tremors of the legs and sometimes my arms depending on what movement I am doing.  I had a new emg/ncs done.  This is why my neuro thinks it is recovery v. relapse. The new test shows less demyelination than before but more sensory nerve damage at the axon.  It was described to me that when your nerves try to regrow, macrophages come in at eat the bad parts of the nerve.  Then schwann cells come in a fill up the nerve space so that nerve growth can happen.  Sometimes those connections dont happpen right, and then the nerve doesnt regenerate.  It appears mine are regrowing but the sensory nerves are not sending messages fast enough to the spine to the brain and back to the muscles, so these symptoms occur just like in the beginning.  Now I just pray that the sensory nerves will grow properly, but it takes them a long time, something like 1mm/day. So you can imagine in the legs, it takes quite a bit of time.\n\nHoping for recovery for you all!", "Trying to exercise again. Is this normal? I am about 8 months into my recovery. Still suffering from numbness in my hands and feet. \n\nHowever, I am trying to exercise again, starting slow by just walking on the treadmill for a half hour every day. It is been a week of walking and every time I get off the treadmill my feet have severe tingling and my leg muscles twitch from my thighs all the way to my ankles.\n\nWas this a normal part of the recovery process for anyone else?", "Update v2 So things where going along quite well and then 4pm hit last night. Started with blood pressure being high.  Then heart rate. Then I could not get my breathing to slow down. Before this I was playing crazy with my wife listening to do music. \nThen it was like something breaking. It went from fast to not able to breath in enough to blow a feather. No strength. \n\nThen comes in all the ICU doctors saying \u201cdiabetes\u201d \u201cinsulin drip\u201d \u201cglucose drip\u201d and I can think to myself is sleep Jesus. These two will kill me. I look to my room nurse and look down to my pump and she sees it and immediately says his blood sugar is fine, it is x. And he ate st this time. Which put them at ease \n\nBack and forth and decide to leave to bipap on and not intubate. ICU docs get mad and leave since they werent going to be able to boss neurology and the staff doc of IM around\n\nSo it was a rough night. They have me my second IVIG.  Wake up in the morning basically choking on the bipap. Take it off and can take slow shallow breaths. \n\nThe day progresses with everyone saying that I could take s few more days to stop seeing progression. At this point I am still optimistic and happy even though I have no control of my feet, ankles or need to waste and my face and finger are starting to go. Hell what can you do?\n\nThen around 2:30pm mystical fairy must have come into my room because without realizing it. I could wiggle my right toes. Then my other toes. Then my ankles. Then my knees. And then my bladder. All in like 60 minutes. I cannot walk. Too weak but it was crazy that I can now adjust my feet.  My breathing is still shallow however I am feeling hopeful but trying to keep my expectations low \n\nHas anyone hear of something like this before? This sounds pretty standard for second day of icu. Give the medicine plenty of time to take full effect Your experience in the details is different, big picture lines up though.  It will be like bobbing in the ocean for a bit, ups and downs without a lot of control.", "Had GBS in November. Just looked at my medical records on the Aetna app and it says \u201crecent myocardial infarction\u201d and nothing about GBS. Why? I did not have a heart attack. I was hooked up to a heart monitor for two days along with a bunch of other things, but I believe that is normal for GBS. They took it off after the second day I was in the hospital (was there for 5 total) because they said they did not see a need for it. Could that be why that is there? I did not have a heart attack.", "Could I have a relapse I got gb in 2015 after suffering a very painful respiratory virus. I could not swallow and coughing hurt so bad I felt like I might break a rib. The weakness started almost as soon as I was well. I ignored it until I fell and could not even crawl. I was admitted. They did so many uncomfortable tests. \n\nI was afraid to go to sleep because my toes were numb and I could not move at all in bed. Like I could not turn over. My back was so sweaty. It was terrifying but once they gave me the first ivig dose I could sort of sit up. \n\nIt took a long time to get back to where I was, and I still am a little weaker on my right side. That is where it started. It still remains the most terrifying medical experience. \n\nA week or maybe two ago I had severe throat pain but not chest pain. I had white spots on my tonsils. The pain is not as severe as 4 years ago. \n\nI know relapse is rare and if you caught it through your stomach relapse is more likely since that ( idk if version is the right word) gb is much more serious. \n\nAny info would be greatly appreciated. It sounds like you know the statistics.  Words like 'rare' do not help much when you have gone through it once and you remember what it was like.  For years afterward, I would second guess every virus and every pain in my legs.  The only advice I can give is to be vigilant if you spot the signs, but do not let the fear of relapse control you. Thank you. You are right I cannot drive myself crazy. Your advice is very good. I am so sorry that you are in a place where you are even questioning this. All I can say from personal experience is that you know yourself. You have lived in that body of yours, and you have already experienced GBS once. I think regardless of the GBS variant, your knowledge of statistics, etc, it would be in your best interest to tell your primary doc or neurologist. \nI am in the middle of a relapse. I actually think I might have CIDP since this has happened to me before (between first diagnosis and relapse), and I am just not getting better this time. Since I have autism and PTSD (including trauma from my first guillian barre diagnosis), I think my doctors are quick to judge and blame my symptoms on that before they even run diagnostics. That is very unfair that your doctors are quick to judge you before they even run tests. I am sorry that you are going through it all again. They should not be so quick to judge, especially considering you have relapsed before. If you ever want to talk Pm me. I have ptsd as well from a horrible experience at a residential that makes me afraid to see doctors. If you do not mind me asking, what made you develop ptsd during your first diagnosis? I developed it from experiencing emotional abuse at the hands of my therapist and other staff at this residential. Jewish Children\u2019s services had to get involved. It was a whole huge thing that lasted for about a year. I developed severe anxiety, painful nightmares, and trust issues.", "GBS and alcohol I am going to preface this by saying that I will of course be asking my doctor but I just wanted to hear others\u2019 experience.\n\nI started drinking a lot more during quarantine after losing my job and I would say right before the GBS hit I was probably drinking 3 to 4 drinks every night, not good I know. I actually stopped drinking completely about two weeks before I was diagnosed because my primary care doctor wanted me to stop so she could test my liver enzymes which were a little high on the first blood draw.\n\nMy question is, has anyone had GBS , and continue drinking? If so were there any negative effects related to your diagnosis? Was anyone able to recover and get home and have the occasional drink with no ill affects? I definitely do not plan on ever drinking as much as I was before but perhaps a few drinks on the weekends. I actually run a website about drinking. I have never have any GBS-related problems due to alcohol. What is the website if I can ask? I do not drink much if at all anymore but I have never had any problems with GBS. \n\nThat being said, I had some serious liver problems right before I was diagnosed (still do not know what caused that)\n\nI think the biggest concern would be how it would react with any medication you are taking I do not drink a ton, but am a casual-with-friends drinker. I did not drink during my initial recover, but after that I did and have not had any issues. I do have a MUCH lower tolerance, though the medications I take probably play a role in that. Been about 5 years since I started drinking again. I drink as it seems fit. I cannot tell any difference in GBS. I drink in bars so actually getting out and getting positive attention is better for me than the booze is bad. My GBS had me in the hospital in May. I walked my dog 3 blocks to the Elks to watch the game tonight. This was the first / longest outdoor walk since diagnosis. Your relationship with alcohol during quarantine was common. I would not necessarily read too much into it. Especially since it does not sound like you were drinking a massive liver destroying amount or anything. \n\nThat said, there is evidence out there that alcohol CAN contribute to autoimmune and immunodeficiency diseases. Good evidence that it generally deadens and screws up the immune system. That will include bits and pieces that mediate self-reactivity. Far-gone alcoholics tend to get sick and sicker more often. Usually, that does not manifest as autoimmune though. That is to say I think most of autoimmune is just random or genetics. I know people in my family got other autoimmune diseases and none of them drink. I just got dealt a poor hand with GBS - so in my case, I was drinking, about half as much as you - probably did not help, but I do not think it would have changed things either.\n\nI would say though that if you have an autoimmune disease though it is probably generically good advice to not drink though. Just like it would be good advice to eat well and exercise. A healthier body and healthier immune system can probably only help things. Or drink in great moderation a few drinks every now and then is not going to wipe out your immune system or get you all screwed up. If you felt your alcohol use was getting out of control, it might be important to keep more of a lid on that though for obvious reasons. Hope my two cents helps - cheers! I had 10 years ago GBS and after I recovered I drink and I currently drink now. \n\nDrinking has nothing to do with GBS, listen to your doc tho. I stopped drinking about 2-3 weeks before my diagnosis because I read that alcohol can cause or exacerbate the neuropathy pain I had already been experiencing (later attributed to GBS). That is still true for people experiencing neuropathy pain- that it makes it worse because of the effect it has on the nervous system. \nI am still recovering from GBS and my balance is still off, and alcohol will only make that worse, so it will be several months before I have a drink. But I, too, had been drinking a lot during quarantine. Mostly out of boredom. Part of me thinks it had something to do with developing GBS (there is no identifying cause for me). \nMy thoughts on this (only loosely based on science and mostly based on my own conclusions) are this: if your neuropathy pain (pins and needles) is tolerable, and your strength/balance is fine, I do not see why you would not be able to imbibe. ( \\- enjoy! Congrats! that is dope. Hopefully, you make a full recovery! same here. Unfortunately I have been a HEAVY drinker for the better part of a decade, 33F now. I to went on a break for a few weeks before I was experiencing symptoms, and quickly diagnosed. To be perfectly honest after spending the week in the hospital for the IVIG treatment, I went home and straight back to drinking, more than ever. Made me feel better in the moment but I experienced several falls.\n\nI got so bad my mother made me leave y home with my husband and stay with her where I could be closely monitored, and kept away from alcohol. \n\nIt really did help my recovery. I have a variant of GBS called Miller Fisher syndrome. Was in a wheelchair and on a walker from June 2020, until December. I can fully walk now but have chronic swelling of the hands and feet.\n\nI do still drink, not as much as before, but I am well aware I should not and the hospital and current neuro had concerns too. I had an ultrasound done and came back fine, not an excuse but I know i am in the wrong.\n\n\\*\\*do not hate on my grammatical errors, typing's still tough. I do my best. I am glad you are doing better. I was drinking a lot, and it took something really scary to get me to take it seriously.\nI do not think anyone here judges typos lol.\nBest of luck with your continued recovery! Sounds like a few of us had similar experiences. I was drinking a lot more than usual before my GBS diagnoses last December. I will have the occasional beer. But no hard stuff anymore. I am just scared it will make the nerve pain/sensation loss and hypotension worse.", "Could this be Guillain-Barr\u00e9? I am nervous. Like 1-2 weeks ago, I got a tingling sensation in my feet after a jog (I had, prior to that, not been running for a long time). I assumed that it was just my feet not being used to it, but now it is moved up my legs. It started as an \"ankle sock\", then a \"regular sock\" and now it is knee-high, maybe even thigh-high. It is tingling beneath the surface of the skin but it is also muscle twitches, like the ones you get in your eye sometimes. I have not felt any weakness though. The tingling is not noticeable when I move around, only when I am still.\n\nI feel like it might be moving to my arms, though it is hard to tell because I have had (self-diagnosed) carpal tunnel syndrome for 1.5 years.\nShould I seek emergency help? (This website seems to suggest so:  - \"Tingling that started in your feet or toes and is now moving up your body\".)\n\nI talked to a nurse by phone and told her my symptoms. I forgot to say that the sensation was moving up my body. She suggested to me to go to a health center tomorrow (\"Maybe it is B12 deficiency?\"). I cannot sleep now.\n\nI have not been sick, though. My nose was clogged for like 4 mornings last week but that is it. Are you having weakness with the tingling? Is it constant?\n\nYou probably can wait until tomorrow, but when you go ask the doctor about Guillain-Barre. The emergency room doctor said I was the second patient he would seen with GBS in 15 years. From what I have heard with other people, it seems like doctors do not consider that right away very often. I have Miller Fisher so my experience may be different from traditional GBS but I went from perfectly healthy to unable to walk in two days. It was not really a gradual thing. Definitely get checked out though and try to see a neurologist if you can. My family doctor had only seen two GBS patients (including me) in 35 years. A neurologist should be more familiar with GBS and able to test for it.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a doctor.", "Discussion topic: How old were you when you had GBS? What effect do you think your age had (if any)? How old were you when you first had GBS? Did your age affect diagnosis or treatment? I personally was 5 years old and my age definitely played a factor! My mother did not believe me, so treatment was delayed until I was almost fully paralyzed. She thought I was being dramatic/weird and playing pretend, and the delay meant I had to be separated from her immediately for emergency treatment - this was back in the 80s, so she was not treated the best or kept updated either. It has colored our relationship ever since, sadly, even though I did not properly realize that until I was much older.\n\nOn the flip side, my age seemed to help me bounce back more quickly. There were other people in PT with me who had had it, but they were much older and more stagnant in recovery. I was 24. (I am 49 now.) I think I was lucky to have had it younger -- it seems that older people with GBS have a hard time recovering -- but at the same time, I would happily have given up 25 long years of residuals by having it later. I was 4 (Back in 199&amp;) - am now 26 (Nearly 27).  \n\n\nIn the space of 24 hours, I went from being a typical 4 year old to being paralysed from the neck down. Thankfully, I didnt require a respirator - it took me over a year to start getting back to 'normal'.\n\nAll I have left is a bilateral foot drop on both feet and a poor balance. I wear orthotics on my feet and ankles up the back of my calf, I have to get these recast every couple of years. But, its a small price to pay for what could have been much worse! Hello I am from Belgium and a newbie on Reddit. So here is in short my story. I was 62. It happened november 16th 2019. 4 weeks in IC of which 3 in a coma. Completely paralysed. Intubated. \nRevalidation is going extremely well says my neurologist . They thought there was a big chance that I would not be able to walk again. But I can walk without help, I ride my bike. Legally I am not allowed to drive a motorbike or a car. However, on a parking I was able to drive my car without problems.\nFor the moment I suffer from a slapfoot (?), memory problems and cold feet.\nI do not think my age did not have any effect. Perhaps I was just lucky. I am 31. I had it this past year. I feel very lucky to be this age in the sequence of my life experience because I built up enough emotional resilience to get through it without losing myself. A younger me would have dealt with it very differently. I am also thankful that I was not much older because of the health risks. I feel like I have been given a second chance, a chance to re-evaluate what is important to me, especially because I got it when I my first child was 6months old. Feeling very grateful to have an opportunity at this point in time to reassess. I was 15 going on 16 in the two weeks I spent in both the hospitals I was in. I feel like my onset was very different from most, luckily for me it was immediate. All at once I was just overcome by the most pure form of pain I have ever felt from my toes up to my waist. There was no delay, no ascending paralysis it happened all at once over the matter of a few hours. Thankfully it never affected my arms or above the waist (unfortunately that meant my ability to use the bathroom was affected as all that was paralyzed too, yay catheters!/s). I also had Transverse Myelitis going on at that same time which I believe is pretty common, although oddly enough I was the only one in PT that had both, all the other kids had one or the other and all of them ended up worse than me.\n\nWhat sucks is I am permanently affected so the rest of my life I will have to deal with pins and needles and small balancing issues but they are not that bad, at least I got all my strength and control back.", "Can you have CIDP without weakness symptoms? Is it possible to have CIDP without having any weakness or motor symptoms, and all reflex tests normal? Especially in early first 1-2 years? \n\nThe reason I ask is because I have been experiencing a bunch of symptoms that mostly started late October 2020 and have slowly progressed worse ever since 14 months ago.\n\n- Dull Burning Pain, pins &amp; needles, in my right throat, front right neck, right rear neck, right cheek, right temple, around right eye.\n\n- Right side of tongue feels stiff and sore sometimes. Especially when pins and needles are bad in my neck and face.\n\n- Random spot mid back also in right side which feels pins and needles too. But no pain.\n\n- Arches of Feet twitch and sometimes hurt like a muscle cramp. Right foot is worse but happens to both feet. (side note, for past 4+ years I did have toes that would feet that would cramp and contort my toes in a painful position. This significantly reduced after a vitamin D deficiency was found and corrected.)\n\nNote I have had blood teats for probably every autoimmune disease that is able to be tested by blood, and a MRI of both brain and cervical, and a full body CT. All of that stuff has been normally thankfully. \n\nSo pretty much everything has been done but spinal tap. Also is spinal tap the only way to 100% rule out?

Luckily he made a full physical recovery.\n\n\nMy mother swears that the illness has changed him, mentally. From a guy that used to write romatic poems he turned into someone who can barely write a single sentence without making 50 spelling mistakes. He is not mentally disabled by any means however it seems the illness has blunted his mental acuity. He is extremely forgetful, absent minded and inarticulate. Have you had any such experiences in the long term? Is there any research into long term effects of the illness?

Could you point the part of your comment that is supposed to be funny? Do you know if he has had his thyroid hormone levels checked? I got Hashimoto's thyroiditis along with GBS when I was 18. It can cause brainfog and depression.\n\nI have bad periods where I feel dumb and slow like I have brain damage. I also have a history of depression and anxiety prior to the GBS and hashimotos, so it is difficult to narrow down the cause. Man. This is so interesting. We are in the hospital right this moment and finished my wife\u2019s first day/course of IVIG (out of 5 days). Her condition is undiagnosed but doctors best guess is focal CIDP. Anyways when her symptoms started / got worse was right after her pregnancy, when she also got diagnosed with Hashimotos. She is had it under control by take a medicine daily. What is interesting to me is there are so many times I feel she is dumb/slow. Ofcourse I never tell her that :) . She does not have a history of anxiety/depression though. Sorry to hear that. I hope she recovers quickly. \n\nI had Bell's palsy for a few days, which progressed to Miller-fisher GBS. That was about 12 years ago. I think (hope) the thyroid issue is the only long term damage I have from GBS.\n\nI am waiting to see an internal specialist who I hope will help balance out my thyroid. I tried to get help when I was younger, but was only humored by most doctors. I forgot to mention that I also have an ADHD diagnosis, which muddies the waters even more. I have memory problems. They were already a concern because Alzheimer's is pretty prevalent on both sides of my family, but after GBS it is been a noticeable difference.  The regular life side of it is bad enough like not being able to remember if/what I have eaten, conversations, meeting people, directions, focus. But I have also been having trouble with spelling, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. \n\nI have started doing crosswords and other mental games to try to fight it, but they only help so much, y'know. It is scary... but my husband has been really patient and supportive through this whole thing. So that helps a lot. Interesting. I had MFS that progressed to full blown GBS 10 years ago. Last year my GI doctor did a thyroid panel and I have hypothyroidism. I still have not been to see a doctor for it. Reading about you all\u2019s is giving me a kick in the butt to actually do something.

Yesterday was rough. I was very sore head to toe and had the chills pretty bad.  I was also exhausted and slept for about 12 hours when I was finally able to fall asleep. Today I am still a little sore but pretty much back to normal.\n\nI had Guillain Barre about 19 years ago. Not a lot of lasting side effects so I dont know how relevant that was for some of you but thought I would share. Had my 2nd Pfizer shot yesterday. I feel horrible today, but I was expecting it. All the same symptoms with a splitting headache. Better days ahead. thanks for sharing any tingling/numbness in your extremities?  how about fever or skin crawling? Not OP, but I have slight tingling going on. Not going to lie, I got a little worried but I am 2 years out from my diagnosis so I have a little PTSD. I am sure everything will be fine. I had this and i was freaking out after my first shot. But after a day it was all good. I definitely had a fever and some numbness. but today I feel fine Yeah I feel great today I got Pfizer #2 almost two weeks ago, and it was a much easier experience than the first one. Sore arm of course, and little achiness and a headache on the first night, but that was pretty much it. Nothing even remotely worrying on the GBS front. after second shot? I will tell you in two weeks Similar here, second shot on a Monday, Tuesday was the worse, Wednesday felt far better except for a sore arm.\n\nGBS about 20 years ago omg twinsies", "Nerve tension - has anyone experienced this? I was diagnosed 3.5 years ago. I am back to walking and eating and working despite several residuals. One of them being what I think is nerve tension in my legs. Its like having extremely tight hamstrings, except its actually the nerve that is tight. When I try to sit down and stretch my hamstrings I have to stop at just a tiny stretch due to this weird nerve pain in the back of my knees/calves (very different from the pain you get from stretching a muscle). Forget the stretch, I cannot even sit on the floor without severely rounding my back. Sitting up tall involves a 90 degree angle at the hip joint. I can barely get to 120. I get the same sensation when I stretch my arms a specific way but my legs are the real issue.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? Have you been officially diagnosed with it? Have you had any success with 'neural flossing'? I am not sure to be honest what this sensation is and why you might have it. I am sorry you are dealing with this. I will say that my hamstrings are very very tight and stretching them takes lots of energy but it helps me reduce my leg pain a lot. I *think* I know the sensation you mean.  I am a runner now and do a lot of stretching.  My hamstrings in particular feel like they are filling with liquid when I stretch them right.  Not exactly, but that is the best I can describe it.  I always assumed this was true for everyone.  The stretch hat triggers it is sitting on the floor feet outstretched,  pull your toes back to you and start moving as far as you can to touch your toes.\n\nTry to improve your stretching as much as you can.  If you do not have physio or massage, maybe try yoga?  The older i get, the more I realize hat stretching is health.  :)", "Family History? I was curious about this community\u2019s experience with other autoimmune diseases. My family seems to have an abnormally high instance rate of autoimmune neurological disorders; my father and brother both having had GBS (my father\u2019s later developing into CIDP), my paternal grandmother, her sister, my cousin on that side, and now myself all having Multiple Sclerosis (one of my Grandmother\u2019s brothers may have had it as well, but I never knew her or her siblings and I cannot remember). Neither of these diseases are supposed to be hereditary, so I wanted to see if anyone else has a similar family background. My cousin was diagnosed with GBS about a year and a half after I had it. I checked with my neurologist, just to be safe, and she strongly advised that it is not hereditary. My grandpa had it too. It is said to not be hereditary but maybe there is not enough research to confirm that", "Home Fitness - Elliptical Trainer   Wow!!! Great innovative idea by your dad, it is better than not having one at all. Well guys. Making great progress", "My CIDP Story Hey everyone I am 24 year old male from England  and i got diagnosed with CIDP just over a year ago, I have currently relapsed. The reason I am posting this is to see if anyone can relate and just to get this off my chest really. It will probably be a long read so thanks to anyone who does read it or even comment.\n\nSo in October 2017 (which is the first time i can pinpoint a start of the symptoms) i went out with some mates to play football, first few minutes everything was fine then I started to push myself to run and put my foot through the ball and my legs just gave way from underneath me not all the time but just when i was trying to go at it 100% did not think a lot of it just thought probably need to go to the gym more often.\n\nFast forward a few weeks I am at work. I work nights in a supermarket so my job is stacking shelves. So I am putting stock on the shelves and I notice my left hand grip is weak, it is suddenly taking a lot of effort to take the plastic wrapping of the stock but again I do not really think about because overall I feel fine.\n\nHeading towards Christmas I am at work and I am down on my knees putting stock on the bottom shelf and i bring myself back up and as soon as I am upright i just fall and because I am working with someone so I just laugh it off. I work 6 hour shifts and before, during and after the shift I am just feeling shattered.\n\nHeading into the new year symptoms are still there and gradually getting worse, my legs are going from underneath me every now and then, my grip especially on my left hand is nonexistent struggling to even open a packet of crisps but i can still move around fine. I have booked a doctors appointment because I have been suffering with depression and anxiety for a few years and I thought I am going to speak to someone about it. A few days beforehand I am reading an article on a wrestling site and it is about a neck injury to a wrestler and how he is lost his grip and how very serious that can be so I get a bit worried and I mention it to my doctor he says he will refer me to a neurologist.\n\nAround about February 2018 my symptoms are progressively getting worse, barely any grip in both hands so I am occasionally dropping things, my legs are moving slower, walking up and down the stairs is way more challenging than it should be for a 23 year old and by the end of the month I decide to take time off work because I was not capable of doing my job. \n\nIn March 2018 I get my referral to a neurologist the only problem is i would have to wait 2 months for just a consultation, I was in a really bad way so the thought of waiting so long for just a consultation was scary. So I made probably the best decision I have ever made and went private, it cost just over \u00a31000 for consultation, scans and tests (I worked nights and weekends for 4 years which as a young adult you can save a bit of money that way). My neurologist puts me back on the nhs after initial test and scans.\n\nAbout a month later I got diagnosed with CIDP the only problem was getting treatment as the condition and treatment is so rare it is only available in a handful of regions and one of them is not Staffordshire which is where I live. My neurologist reffers me to a specialist in Birmingham which is about 50 miles away from where I live. We go over to see him and he sets me up for treatment the following week. By this time I am in such a bad way, can barely walk, struggling to wash and bathe myself, need help getting dressed as I cannot lift my arms above my head and had to stop driving.\n\nSo me and my mother pack our bags and make our way to Birmingham for a week. I go in for treatment which is IVIG, I had 125g over 5 days. After the final day we head back home and I felt great, it really is amazing what modern medicine can do. I was booked in for more treatment every month for the following 3 months, when I saw my specialist he said I would need treatment for the rest of my life barring any remission periods which I did not realise and was a bit tough to take.\n\nOver the course of the past 12 month's (except for a blip in October 2018) i progressed very well (returned to work in July 2018), with my specialist knocking down the dosage every 3 months and saying that a remission period could be on the horizon. In April 2019 he knocked the dosage down to 80g a month, it did not work well as a few weeks later my symptoms started to come back not as severe as last time but still enough for me to notice. My specialist confirmed it is a relapse and has since upped the dosage (120g every month) . I have responded to the treatment just not as well as when I first started which is a bit worrying. I am currently off work again and do not really know when I will be back the past month or so has been really depressing in all honesty and has me worrying for the future. \n\nWith all that said thanks to anyone who took their  time to read all that and I welcome any questions. Hang in there, it is a rough road but you will get through it. If you have not heard of the gbs/cidp foundation get in contact with them, they have lots of resources available. gbs-cidp.org Thanks i will look into it. It helped me a lot. I had gbs back in 2015-16 and just getting in contact with people who have gone through it helps. I dont know how much presence they have in Europe but I do know the worlds best neurologists that specialize in cidp/gbs are located in europe. The neurologists i see are brilliant. How are you coping with your condition now and how old were you when you were diagnosed? if you do not mind me askinh Just want to say I am sorry it took so long for you to see a neurologist. When I first had onset I collapsed and went to the E.R, got IVIG and recovered rapidly. However, it kept coming back and every time I would go back to the hospital and get IVIG, the effects were not as good, and they were not lasting as long. It had progressed to the point where IVIG was practically doing nothing, and would only give me a minor strength boost for 5 days, and then I would get more. That is when they started Rituximab infusions, to help calm the immune system, and help IVIG work better. I spent three months in the hospital, the first two months there I could barely stand for 5 seconds. As they were preparing me for life in a wheelchair, in the third month, I started seeing huge results (they had told me rituximab would take about two months to work). During the last month there with amazing progress week by week, I walked out of the hospital (which seemed impossible one month prior). I guess what I am trying to say is, neurological disorders are scary, but there is plenty of treatment options; even when IVIG fails. There is IV steroids, pill steroids, and plenty of different immunosuppressants. One thing I learned after dealing with neurologists for about 6 months: do not listen to them about the prognosis. I was told by 2 neurologists it probably would not get any better than when I could barely stand, was wheelchair bound, and struggled to open a bottle. A month later I was walking. Now, two months later, I am back in the gym hitting upper body and I let PT workout my legs since they got the worst of the weakness. Everybody\u2019s responses to treatment vary widely, but no one can predict how things will be in the future. I hope this gave you some comfort, and do not stress the efficacy of IVIG. If you are not getting progressively better, please urge your neurologist to move on to the next step, instead of getting worse while appointments are months away. Good to hear you are recovering well, is it CIDP you have or another condition? Thank you! Yup it is CIDP. How old were when you were diagnosed? Started when I was 18 back in November of last year. Wow younger than me, how often do you have treatment? While we were in the hospital we would pretty much just wait for the weakness to come back, and then we would infuse. After I walked out of the hospital, they set it up so I would get treatment every 12 days. Which is kind of crazy. However, I was improving week by week because of the immunosuppressant Rituximab, and was no longer getting a boost from the IVIG. I then saw a neuromuscular specialist about a month ago, and he wanted to cut the dose in half and push it to 14 days. Then he calls us and says there is an IVIG shortage, and they need to save the outpatient IVIG for people who really need it. He said he is confident that the rituximab infusion I got around February of this year has been doing all the work. Obviously that is just convenient for him to say, but there is some truth to it given my rapid recovery after IVIG failed, and the fact that I do not get a boost from the IVIG anymore, and the improvement week by week that is not from IVIG. So he canceled it, and it is been almost three weeks since my last IVIG and I feel great. No decline yet. So who knows when I need it. Best case scenario is that the rituximab gets rid of the need for IVIG, so we have got our fingers crossed for that. Now, the rituximab infusion is 2 doses, 1 dose every two weeks. Not too sure how much they actually pump in you, but that is the how long it takes. And you get that every 6-8 months. He said they will do my next one in August. So it is actually much more convenient than monthly infusions of IVIG. 28-29 when I was diagnosed. Spent my birthday in the hospital. At first it was just dealing with the physical side of it, after the symptoms went away and I was repairing my nerves, I did a lot of physical therapy with a personal trainer. Took an assortment of supplements and meds that helped with pain, tingling. I think now it has affected me more in a psychological sense than anything else. It pretty much turned me into a hypochondriac because of the experience of knowing something was wrong but doctors not believing me and then going through the whole paralysis, it really messed me up. Made me not be able to trust my body and feel like anything could happen at any moment and I would be a goner. I have been doing a lot of therapy though and working through that trauma. I feel like I have been doing better than I have in awhile. But besides that I just try to stay as active and positive as I can. I know the feeling, I sometimes haves this dread of waking up and not being able to move properly. Keep up the fight brother. Life is really a shit show and we want it all and then some but cannot ever get it. But in the meantime we see the vapid celebs, the arrogant ceos, the douche sports stars. And on top of it we get stuck with one of the rarest, worst diseases out there. Depression is no joke, but I hope you are able to get some help. My perspective is always to try to remember that some people have way worse lives and count your blessings. Idk if anything I am saying will help, but thanks for sharing your story, it helped me!", "Dad diagnosed with GBS Hey all, \nMy dad was (very recently) diagnosed with GBS after a really bad bacterial infection. He had numbness in his legs and struggled to walk longer distances.\n\nHe is in the hospital now being treated with plasmapherisis. Apparently they caught it \u201cearly\u201d because he still has sensation and his arms are just affected a little bit. He will receive several doses of plasma. My question is, is there really such thing as catching it early? Does being treated early mean that the disease may not spread upwards? Or does every patient always become almost completely paralyzed. I am really freaked out and keep reading horror stories from all kinds of sources, scared that he will be hospitalized for months.\nThanks In short, yes.   The immune system is attacking the nervous system and will do a lot more damage if not treated early.  It can be stopped before you become too weak to stand but that would require immediate diagnosis which does not always happen.\n\nYour dad's experience sounds similar to my own. I let it progress a little too long before i was hospitalized and was not only paralyzed but would have struggled to crush a coke can with my hands.  It was scary for everybody but with immunoglobulin treatment I was learning to walk again within a few days and was home within a week. After a few months of physical therapy I was able to do most of the activities I had done previously with only a few lasting side effects.\n\nI am not sure what factors are involved when inpatient treatment is required for months but I would imagine it is related to how resistant your body is to the treatment and how much damage it does before recovery.  By the sounds of it, your dad should come back from it sooner than later.\n\nHoping for a quick/easy recovery. It is interesting because most places I have read have said someone may be in bed for months, which seemed like a lot. Thanks for your comment It all depends. They caught mine \"early\", and I was in and out of the hospital (including rehab hospital) within a month. It also is really up to your dad. The harder you work on your PT and OT, the better off you will be. Tell him to push himself as much as he can when it gets to that time. They did not catch mine until I was on life support and could not even breathe on my own.  As a result I was 97 days in the hospital and have some permanent nerve damage to my feet.  So from just two stories you can see how different it can be. It makes a huge difference catching it early! Your dad is on his way to a speedy recovery!  All the best to him. In my personal experience yes. They caught mine early and while I was paralyzed from the waist down it did only stop at my waist. I was fortunate enough to have recovered quickly and was walking within a matter of months again. Although there is still residual numbness in my legs and feet, especially my toes. Hoping for a quick recovery for your dad, I know it may sound stupid but a positive mindset really helps! Yes, it is amazing to me to read these new stories. I had it back in the 80s. They just gave me regular spinal taps to make sure it was not something worse and basically let my body deal with it. It is amazing how far treatment has come for such a rare issue! Did the treatments work immediately or did it take some time? Or do you know if the disease can progress even with treatment than plateau", "Ambulance ride to hospital and sent home presenting with classic GBS Doc says the words GBS but... Input appreciated. Tldr;  Straight Up GBS symptoms CT scans and Xrays clean, Labs Clean except for a couple of things and they were minor.  Doc says GBS but I do not have enough to admit you so your going home with generic muscle weakness diagnoses, come back if it gets worse..... it is.  I forgot to mention in the main also trouble swallowing to a small extent.\n\nThis just happened with me, Weakness started 48 hours ago, already have nerve injury in back and left leg, so live with pins and needles on left foot, or rather when you have been outside too long in the winter and you freeze your hands and when they start to warm up again you get that excruciating pain, and significant muscle weakness in right leg that was not there before and left leg more so than usual, so Pain in both legs that is not usual. So Both feet painful pins and needles and muscle aches both legs not usual strange but hey I have got to wait for my disc to fuse together naturally anyway because I am not a candidate for spinal surgery so I am used to all sort of weird crap. that sums up Saturday.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSunday wake up 3:30 Am, reach over for glass of water as soo as it slide off the edge of my nightstand and its full weight is then on my hand it shoots right out of it and hits the floor. Have bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, assume it was that go to reach down and try to pick it up Ow  OW OW OW what the jeebus is going on sharp ache? if there is such a thing in the muscles in my arms ok maybe i was sleeping on it.  Reach for glass its like its glued to the floor. Ok something is up try and get back on bed arms barely working, legs are 50% at best right now on a good day.  Wind up face first on the floor....  Ok wake up wife, take my pain meds well two because screw whatever dumpster fire my body  has created.  A good dose of oxy should clear this right up anything that survives 60 mg warrants some attention. I am on it daily anyway for a l5 S1 injury,  does not make a difference. Ok well lets just go ahead and start throwing a little of everything at it, valium, another oxy, 800 more mgs gabapentin, Flexeril, all i wind up with is a dry mouth so bad its like glue. Oh and throw in a side of difficulty swallowing.  \n\nOk time to take this seriously, have a medical background. Know what GBS is and that is its auto immune but that is about it. I more know how to treat a sucking chest wound in the field with a piece of plastic a pen tube and some tape if I am out of 19 gauge needles.   Fire up the interwebs, hit up a trusted symptom checker pop everything in:  Strong probability of GBS, yeah whatever I must have jacked up when entering everything being tired and in pain and the screen keeps getting blurry and I have always had 20/20 vision everything else is broken but, that has always been 100%, including medications etc, this is a gold standard symptom checker. Spend 20 minutes re doing it double check everything, get same result... Ok must be a glitch in the database or something.  Going to next one, same result again.... ok well then start to consider possibility but no way, i would have hit the lottery already if I had those odds.  Also kind of killing time, drinking a couple of electrolyte drinks i keep around because I always keep them on hand for when I cant hardly eat or drink due to a digestive issue. Check third symptom check making sure i am being totally 1000% un biased and answering accurately and honestly SAME... Still no improvement actually getting worse.  oh and ive taken my temp about 14 times because I keep sweating etc no temperature. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarting to get scared,  make a plan with the wife tell her what i know and what is about to happen, and that I am going to call the insurance co advice line and talk to one of their on call nurses, one to confirm what I am starting to suspect. Talk to nurse explain symptoms like 47 times, not really but a lot of double checking and a couple triple. She tells me I need to hang up the phone and call 911 which already knew was coming, already had bags packed with the metric ton of stuff I have to carry around. Ambulance picks me up they do a 12 lead in the driveway, all good get to hospital, immediately get two cat scans 3 sets of x rays and half my bodyweight in blood.  Talk to doc , doc says I cant find anything wrong like literally I on paper I am, healthier than I should be to be totally honest other than I am under weight,\n\n I had a chest infection about 3-4 weeks ago and my chronic pain has been pretty bad so have not been eating much and pretty stressed out cause extreme chronic pain takes a toll on your body.  Doc says he is going to discharge me, I am kind of going ok well all y labs were good, imaging nothing changed from the last time i had imaging done a few months ago. But hey Im not the doc and he is a good dude, I have seen him a few times.  He almost makes it to the door and asks if I have been sick at all, I ask like how long and he is just like whenever sooo I tell him well I have this rash, but other than that diarrhea about 12-14 days ago completely forgetting the upper respiratory infection because I just get them semi frequently.  He says you it kind of sounds like GBS but I do not have anything to hospitalize you on because your not having trouble breathing to technically your stable  but its more of a diagnosis of omission than anything follow up with your pcp and see about getting into neuro also but come back if you start having trouble breathing...   So now im home, even my fingers feel tired and heavy and hurt. a kid running through the house 50 feet away seems to cause more pain. And even my discharge paperwork  basically says well you probably have this but we cant say that for sure so were going to say its generic muscle weakness more or less of a unknown cause.\n\nAnd that is how I wound up here, typing even drains the life out of me adn hurts...  I can already tell you that I am headed back to the Hospital by the end of the day tomorrow if this keeps getting this bad this fast. I may have had some fatigue Friday afternoon / evening  but this went from feet up, Pain between shoulder Blades throbbing outwardly till you hit the shoulder and the joints hurts.  I am hoping its wrong on this but I guess ill just have to follow up with my pcp in a week when I have a appointment.  I just am not sure what to make of all this  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny Input would be greatly appreciated and if you took the time to read this wall of text my sincerest thanks. So you need to go to the hospital ASAP. Not tomorrow, now. You also need to request a lumbar puncture. I am honestly astounded they did not do one when you went in originally, even though the doctor thinks it is GBS. \n\nI am so sorry about your situation. This seems all to common; patient goes in, gets turned away even though they have all the symptoms, and then are admitted but it is way worse. \n\nBest of luck and I hope you get care ASAP &gt; This seems all to common; patient goes in, gets turned away even though they have all the symptoms, and then are admitted but it is way worse.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Best of luck and I hope you get care ASAP\n\nYeah, I have quite a bit of medical background and the more I have read up on this  I am seriously considering going to a different hospital, I happen to have three within 30 minutes of here but the 1st I went to was the best out of the three, \n\nOption 1 back to same hospital as there will be different doc on duty\n\nOption 2 rural county hospital\n\nOption  3 Rural county hospital different direction \n\nOption 4 1.5 hours away Large well known hospital with level 1 trauma unit the works, however less beds and vents available and higher patient load with more chance of covid transmission,  which I have not had my booster shot and I am high risk soooo.... \n\n Yes I know none of this constitutes medical advice cya just looking for unbiased input with the given info.  Also monitoring respirations and sp02 sats  if my respirations drop at all ill be calling 911 This 100%. Cannot believe they did not suggest an LP in the first place. I was lucky I guess. They admitted me pretty early in the process but I went downhill super quick. 24 hours from mild numbness to basically paraplegic.  The good news is once you get the LP the diagnosis is pretty straightforward and they should start treatment. Other than them trying to kill me with plasmapheresis and then switching to IVIG, I responded quickly to treatment. If you start feeling pain request gabapentin, it helped me a lot. And do not be surprised if you start having insomnia. I got out of the hospital about 3 weeks ago and I am still not sleeping. Sounds about standard for most emergency rooms unfortunately. The standard of care in the United States is shit. I would go with option 4. Larger hospital 1.5 miles away. Do not go back to same crappy hospital that discharged you, that happened to me, too. Less than 24 hours later, by the time I got to the second hospital, my breathing became labored. I ended up getting intubated. They should do lumbar puncture, and once definite diagnosis is made, you will need IVIG treatment, and, if like me, it does not work due to getting diagnosed late, you will need plasmapheresis. One day my legs started to collapse out from under me, and within 48 hours I could not move my fingers. I was in hospital for 1 month and inpatient rehab hospital for another month. I did fully recover, besides chronic fatigue and some aches and pains. Best of luck! I am sorry you are going through this.  The way they run some of these ER\u2019s is ridiculous.  Please get help soon and be well. What happened with your plasmapheresis? Well at first they missed a dose of lisinopril and I crashed when my BP dropped to 50/30 and I woke up choking on my own vomit. Wheeled me into my room and I crashed again and had a heck of a time trying to get another IV in me to give me fluids to get my BP back up. 2nd treatment was non-eventful but the third they did not wait a day like they said they were supposed to and I started feeling to the same way as the first time. So they did not finish. Got to the room and they called another crash cart because I could not stay awake and my BP was dropping again. I guess maybe I was allergic to the fluid they use to replace my plasma, not sure. But they decided the PLEX was not for me and switched me to IVIG. That is terrible.  Glad you were able to switch to IVIG. Well I survived and have a heckuva story to tell. It absolutely sucked at the time though I will admit. This is awful. A lumbar puncture is main diagnosis for GBS! demyelinating variants... Also, the sensitivity of the test is poor until the patient already has severe symptoms. First, let us hope it is not GBS! Is there anything odd in your face-have your spouse do analysis; also any coordination or balance issues-you indicated dropping things but what about walking a straight line, one foot in front of the other? Test if you can stare at your spouse\u2019s finger held just about arm\u2019s length out in front of you, with your arm extended straight out to your side, pointer finger extended, then in one continuous movement, touch her finger keeping your arm straight and eyes on the finger,and then directly to the tip of your nose. Have her move her finger to different places in front of you barely in your reach.  This loss of brain to nerve to muscle motor skill is a big test of nerve conduction. Also test your reflexes at the knee and elbow. \n\nGo to the biggest possible hospital ER, complain of immense pain and numbness to the feet and legs/hands and arms and creeping inward. Language to use to help get GBS diagnosis is severe respiratory illness within last month; peripheral (outside in) and bilateral pain/numbness/paralysis (even if weakness is in one side more than other sounds like it is still bilateral). Be sure to not down play ANY symptoms, if they ask anything SAY YES, as long as it aligns with bilateral and peripheral. Suggest an electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction study and test your reflexes (huge indicator of GBS because it effects tendons\u2014this is when our ER doc was like WTF). Push for a lumbar puncture (the risk factor will not allow it to be first test done, that is why start with EMG). The GBS indicators from the LP are that your white cell count is normal (indicating no or minimal infection) but your protein counts are abnormally high (indicating bad things going on in your central nervous system). They were able to tell this with my husband at a suburban small hospital within 30 min. of LP. \n\nI just went through a crash course in GBS with my husband who went all the way to fully paralyzed including face but not respiratory in 2 weeks after respiratory illness and is climbing back in a miraculous fashion now after IVIg. Took one urgent care and two ER visits within his first week of symptoms. 2nd ER doc witnessed the decline to paralyzed during the exam. Thank goodness for her astuteness. Whatever happens, good luck to you! So crazy! Hubs is going through GBS, today is day 29 of symptoms and 22 in hospital. Diagnosed on day 4 in hospital, started on IVIg within hour of diagnosis; had reaction to IVIg, ended up with hemolytic anemia (literally blood destruction; hemoglobin dropped to 6!) and getting transfusions. He is type AB and apparently while ALL things GBS are rare, as are reactions to IVIg, this is the most common with his blood type than any other. Good thing is that IVIg still is able to work it is magic while his body went through the anemic crash. He transferred to a rehab facility once his hemoglobin stabilized to 9 on day 16. After a week there he is coming home tomorrow and into all day rehab. Still suffering immense pain, though it seems to get to a max of 8-9 versus skyrocketing past 10. I can tell he is very anxious to come home to our busy house as am I, so any tips welcomed! Looks like option 4 is 1.5 **hours** away, not miles. I would honestly go back to the same hospital and request a lumbar puncture. But you are right with everything else; OP needs to act quick. I completely understand the extreme desire to get out of the hospital. I had the opportunity to do some intense inpatient rehab but chose not to so I could go home (it required me to stay in the hospital). I was so tired of that hospital bed, the food, and the being woken up every two hours. Your husband\u2019s situation makes mine seem like a cake walk. I hope they have him on gabapentin for the pain. It helped with mine immensely. \n\nAs for tips\u2026. when he is having a bad day just keep reminding him that this is temporary and he will eventually get through it. My wife kept doing this and she gave the strength to get through the bad days when I needed it most.  And one last tip for you. Take time for yourself. You need to recharge too. Take a half an hour to watch a tv show, drink a glass of wine, go for a walk\u2026 whatever your brain needs. You cannot play constant caregiver when you are completely burnt out. \n\nSending healing thoughts to the both of you. Good luck and speedy recovery. My first trip to the ER was rewarded with hydrocodone and muscle relaxers. I tried to explain I am not a tweaker looking for drugs. The next day a friend in an independent lab ran some bloodwork for me. I took that with me to the hospital- I was there for just over 2 weeks\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. I hope you fare well through this \ud83d\ude4f Hahaha they tried that with me too and I am a chronic pain patient and I pointed at my bag and said I have probably got more drugs in there than you have access to for half the ER\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05. All rx'd except the medical mj, well technically it is prescribed but.....  \n\nDoc asked to see me meds(im an Irish pirate now? Is not that a leprechaun? Or would a dwarf Irish pirate be a leprechaun? Off topic and rambling I know) , I am in a illegal state but I have noticed a thousand percent over the years that 99% of the time if you are completely honest with them they are way nicer. Unfortunately the way our health care and laws are set up it docs assume the patient is lying, so just coming out and saying yeah I use medical mj from across the way shows that you have nothing to hide.  \n\nAnyway the first doc I saw the first trip is a really good one and has told me to return immediately if things progress at all, which they have not just kind of stalled, if there is no change by Saturday I am going back in to see him, and we discussed that he will \"find\" a reason to admit me which will not be that hard as I have got about 47 different things wrong with me.\n\n Still not a hundred percent what is going on been checked out twice now, cannot find any reasonable explanation for my symptoms and the spinal tap is not going to work on me as I am going to have elavated csf anyway from other things.  Pretty much all the markers that they could use on me will not work due to other disease/injury.   For now wearing a breathing monitor at night I hardly sleep anyway.\n\nStupid question anyone diagnosed with gbs did it cause memory issues, and mental fog?  Bouts of sweating out of nowhere feeling like I have got a 108 degree fever but your completely normal?  \n\nAlso arms and hands are still weak but not quite as bad.  Legs are still fubar but catscan show significant nerve impingement from a old injury that is just going to keep getting worse so hard to tell there. A drug addicted leprechaun or a small drug induced pirate? Either is a win in my book\ud83d\ude02. I think we all have pretty crazy stories, and obviously you have taken a positive approach to view yours. Brain fog?? I am not sure, I cannot clearly remember \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.... I see what you did there :)", "Partner possibly has GB. Any advice on how best to support him is appreciated Hi all,\n\nRecently my partner of 7 years began losing sensations in his hands and feet, we thought nothing of it and continued about our business.  The following day his entire torso was numb and his hands and feet were worse.  He described the feeling as pins and needles.  We grew increasingly more concerned and ended up in the ER for MRI\u2019s all night.  They gave us a promise that a neurologist would be able to see him right away on Monday (this occurred through Saturday night).  They were unable to diagnose the issue but most likely ruled out MS.  \n\nMonday came and the neurologist was unable to see him until next Wednesday.  At this point his symptoms in hands and feet had worsened, and it had spread to his legs.  On Tuesday we decided to go to a different ER, and they were able to bring a neurologist in.  They said it is possibly GB, and that with time his symptoms would worsen, but they would grow until a plateau stage, at which point they would start to get better.\n\nIn the meantime we have been cutting out our vigorous exercise routine, and trying to ice his back just in case this is from some sort of inflammation (as nothing is certain).\n\nI personally am trying my best to support him through this.  It hurts my heart when he wakes up and each day tells me it is a little worse.  I want to find a balance between him being independent and feeling like he can rely on me without me being overbearing.  I mostly just try my best to be there emotionally, be as understanding as possible (even though I know I cannot hope to understand) and let him know I love him very much.  We have been holding hands lately because the sensation of touch in these numb areas is uncomfortable.  \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how I can best help? I really appreciate any advice I can get, thank you so much for any help you can provide. So sorry about you and your partner's situation.\n\nI was diagnosed with AIDP, then Miller-Fisher, in February last year. Lost complete control of my body from the waist down, was on a breathing tube, the works. It was the hardest thing I have ever gone through. Thankfully, I had my wife by my side the entire time, being extremely supportive.\n\nHere are a few things that helped me:\n1) Be patient. This is not something that goes away overnight. If it is GBS, both you and him have a long road of treatment and recovery ahead. It will be frustrating and painful for both of you, but you need to be patient. His emotions will probably go a little haywire. If you can, I suggest he visits a psychologist during treatment that specializes in neurological disorders. During my month in the hospital they had a psychologist there and it helped tremendously.\n\n2) Celebrate the wins. You need to feel like you are moving forward. For me, my first win was being able to sit up on my own (I lost a lot of movement in my arms and torso, too). Whatever it is, make sure you celebrate. Whether it is a meal, or some sort of purchase to treat yourselves, celebrate.\n\n3) Have goals. That is for both you and him. Like before, you need to make sure you keep moving. This thing literally paralyzes you, so any way you can feel like you are progressing towards something helps.\n\n4) Be an advocate. Depending if he is comfortable with it, you need to be an advocate. You need to discuss things; how he is feeling, what medication he is taking, how treatment is affecting him. You need to know the ins and outs, because there could be a time where he cannot speak for himself. For me, it was when the nurses in the neuro ward kept on giving me oxycodone when I was trying to tell them not to. My wife had to stop them. You need to ask questions, and be his voice when he cannot be.\n\n5) Make sure he knows you love him no matter what. If it gets to the point where he is hospitalized he will feel lonely. Nobody likes being alone in a hospital room for weeks. But as long as he knows that you are there, that you love him, and that you will still love him, it makes it worth it. For me it gave me purpose. My whole goal in rehab was to be able to leave so I could go to bed next to my wife again.\n\nYou both will get through this. It is hard, it is exhausting, it is painful. But as long as he knows you are there for him then it will be okay. I wish you both the best of luck, and please do not hesitate to ask me any other questions. Assuming neurologist confirms it is GBS and it is severe enough, there are ways to help - IVIG or plasmaphoresis. Antibody tests and spinal tap can confirm diagnosis. Did the hospital start the treatment yet? They have decided to hold off on the spinal tap until the following appointment and no treatment has began as they were worried about blood clots Thank you so much.  This is exactly the type of advice I was looking for and I will take each of these points to heart.  Currently I do not have any other questions but this is a great place to start.  So thankful to hear you recovered yourself - thanks for allowing me to turn to this community even though there is no sure diagnosis. Good luck! Hope you will recover soon!!\nP.S. Spinal tap sucks - worst headache of my life for days Ugh I had to use a cane after mine for a bit. Do NOT go to a teaching hospital - the guy trying mine failed for 7 pokes over 2.5 sessions before they called in a specialist. It was hellish. The person who did mine was in training, and it was the first they had done. I found out afterwards. Fortunately she nailed it, but the headache was decent.", "Boyfriend with prior gbs nervous about covid vaccines. Hey all! I will try to keep this as short as I can. So my boyfriend (29) got the Miller fisher variant of gbs when he was 20. He ended up hospitalized for a while and had to relearn to walk and re train his eyes to focus. We were not together at the time and he does not like to talk about it much so I do not really have more information. He had not seen a doctor in several years due to severe anxiety and has his first Pfizer vaccine scheduled tomorrow. He is incredibly anxious that he will have a terrible reaction. I told him that if he is not comfortable getting the vaccine right now to wait. We have hopes to travel out of the country if the borders open later on in the summer and that is why he feels that he needs to get the vaccine. I guess I am just looking to read other peoples reactions/experiences so I can help him make his decision and also help to calm him down. Got CIDP in 2019 after the flu shot (similar to gbs) and was also nervous about the shot (I still have pain in my neck from when this happend). My neurologist flat out told me that me getting covid is far worse than not getting the shot at this point.\n\nI have had both shots now(pfizer)..1st shot caused shoulder pain, 2nd shot caused headaches, small fever, chills, and some light tingling (the tingling did make me a little nervous lol). \n\nIt is been almost 2 weeks now and I feel completely fine so far. I can understand why he is nervous but you just need to sit back and think about the positives of once you get the shot done. My dad had the Miller Fisher variant and spent quite some time in ICU, hospital, and rehab centers. His doc said to get it as COVID would probably be worse or kill him. He got both his Pfizer shots and did not really have any issues other than sore shoulder.  I understand the worry but chances are he will be fine. I had GBS in late 2017-2018, spent about a month in 3 different hospitals including the rehabilitation hospital. I am also 26 weeks pregnant currently. I TOTALLY get the hesitancy.\n\nI talked to my neuro at the beginning of COVID and she told me whenever there was a vaccine, get it as soon as I could. Recovering from GBS is a \"cake walk\" compared to recovering from COVID, according to her. My OB said the same thing, that even if worst case scenario came from the vaccine, it would pale in comparison to getting COVID.\n\nI got my first Moderna shot in April and I go next week to get my second shot. My bf got Moderna also earlier this year, and after his second shot he had a fever and chills, and slept for like 12 hours, but then he was totally fine. He even said the arm pain was not as bad the second shot.\n\nI was extremely nervous before my first shot. I was worried about GBS, worried about my baby. But then I remembered when I had GBS and when I was on a ventilator for 3 days, and then it was like *duh, I would MUCH rather get the vaccine than be on a ventilator again because I got COVID.*\n\nI think it is really normal to be anxious, especially because everything is so new. But COVID is way worse than GBS, long COVID is a real thing. He should see if he can do telehealth with his doctor, that might help?\n\nSend him my best wishes, and I am here if you need to talk! Your boyfriend sounds like me. I am on the fence about the vaccine and still have not scheduled the appointment. I did not get GBS from a vaccine though but doing a risk analysis is not getting me anywhere. I had GBS in 2015, spent time in the hospital, 6+ months relearning to walk, still have some residual effects. 100% get the hesitancy. \n\nI got my first dose of Pfizer the beginning of April and 2nd dose 2 weeks ago. I had a migraine the day after (not unusual for me tbh) but other than that have not had any side effects. I get neuropathy on and off generally but it has not been any different than normal. I was really stressed making the decision, but I am definitely relieved. We will see at the 6 week mark, but so far so good. This is about the same experience I had, except I had some tingling after the first shot. I had GBS in 2014, took me the better part of a year to be somewhat normal from a mobility standpoint. I still have issues with my left leg and ankle and randomly fall. \n\n\nI actually contracted COVID19 in April Last year. It was a mild case. I had not felt quite 'right' since I had it.  Lots of fatigue and even worse brain fog than the GBS left me with. \n\n\n\nStrangely enough about 5 days after my second shot I actually felt 400% better than I have in a year. I must have been experiencing a 'long hauler' symptom I did not realize that somehow my body corrected after being alerted by the shots. Who the hell knows, this virus is a mean MF. \n\n\n\nAnyway OP tell your BF to get the shot as, brain hemorrhages, , psychosis/mental issues, severe arthritis, blood clotting, and that annoying death thing are all worse than GBS. I have had my second moderna shot for over a month now. GBS \\~7 years ago. All is fine so far. *Ironically*, very little reaction to the vaccines. I have been telling people it is because my immune system never works right but I probably just got lucky. I had Miller Fisher in 2019. I am almost two weeks out from my second shot of the Moderna vaccine. Did not have any trouble with either shot other than a sore arm. Everyone is different I am sure but hopefully this helps a little. I was encouraged by my family doctor to get the vaccine. Had some issues the 1st 3 weeks, but that is all cleared up. Rather have a little discomfort than get COVID i had GBS on 2004, got 2 shots of SINOVAC. its a calculated risk. I am a teacher, so i took the risk because the chance of getting COVID for me is very real. I had zero issues. Hey there! I got Miller fisher 2 years ago at 24. I am 26 now and I got the first dose of Pfizer two weeks ago. I had some fatigue but nothing crazy. Small bruise on my arm as well. I completely understand how he feels, but he should be fine! If he wants to chat feel free to PM me. I got Miller Fisher. No problems after Pfizer vaccination. After talking with my neurologist, we determined that the effects of covid would be far worse than anything I would experience with a vaccine. \nI already know what to look for if my GBS symptoms come back, and I know what to do if that happens. \n\nI understand the hesitation, and I recommend he talk to his neurologist, as well. I heard that the stronger the reaction, the stronger the immune response. So, it is good that you did not feel too much, because it means your immune system is not overreacting If he does not want to get it, it is ok. GBS is acute illness in which the acute phase lasts 2-6 weeks, followed by a plateau phase and then followed by a recovery phase - each phase varies depending on The individual \n\nUnfortunately depending on the severity of the acute phase this is what leaves us GBS survivors with our residuals.\n\nYour boyfriend is 9 year post GBS so the risk would be the same as a person who had never had GBS going to get the vaccine.\n\nI have been post GBS and the plateau phase possibly for 6 months, maybe less, and now in the recovery phase. I have had both Pfizer vaccines as I work in the Healthcare sector and I am absolutely fine.\n\nI experienced localised pain in the shoulder after 1st vaccine and flu like symptoms (completely normal and in line with non GBS vaccines patients and their experiences) and did not really feel much of anything after the second.\n\nI understand your boyfriend's nervousness but it most definitely better to have the vaccine - unfortunately Covid is going to be with us like Flu, where they will be yearly booster shots to help our populations from having waves if covid ripping through them. Hiya! I was diagnosed with GBS in November 2020 and got out of hospital a month ago. I am still struggling a lot with GBS symptoms and learning to walk again. I got the COVID vaccine yesterday (my neurologist advised Pfizer because the other vaccines have a higher risk of blood clots and I am fairly immobile / take meds which already have that risk). I feel absolutely fine so far and have had no extra issues! The tingling and pins and needles have been more present in the past day but that often happens so I cannot say whether that is related. I will let you know if anything changes but if your boyfriend has been recommended to have it I would definitely encourage him too! I had COVID whilst battling GBS and it led to me having a relapse. Best wishes x I had Guillain-Barre in 2014. My illness was not triggered by a vaccine. I had the Covid vaccine (sorry, do not remember which one) in February/March and had the same types of side effects as most of my co-workers. I completely understand what your bf is going through. My case was a severe one, which paralysed my whole body, except for a part of the right side of my face, in less than 24 hours. I could not breathe, I could not talk, I lost my hearing, and I was in a lot of pain. I only could communicate by means of blinking my right eye. I wanted to die. I am sorry to say what I am going to say, maybe my experience was too bad, or maybe I am too weak, but if I had to choose between the possibility of having covid and the possibility of another GBS, I would take covid chances. Which is not to say that I am against vaccinations in general or against this particular one, but if I suspected, even a little, that GBS could happen again because of that vaccination, I would not take that risk. This was my experience and it is also how I feel. The only thing that I have to push back is the idea of getting GBS from a Covid infection. Can you imagine going through what we went through AND Covid? I hate this. I genuinely have no idea what to do and basically no data to go by. I had the Miller-Fischer form of GBS in 2006 when I was 21.  I had a very similar experience to him and totally understand his fears.  I received my second dose of Pfizer 2 weeks ago.  My side effects from it were very similar to most people's and only lasted about 36 hours.  I only started getting vaccines again a few years ago when I was pregnant with my son when I got a tdap booster to prevent him getting whooping cough.  I have not relapsed or had any issues.  Hope hearing my experience helps. Another Miller Fisher (2010), 2nd Pfizer was 3 weeks ago.  side effects were mild.  Hopefully he got through the event without stressing too much, and is planning to follow through with the 2nd shot (if he got the first). Why Did MOD edit my post to remove impotence?", "Has anyone taken alpha lipoic acid (ALA)/had infusions for nerve regrowth Has anyone taken alpha lipoic acid (ALA)/had infusions? If so, did you notice an acceleration in nerve regeneration? I read that it is a recommended treatment for neuropathy in Germany. My neuro has me on a high dose supplement of it since 2018. I personally do not know if it is helped. I have also read some articles similar to what you are mentioning. For me, I do not think it is had any kind of huge or life changing impact, but I continue to take it since it cannot hurt. I feel exactly the same way. Thank you! I am having my first transfusion on Friday. I will report back if I notice any changes I was in too bad of shape to know if it did much when I tried it. If you are interested in supplements, I would say to also look into lion's mane mushroom extract.\n\n\n\n&gt;Lion\u2019s Mane is an edible medicinal mushroom with some distinct properties. It contains a range of over 30 bioactive compounds known as hericenones (in the fruiting body) and erinacines (in the mycelium). These unique compounds have shown the potential to stimulate the production of the so-called Nerve Growth factor (NGF).\n\n&gt;Another distinct property is that these compounds appear to support and speed up formation of the myelin\nsheath (which protects nerve fibers and improves their 'processing speed'). The process of 'myelination' is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system but declines with age.\n\nThe research is not super clear but from what I gather from the post is that you want an alcohol extract of the lion's mane. According to the post, the only company that offers an alcohol extract WITH 3rd party testing is Oriveda. Their product is actually 2 products in one. You get capsules of the alcohol extract, and you get capsules of the standard water extract, and the 2 combined may be more effective than either or.\n\nHowever, most of the studies mentioned in that post are about CENTRAL nervous system improvements (brain), while we are looking for PERIPHERAL nervous system improvements (body). I did find this small study showing some benefit of giving the water extracted lion's mane to rats with leg injuries that damaged the nerve. \n\n\n\nI plan to purchase their product next pay check and give it a try. I am 4 years out and still battle fatigue every day at work.", "My Nephew was diagnosed with CIDP in March 2021. He was 2 at the time and since turned 3.

Keep up the good work \ud83d\udc4a Thank you", "High creatine kinase (CK)? Have any of you gotten blood work saying you have high CK? Did you find out why? Mine came back very high in January. PCP told me to follow up with it in April but do not exercise for a few days before getting the blood drawn. I followed his instructions, and it came back a bit lower than last time, but still quite high. Last time he mentioned it could be from muscle spasms that I do get in my legs at night on work days, regardless of water and electrolyte intake, but the spasms really are not that bad. Yes but i have kidney failure causing it", "Long term I started feeling pain in my feet in January, it was not too bad though I could handle it. The pain slowly started getting worse and worse and I still thought maybe I had just pulled muscles or some thing but I was not sure then came the weakness by mid February I had I could barely walk and it got to the point where I needed help just to get up and get to the bathroom so I decided to go to the ER\n\nI was admitted on February 25 and they didEvery test you could possibly think of like six MRIs and CT scans and a lumbar puncture and that is when they came back with a diagnosis of GBS. They started the IV I G treatment pretty quickly and I had five days of that but did not see a difference afterwards. The first week I was here they gave me Norco and IV morphine at the same time and during that was the only time I felt any relief from the pain even if it was only for a half hour or so. After a week they stopped the morphine and went to just the Norco which really does absolutely nothing For the pain.\n\nDuring the same time they were doing the IVG I was also given an Gabapentin but again not much notice any difference. Not only have I not seen any improvement but now my hands feel the way my feet too which is and excruciating burning sensation and also severe stiffness. A few days ago they switched me from from Gabapentin to Lyrica I am so I have been taking that for about four days now but still no relief from the pain.\n\nI also cannot walk without lots of assistance, I am doing physical and occupational therapy here at the hospital while I am here and I can use a walker if two people are holding the belt around me at the same time, And even then I cannot walk that far because my legs are so weak. I cannot really use my hands for anything because I have no sensation in my fingertips and the rest of my hands are burning and stiffness so they do not even want to move the right way. \n\nMy question is has anyone else ever experienced this? Nothing seems to help so I do not know how I am going to be able to function and live a normal life at all. If anyone has been through this can you tell me what to expect going forward because I am lost. I cannot imagine living with this kind of pain every day for the rest of my life, the six or so weeks since the onset of symptoms is already too much for me I just want to cry all the time, can anyone give me some advice please? I am so sorry you are going through this.  My fianc\u00e9 had GBS in 2014 right after a flu shot. 4 ER trips in 48 hrs. They called him a drug skier despite having never had a prescription for narcotics besides a dental procedure. The last time he had to crawl to he car as he is too tall and heavy for me to help. He was in agonizing pain and was not given anything. It took an ER nurse to get them to finally listen. I can still hear the screams.  I tell you all this to let you know we all understand what you are going through. His IVig helped. His hands and feet still tingle and he gets nerve snaps but he is recovered as much as he will. The pain was better after treatments. But it took time. \n\nI hope you get better soon. I know it will take time. I am going to check back on you to see how you are. I wish Netflix thing but peace and the pain to go away. Virtual hugs. I was diagnosed February 1st and had the same story as yours leading up to it. While in the hospital I was given the 5 days of IVIG and the same medications. They did not help much at all. The IVIG does not help heal you, it just stops/slows the attack unfortunately. My whole stay I had the burning sensation on my feet and hypersensitivity. Walking was impossible without a walker and I had moments of severe pain that left me crying and restless. They put me on Ativan for help with anxiety and sleep and that actually was a huge help.\n\nDuring therapy I was given leg braces and holy crap were those a game changer. It still took me a while to get to walking confidently with the walker but 3+ hours of therapy a day helped a lot. When I was depressed or worried, I would practice trying to wiggle my toes, move my ankles and even if I got a twitch I would focus on that to show I am healing. Focus on the positives. It helps a lot. \n\nUnfortunately everything comes down to time. Or so I am told. I went from not being able to move anything lower than my knees to now being able to move my ankles a bit and my toes. I am walking without a walker for a few steps at a time and the burning has gone down a lot. What dosage are you on for Lyrica? I am on 100 mg in the morning and noon, then 225 at night. On top of that I am on Cymbalta. Some of those meds take a while (weeks) to actually help.\n\nWe are both very very early in our recovery. Remember that. Keep working hard at it. This does not define our lives. Thank you for sharing that. It does sound like we are on a pretty similar journey including the timing and everything. I take 150 mg of Lyrica three times daily I also take a Xanax in the morning afternoon and evening .25 but that was a prescription I was on before this started. I also take Cymbalta as well that they prescribed her in the hospital I take one in the morning and one at night but I am not sure what the doses. They have given me steroids via IV for a few days and now they give me a steroid pill once a day since I have been here. Honestly I think there is even more medication that I just cannot remember right now. I get about one hour of physical therapy today and about 45 minutes to an hour of occupational therapy which I feel better after I do but then it does not seem to be working very well it is a very slow progress. I will ask about leg braces tomorrow..! Would really love to keep in touch it is nice hearing from someone who is going through the same thing that I am. Thank you so much for sharing! That sounds so awful for your fianc\u00e9 I am glad to hear he is doing better. It It must have been so frustrating and hard for it to take so long to take him seriously. Did he do inpatient rehab or outpatient? I am getting financial assistance from the hospital and all the inpatient rehab facilities around here only take so many financial assistant people and they are all full so the doctors are basically like when we and you feel safe to go home then you will go home and do outpatient rehab. But at this point I cannot even imagine what I would do at home luckily I have people who can help me and my boyfriend is trying to learn from my physical therapist the best way to help meBut we just do not have the resources to get the equipment that we need also I have a Foley catheter and that I have had since I got here pretty much because I cannot feel anything from my waist down except my feet which are on fire 24 seven. Please do stay in touch and thank you so much for the advice and the words of encouragement I appreciate it more than you know! My GBS was decades ago, but to this day I have never experienced pain that is even close.  I still remember lying in bed in tears with heavy metal blaring through my earphones trying to distract myself from nerves on fire.\n\nI was lucky that the pain only lasted a couple of weeks, but it is different for everyone.  Then of course, same as you, comes the long road learning how to walk again.  Everyone is path to recovery is different, but I can tell you that the physio helped immensely.  First inpatient, then outpatient for about 3 months.  Listen to the professionals, do not take shortcuts, and try to stay positive.  There will be days where you seem to make amazing progress, and others where it seems that nothing will change.  Stay strong, it is a marathon, not a sprint. :) I had GBS decades ago too but the advice about one day being amazing on the progress front &amp; one day being crap &amp; it being a marathon is spot on.\n\nGood luck on your journey. As someone still in treatment with CIDP, I use to run marathons but that seems trivial now when I have to really prepare to go out. We had some nice weather over the weekend and since we are all wfh and safe I went to my neighbors bbq, went over mostly for dogs to play but 2 days later I am in crazy pain because I was standing unassisted for 1.5 hours.... I am 1.7 years in of IVIg treatments every three weeks.   It is not a magic pill that cures you, it is just to stop or slow down our immune system from being an asshole. I had this issue, the Dr. was not prescribing the correct amount of the Gabapentin. I was taking 100mg 3x/day. I told my friend who is an NP I just could not get any relief, she asked about the meds and she told me to go up to 300 mg 3x/day and let me tell you, BOOM the pain was dulled to a degree I could handle.\n\nI would NEVER suggest you do this w/o consulting a Dr first so anyone reading this DO NOT COME FOR ME\n\nI started my journey last June and was on a walker/ in a chair until December. Tomorrow I will go to the DR to be cleared to go back to work. I still have to take the meds but I am getting back to normal.\n\nTry not to let it overwhelm you. If you ever want to talk please message me. I felt so alone in this, and honestly finding reddit a few months ago has helped me so much. I was actually up to the very highest dose of gabapentin you can be on which is 800 4 times a dayAnd I felt no relief. That is why they switched me to Lyrica they said it is the new were version of gabapentin so they are trying to get those doses right I am on 150 3 times a day Yeah I think that is what I am struggling with so much. I just cannot imagine having this level of pain for who knows how long it is driving me crazy and I feel like I am losing my mind. Sorry it took so long to reply. He was in hospital and rehab. Fully insured - a blessing   But he had to transfer from a chair to bed and toilet. Feed himself and shower before he could come home.  He worried all the time. Right now I know you are scared.  It is scary. But there are people and resources that can help you. This world is full of good people too. Right now ask your facility to help you navigate that. Most importantly you have to de-stress as much as possible. Some days will feel like you are climbing a mountain. It is going to be slow. Do your rehab. It will get better. You will never be 100%. But it will get better. Go fund me. Video your experience for others. Tell your story. Raise awareness. Look forward. You have got this!!  My mom is currently recovering from gbs and went through hell to the point of being put into a a medically induced coma and on a breathing tube. She experienced a lot of what you described. If your symptoms do not seem to be improving or are getting worse I would consider the plasmapheresis treatment. My mom did ivig for 5 days and it did not even touch her. She did seven treatments of plasmapheresis and is making progress. Albeit slow progress. She is also in significantly far less pain and on way less medication. Thank you for sharing. I hope your mom gets well soon she sounds incredibly strong!\nI have seen stories of that treatment working for people so I will ask my doctors they have never even mentioned it to me so I do not know why", "GBS success: health interview for citizenship! Just did my health interview for Australian spouse visa (sorry for my absence btw, this anxiety was a definite factor!). GBS came up of course, but their only concerns were constant ongoing factors and how I mitigate them. I have a current autoimmune rash and that was noted. Passed the exam, regardless! Do not feel like your past issues will hold you back from things like moving abroad, even if you have residuals! \n\nFor context, the Australian health exam assesses what \"burden\" people will be on their Medicare. If you have recovered from GBS, it seems you are fine as long as there are no serious lingering conditions. I have light nerve damage and flare ups of autoimmune rashes. Congratulations! On your interview and recovery. \n\nAs an Australian, welcome! Thank you! It is a big relief to be past that - I was terrified GBS would disqualify me!", "Could it be GBS or CIDB? Untreated urethritis for 6 months, month ago developed whole body paresthesias, random pains, muscle twitches I cannot sleep because of pain.

Also I have random itchy spots, like groins, legs.\n\nMy legs feel like they are on fire.\n\nI have urethritis which is untreated, abx doesnt work.

", "Study finds no link between COVID-19, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome  But again, no mention or stats on getting again! Is there any higher chance of getting a re-occurrence with any vaccine? I have been told the chances of getting it again, from anything, are very very slim. '\"Our analysis shows SARS-CoV-2 contains no additional immunogenic material known or proven to drive GBS,\" (Stephen) Keddie noted in the release'\n\nThis is simply not true, spike proteins are known to bind to gangliosides, which provides a clear immunogenic mechanism.\n\n((\n\n(\n\nStephen Keddie's analysis is under the assumption that GBS can only be caused caused by molecular mimicry. But this assumption is not scientifically sound, since that hypothesis is only significantly likely for Campylobacter-associated GBS.\n\nIt does not explain the other infectious associations like influenza associated GBS. That line jumped out at me as well.  Thanks for the clarification. I do not know but sometimes studies are misleading. What about the people who did not have any infection other than COVID-19 and they developed GBS afterwards? If you go to pubmed you will find many documented cases about developing paralysis after the infection. How can this be a coincidence that happened to that many people considering the disease is relatively rare? Lots of things bind gangliosides. That does not mean they drive GBS. Rabies, cholera toxin, tetanus toxin are a few examples. Alpha synuclein and b amyloid proteins also. You are right, it is not the mere presence that is relevant, but the likelihood the complex (of self protein bound to foreign antigen) can induce B-cells in making a mistake. The mistake also has to occur sufficient times (through the process of B-cell maturation into plasma-cells), or no autoimmune disease will result. One possible mistake is the co-capture mechanism from my link above, which notably, does not require autoreactive T-cells.\n\nSelf-proteins like Alpha synuclein and b amyloid are much less likely to induce problems than foreign antigens, due to lack of T-cell sensitivity (due to Thymic selection).\n\nA variety of pathogens have proteins that bind gangliosides and that binding is the most likely reason why that variety of pathogens are associated with GBS, despite a lack of mimic epitopes of sufficient size.\n\nAssociation with the tetanus toxin for example, is why the CDC has an explicit warning on the vaccine: (\n\nGiven all this, we can assume that it is hypothetically possible and thus the usual caveat applies: more research is needed.", "CIDP and covid symptoms, neuropathy flare ups? I have CIDP Which has brought along with it some severe neuropathic pain over the years.

And this will repeat a couple of times a minute for hours in the same place. \n\nYesterday I started feeling like a cold was coming on, then the neuropathy went into overdrive. Both feet, both hands, pain exploding in one after another. I have experienced a lot of pain since getting CIDP but this was the most intense 24 hours I have ever experienced. It is never hit multiple spots at the same time before. That pain stopped about 6 hours ago but my cough is getting worse, sore throat generally achy. \n\nI am going to figure out how to get tested for covid tomorrow, it is difficult being disabled. My question is could covid cause this huge increase in neuropathic pain?", "Post COVID Vaccine Hello all,\n\nI had GBS in late 2010, and today got the first half of the Moderna COVID vaccine. I am going to keep a thread of my progression as I wait to see if anything happens. I am hoping that my thread may help people decide what is the best course for them.\n\nI chose to get the vaccine because I live in an area where people do not want to follow social distancing protocol, and I work in the public sector where I will be required to help the general public as soon as my office reopens. I did and still do have worry about getting the vaccine because of GBS, but after speaking with my doctor, I realized that making an educated risk was one I was willing to take. My GBS was not induced by a vaccine, but more than likely a flu or bacterial infection I had at the time (on a side note, the greater Cincinnati area has the highest cases of GBS in the US. My educated guess is that there is a certain bacteria or virus natural to this area that triggers it but nobody's really sure). \n\nI got my vaccine about 1.5 hours ago (3/3) and will be updating with anything that might be of interest to anyone. My second vaccine will be 3/29. As always, please contact your doctor before getting the shot. We all have different GBS cases and I do not want my anecdotal evidence to be your ultimate decision, but rather help you think what is best for you and your case. This is helpful thank you! My doctor told me NOT to get vaccinated yet. Right now my immune response is out of control. I get numb (and sometimes sick) from all food, many plastics, sitting in a funny way, sitting too long, off-gassing from new products... So I am waiting and continuing to isolate, but it is easier for me than you. My partner and I can both stay at home and our county is 99% mask compliant so local errands are not a safety concern.\n\nI am glad you got your shot and look forward to your updates! 44yo female GBS x2 survivor. I have been fully vaccinated, I am a month post-second injection, and I am without issue. That makes me feel very relieved to hear that, congratulations. \nMay I ask how you contracted GBS twice if you know? Thank you for this, I am looking forward to your updates. I am afraid to get the vaccine as I lost my mom to GBS/Miller fisher many years ago. 1979 and 1990. The first time, I had some unknown virus, and went from falling all morning (4yo), to being on a vent by night. The second time (13yo) I had mono, and it never took down my diaphragm, and I maintained a few large movements. I was back on my feet in 4 mos. I do have some residual paralysis in my feet, and possibly elsewhere. Things are starting to appear as I age. 4 hour update: I am feeling a little low energy, but it could easily be attributed to it being close to my natural bedtime and also I took an incredibly hot bath before writing this. Will update tomorrow. Thanks for posting and best of luck that all goes well. I want to see how others are affected before I get the vaccine. I had GBS 2-1/2 years ago. I am a 60 yr old GBS survivor - had it in 1996. I received the second moderna dose on Saturday 2/27. Second dose definitely was worse - 2 days of fever of 101.5 and aches and headache. Much better today but it did hit me pretty hard while my brother only had mild side effects. I think it is so worth it though...I was working and living in Zambia when covid hit and had to leave because there was no good medical care where I was living. I should be able to return sometime this year (fingers crossed for a booster for the So African variant). I am so happy that there is a vaccine and I am fine. Everyone needs to do what they think and speak with their doctor - but I am grateful I received it. Did your doctor have anything to say about the pros and cons of the specific vaccines? Thanks for the updates!  53 year old GBS survivor here.  I finished my second shot of the sputnik vaccine 3 weeks ago, and I chose to get it for many of the same reasons that you did.  Right now, there seems to be more danger getting GBS from Covid itself than from the various vaccines.  I had no reaction to the first shot, but I did have a fever (37.9) on the day after the second shot.  It was a common, and mild reaction, and I have had no other problems since that time. I was told not to take a bath or visit Sauna for a day or two after the shot (showers are OK).  Might be different for the different vaccines though. I have been following the research as it gets published, and the 2-shot vaccines seem to have a better prevention rate.  Slight fever after one or both of the shots is fairly common, so it is best to plan a day off if you can.  Most researchers seem to suggest that the best vaccine is the one that is available to you. Sorry, I meant pros or cons in relation to our GBS concerns. I have seen the efficacy stats, but I am curious if there is any consensus at all as to whether the mRNA vaccines are better for GBS survivors because they do not have a traditional vaccine structure, or if J&amp;J is better because it is only one dose. Or maybe it does not matter at all. For that, it *seems* not to matter.   Like everything GBS related, it is hard to to spot trends with very small sample sizes, but no problems have surfaced yet with any of the vaccines even with a fairly large roll-out.  The mRNA vaccines are a newer technology, and the adinovirus base has been used more widely in other types of vaccines, but they all seem to be good so far. Thank you for this information! As someone who has been hospitalized and treated in the Greater Cincinnati Area (thank you, B North!) in the last year- what is your source for Cincinnati having the highest cases of GBS in the US?\n\nI am very interested in learning more about the vaccine. Fauci's early recommendation along with that of my PCP kept me away from it. You know I probably should not have said that because it is now anecdotal, but when I got diagnosed my old PCP and neurologist said it, so it is been stuck in my head ever since. I will say that my new PCP mentioned that a bacteria found in undercooked chicken (campylobacter jejuni) can also cause it too. Day 1 Update: woke up feeling a little tired but that is it. My anxiety after getting the vaccine is what probably made me have bad sleep. Walking and gait are fine, my heart rate seems normal. Arm hurts but it is to be expected. Ah, crap. Wish I would have known. Luckily I am over six foot and my forearms do not usually go in the water unless I am washing them lol. I will keep it in mind for round two. It will be interesting to hear if the other vaccines/countries also recommend this.  I did a search online and found nothing about this one way or the other.... My mother, F 74, had severe GBS about 30 years ago, has had both Moderna shots and is 2 weeks past her second injection. No issues. She was very concerned as she has not had a vaccine in 30 years! I am a 35f a year out. Got my second shot last week. Pfizer. Other than soreness at the injection site, I got a bad migraine, chills, and muscle aches. Only lasted at best 24 hours. Been fine otherwise and since. My Neuro said since I did not \"get\" GBS from a vaccine, then I would be fine. If I had gotten GBS from a vaccine, he would have been against it. Sorry for the delay, I forgot to respond. The second dose definitely hit me. I had flu symptoms for about a day, but that is it. Otherwise I have been fine, no neurological problems or anything. Thank you for your response. I am glad to hear you are doing well despite the vaccine side effects. My daughter had her first Pfizer on 4/8 with no symptoms. I hope her second dose goes well too.

Back in 2018 at the age of 26, I was hospitalized with the numbness, double vision and headaches associated with the Miller Fischer varient. Went into respiratory failure and was med flown into Boston, where I received my diagnosis, was intubated in the ICU, fully paralyzed, and hospitalized for 3 months. I have since made a full recovery, but it can be challenging to deal with.\n\nI know most of you probably feel similar. You are part of a rare, exclusive group of people who have gone through a difficult experience that almost no one in your personal lives can relate to. Because of this, it may be difficult to get the proper support needed. \n\nI have been there. I am STILL there, with all of you. I created a group on Facebook for my own recover and for your recovery in hopes of connecting with those who have recovered, and providing support from those who are still recovering.\n\nIt may be nice to connect online, and my hopes is that maybe we could start convening via zoom.\n\nThis is the link. \n\n\n\nWould any of you be interested in connecting and sharing expeirences with each other? It is a great idea, I do not have GBS, I have CIDP but was also fully paralyzed at one point.  I hope people respond and join you though!  We can all use more support! Yea I would love to be able to connect and talk to others! Mine was in June of 2019 and still feel I am going through it. I do not have FB though... That is no problem! I can send you a ZOOM link when I get more people. Or/and, we can check in, in a week and see if this catches more people. That sounds great, thank you! Would be nice to connect with others, I also do not have Facebook. I was also struck in 2018, I was sick the week before, felt better for 1 day, then my legs started to collapse. Within 72 hours of that I was fully paralyzed and intubated, and have also made a full recovery. Are you all familiar with the gbs-cidp.org website? They have annual meetings all over the world, they visited me while I was recuperating. Unfortunately I have yet to get to one between the pandemic and then my license being temporarily revoked due to having GBS (I live in PA). I am familiar with the website. I actually reached out to them prior to setting this up. They gave me the contact info of someone who I could connect with. To be flat out honest, I was not totally into that. I was looking more so for a support group of peers. No problem if you do not have Facebook. As I mentioned to the other poster who also did not have Facebook, we can chat in private. And if I get enough people, I can create a ZOOM meeting for us to speak. Do you use ZOOM?\n\nBy the way, my experience was very similar. I was sick for about a week. Felt better, and then later in the day I started to get numbness in my mouth and then double vision. You are more than welcome to join If you would like! I would love to join! I was also 26 when I was diagnosed MFS in September 2019. I was paralyzed from head to toe within a week and spent 3 months hospitalized and in rehab. I am nearly fully recovered though my face is still largely paralyzed. I am still noticing progress so I am hopeful :) Just added you! I remember you. We chatted via private message under my primary, more casual account I believe. I love this! I do not want any connection between Reddit account and my old Facebook (have not used it since 2013) so I am happy here. I fully support you and thank you for creating a support space. I have CIDP and this subreddit has helped me feel less alone. Would love to connect. I had/have sensory predominant GBS. Like others, no Facebook but would be keen to join up. Great! \n\nWhen I have enough people, I can create a zoom link and send it to you? Hello...just diagnosed.  Living with this for 8 years - 100% holistic...did not have name for what I was dealing with because I am rare &amp; drs just kept trying to medicate and if I do not follow protocol coo they \u201cfired\u201d me.  I am off ALL pharmaceuticals.  Diagnosis came because of mass in omentum.  Surgeon completely missed it &amp; messed up my neck.  That is how I got to specialist who did extensive testing.   I have only read a couple posts....it is scary to read on... Thanks! \n\nReally just looking to create a support group that convenes, rather than just through social media. As it is something I believe I need, as well as others!\n\nGood to know this is available though. Thanks! Awesome I will message you!", "Symptoms after flu shot Hello, \n\nI had my flu shot a couple weeks ago on a Thursday 05nov, and the next couple days I started feeling numbness in my fingertips. That was it, and I thought it was weird but figured I would see how it progresses. Fast forward to Friday  13nov, and I wake up fine, but a couple hours into my workday, I start feeling very fatigued and my muscles just started aching like I had been hit by a truck. So they made me get tested for COVID, which came out negative on Sunday, but since then the muscle pains have gotten worse and the numbness has spread to my palms, and now my thigh muscles are numb and weak, as well as my arms and back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not like to be the guy that web md's himself to try and self diagnose, but I am having trouble with how I am going to approach the doctor with maybe testing me for GBS. Normally, this would not be an issue, but I am in the military and it is sometimes difficult to ask for stuff like this with military docs. \n\nThese past few weeks have just deteriorated my quality of life and I am so depressed because every day it is just so painful and annoying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks Hey,\n\nI am not an m.d., just someone who has a relative who got gbs and that is why I joined this community.\n\nUnfortunately, this sounds quite similar to how my relative got the disease. He also got the flu shot and I think it was about a week later that the first symptoms crashed in. He was very confused and thought it might be muscle pain due to the flu shot and shook it off, because you can easily have flu symptoms afterwards. However, the symptoms became more severe and eventually he went to the m.d. They were clueless in the beginning and it sadly took them a while to find out what he got (precious time! So it is very good that you already have an idea!).\n\nI would strongly recommend to you to see an M.D. and take it seriously because this disease can do anything (begone in the next few days or hunt you for a while..).\nAnd an ongoing destruction of myelin might prolong the overall recovery process.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask or to reach out!\nThis disease can be very frightening and can also affect the brain (in severe cases) so a: get your shit together, is the least helpful thing.\n\nSo it is better to get it tested. Heads up buddy and in case you have questions or anything else you can always write me a message! Thanks man, it has had me terrified past few days. I am just going to go ask about it, stigma be damned. If I do not have it I will just deal with the attitudes later. I am tired of feeling like shit. Yeah! Dealing with the stigma and not having it is way better than having it and do not get treatment. I had similar symptoms after I got \\*both\\* a Flu and Shingles (shingrix) vaccine.  \n\n\nTL,DR: I had side effects similar to yours, and they went away after four weeks.  \n\n\nI was already having feelings of sickness, with some tingling going back the last 5 years or so, with no diagnosis. And symptoms would come and go - they were constant.  \n\n\nThere was really bad pollution here because of fires around early September - my symptoms got much worse around then, and were lasting longer.  \n\n\nI went to the doctor on Oct 16, I was feeling better at that time.\n\nThe doctor had run blood tests already, and there was nothing of note in them or when I saw him.  \n\n\nHe asked if I wanted to get a Shingles vaccine, and said I could also get a Flu vaccine, and I went ahead and got both.\n\nI felt very sick within about 5 hours, and had severe back pain - where I sometimes had moderate pain, I now had severe pain running from my lower back into upper thigh (sciatica?).  \n\n\nAfter about 4 more days, I had weakness but only in my legs - I noticed this when biking uphill, hiking, and when walking upstairs.  \n\n\nI went to urgent care, but there was nothing in blood results showing anything unusual, they took an xray of my back, and give me some muscle relaxers to help with the back pain.\n\nAfter another week, the weakness got worse though the severe back pain was now mild pain.  \n\n\nI read up on Flu and Shingrix side effects, and saw the possibility of GBS (on the CDC web site). I talked with my doctor, and he had me go to the ER to get a spinal tap.  \n\n\nAt the ER - with large delays, as COVID-19 responses are filling up hospital beds even for those not in ICU as they have to put one person in each room, and that backs up into the ER rooms - the doctor gave me some simple strength tests, and told me I was not weak :-(  \n\n\nThat was difficult to hear: I am in excellent physical shape for any age, as I bike 2 or 3 times a week with 2000 foot climbs, as well as walk about 2 miles with 500' climbs about once a week, and their strength tests do not compare you with any previous results.  \n\n\nBut another ER doctor was OK with me getting a spinal tap, I got one and the tap showed elevated protein levels.  \n\n\nI had a video visit with a neurologist, and then an exam with the electronic (I think EGM or such) testing of my nerves, plus strength tests - again, simple strength resistance testing that is not very objective and does not give a comparison to when I did not feel weakness.  \n\n\nThe neurologist found \\*no\\* nerve issues, and even told me I could go ride my bike, even though that was not a real possibility for me.  \n\n\nAt this point, it had been four weeks since my initial onset.  \n\n\nThe next day after that, I felt \\*much\\* better, though I still had some leg weakness.  \n\n\nThe following day (29 days since the vaccines), I still felt good and my leg weakness had decreased too!  \n\n\nAnd now 35 days later, I feel good and I do not think there is any leg weakness! I have not had any re-occurences so far like I have had in the past, but I will have to wait weeks before I can say it is no longer happening.  \n\n\nI still have no diagnosis - not GBS, not CIDP, and need to followup with my doctor and neurologist to let them know how I am doing and to ask for guidance. It does not hurt to be an advocate for your own health.  Remember though that flu shot will often give you symptoms of the flu as your body fights what it thinks is the virus.  This includes tiredness and aching as two extremely common symptoms.  At this stage you know best what you consider flu-like aches and weakness from 'holy-shit-this-is-not-normal-why-are not-my-legs-working'. Diagnosis of GBS should be made asap. The sooner you get the treatment the better. I was ignoring the symptoms for a day until I could not walk. Pls do not make the same mistake and go to a doctor asap. Good luck.. I am glad you went to the ER and they did some good diagnostic tests.  As others have said, you need to be your own advocate and ask questions. Please check with your physician if you are concerned about having GBS. As others have stated, the sooner you treat it the better your prognosis can be. GBS has some distinct characteristics, but the onset and rate of development varies widely from person to person. Any sort of numbness or muscle weakness justifies seeing a doctor immediately. Good luck and I hope you get well.\n\nEdit: I see you have been to the doctor, I am glad to hear that. We are here for you throughout this process for any other questions or support you may need. Keep us posted on it.", "Help me be realistic I am 42, having a second round of gbs 25 years after the first, I have been in the hospital/rehab for the last six weeks.  My case of GBs has been moderate in that I was not intubated.   Over the last week and a half, I have regained my ability to stand and walk(albeit very slowly and on a walker).  I will continue intensive rehab when I go home later on this week.   I am still very numb everywhere, particularly in feet.  I am a teacher and I am out on disability.  My question for you all that have experienced this before is how likely Is it that I will be going back to work this school year?  I hate not being at work.   Thanks I did not have gbs but had similar symptoms I am sure someone else will chime in with timelines but my advice is to just use getting back to work as motivation during your rehab/recovery. It seems like timelines for gbs can vary quite a bit so do not be discouraged if your situation takes longer. Keep in mind that taking care of yourself and your health is your first priority. I think the fact that you did not get intubated is a good sign but that is just my opinion. Best of luck, wishing you a speedy recovery! I would be very doubtful you would be up to par to return by the end of this year full time. \nTake things easy and focus on getting back in touch with your body, exercise, eat healthy, and get plenty of rest. I had been told 2years until \"full\" recovery so definitely give yourself plenty of time. Be patient, be kind to yourself, and remember process done hastily will likely result in two steps back where as process done carefully is more likely to result in steady steps forward :) \n\nI was a stubborn teenager when I got gbs Miller Fisher variant from the gardasil vaccine (13yrs ago) . I was 16 working(30hrs/wkly) and in high school as a full time student. Within 8 months I was back to doing everything. I  put in a lot of hard work; blood, sweat, and tears to regain physical mobility. However my diet was horrible and I did not get enough rest. Eventually everything caught up with me and I landed myself back in the hospital. \n\nBest of luck fellow gbs survivor/warrior I had a moderate case and returned to work after two months off. I did not return full time (per my neurologist). I am 1 1/2 years out now and just now am being allowed to work 35 hours a week (and I am absolutely wrecked by the end of the week). I think it is doable but it is something you will not know for yourself until you return and see how you feel. It is March now so you may not return in time to finish the school year, but at least you will have the summer off. I was also quite young when I had GBS.  I am lucky that I have never relapsed, but I do know how much longer it takes my body to heal now that I am older.  If you have access to physio, take their advice and do not put yourself on a deadline.  Let your body heal and rebuild your strength at a pace that does not risk further injury.\n\nBut as far as work?  you do not teach with your feet, do you?  ;)  As long as you are not to proud to use a chair or other aids, then doing what you enjoy should help keep your spirits up. At 35 years old I was back to work full time after about 6 weeks.  My work was desk work as a unix administrator though and it was easy to avoid any physically demanding tasks.  I had issues with fatigue for months afterwards though.  That said I was a Miller Fisher case that  and only hospitalized for 11 days and walking with a walker by day 8 of those 11 days.\n\nThe ability to get back to work is going to involve a lot of things I would think.  Age being taught, and flexibility/willingness of your school district to provide you with help, I picture being the most important aspects outside of your personal condition.  I see no reason you could not be back in action for next year, but I imagine this year is pretty unlikely. My daughter was diagnosed with GBS at 12 (and later CIDP).  She went into the hospital and was diagnosed on May 7 was inpatient for 10 days on IVIG (Immunoglobulin) and steroids ( I forget which).  She was able to attend her 6th-grade graduation, but it was a struggle.  \n\nGive yourself time to heal but you might be able to get back before the end of the year. My kid was also a Gardasil onset. I was also quite young. OP's post is my fear!", "How bad is CIPD? Hi guys.  I am currently experiencing every symptom of CIPD.  My jaw and neck and throat are on excruciating pain.  Electrical storm.  Cramps.  Using a walker at 36.  Started a couple months ago.\n\nI was recently tested for MS(cerv, thoracic, brain, orbital) and clean.  Now doing a spinal tap for CIPD.\n\nIs CIPD worse than MS?  Very little data on it.\n\nThanks! Peripheral nerves have a better chance of recovery than CNS nerves.  After 15 years I went from paralyzed to walking mostly normally.  It was a slow process with a lot of back and forth but it did get better.  How bad it gets just depends on your body and everyone is different.  Do not give up fighting, keep reminding your body what it is supposed to do. Thanks for the reply and glad you are relatively well!  How fast did this thing move on you? Im about 2 months in and about 3 days ago began having throat pain.  Now I have nasal regurgitation and pain on both sides of throat.  Like every 4 hours I notice a new spot going out. In the beginning it was very slow week by week it crept up my legs, but then it suddenly it took off and I went from tripping to not being able to walk in 10 days.  Ended up in ICU for 10 days, cranial nerve damage, autonomic issues.  If it is going that fast for you I think you should see a Neurologist. Wow!  And ya...I have neuro appointment on the 28th and will be requesting an EMG and a spinal tap. NCV too, nerve conduction velocity,  how fast a signal transmits from like your knee to foot.  They can tell damage by the lower velocity.  I am no expert, but I wanted to chime in here. My girlfriend was about to be discharged from the hospital with a \"it is probably something psychological\" when they decided to perform this test, mostly to see if there was any noticeable difference to the same test she would had a year earlier. During the test the room filled up with multiple neurologists because of how extremely bad her test results were and that is how she eventually ended up with her CIDP diagnosis. Had it not been for this test, we would have been sent home (again) without her receiving the proper care.\n\nAgain, I am no doctor or anything, and I do not know if this test is vital for the CIDP diagnosis, but in my girlfriend's case it played a pivotal role. I like to think its better - as peripheral nerves do heal and its a faster process the younger you are. So there is a shot at 100% recovery. Also the treatments for CIDP do not cause side effects as its a relatively more natural ivig regime. Also the disease has a tendency to burnout after a few years. As you can probably see I like to look at the bright side of this bad hand life has given us. Wow!  I definitely will be requesting this one as well.  THANKS! EMG is another name used as it is an EMG machine. Any neurologist worth seeing has one in his office.", "Dealing with cidp Hi I have cidp I showed symptoms when I was 16 started losing ability to run I thought it was a sports related injury cuz I played squash but it turns out it was not. He went into the hospital April 2020, I was in a children's hospital made a certain amount of progress as got hit with a bunch of needles, and a couple procedures. I get IVIG every three weeks but I am still at home I am now 18 and another month I will have been home a year. This... this loneliness I was wondering if anybody had a way to cope. I am stuck inside Im taking digital classes and while I still have friends and go outside every once in a blue moon. I find it still difficult to live like this and advice? If you are on Facebook there is a group call GBS\\CIDP Exercisers that might be good connections for you. \n\nAdditionally on YouTube there is a channel by NoEggCraig that shows his continuing recovery from an exceptionally bad CIDP onset. \n\nWhere there is life , there is hope. \n\nWhere there are optimistically realistic expectations there can be a plan. Hi OP, I am also 18 and was diagnosed with CIDP at 13. Also got hit by a hunch if needles and took IVIG twice a month at the beginning of my diagnosis. Even now I remember how hard of a time it was for the first few years of my recovery, that feeling of loneliness and seclusion. For me at least I coped by just spending time hanging out and playing video games with my friends, very light exercise, etc and trying my best to look at the brighter side of my situation, essentially things to keep myself from thinking too negatively about my condition. While im no doctor, I definitely would have recommended to my past self to reach out to people you know - close or not - and kind of just rant about how you are feeling, and share your journey and experiences. For me at least, it was scary not knowing any other young people with CIDP and being afraid I wouldnt ever recover because of it, so if that is the case for you, just know that its 100% possible, it just takes time and patience, 5 years later and im practically fully recovered :) Best wishes for a speedy recovery! Ahh yes I have found them, thinking about joining, thank you Hey OP.  My father actually has CIDP.  I do not, but went through a long period of undiagnosed severe pain- The very worst period being from age 16 - 22.  I am now in my 30s, here to lend an ear if you need one. Thank you honestly being by myself is the worst thing, cuz well I start to think very negative which is not good. I am so sorry.  I know how lonely and dark it can feel for your body to betray you.  I promise you that there are many souls who have walked this path before you.  And, sadly, many who will walk the path behind you.  Even when it does not feel like it, there is always- always a light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you being stuck in the hospital was terrible, left me with too much time to think. Getting poked and prodded was kind of embarrassing Ugh.  It is horrible.  I spent a full month in the hospital once.  It was not during a pandemic though, and I think that is even harder.   I remember the first two weeks, I felt so horrible I did not really care where I was.  But the second two weeks, I was miserable and bored out of my ever loving mind.  Having visitors was actually worse than being alone because I could not stop throwing up.  And I was like \u201cno!  Do not leave!\u201d  As I continuously just sat there and puked.  \n\nIn hindsight, I really do not blame people for leaving.  I do not think I could sit there pretending nothing was happening either. Lol\n\nDo you have people you can talk to or\nOutlets you post your thoughts to? Yeah but, Bein... 18 everyone is busy so.

Wow. This is why I want to wait a bit before taking a vaccine.\n\nEdit: interesting, Peru had an outbreak of Guillian-Barr\u00e9 last June. I love how they simplify GBS to 'difficulty moving arms'. L0l. Weird, I got Miller-Fisher after visiting Peru In June 2006 where I got a nasty intestinal bug. So unlike the vaccines approved in the US currently at least, this one is the same setup as the Flu vaccine.  So seeing things like this are more expected from this one IMO.  \n\nThe setup being used by Pfizer and Moderna are largely unknowns for any possible interactions with GBS, and related responses.", "Are tattoos a risk? I suffered from GBS years ago at this point, recovered and I am fine now. But I was wondering seeing if there would be any complications if I got a tattoo. There is little to no information on this topic. Any one have any experience or advice ?  No experience, I guess the thing to be mindful of would be what your initial trigger was. For example, mine was an upper respiratory infection, so I am now a lot more cautious about colds. Of course, I cannot have a flu shot ever either. If your trigger was something related to cuts, maybe? But I believe the majority of GBS triggers are thought to be flu shot, upper respiratory infection, childbirth, and things of that sort.

My dad (57M) was diagnosed with GBS exactly one week ago and went from pins and needles in his legs to no feeling from his shoulders down in about two days. He just finished his first round of treatment and the drs are saying he is most likely in the worst of it and we will just have to wait and see how he progresses from here. One thing I am struggling with is what to do to help him pass the time in the ICU. He says music and tv give him a headache and he cannot move around much, and I want to use my time with him to help him be more comfortable. Besides doing the care acts he requests (feeding, brushing his hair, etc.) can you recall any things you wanted people to help you with or bring you that maybe are not so obvious? I just want to make sure I am helping him be as comfortable as possible. Any advice in this difficult time is appreciated.  I wanted people to talk to mostly. It is a wild experience, and having family and friends around made it a lot easier to get through. \n\nIf your dad has friends that cannot come visit, maybe offer to help him call them or text them for him?\n\nMy grandma got me a blanket that was leaps and bounds better than the hospital blankets, which made me feel a little more comfortable. Once I got my sense of taste back, it was good having food from home to get a break from hospital food.\n\nGood on you for being there for your dad. My best wishes to him, let me know if you need someone to talk to!  My wife liked people coming to visit, bringing food, brushing her hair, and a soft blanket. :) I also brought her books on tape from the library! Audio books can be a good distraction and not as loud as music.   A pillow from home. I appreciated that! My family kept a calendar. It was more of a day planner. Everyone wrote something in it. Current events, weather, what I was saying or what they talked to me about. I had the sensation that my legs were hanging over the edge of the bed. My sister wrote one day, \u201cshe has lost her legs again. \u201c    All the best to your dad.  Podcasts might be a good idea. I did not listen to them at the time but I would have loved them if I realized they were so interesting. \n\nMy family brought my iPad and headphones.  I watched a ton of Netflix on the volume I wanted which was nice. The hospital tv was not a great selection and my eyesight is not great so having my iPad up close was a huge help.  First, I am so sorry to hear about your dad and your family is in my thoughts and prayers.\n\nI loved talking to my family and having them tell me about their daily activities. Music and tv made me nauseous so talking was the only thing that helped pass the time.\n\nBest of luck. I am still In recovery, but able to walk again with the use of a cane. For 6 months I was a quadrapalegic.  Thank you so much for your advice. I am going to bring in some photos from home so he can see our faces when we cannot be there with him. \n\nGood luck to you as well, I am praying for a speedy recovery.

The other things I wanted to know when I started this journey were some of the practical things.  I have a government disability designation. I get a tax break, access to the disabled persons savings benefit, and transportation tax allowances.  I did not know about these things before I got GBS. I am in Canada so there may be other programs in different countries. This is a GREAT idea. I will work on compiling resources for that. I will add that to the wiki. That is going to be my task this week, updating the wiki with more resources. Thanks for the awesome suggestion!", "Question about my mom\u2019s GBS recovery Hey Everyone! First time poster here. I first want to say that I have been reading all the posts, and everyone in this group is so supportive of one another and the GBS community. It is awesome to see.\n\nSo I have a question that I was hoping you all could help me with. My mom was diagnosed with GBS in October 2020. I was visiting her one night and she was not feeling well, and by the end of the night, she has lost the ability to walk. We went straight to the ER and they quickly diagnosed her with GBS. She also has stage 4 cancer, and actually got the GBS from her immunotherapy treatment. It is been a little rough over here.\n\nAnyway, she really did pretty good at the hospital (no ICU) and stayed 2 weeks (received IVIG). She went to rehab facility for 2 weeks after that. She was sent home, and she was not in great shape. But since then, she has been making very very slow progress. She walks with a walker and needs 24/7 caretaking. She is been out of the hospital for 2 months now. \n\nSo finally my question! Thanks for sticking with me. Since she is been home her right hand started tingling a lot more than usual, then started numbing, and now it is closing up into a fist. She cannot control it at all and now cannot use it at all. We are worried that she is somehow regressing, although she seems to be doing okay otherwise (but extremely slow recovery with everything else). So I guess my question is, when you were recovering, did you have things that happened that made you feel like you were relapsing or regressing? Or is this hand thing not that big of a deal in your opinion? I am just lost because GBS is SO confusing and it is hard to find answers. We do have a good neurologist who is monitoring as well.\n\nJust wanted to get yalls thoughts in this and see if anyone went through something similar. Thank you guys! This is an awesome community! GBS takes a long time to recover from. I cannot fathom going through it alongside stage 4 cancer. There are ups and downs, and for many of us setbacks and \"relapses\" as symptoms ebb and flow. This is normal. The good news is that GBS heals over time, just VERY SLOWLY, and it should not be the focus of your mom's recovery. Focus on the cancer treatment and do what you can to help ease her mind about the GBS, because it will get better... it just feels like it takes forever. there is a facebook group \n\nGuillain-Barre' Syndrome Survivors  \n  \n\nand another community at the GBS/CIDP foundation  \n\n\nI swear, it seems as if everyone is experience and recovery with gbs is different, but you may find many more share your mom's experience in those sites...\n\nbest wishes First, best wishes to your Mom.  She must be a strong woman to deal with both Cancer and GBS.  GBS can certainly take longer to heal for older patients (you did not post age, so I am guessing here).  And your neurologist is a great person to ask about how the cancer treatment may interact with GBS recovery.  But do you still have access to physiotherapy or the rehab facility?  It really takes time to rebuild strength and muscle, and having a professional guide you through some basic exercises and stretches may help. I do not think that the fist has to do with GBS. GBS starts with the destruction of nerves, which seems to me would leave her unable to make a fist since the muscles cannot contract. All the best and much love to you and mom. You may want to ask about a second round of IVIG? that is something my mom did when her symptoms stopped improving. However the IVIG can be pretty rough too This is definitely a big deal but I say this in context. \n\nI have been battling multiple inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and I have had huge ups and down. One of the scariest things was when this started happening to me. Waking up with my hands being stiff and having a hard time opening and closing them. \n\nAs I continue to navigate my health, also with a great neurologist and broader medical team, I have days where my hands are not that stiff and days where they are bad again. I have experienced significant recovery in some symptoms and I have had a hard time with others.\n\nYour mom is an amazing woman fighting cancer and dealing with this health outcome at the same time. Her neurologist should do everything possible to support her hand recovering, and it should not be treated as just okay or normal. I would say that numbness, stiffness, and tingling coming and going in all kinds of ways is something I have experienced ebbing and flowing in the process of hopefully recovery.\n\nMy heart goes out to you and thank you for looking out for your mom. &lt;3 I believe the tingling feeling and uncontrollable nerve firings are symptoms of the nerves recovering. I had the same feelings in my feet and hands during recovery. \nObviously I am in no way certified to give medical advice, so still get it checked out by your doctor, but that was my experience", "Do not know what took me so long to look for this sub.... My older brother, male 35, started experiencing symptoms about 2 1/2 years ago and between dismissive doctors and him not taking time off work to take it seriously, he was not diagnosed until a year later. He was at Cleveland Clinic for about a week for IVIG after being diagnosed and tried outpatient PT for at least a few months but it is probably been close to a year since any further treatment was done. His hands have some numbness, especially his thumbs, but his biggest issue is basically being completely numb from the knees down. He has braces that go inside his boots to support his feet and prevent toe drop (not sure if that is a medical term or just how he describes it). He is in constant pain and basically just hates his life. Being 6\u20195\u201d makes the paralysis especially bad for him. Does anyone know if there is something more that can be tried? I have read through some posts and seen multiple rounds of IVIG at regular intervals mentioned and it just seems crazy that there is not a doctor trying to do something to at least improve his condition. Plasmapheresis is what finally help me. With the IVIG my weakness just continued to worsen. Is that a one time thing or an ongoing treatment? It was done a few times until my condition stabilized. After that it was months of physical and occupational therapy. It only lasted 6 months for me, and I fully recovered. Our mother is a nurse and she is been on him to go see different doctors but he is a stubborn ass who would rather go to work every day and tough it out so far. He complained about the PT and how painful it was but at the same he did not really feel anything when they hooked up the tens device to his lower legs and turned it all the way up. I sent him an article on plasmapheresis after I read your comment and I am hoping he will at least see another doctor about the possibility of trying it. Thank you so much for your input. I am 6 2', had acute GBS 4 years ago. I take daily B12  shots that help a lot. If he has problems to walk I recommend Vibram 5 fingers shoes. When your foot has 5 toes to feel things out it much easier to walk than in shoes. They helped me walking again. Find a better neurologist. Also regular rounds of IVIG are for the chronic form of GBS called CIDP. The term i think you were looking for is 'foot drop' which tbh is very common in a CIDP dx and reflects weakness in the ankles requiring braces. Again, find a better neurologist. I had it done. I had it 3 days in a row, then a day off, then my fourth treatment, another day off, and the fifth and final treatment. It made the biggest difference in my recovery, but it is EXPENSIVE. He has high deductible low premium plan through work and an HSA that idk how much he contributes to. Basically everything up to $2500 he has to cover the copay and everything after that is covered. At this point I would pay the $2500 myself. I think part of the reason he has not gone to another doctor is because he does not want to pay the money. At this point it is half finding out what treatment he needs to improve his condition and half convincing him to actually do it. I figured the neurologist at The Cleveland Clinic would probably be one of the best. At this point he is kind of shut down and is not seeking more help. He just deals with it, bitches about it and goes to work. He flies to Kentucky for work on Monday and comes home on Thursday and is not taking the time to really seek further treatment. I really do not understand his mindset. Before he got diagnosed, he was in a really low place and  got very drunk and asked me to promise to put a bullet in his head if he ended up too paralyzed to do it himself. It is half finding out what he needs to do and half convincing him to make it happen at this point. Please help him find some mental health therapy for this - GBS and CIDP are often comorbid with depression, because it is a huge, negative change to what you can do in life. Losing mobility and dealing with chronic pain is massively upsetting. If it is been ongoing for over a year, that sounds like CIDP. He needs to see a neurologist who specializes in this. \n\nHe needs help on several levels. Please do not indulge his suicidal tendencies - extreme chronic pain can make people suicidal. He needs a doctor who can help. Money is not worth more than being alive. I get his perspective - I had a relapse and did not want to go to the hospital for fear of costs. Is Medicare an option? If not, look into teaching hospitals - it will not be as good, but the charges are way lower.", "Question about symptoms ", "Monthly discussion topic: GBS and pregnancy One big goal of this subreddit is to collect experiences - GBS varies so widely and is rare enough that it can be hard for people to know if what they are experiencing is normal or even part of GBS.\n\nEach month, we will put up a new topic to help spark discussion and create a future repository of experiences.\n\nThis month's topic is pregnancy, either while enduring GBS or afterwards. Have you noticed any side effects? Have you been able to be safely pregnant during/after GBS? What effects have residuals had on pregnancy if you have gotten pregnant after GBS? Any other related issues you want to discuss? Personally quite interested in this topic and I hope we get some good discussion. I personally have ovarian cysts and I have nfi if that is related to GBS. I get massive pains in my abdomen each month from them, but it kind of melds into full body nerve pain sometimes. Technically, the doctors say I have PCOS, but my symptoms are very light - just cysts, weight gain in lower abdomen and rare periods (3-4 months without one without birth control, 7 years without one on hormonal IUD).\n\nProbably infertile, wonder is GBS is a factor (had it in prepubescence). Also curious how safe it is to have a child after GBS - I have read epidurals are a big no. Anything else unexpected? Popping back in here to add my 2 cents to this discussion! \n\nHaving children was one of the scariest things for me because there is so little information. Even now I can talk about my experience with this, but we have really no way of knowing how normal my experience is, given the lack of studies on pregnancy in general and the fact that this disease tends to be very individualized. So obligatory take all this with a grain of salt/ consult with your doctor.\n\nHere is my pregnancy experience, start to finish:\n\nI got CIDP when I was five and it has never gone into remission for me, I am constantly medicated with IVIG (idk if that is important). When I was 8 I went to Mayo Clinic to talk to the CIDP experts of the time and during the work up they flat out told my mom that pregnancy was a total no go for me, and they actually told me and my mom that there was like a 33% chance that I would die!?!?! So that was crazy and crushing. \n\nPregnancy #1:\n\nAt 20 my IUD failed and I got pregnant. I still believed what I had been told all those years ago so I was very scared, my home health nurse at the time said that she only knew of one other person who got pregnant with CIDP and that the pregnancy actually put her CIDP into remission, so that was a glimmer of hope for me. \n\nSo I go see my neurologist and it turns out she has actually helped two other CIDP patients through their pregnancies and it ended fine for both of them. She was very encouraging with me and I decided to plow ahead. She advised that I stop the IVIG and start doing prednisone pushes. I was very hesitant because I am very dependent on my IVIG, about 3 days after a missed treatment I can feel the symptoms come back and about 1 week after a missed treatment I start regressing pretty hard. But to my surprise I went off the treatment completely and I was totally fine. I had to stop taking my Gabapentin (Neurontin), and that was fine too. I said that I would only do a prednisone push when I needed it because I react very badly to steroids and have worked very hard to stay off them at any cost. I did not end up needing any prednisione because I was completely asymptomatic through the entire pregnancy. I had a total Pinocchio moment, I was a real girl! No meds, no symptoms, no weakness, it was amazing, I wish I could be surrogate to other people so I could experience more of it. \n\nThe pregnancy came and went without any complications. I gave birth in a hospital under epidural, after using pitocin to get things started, healthy baby. My neuro said I should try to breast feed as long as possible because the hormone involved in breastfeeding, Prolactin, has been shown in studies to be great for neuro damage. That did not pan out despite my best efforts, but that is an issue that runs in family, so it is unrelated to CIDP. The recovery was fine too, about 3 months post partum I started to feel my symptoms creep back and I went back on IVIG at that point. \n\nPregnancy #2:\n\n18 months later I made the decision to do it again and went back to neuro. She said it should be fine but this time I would stay on IVIG, I think some new information had come out that made her think this would be better. It was another smooth pregnancy, this one went into an emergency c-section because the baby was in distress. Having now had one, I do not recommend c-sections, but what we have is what we have. The recovery for this one was a little harder, I had to go from receiving treatment every 4 weeks to receiving treatment every 3 weeks because I was feeling symptoms again, back up to 4 weeks now. Same issue with the breastfeeding. Healthy baby.\n\nHere is some extra thoughts I have had:\n-CIDP historically reacts very badly to hormones, I personally experienced this when I went through puberty, I actually thought I was going to die (like my doctor asked make a wish flew me out to Europe to see France before I died, 10/10 would recommend) and that seems to be very common to other people I have talked to, but for whatever reason I have not (in my limited, anecdotal, personal experience) seen this same phenomenon with the hormones associated with pregnancy. It seems to be puberty and menopausal hormones specifically. But this could be why I was given such a dire statistic by the doctors at the Mayo clinic. Maybe?\n\n-I have asked so many doctors about the odds of my children having CIDP and they all tell me that it is just not possible. GBS/CIDP requires an environmental stimulus, it is not related to genetics. \n\n-I wonder if it is possible for pregnancy to trigger a relapse in someone who is in remission, but its okay for people not in remission, because like, hello already got the dang thing. \n\n-IVIG is considered safe for pregnancy and there is actually a lot of information on this because it is used to off label to help prevent miscarriages in the first trimester and its used in the third trimester to treat chicken pox as this is deadly to the fetus. So there is a lot of info out there on this. \n\nTLDR; I have had two healthy pregnancies with CIDP, with and without IVIG. Neither pregnancy noticeably affected my disease long term. Both pregnancies were easy and both babies were and are healthy. 11/10 would recommend. I got pregnant 13 years after suffering from GBS. I fully recovered from GBS\u2014I was paralyzed but had no issues with breathing\u2014and had no residual issues. I was very worried about GBS reoccurring from vaccines or during the pregnancy.\n\nI did end up with Gestational diabetes and thyroid issues. I controlled the gestational diabetes through diet and had a natural birth at the Midwife Center.  I had no issues conceiving, but paralysis is something I will always worry about. \n\nWhat if it reoccurs again randomly? Or when I am elderly?  There is just so little known about GBS. I am constantly looking for more information to gain new understanding. Thank you for sharing! It really is scary, and I honestly think we are helping others by documenting our experiences here. Thank you for your amazing post! This is great to read and gives lots of hope to survivors, myself included! GBS My Journey My New Beginnings The Comeback ", "Autonomic nerve test and skin biopsy for CIDP? My wife is 32 years old and has not been feeling well. She saw a neurologist who performed an autonomic nerve test today. He suspects that she has nerve damage and CIDP. She has a skin biopsy scheduled for Monday that he says will confirm or deny it. Is this the normal course of testing for CIDP? Skin biopsy results could take up to 2 weeks to hear back so the wait sucks. Yes, if a diagnosis has not been reached, a biopsy will help confirm. This will show how much damage has been done to the nerves, as well as affirm neuropathy, which is needed for treatment. Usually an EMG is done before a biopsy. So if the biopsy shows nerve damage, that is all that is needed at this point to confirm? I am assuming there is nerve damage but was not confident on CIDP being the cause. It will show the extent.  And there might not be any nerve damage. It might just be the myelin that is damaged. That can heal.\nI think it can tell you a lot. CIDP attacks myelin, so the biopsy will show if that is the only damage, or if there is direct nerve damage. If it is just myelin, it could be CIDP. Matter of sequence I guess. If we are talking invasive tests that suck, it is usually lumbar puncture before skin or muscle biopsy. The puncture yields some conclusive results on what you are dealing with, and it rules GBS/CIDP in or out. Have not met anyone with this that did not have abnormal readings from that test. (High levels of proteins, otherwise normal)\n\nIf the fluid has high cell count but normal proteins, extremely likely it is not this but something else. \n\nA biopsy can show yep something is going on, but then they want the LP because lots of things can cause nerve damage. It can be a little much to endure both in such short order.\n\nSource: Two LPs, one muscle biopsy, one bone marrow biopsy, countless EmGs If it is just myelin, could it be something other than CIDP?\n\nThe doctor said the autonomic test showed something when muscle is at rest. He said that means there is nerve damage. Is it possible that despite that, the skin biopsy shows no damage?\n\nI guess I am hoping there is some other explanation to her nerve pain that is not nerve damage or CIDP. Did she have a nerve conduction test? What did that show? She saw a different neurologist a month ago. That doctor ordered the nerve conduction test. Another doctor did that test and said it was a pinched nerve. The ordering doctor saw the report and said it did not look right and referred her to a neuromuscular doctor. We got a second opinion from another neurologist where we got the above results. Have not seen the neuromuscular doctor yet.\n\nNone of her MRIs showed a pinched nerve though. Ok. Typically a nerve conduction test can show cidp. Why would the doctor only see a pinched nerve? That is way out of my scope of knowledge, sorry. Hopefully she has a great neurology team that can explain things better. I suggest writing a few questions down and sitting with the doctors to discuss. That is what I did. My doctor took the time to explain what they were doing and what it was testing and why. He also went over my results with me. Be firm that this is something that you really need. If the neurologist still is not sure if the nerve damage is caused by CIDP, they will do a biopsy because it will show if there is demyelination or axonal loss.  Has your wife gone through a nerve conduction/muscle test?  It is often used to help diagnose CIDP and rule out a pinched nerve.", "CVS questionnaire asks if you had GBS Hello, I have been scared to get the vaccine because I had gbs a few years back. My employer is now forcing it. I went to my local CVS and they have you fill out a short questionnaire before getting the shot. The last question on there asks if you have ever had GBS. I really was not expecting to see that question on there. I got scared and did not get it. I even spoke to the pharmacist there and she said to not get it, which is why that question is on there. What are you guys thoughts on this? I am in the same boat you are. My job is requiring the VAX and I just submitted my medical exemption form stating that I had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 from the flu vaccine when I was a child. I am low-key hoping they decline it so I can force them to fire me lol If you get one of the mRNA vaccines,ie: Pfizzer or Moderna, they are safe for us people who have a history of Gillian Barre. I have had both my vaccines without any issues. I had GBS and got the vaccine with no issues I checked with my neuro before the vaccine was even available and she told me \"COVID is a million times worse than GBS, get the vaccine when it is available\"\n\nI got both shots while in my second trimester of pregnancy. I had the exact same scenario happen. I am still debating what to do. You should talk with your primary care provider or neurologist regarding getting the vaccine instead of the pharmacist. They know your medical history and your specific risks when getting the vaccine. \n\nI got GBS (some variant of Miller Fisher) in Jan 2019. I talked to my neurologist about getting the vaccine and he 100% recommended it. The GBS CIDP Foundation also ( it. I got both doses of Pfizer around April/May of this year. No side effects. \n\nYou should get the vaccine. You should talk with your primary care provider or neurologist regarding getting the vaccine.\n\nI got GBS (some variant of Miller Fisher) in Jan 2019. I talked to my neurologist about getting the vaccine and he 100% recommended it. The GBS CIDP Foundation also recommends it. I got both doses of Pfizer around April/May of this year. No side effects.\n\nYou should get the vaccine. My husband had GBS in 2018 and was told by the neurologist that he should never get the seasonal flu shot as it could trigger a GBS flare-up/relapse.  \n\nWhen the vaccine for Covid came out, I asked my neurologist if my husband should get it or not, since he was told not to ever get a flu shot again. She said that he definitely should, and explained that while the *seasonal* flu shot could indeed trigger a flare-up, the composition of the Moderna/Pfizer Covid vaccine is completely different, and has not been shown to cause a relapse or GBS-related complications. Furthermore, she explained that, on the off chance the vaccine did cause a relapse, it would be FAR more mild than if he caught Covid \u201cin the wild\u201d and had a relapse due to that.  \n\nWhen I got both my shots, I asked the supervising doctor at each location if my husband should receive the vaccine despite formerly having GBS. Not only did they both confirm what my neurologist said about the formulation of the Covid shot being safe for GBS patients, but they also explained the purpose of the GBS question on the vaccine form. They said it is to keep track of the total number of GBS patients who receive the vaccine, so that if some people experience symptoms of a flare-up, researchers can compare those numbers to the *entire* vaccinated GBS population and check the statistics to make sure it is still safe &amp; effective for that group. That is the only reason the question is on the form. I feel like COVID is not as bad as GBS is??? On average? I had GBS 3 years ago; I also had Covid this past April. I got the Pfizer vax in August and have had no issues. I attended my neurologist two months ago and told me there was no issue for me to get the vaccine. I had GBS AMAN 10 years ago and still have some sequelae like muscle atrophy and general muscle weakness. I got the first pfizer shot 2 months ago and no issues, pending the second shot now.\n\n\nAlso im in a forum of people from my country who got GBS, and a couple of them joined this year as they got GBS after Covid infection, so it can happen either way.. I told the people that did mine that I had it and they asked if my neuro approved it and I said yes. In 1995, I got a severe case of GBS from a flu vaccine.  I was in ICU for 10 days, in the hospital for weeks, and it took me a year to be almost normal again.  I still have some residual neuropathy on and off to this day. My neurologist told me never to get a vaccine again as it might trigger GBS again.  When the Covid vaccines came out, I tried to contact my original neurologist to ask about the vaccines, but he had passed away in 2016.  So I emailed Johns Hopkins neurology department.  They told me to definitely get one of the mRNA vaccines.  They said I was more likely to get GBS again from getting Covid, than if I got the mRNA vaccines.  So I got the Pfizer vaccine.  It did trigger a little bit of neuropathy after the second vaccine, but it was because I got dehydrated.  I recommend to hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!!!  Now I am fine and relieved to have gotten the vaccine.  The J&amp;J vaccine is the one that has the GBS warning associated with it.  I hope this helps relieve your anxieties about it a little bit. GBS is by far the most pain and suffering I have ever experienced, how can someone who has presumably never experienced GBS say anything is a million times worse?\nI got GBS from the Covid vax (first dose), I will not be getting the second I got both shots and the booster.  The cvs pharmacist who gave me my booster asked about me saying I had gbs on the questionnaire but just wanted to make sure I did not get gbs from a previous covid vaccine.\n\nGot my first two shots at a community center and was not even asked then.", "GBS support group started on reddit! Hi Everyone,\n\nThree of us here on reddit started a support group for GBS that is connecting via ZOOM. We met for the first time last night for about an hour and it was awesome to meet/connect! \n\nWe want to try to expand the group, so please let me know if any of you are interested in connecting with us! Feel free to direct message me, or comment here and I will message you with the details.\n\nThe more the merrier :) we look forward to hearing your stories. I am... have you thought about a group chat? I second this. I am not from the US and differences in time zones might make it slightly difficult for me to join the Zoom/Meet calls, and I would very much like to be a part of a support group in any form or shape.   We have talked about that. Ill be in touch later! Yay! Thanks. I am interested too :) sure I will Please include me. I am looking for feedback/views on the Covid shot. I have concerns but am feeling the social pressure to get one. I am vaccinated. I will message you. Interested interested, thx!", "I just found this community and wanted to share my story. I was a fit 21 year old junior in college when I was diagnosed in Late 2013.  The onset was only 3 days that I was aware of and I then spent the next 15 days in the hospital, being paralyzed for 8 of them. Insurance company refused inpatient rehab and the outpatient rehab they approved only last 3 weeks.\nA year later I felt weak, but I was able to function.  No working out, no physical labor, but I could go to class and do enough to get by.  Due to a lack of what I was dealing with I chalked the \"long term\" weakness to depression and the weight gain that accompanied the inability to move and the hit to my metabolism from my lack of exercise.  It would take 2 years to figure out the constant fatigue and weakness was not depression, but residual weakness and the long term effects of GBS.  \nAfter all of that I cannot really complain about my experience.  I have read horror stories of people that survive GBS and never fully recover or people who faced symptoms much worse than mine.  I am fat and I have underdeveloped muscles in ankles, shoulders and biceps, but I can still live a decent life.  Weight loss is my current goal, but my set of muscle that are affected by weakness makes most exercise difficult to keep up over time, and I have been told by a couple doctors that my metabolism has been indelibly affected and I will always have a low functioning metabolism.\n\nIf you have nay questions just ask. Thanks for sharing your story. I am glad you recovered as much as you did, but I am sorry to hear you are still dealing with lingering affects. In my experience, PT/OT are the single most important services we can provide to help recovery with GBS, and the fact that insurance companies will skimp on it is super frustrating.\n\nMy wife was 25, in the first couple months of her master's degree when she developed GBS. It was about a week, with 1 failed attempt at admittance to the hospital (misdiagnosis), before she got admitted and treated. By the time she was admitted, she was paralyzed from the hips / shoulders outward. She spent a week in the hospital, and discharged with a walker (which she could not really use yet)\n\nLuckily we had a big support group to help get her to her PT appointments, as I spent all my PTO caring for her in the week she was ill but not hospitalized and had to get back to work. It took her a year to really get to feeling like herself, and she still 'tests' her hands and feet if they feel tingly.\n\nAfter dealing with GBS, I am sure you can take control of the lingering affects in time. You seem have a great attitude which does wonders. As variable as the syndrome is, so is the aftermath. Your recovery may not look like anyone else's, so keep plugging away at what feels right for you! :) Sharing your story is a good thing. We know what you have been through and understand your frustration. Keep working at it and be sure to share your progress.  I turned 19 in early 2013 when I had GBS. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also deal with constant fatigue and am also trying to get in shape but it is hard. DM me if you want to chat.", "This book was really helpful for an inside perspective. My so is father noticed numbness at work in 1975. He was taken to an ER and never went home.\n\nUltimately, he was one of the very few cases that remained paralyzed for the rest of his life. He lived until 2013. He recommended this book! \n\nNo Laughing Matter ( I had no idea this existed. Thanks! His also wrote Catch-22, one of the funniest reads EVER, Great read! It is linked in the wiki, but I am so bad at finishing that, so I am not surprised anyone noticed hahaha Check the wiki! (It is basically like half of it  we need some more GBS representation!) It is a candid and raw review of life with GBS. We are fairly certain that his Dad was listed at the end. I found it a rough read because it is so personal to what we go through, but for that same reason I consider it a seminal read for anyone going through it and their loved ones. I may have my husband give it a read just to help him understand more.\n\nLorenzo's Oil is also good, in that same vein. It is about a different illness, but the onset is similar and it can be very helpful for friends and family to watch that to understand what we have gone through.", "Foot drop, Sciatic enlargement - Starting IVIg A long post but this seems like the best place in the world to share it. Before my wife and I met (6years ago - she was 27) she apparently never noticed any difficulties in walking (she actually ran marathons). After marriage we used to go on long walks together and I noticed a very very slight slap of her right foot but always thought she is just tired. She got pregnant in 2018 and delivered c-section (by choice). During her pregnancy she had to take Thyroid medication and later got diagnosed with Hashimotos disease. Post pregnancy recovery, you could really notice her right foot limp / drop. Since then, the entire of 2020 we have tried to find a diagnosis. Spinal tap, blood reports, full body MRIs, EMGs, sural nerve biopsy, Pet scans etc etc. Things that could be seen were 1) Sciatic Nerve Enlargement 2) Oligoconal Band detected in CSF and Serum both (negative result) 3) First Ana profile was negative, a year later repeat test showed extremely small positive (doctor said high cases of false positive) 4) Muscle wasting below the knee - right foot 5) Sural biopsy showed mild dymylineation and axonal loss. She has no pain but now the foot drop and muscle wasting is getting worse despite continuous physiotherapy. Later EMG/MRI shows that despite taking Hansen\u2019s medication (she is from India) for 8 months there is been no improvement in the Sciatic nerve. She was also on steroids (30mg for a week and then tapered). We are not sure of the steroids helped or not. In addition, post pregnancy she has had high Bilrubin (1.7) and gall bladder stones (last we checked they were not blocking anything). In recent couple of months she seems to be losing weight as well. I do not know if any of this is connected but wanted to mention it.\n\nNow the doctors (we have consulted around the world) are unable to diagnose it without a Fascicular Sciatic nerve biopsy which a risky procedure apparently. We might still have to do it some day but the best guess right now focal CIDP and we are scheduled to start 5day course of IVIG next week. If this does not work then the biopsy might be done (will try to get it done in Mayo Clinic). \n\nFrom my personal research, I feel it really could be anything (Autoimmune, CIDM/CIDP, Amyloidosis, Sarcoidosis, Lupus, MS, Sjogren, MMN, GBS, Piriformis Syndrome etc) but it is difficult to diagnose without the sciatic biopsy.\n\nI just wanted to share our story and keep it updated going forward, in the hope that it helps us as well as someone else out there. \n\nWould love to hear any similar experiences, anything that jumps out, what to expect from IVIG, when could we expect to start seeing results, are future doses needed (as our doctor has not talked about it much - said if this works we can start oral immunosuppressant for maintenance), sciatic biopsy experiences, etc. Personally for me with IVIG, it is most important for it to be room temp and free of tiny bubbles to help prevent the headache. A pooling bag helps a lot. I had to go to infusing by gravity as the pump worked the protein and pushed bubbles. I could run a whole infusion in by gravity in 2.5-3 hours and not get the headache. Hydration prior of course, not cold liquids if possible. I have never heard of bubbles causing headaches before.  Is this common knowledge somewhere?  \n\nI used to get headaches with IVIG, but then when I had to go to a different hospital they gave the infusion simultaneously with fluids, and I did not get a headache.  Since then I have been getting fluids through IV before my infusion (because my doctor prefers it this way), and I have not gotten one headache!  The pump being used, the drip rate, and every other variable is unchanged, so it has to be adding the fluids, and not taking out bubbles.  \n\nAlso, prior to getting the fluids through IV, I would hydrate myself well, starting the night before.  However, I always drank icewater, which you also said not to have cold fluids.  Why is that? My neurologist treats CIDP patients regularly as part of his practice. He typically sees patients go through an 18 month course of IVIG and then go into complete remission. (95% of his patients do, he has told me)\n\nI was only able to do a few rounds when I was diagnosed before insurance kicked me out. After a long battle I finally got back on. Before restarting we did fresh EMGs and a skin biopsy and he could see some of my nerve fibers were actually showing significant recovery. He thinks I will only need 3 months of IVIG. In my case my health was being wrecked actively by environmental conditions and improving those conditions made a big difference. I have experienced a reduction in paresthesia (those \u201coff\u201d nerve sensations) but I am sick in many other ways that IVIG may or may not help. \n\nA couple recommendations - work closely with a neurologist or your most trusted practitioner during IVIG. If you do not have a functional medicine practitioner on your team, I would recommend them because they look systemically at issues and do not stick to one region. For me it is breaking me financially because they are out of network but I was out of options for dealing with my complex case.\n\nI also recommend that if she has any history of migraines, she should have her doctor include a saline drip at the beginning of IVIG and also drink a ton of water herself. Dehydration can cause headaches and migraines and the saline helps. I would also recommend getting some magnesium supplements such as from MagOx because constipation can be a side effect and they help especially if you load them for a week before starting treatment. \n\nIf she has difficulty with injections, and if her doctors think she will be on IVIG for a long time, she can look into a picc line or mediport. \n\nBest wishes to you, she is going through a lot. Glad she has you. Thank you. We are been hydrating well. 8 hours before she starts her first dose. Will keep this thread updated from time to time. First I have heard of bubbles so will be on the lookout as well as the gravity thing Thank you so much for sharing. It seems like you are going through a lot. Be strong and am glad you have a good practitioner. We are currently on the other side of the world with limited options and worst part is that this is undiagnosed and just a best guess. Still I do like our lead neurologist especially as he is open to suggestions from all over the world. He is the one talking to neurologists in the US, Singapore, etc on our behalf. I agree about the complex case thing, as even she has so many other issues that it could be related to any of them. For now we are so tired of trying to find a diagnosis that we would like to start some sort of treatment first prior to traveling to the US. Thank you for the recommendations on the saline line, magnesium, and others. I will talk to them about it today or atleast once after her first dose is done and see how she reacts. If you do not mind, could you share what sort of other health issues, and environmental factors (and what changes you made)? Who knows these are some things we have not thought of? Cold liquids can constrict your peripheral veins and make it hard for your nurse to stick you. I found the bubbles/gravity out by accident when my pump was acting crazy and we just ran it by gravity with the pooling bag. I think the little cheap pump mashed the solution a lot and worked the protein like beating an egg, and we were always having to stop and thump bubbles out of the line. Room temp and gravity, I cannot explain it. IV hydration makes me feel worse, gives me palpitations. I am on Hizentra now, do not miss the IV game of super hydration and headache chicken. Oh and a tip for all IV infusers without a port: demand the pharmacy buy Braun angiocaths and send them. They just freaking do not hurt and do not cause blowouts in your veins. They will make your nurse into a stick wizard. Braun 20 French for the win, guys. Interesting!  I wonder why the nurses do not know that the cold liquids constrict the Peripheral Veins?\n\nIs the Hizentra a sub-q treatment?  How long have you been treated with it, and what is your schedule like?  Any negative side effects for you?\n\nI am really glad I found a way out of the headache, and feeling like I was hit by a truck the rest of the day, with IV fluids before the infusion.  Glad you found a way out, too! I kind of think you have to be on both sides of it to realize some of the finer points of getting stuck. The Hizentra is sub q and is just easier on your system in general. Weekly doses keep me from the roller coaster of IG highs and lows. That is fantastic!  How long have you been on this treatment, and how much do you need to inject?\n\nMy doctors and I were discussing it a few appointments ago as a next step if going to biweekly infusions did not keep me from declining again.  Thankfully, I have been doing well with the biweekly infusions, and have stopped the roller coaster.  I would go from independent to dependent in a weeks time waiting for the next infusion.  It was hell, especially mentally.  Glad I am not dealing with that anymore! Happy to help. I discovered that I was living with an infestation of mold in my apartment and i had been exposed for a year and half. The discovery process and shitty remediation from the apartment company\u2019s vendor led me to get very ill and exposed many more of my belongings, so I have lost most everything I owned and cared about and have also lost all my savings to medical care. I moved to a different apartment in the same unit, which is still bad for me, but the extremely high mold levels are not an issue anymore. I also boxed up everything I could not bear to get rid off and I am not touching anything I was not able to thoroughly clean. \n\nAt the height of the mold impact I was not only getting neurological and immune problems but also psychological problems. Mold can cause depression and anxiety and it was really extreme. Since I moved, the psychological extremes are gone, and the neurological symptoms have improved. However my immune disorder is out of whack and I am on a 6-12 month progress to try to get better. My functional medicine doctor checked me for all kinds of things: Lyme and co-infections, viruses like EBV and HHV6 included. I have a co infection of Lyme disease, I have viruses in my system (widespread in population) that are contributing to systemic issues. \n\nI have hypothyroid, dysautonomia, POTS, mast cell activation syndrome, vitamin D deficiency. I was diagnosed with chronic inflammatory response syndrome where your body does not know how to turn off the inflammation process. And I have been on IVIG for CIDP. Also have a migraine disorder totally under control thanks to Emgality which is a wonder drug. \n\nSorry this is a total mess, and a lot, but feel free to ask me anything. Before the mold, I did not have CIDP symptoms, but I did have a number of these chronic conditions. Since the mold, everything is exacerbated, I cannot eat almost anything and my body overreacts to everything. I am sorry again for what you all are going through! The mold issue is incredibly unfortunate. I could not in my wildest dreams imagine something like this could happen due to mold. And it angers me that you had to lose so much to this. I am sorry you have had to go through this but really speaks to your strength as a human to keep going so well. Thank you for sharing. I will make sure to keep a lookout for any such symptoms so that we can hopefully be ahead of the curve! Thank you, you are very kind. &lt;3 One of GBS's characteristics is that it is a rapid-onset syndrome. She would not have had GBS for 8 months and not noticed (and it also would not persist for 8 months). CIDP could be a potential worth looking into, but it sounds very localized. Oh I am so glad she has a diagnosis. Of course I would rather that you were both healthy and had not had to go through all this. I do not know what the treatment looks like for that disorder, I hope you have gotten some meaningful next steps? I am so happy for you :) The thing is when you find the right experts, they just know. I got my CIDP diagnosis because my neurologist happened to already be a specialist in this rare disorder, AND he thinks a lot of people are getting diagnosed with fibro who should be diagnosed with this based on his research and networking in the medical community. He knew what to look for. I am so glad the Mayo Clinic did that for you!", "Vibrating in feet Right now both my feet have a vibrating feeling going through them. I am **pretty sure** this is not the first time since I now have nerve damage from the GBS, but the feeling has me nervous. I know people say tingling is a sign or symptom of GBS, but now I am not sure if I am correctly telling the difference. My anxiety has been very high lately.. I got GBS in 2017. I had a cold this past September, but thankfully that is gone now. I hope. Not sure if this has anything to do with it, but when I had GBS and my nerves were starting to heal I developed tremors. It was not from the GBS though, it was from the anxiety medication they had me on. I am not on anxiety medication, but I probably should be lol. But, yeah I was thinking maybe it is my nerves in general or something. Because it is definitely happened before but I think I am just more on edge or alert now. I had a similar feeling but only a few times the first month or so after recovery. \n\nAs for anxiety, I still get a bit freaked out every time a limb \u201cgoes to sleep\u201d on me.  My GBS event was in 2010.   I am not sure when or if those little freak outs will stop. \n\nGood luck out there. Gotcha. Yeah, my nerves issue went on longer than that but have mostly chilled out now.\n\nUnderstandable and I feel the same. Like I will always be nervous about it.\n\nGood luck to you too! After my episode of GBS I too developed an extreme case of anxiety (general anxiety, panic attacks, you name it I got it) but I started to notice that when my anxiety would go up I would start to experience that tingling/trembling feeling in my feet, hands and face like I did when my symptoms started to show. I dont know if it was psychosomatic or if it was an actual reaction of my damaged nerves reacting to my anxiety. I would suggest to get into some therapy or support groups to help you process this traumatic event, it took me awhile to finally realize how much of a psychological impact it had on me, but after working through the trauma and anxiety that the GBS caused, those symptoms started to fade. I was also on gabapentin and it helped a lil bit, but if your experiencing anxiety I really suggest the therapy to help you through this. It can be scary sometimes, I felt like  I was going through something that noone else has experienced but your not alone in those feelings. Good luck on your journey. I am 20 years out for GBS, and I am right there with you still. Arms fall asleep very easily and it is a deep hard sleep. \n\nI have found that it is just something that you just learn to live with.", "2020 Summit Who will be attending the virtual summit this year?  Below is the link to register.\n\n( Thanks for posting this! It is a great year to attend as it is virtual and free due to the pandemic, so it is a rare opportunity to see what it is like and hear some helpful information. You are most welcome. was not aware of this, thanks!", "Looking for info: Can the reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus in patients who got GBS after prior mono infection yield another case of GBS? I am reading that there is a possibility that Covid-19 can reactivate the dormant Epstein-Barr virus in people who have already recovered from the primary EBV infection, being mono. Would people who contracted GBS from EBV get another case of GBS given a reactivation of EBV in their body? I know this is a specific question but it is driving me crazy... want to know if I am staring another case of GBS in the face.\n\n(\n\nMy background: I had a mild case of GBS after a bout of mono caused by the Epstein-Barr virus about 2 years ago. I fortunately had a mild case and retained muscle function and reflexes, the only real reason I was admitted to the hospital was because of a facial palsy I developed along with tingling and numbness in hands and feet. I received immunoglobulin therapy. This corner of Reddit is full of people who have had experiences with GBS.  We are not really medical folks, or GBS researchers.\n\nI strongly suggest you go talk to a doctor.", "Care package My sister was just diagnosed on Friday and I want to send her a great care package. What are some things that brought you some extra joy and comfort?", "GBS healing process Hi guys, I got out of the hospital 2 weeks ago after 5 day IVIG.  What is healing like? any stinging pain associated with it ? and what did you feel first, i keep waking you everyday hoping the numbness is not there. Hi there, my partner is about 3 months removed from in patient therapy. The numbness we have been told is the last to go, but the pain is slowly calming down. Not nearly as fast as she would like, but the progress is there. She has a patch of one of her feet that she can feel, and otherwise nothing from the ankles down. \n\nHer Doctor from Lenox hill told us an interesting tidbit - nerves regrow 1 millimeter per day which is why the recovery often takes so much time. Stick with your PT and keep some sort of record for yourself to track the small victories along the way. \n\nHope this helps! thank you, it does ! i hope your partner has a speedy recovery Same to you! If you ever have any questions for a fellow GBS warrior, happy to ask her. My partner is a 2014 survivor after a flu shot. Not diagnosed for 4 days, almost wheelchair bound, but now just his hands and feet still tingle, and 80% feeling back in feet. It is as good as it gets. He came within an hour of being vented. He is used to the feeling now. I cannot rub his arms and touch his feet with mine. Sex is good, but he pays for it after.  You get used to it, and know what works and what does not.  The positive, he is alive and brain untouched. He did not walk for 4 months, but life is pretty good now. Take care of yourself and know it WILL get better. Healing is going to be a lengthy process. Remember you may never get back to 100% where you were. You will get to a \"new normal\". The pain goes away first, numbness will be after that. You are going to be weak. Make sure to do all of your PT and OT. I did not do facial exercises and almost 3 years out I still have some (noticeable to me) facial weakness. My balance is probably 90% of what it was, endurance probably 85%, and strength is probably 90%.\n\nTake care of yourself, be kind to yourself. PM if you want someone to talk to :) thank you for your kind words, does sex trigger numbness and pain more? is that what you meant by suffers after thank youu \u2764\ufe0f yes, just a little bit of the sharp spiky pains, you know, the \"snaps\" he calls them. Not too long, but totally worth it! ;-)  I love him...that is all that matters. yesss! that is what is most important Over 1 year since I was diagnosed and I still have numbness in my toes and arch of my foot. I have learned to live with it and I am used to it now, does not bother me or limit me i have the same thing as well. however, it does bother me. any tips on how you got over it? for me, it is more of a mental block I am a competitive cyclist who has fully recovered and is stronger than I was before. So when I am riding I do up my shoes really tight and have custom orthotics to kind of lock my feet out of the equation. I would not fare to well as a runner or a jumper as my arch and toes are still a bit weak. I am a competitive cyclist who has fully recovered and is now stronger than I was before. So when I am riding I do up my shoes really tight and have custom orthotics to kind of lock my feet out of the equation. I would not fare to well as a runner or a jumper as my arch and toes are still a bit weak. But I just kind of work around it, the numbness are tingling is just a part of me now ;) Hi! Hope you are doing well.\nI felt sever back pain at first but it went away within 2 weeks.\nI did not have pain in legs or sensation abnormalities. I only had motor abnormalities from toes to thighs.\nThe advices I can give you  are these:\n1- be patient. Healing takes time and it is important to keep a good mentality while you are healing.\n2- if you have motor abnormalities nothing will restore them EXCEPT physiotherapy and aquatic therapy. \nGood luck! Hi there!  I had facial paralysis, extremely weak legs and arms, and lots of nerve tingling.  One thing I recall was that my muscles kept twitching even in the face.  It was kind of a neat sensation, but I knew that the nerves were reconnecting.  I also had severe muscle atrophy, so my legs and back were constantly in pain.  The other thing was the constant pins and needles in the fingers and toes, which always felt uncomfortable and \u201ccold\u201d.  I am almost at my 4 year \u201canniversary\u201d of GBS, and those symptoms are almost a distant memory.\n\nI know everyone is different, and the one thing that I would have done differently was to seek counselling earlier than later.  As another poster mentioned, it is a \u201cnew normal\u201d and dependent on your life stage and what you used to be able to do before, you may be unknowingly hard on yourself at first.  I still suffer from fatigue - it is still there but it is not as severe as before. \n\nCelebrate each day as a victory :) good luck we are all with you on this journey!  I was diagnosed with GBS about 3 years ago at 33yo. I spent about a month away from home between being diagnosed in the hospital (spinal tap/nerve conduction studies) then PT afterwards to learn how to walk again.\n\nI was fortunate enough that it never spread higher than my rib cage, but I still have lingering numbness in my lower extremities. It is terribly annoying, and I still walk with a cane most of the time, especially in colder weather. However, most people who see me walking without it would never guess I cannot feel my legs/feet.\n\nI genuinely hope you regain feeling, but DO NOT let it discourage you if you do not. Besides the recovery and lingering annoyance, very little has changed in my life. thank you. i wish you good health also and hope the numbness go aways I had it on my legs and i do football now. When you get out of the hospital you usually have to take pills for around 7 or more years at least i did every morning and night. The best way to heal is training the part you were paralyzed to have better muscles or nerve power. I was five at the time and im 13 now. One thing that was a nightmare and still is, is the leg pain that comes within every month. I had leg pain every month at least once at night. I havent done a lot of research on this disease i had though so my paragraph of a text may be wrong at some parts Im so happy my grandmom reacted instanly after there was something wrong with my legs. Im good now but if feel paralyzed for a few seconds sometimes I find that my arms and legs \"fall asleep\" *much* quicker than they did pre-GBS. Even a minute in the wrong position and it is back to the pins and needles. (which is now my least-favorite non-pain sensation) Ive almost conpletely recovered i just got a check and nearly to 100% but my nerves let mw down for some reason sometimesfl for a second or so. It just did it right now It is a learning process, to relearn even the basic abilities. Like eating, cleaning yourself up. I am learning how to walk all over again, so there is both good and bad days. Gbs is not really fun but you learn how to handle it somehow!", "GBS / CIDP recovery I was diagnosed with CIDP and started medication and IVIG in June 2020 but stoppped the IVIG in November due to severe headaches. I am doing much better not fully recovered yet but my muscle mass and weight is very low. I was wondering how long it took others to recover their muscle and be able to gain back some weight? Thanks! Took me around 1 month to get some weight and muscle back. Still working on it - weight training 4-5 times a week and I feel that with cidp its tougher for me to gain muscle. I am also not on any treatment as I seem to be stable. Just wondering are you in remission or are you worsening now that you have stopped treatment? Thank you for your response! I am actually still on treatment a low dose of prednisone as well as mycephenolate but I am doing much better now. I have an appointment next week with my neurologist to see if he is going to start lowering my dosage of medication to eventually get me off. I have been on IVIg for about 1.5 yrs and had a very slow recovery but since it took so long for me to be diagnosed some of what damage is done, is done.  I am a lucky camper  that a lot of PT I would like to be doing is prohibited by other doc's due to other medical issues currently in treatment for as well. \n\nI went from ~195lbs of muscle down to 145lbs at my worst.  Back to about 170 I think but point being everyone is different and when the condition is caught and your age and fitness when it happens makes for a zillion variables. \n\nI do not think I will ever regain muscle mass in lower legs and lower arms but that does not mean I cannot get stronger.  I no longer care what I look like to other people if I am walking under my own power and not tied to a chair.  \n\nI am sure you know this but if not you can still be administrated IVIg but on a drip rather than an infusion pump. (just takes way longer per treatment)  That and extreme hydration can really help.  You can also inquire about in home treatments if your insurance will pay for it making it a bit more comfortable.\n\nLast note, if available where you live medical marijuana has made a world of difference for me rather than pharmaceuticals.  It was never my thing but figured I would try it at the ripe age of 47. LOL\n\nGood luck but I am pretty sure you got this! Great to hear you are doing well and good luck! Hope you are able to eventually get off medication and go into remission. I was in the best shape of my life complaining that my legs are getting too big with all the muscle just before this cidp came out of nowhere. Lol. Thank you for all the tips! It is all about remaining positive and not giving up! I lost a ton of weight because my autoimmune problems are so intense that I get numb from eating food. At this point it is any kind of food. The more inflammatory the worse it is. For a while I had trouble eating enough calories in a day and was passing out. I have since stabilized but my diet is entirely meat, fish, vegetables and fat. I have CIDP and have been in and out of IVIG. I lost about 20 pounds rapidly and I am adjusting. \n\nThe main issue I have had lately gaining muscle is that I am now going numb in reaction to lifting weights. However, I restarted a previous PT program and I was recently able to move up a band to tougher exercise. It is just very slow going because exercise that was no problem in the past now causes that out of whack immune response. I was also able to ice skate without my feet going completely numb. \n\nI have been through a lot with multiple autoimmune disorders and it is hard for me to tell right now if IVIG is making a difference. It used to be really clear and I would be much more stable right after getting my dose. Now I cannot tell but it was so hard to get approved for it, I do not want to stop. Before having GBS my weight was 170 lb. I was in the ICU for a month, plus a week more in a normal room. I lost about 30 lb during that time. Five months later, I am at 150 lb eating as healthy as I can. I got diagnosed with Guillain Barr\u00e8 a year and a half ago since I have been tested for myasthenia gravis as well because I am not improving despite being on IVIG infusion still. I also get severe headaches with IVIG and nauseous I generally have to drink a lot of Gatorade sometimes that helps prevent the symptoms. A have recovered slightly but have a long road ahead of me. My speech is still off my vision is suffering greatly with three conditions diplopia strabismus and nystagmus I went from 110 when I first got sick then to 91 now I am 85 pounds Im so sorry for everything you have been through! Have you been in any other medications besides IVIG because my neurologist put me on prednisone as well as mycophenolate and they have some side affects like nausea at first but I do feel that I have improved with them. \nAlso through all of this I feel that my vision has worsened too unfortunately! Yes I have also been on prendsone sadly the only thing it gave me was acne lol. Gabapentin helped a lot with the pain but I requested to lower my dose to a very minimal one because the side effects pertain to dizziness vision issues etc my neurologist said my dose was so low that it should not cause those issues. My first symptom with Guillain Barr\u00e8 was vision issues I complained I could not see right double vision and blurry it only got worse over the next few days along with weak and brain fog until one day I could not walk anymore I also had stomach issues I thought I had the stomach flu A few months before I was diagnosed with CIDP I was having extremely bad vision I remember sitting in my classes and not being able to focus on big words right in front of me. I was not even aware that I had CIDP yet because i was still able to walk although I did notice my balance was worse than usual. Then slowly I noticed I could not pick up my feet or run and eventually not even bend my toes. I was dragging my legs to walk the bare minimum and if I had to leave my house I needed a wheel chair.  \n\nI also got a lot of acne at first from prednisone as well as facial swelling. I naturally have chubby cheeks but my entire face swelled up a lot. I was on 40mg at the time and a few months in my dr lowered my dose to 20mg which did help the swelling and acne go down but I still have flare ups. I was diagnosed with CIDP in September 2020 and started IVIG therapy in October.  I initially would get headaches and acne, but I was prescribed prednisone, benedryl, and iv fluid.  I now just get the iv fluid pre and post ivig. No longer have side effects.\n\nMuscle loss has been a huge issue.  My weight fluctuates, but on average, I am down about 15 pounds.  The strength in my hands and arms is better - can open bottles and carry groceries when I could not before ivig.  The muscle in my legs and ankles remains an issue and both are very weak.  I will probably get physical and occupational therapy after my neurologists sees me next. Jeraldporterfield \n     I agree on medical marijuana. I do not like it. But for those that can take it all is well. I brought up microdosing on a mother site and got my words torn apart. If it does not hurt you why not try it, we are on our last hope here b", "Just found this sub - amazing Hey there! I have been reading through this sub and it sounds like you are a group of exceptional people. There is a lot of strength in here. I thought I would pop in to say hi, share a bit of my story and hang around for a bit! It is been 17 years since my bout with GBS and I have found myself thinking back a lot recently. If any one wants to chat to me about being a long way down the line from GBS, or anything at all, then feel really welcome. Please do.\n\nRecently I have wanting to reconnect with my experiences of it, and how it is lead me to be the person I am today. I also recovered from COVID in April, and that definitely has led me to think about life a bit! \n\nI got AIDP in 2003, when I was 13, off of the back of Laryngitis. This was in a very small town in NZ, and no one had a clue what was going on. GBS was known about but they had disregarded it because I was so young. Within a day I had major weakness, and I was put into quarantine at hospital for 5 days while they tried to understand what was happening - I was not able to see any one, and the paralysis went through my limbs. Fortunately my torso was not greatly effected and I was able to breathe/digest unassisted. It was servere, but I was spared from how severe it can get. \n\nI had a 9 month recovery period, which was made challenging by the fact that few of my health providers had encountered GBS. So there was a fair bit of guess work going on. I am super tall as well,  by 13 I was 182cm / 6\" tall, and over those 9 months I grew another 4cm / inch and a half. So that definitely complicated things.\n\nI recovered though, missed a year of high school but was able to come back. A downside from the health care was that once I was walking well enough again, the rehab pretty much stopped. I had really significant muscle atrophe, and a long term impact was that my feet became deformed because my leg muscles did not redevelop with the proper balance.\n\nToday I am 2m / 6\"7 and I lead a normal life. About 18 months ago though I had a foot reconstruction, because walking was becoming really challenging due to my feet. What was crazy was when I woke from the anaesthetic, there was another guy opposite me in the room. He had just been diagnosed with GBS and was in his second day at hospital, what are the chances. I wish I had kept in touch with the guy.\n\nThe reconstruction worked well though, really well.  Since then I have been able to exercise, I have found a love for running, and I have just signed up for a half marathon in November (I am in New Zealand, we are so fortunate to have no community transmission of COVID here, and life is relatively normal). So lets do this.\n\nLooking back, my young self was a smiley kid. I quietly got on with things. Or that is how my brain has chosen to paint the picture. But as I am opening up, I am properly getting to appreciate the impact of it on those who were around me.\n\nSo, this ended up way longer than I would intended. But it is felt great to write this. It is been a strange comfort to me to read your stories, hear your thoughts, because I have never spoken much about this. To those of you who are experiencing GBS right now, I wish I could easily offer the same comfort, but I know each case can fall on such an incredible spectrum of unique. Maybe you may relate to some of this, maybe not.\n\nBut for me, this too did pass, and I have lead a rich life so far. If there is any way that talking to me could help, even if it is to just pass the time, then again please do feel welcome. Getting it as an adult is unfortunate, I cannot even imagine getting it as a kid. Other than your feet it sounds like you have recovered quite well! I got diagnosed at the end of February this year. They think it was due to Covid. I was lucky that the hospital I went to was familiar with GBS. I also understand the being tall thing. My daughter is 15 and 6'2 What an amazing story! Thank you for sharing your story with this sub. I have one question, did you resolve the muscle atrophy? If so, how did you work on that, or was it just something that resolved with time? You should look at Vibram Five Fingers shoes. They helped me to ditch the cane. Ah nice! For running or just day to day? I heard the same advice, but unfortunately my feet are too misshapen to wear them. I compromised for minimalist runners though, and they have been excellent, though took a bit to get used. Thanks! It felt good to do, so thanks for reading too!\n\nMy muscle mass returned to normal after I persevered with leading a normal life. I should have been using the pool more, and the gym, but did not have that long term rehab plan to lay it out. So my quad to hamstring ratio, and just all of the muscles involved with my gait were way off from how they should operate together.\n\nThe change to my soft tissue, and bone structure was then really gradual. It took a decade. So we had to do a fairly dramatic intervention to resolve an issue that could have been fixed with just doing calf raises, or yoga, etc.\n\nI know the rehab can be so taxing, and painful, and everything. But it is a gift to your future self, huh. Woah so Covid through to GBS? That is a wild ride, and really fresh too. You got this.\n\nHow awesome is that for your daughter, amazing to have such height. But also a huge challenge, I hope she is able to pride in it at that age. Does that make you tall as well? If so I can imagine the trouble with I will fitting wheelchairs and equipment, not to mention keeping people around that can actually assist in moving you. \n\nHope that your recovery is on track. Nope. I am short. I am only 5'3, so easy to handle. \ud83d\ude0f Her dad is 6'4. It is. My main hurdle right now is pain management. I got lucky my muscle memory came back quickly, so I was able to be walking unassisted by mid April. Still have some muscle weakness, so do PT everyday. Day to day, I am 6 2 and I am too heavy to run with it.", "Ontario Ministry of Health Guidelines for the Pfizer and Moderna Vaccinations I received this info sheet because I have a relative in assisted living and they are being vaccinated this week. I was going to link it to this group on the Ontario Ministry of Health's site but the sheet is not on the site so I uploaded is to Scribd. The reason I thought people here may be interested is that I suspect you are like me and are trying to figure out if, as current or past patients with GBS or CIPD, it is safe to get the mRNA vaccines since there is so little research available on them. \n\nIf you go to Page 4 under \"Who Should Not Receive the Vaccine\" (*this document specifically covers the Pfizer and Moderna one because those are the only two available in Canada*) It says that people who are immunocompromised or have autoimmune disorders should not get it.\n\n(\n\nI am not a doctor so I will not speculate why this information is different from some I have seen on American government sites but I can tell you that Health Canada is much tougher to get past than the FDA or MHRA. They kind of have a rep for that for better or worse and they have already refused to allow the AstraZenica one for use in Canada for the time being till they have more information whereas its already being given to people in the UK. Thank you for this information. I appreciate all the valid scientific opinions out there on this subject, even if conflicting, it is still good to see all views out there from professionals Please speak to your doctor or neurologist if you have questions regarding whether or not you should receive the COVID-19 vaccine after being diagnosed with GBS. They are the best resource for you and determining whether you personally should take the vaccine.\n\nAlso to note--while GBS is an autoimmune response, having had GBS does not necessarily mean you have a compromised immune system, especially after recovery. \n\nAgain, speak with your doctor for guidance on this issue. Neurologist appointment on Wednesday, I agree, talk to a doctor because everyone is different. I also think though they not everyone has easy access to neurologists and will need to make their decision based on available information. \n\nI do not know about not being immunocompromised after recovery because I was told by multiple doctors over the years since gbs not to get flu shots or any other vaccines because it could trigger the gbs again and that I was immunocompromised. Again, that is a topic of discussion with your doctor! I was concerned at the start of the pandemic because of compromised immune system and my neuro told me GBS does not mean I have a compromised immune system. I also cannot get the flu shot, but my neuro explains that is because the regular flu is better than having GBS again. Other vaccines are case-by-case. Mine fully supports me getting the vaccine when I am able to. But this is a convo each person should have with their doctor. But what your saying is just an opinion though, that is not a medical opinion that \u201cthe regular flu is better than having gbs again\u201d that is common sense it has nothing to do with my question which is, is there any chance any of the Covid vaccines will cause me to have GBS again? Because if there is there is any chance I will not get it, it took me years and large amounts of money to learn how to walk again and I still have neuropathy. \n\nI agree that it is a conversation you should have with a neurologist and to be clear I am not encouraging anyone to not get the vaccine, it is your own decision how you go about this. For me I would like to get the vaccine but not until a doc tells me it for sure will not trigger my GBS again and I do not think there is anything wrong with talking about that in general because as I mentioned I do not think everyone will have easy access to a neurologist. I am lucky my country has universal healthcare, others not so much. No worries. Yah the lack of verifiable info bothers me but GBS is fairly rare so I do understand it. I recently recovered from GBS. I have been looking into the safety of the vaccine since the first stages of clinical trials. It is safe for people who have had GBS to get the vaccine. (\n\nThe above source is internationally accredited, so we can safely assume that the recommendation is not too closely tied to any single government.\n\nFrom a statistics standpoint, those who have had an episode of GBS are more likely to get sick from covid than trigger another episode of GBS.\n\nThat being said, your vaccination schedule should be discussed with a medical professional who knows your personal case of GBS/CDIP. Exactly. Thanks again! &gt;It is safe for people who have had GBS to get the vaccine. (  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The above source is internationally accredited, so we can safely assume that the recommendation is not too closely tied to any single government.\n\nThey use the CDC as their source to say its safe which is the American Government.\n\n&gt;From a statistics standpoint, those who have had an episode of GBS are  more likely to get sick from covid than trigger another episode of GBS.\n\nThe page you just linked to says \"*There is no data so far to support that patients with prior GBS or CIDP are more prone to develop an infection with COVID*\"\n\nThey also say at the bottom of the page:\n\n*The GBS|CIDP Foundation has also received questions about the safety of  these COVID vaccines but this needs to be further investigated.* I think you have greatly misunderstood the article and my comment.\n\nIn terms of probability, it is more likely right now for someone to get covid and become seriously ill than it is for someone to have a GBS episode. This is supported by an overwhelming amount of data which shows that the spread of covid is really high right now, and there has not been a measurable increase in the number of GBS cases within the population of already vaccinated people (which is within the millions now, not a small sample at all). In fact, some articles have shown that a covid infection may not trigger GBS at all. GBS is a very strange condition that arises from exposure to specific pathogens. Given that an episode of GBS can occur from viral infection, it seems to me that a person who is vaccinated has a higher probability of being healthy than otherwise.\n\nFurther investigation is always needed, that is what science is about. If credible evidence comes out tomorrow that GBS survivors should not get the vaccine, I would absolutely support that. That is not the case though. Currently the data shows that GBS survivors can get the vaccine without worrying too much of increased risk of an episode.\n\nIndeed the GBS foundation uses the CDC as **A** **single** source. They also have many others, including doctors from all around the world that have personally signed a letter sitting on the front page of the site saying that they believe it is safe to get the vaccine. Reducing their sources to merely the CDC is disingenuous.\n\nAdditionally, the CDC is a private organization and, despite being based in the United States, is not ran by the government of the United States. If it was, we might have had a reasonable channel of communication between the two and not such a terrible outbreak within the country.\n\nI understand that GBS is scary, I went through it. I had to relearn how to walk and live my life independently. We live with a supposed increased risk of something terrible happening to us, that is just a fact. However, this does not mean we should excuse ourselves from the highly informed opinions of many medical professionals.\n\nIf anyone reading this is worried about getting the vaccine, talk to your doctor! They do not want you to be sick, and will almost certainly know what is best for you. Please do not only use the highly generalized statements of a provincial government to make your decision.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is from the foundation's open letter to Dr. Fauci concerning GBS and the vaccine,\n\n\"To date, no cases of GBS have been associated with the COVID  vaccines. However, the number of subjects in the clinical trials is too  small to detect such a rare event, if it existed, and surveillance is  ongoing. In the meantime, we would urge all to follow national and local  guidelines about who should get the vaccine. At this time, there is no  reason that those who had GBS in the past cannot get the current COVID  vaccines. If they have concerns, they should speak to their local health  care professionals.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n* David R.

In fact, some articles have shown that a  covid infection may not trigger GBS at all.\n\nI think the issue is that we are talking about two different things. **I am not worried that Covid is causing GBS, its specifically about the vaccines triggering GBS/CIPD relapse** nothing to do with Covid Causing GBS.\n\n&gt;Indeed the GBS foundation uses the CDC as **A** **single**  source. They also have many others, including doctors from all around  the world that have personally signed a letter sitting on the front page  of the site saying that they believe it is safe to get the vaccine.  Reducing their sources to merely the CDC is disingenuous.\n\nThe first thing on the page is that they are linking to the CDC, using that as proof of their claim. The letter is in a separate section and is directed specifically to that American doctor who Trump fired that went on TV and said that people with GBS should not get the vaccine. You only copying and pasting the last paragraph is disingenuous.\n\n&gt;We live with a supposed increased risk of something  terrible happening to us, that is just a fact. However, this does not  mean we should excuse ourselves from the highly informed opinions of  many medical professionals.\n\nAgain, I also do not think we should not rely on medical professionals, do not misrepresent what I am saying but if we do live in a situation where we are at increased risk we also should not rely on a singular letter written by doctors to anther doctor they disagree with, this is just doctors disagreeing with each other. I think the reality is, there is not enough information yet for any doctor or scientist to say yes or no to the question of: Will a covid vaccine cause a GBS relapse?\n\n&gt;If  anyone reading this is worried about getting the vaccine, talk to your  doctor! They do not want you to be sick, and will almost certainly know  what is best for you. Please do not only use the highly generalized  statements of a provincial government to make your decision.\n\nAgreed, as I have said before talk to your doctor. That said, the document I posted from the Ministry of Health has no less worth than the article you posted or the CDC. They are all written by doctors and scientists studying this of which neither one of us are. I am sorry if I offended you, it was not my intention. I just want a sisinct answer to my question with proof from scientists and doctors. \n\nIs there any chance a Covid vaccine will cause a GBS relapse? \n\nThat is it. I can post the entire letter, but it is really long! If you read it though it is not just about Fauci and the president, the doctors provide numerous studies that suggest we are okay to get the vaccine.\n\n\"Since then, the only vaccine associated with GBS has been the flu vaccine at a rate of 1 extra case of GBS/1,000,000 vaccinees, that is, 21 cases when 20 are expected (Salmon et al. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome Following Influenza Vaccines Affords Opportunity to Improve Vaccine Confidence. The Journal of Infectious Diseases, jiaa544,   In a survey conducted in the Netherlands, people who had GBS in the past were queried about whether they had another GBS episode following seasonal flu vaccine, and the answer was an unequivocal \u2018No\u2019 in over 100 recovered GBS persons, many of whom received multiple flu vaccines over many years (Kuitwaard et al. Recurrences, vaccinations and long-term symptoms in GBS and CIDP. JPNS 2009;14:310\u2013315). This study and the published literature does not support the idea that people who had GBS in the past should avoid vaccines in the future (Principi and Esposito. Vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccines and Guillain-Barre\u2019 syndrome. Vaccine 2019;37:5544- 5550 and Hawken et al. Simulation Study of the Effect of Influenza and Influenza Vaccination on Risk of Acquiring Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. Emerg Infect Dis 2015;21:224\u2013231). In fact, the CDC recommends that everyone get the flu vaccine as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks of GBS ( Any risk of GBS or that people with past GBS should avoid either the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is not listed in the FDA authorized package insert for either product.\"\n\nThe sources I provided demonstrate that currently there is no link between getting the vaccine and having a relapse of GBS/CDIP. You are correct, there are multiple articles on that page, which all confer the same idea. Currently it seems that a covid infection may cause a relapse, and the vaccine does not. \n\nThe Ministry of Health has to write laws and recommendations for more people than just those who have suffered from GBS/CDIP. The GBS foundation is for people like us. GBS is a weird autoimmune disorder. Not every virus, or vaccine, triggers it. It also does not necessarily mean that you have a compromised immune system, rather an over-reactive one that really does not like Influenza, campylobacter and a few other infections.\n\nI care a lot about having accurate information on the vaccine within our community because we are so strange. I think that the GBS foundation is a really good source for GBS specific information. I think that when you have to write healthcare policy you end up needing to paint with very broad strokes, which can lead to some conflicts in information. &gt;I can post the entire letter,\n\nThat was not my point, people can go to the link and read it themselves. My point was that you called me disingenuous for saying that the first source they use to backup their information is the CDC when you specifically claimed they were not associated with government. I was rebuking that by saying that it is disingenuous of you to only post 1 paragraph and the list of doctors that wrote the letter because it supports your point.\n\nOn top of that, the letter is extremely confusing, it dips into flu vaccines causing GBS and the lack of any information that says the Covid vaccine does or does not cause it. \n\n&gt;The sources I provided demonstrate that currently there is no link between getting the vaccine and having a relapse of GBS/CDIP\n\nNo, the website you provided proves that they do not think it does. Unless you are a doctor or scientist you cannot make comments like this because you have no proof. Based on the same information I could claim there is currently no link between getting the vaccine and growing a horn in the middle of my forehead.\n\n&gt;Currently it seems that a covid infection may cause a relapse, and the vaccine does not.\n\nSee this is what I am talking about, there is no proof of this, you are just spreading misinformation which makes it harder to figure out what is true and what is not. These are quotes from the page you linked to that go against what you are saying yet you also use the same site you linked to as a source to prove what you are saying is true. For this reason I cannot trust anything you or this site is saying.\n\n&gt;*\"COVID does not cause GBS\u00a0 in any significant number if at all and there is no reason to suspect the vaccine would cause it.\"*   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*\"A UK based epidemiological study, linked below, has found no causal  association between COVID-19 infection and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. This  means that GBS developing at the same time or close to that of COVID-19  is most likely coincidental.\"*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*There is no data so far to support that patients with prior GBS or CIDP are more prone to develop an infection with COVID.*\n\nHave a good one. Stay safe. I am not a doctor, but I know how to read, and I do study a science, so I like to think I can interpret graphs and basic statistics. The strawman argument that the researchers work is tantamount to proving something that is clearly not possible is also problematic. It is disingenuous to discredit the opinions of an organization like the CDC, which has helped handle multiple international outbreaks of coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, COVID-19), simply because \"they are American\". They are not ran by the United States government. They are an independent, non-profit organization. Their statements and research matter greatly. The only misinformation that I can see from our interaction is the statements that have been made regarding the CDC and its political associations. It is straight out of Trump's dialog at the beginning of the pandemic where he sought to discredit the organization. We should not ignore the opinions of the CDC.\n\n\"COVID does not cause GBS  in any significant number if at all and there is no reason to suspect the vaccine would cause it.\"\n\nThe first quote you posted is the point I have been trying to make. \"There is no reason to suspect that the vaccine would cause it.\" The truth is the GBS foundation has numerous articles supported by many scientists and doctors which suggest that the vaccine is safe for people who have had GBS previously. Saying they do not know conclusively is true, there is more data to be collected as the vaccines roll out, but highly misleading if the implication is that the vaccine is unsafe. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that the vaccine is unsafe for our community. COVID is unsafe for our community, regardless of a relapse of GBS. That is the ground truth. Trying to turn my posts onto some political witch hunt is ridiculous, I am Canadian and even beyond that belong to a democratic socialist party, nothing I have said has anything to do with Trump. I am not sure who is alt account this is but your opinions are not worth more because you are using some random site and an American federal agency as a source.\n\nIn fact you have contradicted yourself numerous times in this post, you cannot cherry pick the information from a website that supports your argument right down to using one line of a quote but ignoring the other. This is ridiculous. I did contradict myself when it came to having GBS and getting COVID, it was a genuine mistake. I even said in my first post that current research shows that covid infection does not necessarily mean that you will have a GBS episode. I am just trying to make sure that the community has the most accurate information on the vaccine. Currently the data from at least two seemingly independent organizations (one of which has a whole bunch of doctors from a whole bunch of different countries) indicates that it should be safe to get the vaccine.\n\nThe PDF that is linked only refers to the broad category of people with autoimmune disorders, which is going to include groups of individuals that have not had GBS but suffer from some other condition. If it had specifically said that individuals with GBS and CDIP should avoid getting the vaccine it would be a different story. When writing recommendations for a whole population of people you end up having to paint with broad strokes, and I think individuals with GBS/CDIP may have been inadvertently included in this large group without consideration for our specific condition.\n\nI cannot make anyone trust the CDC, or the GBS/CDIP foundation (not a random site btw, it is straight up pinned to the top of the subreddit right now). It seems from the quotes that you posted that there are more sources which exist outside of the two organizations which support the idea that the vaccine should be safe given current (which is understandably limited so far) data.\n\nI made some genuine goofs in my post. The main point I want to get across is that there is currently a lot of evidence to suggest that the vaccine should be safe for people who have GBS/CDIP. Of course, anyone making a decision as important as being vaccinated or not should discuss it with their doctor (or maybe even two doctors)!\n\nI am not posting this to rebuke you or stir up some sort of political witch hunt, I am posting this so that others who read the subreddit and use it to inform their opinions have accurate information. The PDF is likely accurate, but I think it paints the picture too broadly which results in it not agreeing with the recommendations of an international organization ran by many doctors and scientists who study our specific disorder/syndrome. I would love what the Ontario Ministry of Health thinks specifically of the vaccine and GBS/CDIP. You are beyond stupid goodness  ??? What??? You are not getting the point of what anyone said to you do you in this sub do you. You are closing your own mind to sources that are pretty reputable, and letting your own \u201canxiety\u201d spread unfounded fear amongst a demographic that most definitely should get the vaccine if they can. Also, you are blindly trusting Ontario against the rest of the world???????\u00bf???\u00bf\u00bf? Not saying that they are necessarily wrong but can ya see how dumb you look when you say to others to open your mind when you do not at all?", "My Ride Through GBS I am a 26 year old competitive Canadian cyclist who races in both road/criterium events in the Greater Toronto Area and I wanted to share my experience with being diagnosed with GBS.  These past 4-5 months have been very difficult for me to go from a highly active lifestyle to be essentially bedridden.  I was super lucky to have an amazing support group around me, my Mom took time off work and visited me at the hospital everyday from 9am-9pm, my work gave me paid time off to recover.  I also had tons of friends travel all kinds of distances to come visit me in the hospital, bring me food, treats, weed, you name it.  I do not think I could have done this all without them.  Here is how the past 5 months have gone for me.\n\n**(Background Info) March 11th 2019 - August 18th, 2019:** consistently riding/racing my road bike 400-600km per week (15 hours/week in the saddle on average).  Not more than 2 days off the bike in a row.  I was in the best fitness of my life with big goals in the cycling world.\n\n**August 19th, 2019:** Woke up with extremely sore and rigid muscles in entire body; all regular flexibility gone - it felt like I \"strained\" almost every muscle in my body.  This was much worse than any soreness I have ever felt before from excersize.  At this point I am asking myself, am I over training?  After the symptoms persisted and got worse, I knew that there had to be more to the story.\n\n**August 28th, 2019:** Extreme jaw pain(TMJ) and severe headaches (lasted for 5 days)\n\n**August 30th, 2019:** Went to Emergency Department.  Urine, blood and chest x-ray normal, sent home.\n\n**September 4th, 2019:** Prescribed Vimovo (Naproxen) - 500 mg/20 mg per day and referral for electromyography test (EMG) at Sports Medicine Clinic\n\n**September 6th, 2019:** Numbness in toes, but no pain; swollen legs/edema in feet; blotchy skin on feet.  Went to Emergency Department for 2nd time, Heart ultrasound normal, Blood tests normal\n\n**September 7th, 2019:** Pins and needles and extreme throbbing, stabbing/burning pain on tops of feet(it felt like there were hot frying pans on the tops of my feet), preventing sleep for more than 30-45 minutes at a time\n\n**September 16th, 2019:** Went to Emergency Department for a 3rd time due to worsening symptoms , Obtained MRI results - normal.  Admitted to Hospital after consultation with internal medicine resident and neurology resident.\n\n**September 18th, 2019:** Tests done at the hospital:\n\n* Spinal tap done (high protein level present, consistent with Guillain-Barre Syndrome) - samples also sent to a national lab for testing for rare conditions\n* CT Scan done (normal)\n* Nerve conduction test done (indicates Guillain-Barre Syndrome)\n* Electromyography test done (indicates Guillain-Barre Syndrome)\n* Diagnosis by neurologist:  Guillain-Barre Syndrome\n* First round of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) transfusion completed overnight\n\n**September 20th, 2019:** Second round of IVIG transfusion completed.  I can feel the numbness/tingling in my ring and pinky fingers, this was a first as the symptoms had previously been limited to my lower body.\n\n**September 21st, 2019:** Discharged from hospital with hydromorphone prescription (3 mg every 4 hours) and Gabapentin prescription, starting at 300 mg/day and increasing by 300 mg/day to 1500 mg/day\n\n**September 26th, 2019:**  Things got worse since I was discharged from the hospital and the constant pain was really taking a toll on me mentally, I did not want to live with it anymore.  I was getting 2-3 hours of scattered sleep per night and   \n was needing to put my feet in a bucket of cold water to relieve the burning sensation.  I slept on the couch with my feet in the cold water a few nights as I could not get any relief from the sensation in bed.  Once my feet started to shrivel from the water, I started putting grocery bags on my feet and then putting them in the water to keep them dry. \n\n**September 27th, 2019:** Called an ambulance around 7 pm due to uncontrollable pain in feet. Taken to Emergency Department.  Spent night in Emergency Department on intravenous morphine.\n\n**September 28th, 2019:** Admitted to hospital again.  During hospital stay hydromorphone dosage increased to 5 mg every 4 hours, with 1 mg intravenously after 2 hours, as needed, as breakthrough dose; at end of first week, 1 mg intravenous dose changed to 2 mg oral dose.  Gabapentin dosage increased to 2100 mg/day; nortriptyline dosage increased to 50 mg/day.  I was able to \"shuffle\" to the washroom and stand long enough to have a short shower but was essentially bedridden and constricted to a wheelchair for moving around the hospital.  My ankles and toes were locked up and I could not bend them on my own. \n\n**October 9th, 2019:** Traveled by private ambulance to TGH for appointment with neurologist.  No further treatments or testing recommended at this time. Type of GBS confirmed to be  \u201cAxonal Multi-Sensory\u201d.  Told to stay the course and wait for improvement; Call her if symptoms worsen or new symptoms appear and she will see me immediately.  Gabapentin dosage increased to 2700 mg/day.  Next appointment scheduled for January 15, 2020\n\n**October 10th, 2019:** Discharged from Credit Valley Hospital with hydromorphone prescription (4 mg every 4 hours, with 2 mg after 2 hours, as needed), gabapentin prescription (2700 mg/day) and nortriptyline prescription (50 mg/day); Continue with existing Vimovo prescription (500 mg/20 mg per day).  Stayed at parents place in a hospital bed that they rented.  Lived on the ground floor.  Focused on getting my joints moving again and not allow my muscles to completely deteriorate.\n\n**October 18th, 2019:** Reduced dose of hydromorphone to 4 mg every 4 hours, with 2 mg after 2 hours, as needed, as breakthrough dose\n\n**October 23rd, 2019:** No more constant burning/stabbing pain, just numbness, tingling, aching ankles and feet.  Reduced dose of hydromorphone by alternating doses of 4 mg and 3 mg every 4 hours - No more breakthrough doses required\n\n**October 24th, 2019:** Started to ride my bicycle on an indoor trainer again at a low resistance.  Was able to manage 4 mins before feeling too tired and fatigued to continue on the first day.\n\n**October 28th, 2019:** Reduced dose of hydromorphone to 3 mg every 4 hours\n\n**October 30th, 2019:** Able to eat at table and sleep in my own bed upstairs\n\n**November 4th, 2019:** Reduced dose of hydromorphone to 2 mg as needed - stopped taking altogether within a few days (I wanted to stop taking the hydromorphone as soon as I could)\n\n**November 18th, 2019:** Saw family Dr., Discontinued use of nortriptyline advised to continue with gabapentin for another few weeks.\n\n**November 22nd, 2019:** I was having some GI issues so I stopped taking the gabapentin as I thought that might be impacting my digestive system.  I was also experiencing some dark thoughts and fell into a bit of a depression.  I think I was getting frustrated with how gradual the progress was in my legs, some days I would feel the same as the day before and it was difficult to get myself motivated.  I was not riding my bike at all as I was not feeling very well mentally and physically.\n\n**November 22nd, 2019:** I saw my Dr. and he thought the GI issues either had to do with the medication or the GBS itself as it affects all the nerves in the body.  He wanted to monitor it and see if anything changes.\n\n**December 3rd, 2019:** I started physio 2x a week at a clinic that was specialized in helping people overcome neurological conditions.  This was an important step as it helped me \"re-learn\" a lot of basic movements and was a good transition to being able to ride my racing bicycle again.\n\n**December 15th, 2019:** Now that I had been doing physio for a few weeks, I was getting some confidence back and more and more energy.  My body is slowly gaining some flexibility back(still a long way to go to get back to where I was) and things are on the \"UP\".  I made a plan with my physiotherapist to slowly increase the duration of cycling each day so that I could work back up to where I was before I got sick.  The idea was that I would keep the resistance fairly low and consistent at the start but then increase the duration of the ride by 10% each day.\n\n**January 13th, 2019:** My feet are still a bit numb, my flexibility has not returned yet but I was able to ride my bike 3x this week, all for between 1-1.5hr.  This was a HUGE step, both mentally and physically for me.  My aerobic power is about 70% of what it was in August(based on power vs. heart rate data) and my top end anaerobic capacity is probably closer to 50% of what it was.  I am looking forward to seeing my progress over the next few months with these stats to use as a reference point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was without a doubt the toughest 5 months of my life both mentally and physically.  Even though I still have some numbness and tingling I am forsure over the \"hump\" and well on my way to recovery now.  My biggest recommendation/suggestion for someone going through GBS is \"KEEP MOVING AS MUCH AS YOU CAN\".  The longer you wait to start rehab/physio, the longer it will take to recover.  At the very minimum, try to walk up and down the hall once an hour.\n\nI learned how important it is to have patience and remember to take a look back at how far I have come.  I still have a long way to go to get back to where I was 5 months ago(in terms of fitness) but I would like to think that this experience gave me a mental strength that turning the cranks would have never been able to provide.  I am so grateful that I will make a full recovery and come back stronger than ever.\n\nEverything happens for a reason right?? To 2020 and beyond.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.s. Feel free to ask any questions or reach out to me if you are going through something like this! Thanks for sharing your story and commenting on my post. Our time lines are similar but seems like we are dealing with different issues granted I do not have gbs. I was curious about how it was coming off of medication for you. I am still having a lot of pain but want to come off especially since I am at around six months and that seems way too long. It was the only drug that provided any relief for the pain I was having so I totally understand. It is better to take it than go insane from being in pain all day imo. I was only able to reduce the dosage and frequency slowly as the pain became more manageable but forsure felt some withdrawal/side effects when I stopped taking it (lasted about a week). I found that cannibis also helped the transitions off the prescription drugs. Have you tried very slowly reducing the dosage and seeing if you notice a difference or if it is manageable?  I have definitely dropped it since I have been out of hospital (my hospitalization was rough they were pumping me full of fentanyl which just sky rocketed my tolerance but it was necessary at the time) lately I have just been on a dosage I have not been able to lower and get any pain relief.  Just feeling like it is been going on for a long time. I am hoping to taper and incorporate some more natural remedies while doing so. It is a hard balance for me with PT sometimes I feel I do too much which sets me back. I am dealing with mostly atrophy now most of my nerve pain has is gone. What an incredible account. Amazing detail and date tracking. I could not have been so accurate after my bouts. I am glad you are getting better. Slow road \u2014 be patient and keep up spirits. Appreciate. I had GBS almost 40 years ago.  But I was a competitive cyclist, as a Paralympian - I competed in World Championships and was slated to go to London in 2012 (but I crashed in trials and broke my collarbone).\n\nGood for you for getting back on your bike!!  I had extensive neurological damage, so it affected my cycling more than (hopefully) it will affect yours.  But here are the things I learned about training that may be useful for your rehab.  The muscle fatigue was my biggest issue.  I raced the road and track. Long road races were difficult because I was not able to develop the stamina to compete.  I did better on the track where there are short, hard efforts. But I still had difficulty reaching the max power I needed.  Hours in the saddle is important for road racing and my coaches had to learn how to help me train more efficiently because I could not sustain a \u201cnormal\u201d amount of time riding. I am sure you have a daily recovery regime, but this was also a key to my training.  It was hard for me to get the proper level of deep sleep because of neurological pain.  E-stim and Normatec recovery boots were key.  \n\nGood luck. I found that my legs, balance and nerve pain were significantly better when I rode consistently. Thank you! It helped to keep a log of everything. Great to hear from someone who also experienced GBS as a cyclist.  That is too bad about the crash, never fun.\n\nThanks, I for sure am feeling the muscle fatigue after riding(and during) so I have really been focusing on recovery between sessions, proper nutrition and lots of sleep.  I also have a set of the Normatec boots and they are an awesome tool for recovery.\n\nI am looking to start structured training again in a few weeks with my coach(a former Pro cyclist from the UK).  We will have to see what works and what I am able to manage.  Right now my aerobic power is about 70% it was before I got sick(based on power vs heart rate data from a 1.5hour \"zone2\" ride).  I was hoping to be able to slowly ramp up and manage the 3-5hr rides that I was doing before. It will be interesting to see how the progression goes, especially since I am tracking all the metrics each ride (heart rate, power, cadence).\n\nI agree that my legs have been feeling better and my mobility has improved since I started cycling again.  Did you have any lasting symptoms afterwards? (other than noticable muscle fatigue).  Also - if you do not mind me asking, how old were you when you were diagnosed with GBS?\n\nThanks for sharing! I was very young - 2 years old. Not many treatments were available in 1982 and those that were available were not suitable for someone so young.  I was paralyzed/on a respirator for a month and hospitalized for four months. As a result I have significant residuals - significant muscle weakness (estimated at 30% or a \u201cnormal\u201d athlete), neurological pain, and balance issues. Also since I was so young, my muscle weakness prevented my bones from growing correctly so I have had over 20 orthopedic. surgeries to correct those issues.  Both of my ankles are fused at 90 degrees, which helps with pedal stroke, but not much else!  As a para-athlete they rank you so you are competing against others with similar capabilities - out of 5 categories I was the second to most impaired.  My main American teammate with the same class competed riding a bike with one leg, with no prosthetic.  \n\nI am sure that given your age and treatment you will fare much better! Wow, amazing story. Thank you for sharing - very inspirational! Absolutely amazing write up, thank you for sharing. How are you feeling now? Progress has been going really well, my focus the past few weeks! \n\n\\-I have been going to the gym and doing some light weight training now and have been doing at least 20 mins of barefoot walking each day, up to an hour on days that I do not cycle.  Still doing a lot of stretching each day (especially on the backs of my legs) and it has improved a a lot.\n\n\\-I have enough energy now to stay up the full day (and be active), so I have not been needing to take any naps or have my energy limit what I do each day.  Because of this I am going back to work full-time at the end of February as a Project Manager.\n\nI can still feel numbness and a bit of tingling in my feet and lower calves but I have been amazed at how much feeling has come back in my upper calf.  Before, when I flexed my leg I would not really be able to activate the muscle, so it just felt like jelly.  Now I can fill out my whole leg when I flex it. I think the barefoot walking really helps as it forces you to use a lot of muscles that wearing shoes mask.\n\nMy goal is to be able to go on a 2 week cycling trip in April where we will cover hundreds of km's/day.  Will keep you guys updated! I appreciate you sharing your experience and so happy to see that you are on a road to a strong recovery. I was diagnosed and treated in mid-November while living abroad in Zanzibar (had to get to mainland Tanzania for treatment), and as harrowing as that experience was, your story - and others - are proof that this condition affects us all to so many different degrees. I wish you much strength and progress in your continued recovery. That is an awesome goal, please post a thread showing us you kicking ass!!!! Hi, good to hear your story and that your getting better now, I hope you will fully recover soon. I just want to know if until now your still taking any medications and is it daily or just when you feel anything? It has been 9 months now since my initial diagnosis and 3 months since I have resumed \"structured training\" with my cycling coach.  I am currently stronger/a better cyclist than I was before I got sick (I still have some numbness and weakness in my feet and toes but it does not affect my cycling - my power numbers can show that).  We started with lots of low intensity endurance work at the start, riding about 6-7 hours a week.  And have been ramping things up every week since then.  In the last 2 weeks, I have rode 20-22hours on the bike, covering around 650km each week - with big power gains in the last few weeks especially.\n\nI stopped taking all medications at the end of November and have not touched hydromorphone or Gabapentin since then.  If you are in pain - then continue to take the hydromorphone as prescribed by your Dr. but as the pain became more manageable - I tried to get off the hydromorphone ASAP.  Some THC/CBD gummy bears were actually very helpful for the transition off the opioids.\n\nAs for the Gabaentin that I was taking, I found it helped in the earlier stages with calming the \"vibrations\" and \"twitches\" that were going on in my legs but once these sensations naturally came down a bit.  I didnt see any need to take the gabapentin anymore.  So I reduced the dosage on that pretty aggressively and over the course of the week I was off of it.  I was on a pretty high dosage of this(900mg 3x a day) because of how much fasciculations and nerve firing that was going on in my legs and calves especially.  I had to imagine that this would have an impact on my body and the longer I took it, the more dependent I would become on it. Thank you, I hope your recovery is going well.  My neurologist explained to me that GBS is kind of like the flu, there are so many different strains and variations of it and it affects everyone so much differently.\n\nMy goal now that I have fully recovered is to raise awareness with the equal mental struggles that come with the physical ones.\n\nGetting through GBS prepares you mentally for almost ANYTHING life throws at you afterwards. Thank you so much sir , this is very helpful. I am looking forward to hear more stories of your fast and inspiring recoveries. Best regards. Really appreciate you sharing your journey in such detail. Do you feel like your symptoms consistently got worse, or were there good days and bad days? I think the ups and downs were more mental. For the physical impact GBS itself, I would not say there were ups and downs for me. It was getting worse at the start and then at a certain point it started getting better.", "What differentiates severe GBS from ALS? Is it that the EMG in GBS typically shows demyelation, but if it shows no demyelation it is a sign of ALS? Is it possible for someone to have GBS with no demyelation but instead nerve axon damage? I was reading about AMAN... \n\nRight now the doctors have told us to just sit tight and wait and see and based on symptom progression they will know if it is GBS or CIPD or ALS. But it is already been 3-4 months of just waiting and seeing. Nerves have two functions. Sensory function to feel, and motoric function to contract muscles. GBS affects either one or both of those functions. ALS only affects the motoric function of nerves. GBS gets better over time, ALS will only get worse. Ok so in the case where GBS only affects motor, it can be a fine line between GBS and ALS and you do not really know which you have til you wait and see if symptoms get better? So, I think in terms of outcomes, there is a lot of overlap. But in terms of onset it is a big difference. When my dad got hit with GBS that was a couple days for it to get all the way there. But an acquaintance with ALS lost his motor function over the course of several years.\n\nWhen I try to describe GBS to people who have not heard of it (and the underlying science is not going to be a thing) I tend to try to shorthand it as \"ALS in reverse\". ALS may take years for you to feel the full effects, where GBS may hit you like lightning but can take all that time to recover from. Thank you for this, this is very helpful :)", "CIDP with Near-Normal EMG Test? Anybody ever diagnosed with CIDP and yet have near-normal EMG test results, at least at first?\n\nIf so, what kind of other tests did they do that finally led to a diagnosis? Lumbar puncture for CSF level and nerve conduction studies (many over the years).  EMGs AND NCVs are different. But were your initial EMG tests normal, or nearly normal? Did it take a while for abnormalities to show up in the EMG tests?\n\nMine are too normal. So my neurologists think there is nothing wrong with me, or at least will not make a diagnosis, will not put a label on what I have. One said outright that because my EMG test is so normal, I cannot possibly have a neuromuscular disease. And they will not do any other kind of test. Yet I have terrible symptoms. I can barely walk sometimes. I was in pretty bad shape when I went to the ER so the LP was the test to make the diagnosis to treat. EMGs and NCVs are tests to track progression over the years. \n\nEMGs look at the \"current\" going through the muscles. The NCV looks at the current going through the nerve itself.  I have both while I am being jolted. \n\nThe EMG could be normal because your muscle has yet to atrophy or decline due to reduced signal. You really do not have a complete picture without the NCV to pair with it and interpret the result from both. Thank you, this is very helpful. I do not understand why I have not been given other tests.\n\nThat is another thing, I do have some visible muscle atrophy, but half the doctors do not see it, or feel it - there is actually a palpable depression in the muscle of my leg.\n\nNaturally I think they are all dense and unobservant. I was fortunate that the neuro on call that evening happened to be the hospital's neuromuscular expert so he put 2 and 2 together and ordered the LP to have some more information. I was really lucky that night. \n\nI would say it is time to seek a second opinion, and look for a physician who specializes in neuromuscular disease (not headaches, not a general neuro, not a critical care neuro) because he or she is going to be able to see your body and get you closer to an answer. Muscle atrophy is not normal, so regardless of the results of the EMG, something is occuring. \n\nKeep the faith. What was the abnormality on your test? \n\nI was diagnosed with just a very small slowing in conduction velocity in just one of my hand sensory nerves. And mild slowing in velocity, increase in latency in just my tibial nerves. So i was labelled as mild demyelinating neuropathy. &gt;I would say it is time to seek a second opinion, \n\nWould you believe I have seen 4 neurologists? But they are not neuromuscular specialists.\n\n&gt;and look for a physician who specializes in neuromuscular disease \n\nIn one hospital I finally paid attention to neurologists' profiles and looked for one with experience in neuromuscular disease. But those were booked for months and I was afraid I would be in a wheelchair by then. So I settled for a whoever would see me soonest. \n\nBig mistake, he is a young inexperienced doctor. And this hospital does not allow you to change doctors.  If I had waited I would have seen one of the experts by now. A hard lesson to learn.\n\nMy primary care doctor referred me to a doctor with great credentials. But that doctor handed me off onto somebody else, another junior doctor. I hope she is communicating with the doctor I was referred to, but it would be insulting to ask. I do not have a copy of the test reports in front of me. There were a few abnormalities, and the neurologist in a foreign accent I could barely understand said they were \"sensory and not motor\" in nature. I do not know what that indicates or rules out. It is apparently not enough for a diagnosis.\n\nWhen I find my tests I will post more. Mine was the same and my neuro said \u201cyou do not want there to be something on the EMG, because that would mean damage is done, what this does mean is we still have time to prevent that.\u201d And I loved that he had that perspective because I had not thought of it that way. \n\nTo answer your other question they can check spinal fluid, I have had different kinds of imaging spinal imaging, blood tests, etc. It is a lot of ruling other things out sometimes. &gt;you do not want there to be something on the EMG, because that would mean damage is done, what this does mean is we still have time to prevent that.\n\nI guess my results are good to hear in a way, then. I was wondering if there was a way to tell if damage is permanent. But they cannot prevent damage if they are not treating me for anything.\n\nThanks for the info. I felt the same way. Like I felt guilty for wanting positive test results, but I just wanted something definitive to point to and say \u201cthis is it\u201d. It took my doctors a long time to figure everything out. I hope you get some clarification soon! And if all else fails get a second (or 3rd opinion), that helped me find my answers. Yeah, it would be great just to know what you have and be validated that it is *something*, but the main thing is that you cannot get treatment if there is no diagnosis. Assuming it is something treatable. Yes. Please do. I am an expert an reading the tests now :) \nAlso have they ruled out ms in your case? Both EMG, Nerve conduction studies and Lumbar puncture take time to develop abnormalities and they were all normal at first in my case. A couple of weeks later they showed abnormalities.\nThis is VERY common. The neurologists even told me about it before I take the tests.\nThey did an MRI. And it showed signs that were consistent with GBS.\nGood luck and know that we are here for you if you need anything I hear ya and I understand. It is a rat race.  I hate that patients have to work so hard advocating for themselves, being pushy, constantly reading, when we are at our weakest and when we feel like crap. So true. And we have to try not to look agitated and irrational when we see someone despite how we feel. So far no one thinks it is MS. &gt;Both EMG, Nerve conduction studies and Lumbar puncture take time to develop abnormalities \n\nThis is good to hear, I cannot seem to get anyone to admit that. Sounds like you have GBS, right? Which develops quickly. My case has been slow (many months) but is now accelerating. So I assume it can take even more time for positive tests to show up for me than they did for you. I am sorry that I have no experience in CIDP. What I know is that every person is different than the other. That is OK, we do not even know if it is CIDP yet.\n\nThanks for replying, you have been helpful. I am grateful for everything people here can tell me. OK, my EMG test says my left and right superficial fibular sensory, left sural sensory, and right sural sensory nerves show no response.\n\nAnd my right tibialis anterior muscle shows abnormalities including reduced activation.\n\nEverything else is normal, but I do not know why the above is not enough for them to continue with other tests and come up with something. And does the test say if the neuropathy was axonal or demyelinating? If its demyelinating then it sounds like cidp to me. In my latest emg i just had a small abnormality in my sensory nerves - enough to give me a tingling, buzzing feeling and got diagnosed and treated. I am going on roughly 8 years with CIDP, more than half of those with misdiagnosis, inexperienced doc's and my stupidity of sticking with Neuro's I \"liked\" but did not have the depth of knowledge to make a diagnosis's and more importantly take action with treatment.\n\nI finally left my last Neuro  at their recommendation as they knew they were not in my league.   Once I got with the best in my city I came to find out my last doc ordered all he correct tests minus a second EMG to test time over time. When I got with my now Neuro he had all the info he needed based on previous doc's tests.  My CSF was ~86, EMG I was told amazing I was still walking however I was falling all the time and did not want to admit that. Then my nerve biopsy that  told the whole story for me. \n\nI went from running ~80 miles a week, rock climbing at a pretty advanced level to being couch bound.  My feet were on fire and my hands not much better.  Point being I had to convince Dr's that this is not just getting older / Plantar fasciitis / arthritis, fill in the blank with common sources of pain and limited mobility. \n\nMyself or others here cannot diagnose you but I absolutely encourage you to not take my path where I let it go to the point of being in a a chair, massive atrophy, and all the negative crap that comes with reduced activity. I genuinely hope you are totally wrong and just having a bad day. BUT be your own advocate as nobody else is and myself and others would rather you be wrong then cry wolf as they say.\n\nI apologize in advance for misspellings and the like, my fingers do not work like they use to.  That being said my inbox is open for questions and or just to chat.. &gt;axonal or demyelinating\n\n\"There is electrophysiologic evidence of mild, chronic, inactive right L5 radiculopathy.\n\nThere is also evidence of axonal, length-dependent sensory polyneuropathy\" Ok then its unlikely to be cidp as yours is axonal. Also explains why you have issues walking as the sensory nerves communicate information to your brain which helps with balance etc. Thanks. My balance is terrible. I am sorry for not replying sooner. Eight years is a long time to be fighting something. Have you been receiving treatment finally and is it helping or at least stabilizing the disease? Have you been able to reverse some of the atrophy? \n\nI hear that the treatments are very expensive. I asked a doctor why he could not just take a stab at treating me for CIDP and he said insurance will not pay for the treatments without hard evidence (positive tests and bloodwork). I guess that is understandable. He said without insurance, treatment would run into the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nI am seeing supposedly knowledgeable doctors in and around a big U.S. city but none of them see anything recognizable yet and my labs are unconvincing. I notice they seem to go by past cases they have seen and look for the same kind of progression. Please see a neurologists that is an exert in neuromuscular diseases.  I initially had an MRI that showed inflammation at L5 (went to ER because I could not walk completely upright). ER doc, radiologists, and onsite neurologists could not figure out why I had inflammation without nerve impingement. Then I saw an expert who did all of testing - MRI, spinal tap, auto-antibody testing, and ncs/emg (upper only) even though I had upper and lower bilateral symptoms. The doctor who did the ncs/emg noted demyelination but diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome in just one wrist; admitted something else must be going on.  With the other tests and the ncs/emg, I was diagnosed with CIDP.  Recently (7 months from the earlier tests) had ncs/emg on lower extremities. Showed mild demyelination and axonal loss in several sensory nerves that explains my balance issues. My point is that you need a competent neurologist that can put all of these moving pieces together along with your subjective symptoms. Yes, thanks. I have seen two neurologists who advertise neuromuscular diseases as their special interest and neither can diagnose anything. They seem to compare the progression of my symptoms to that of other patients and mine do not fit the patterns they recognize, plus the blood tests I have been given are all normal. That is why I was wondering if they left out any blood test they should have given me. \n\nAnd I pass the strength tests they do in the exam room, they think I am too strong for it to be CIDP, ALS, whatever. Yet I can barely walk some days. I live in an area with above average medical care so I am especially disappointed. \n\nI will not give up. I am pursuing a rheumatology diagnosis as well based on a clue a surgeon recently gave me.", "GBS and PMR Just wondering if anyone had both GBS and Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR)?  I had them both, about 10 years between the two of them.  My  Rheumatologist said that there is no connection between the two, but because they both involve the immune system he feels there might be some connection.  It would be interesting if other GBS survivors had PMR as well.\n\n## I do not know about PMR specifically, but my neuro said there may be a correlation between GBS and developing autoimmune diseases as a broad category post-GBS Thanks, I do worry about what else there is that might get me.  But I just live my life everyday and am grateful for being able to.", "Hey! Wondering if this group has any CIDP winners in the group \ud83d\ude05.. i have been dealing with CIDP for the last 3 years now any1 up to share some experiences  I have had GBS/AIDP for 5 months now. I lost the ability to walk but slowly got it back. Right now I am dealing with no feeling from my elbows to my hands. Also no feeling from the knees down. It is tough. Yea .. bit shity to be honest.. i hope you recover soon.. i take ivig every 3 weeks.. whenever i extend i get a relapse on the 5th week.. im still recovering from the last one with weak legs and grip feels like having patches on my feet that are just numb CIDP warrior here!!!!  \n\nFirst sign of weakness for me was in Oct 2019.  Since then relapses started at 6 weeks, and then got shorter and shorter each time until it was returning just 11 days out of my IVIG treatments.  I went to IVIG every 2 weeks, and we started Prednisone and got the relapses under better control.  \n\nIn June I got Rituxin, and I feel great!  I have IVIG every 3 weeks now, but I do not feel ANY weakness leadingup to it! Yay!!!!  Our plan going forward is to wean me off Prednisone (I am already down to 20 from 40mg daily), and then see if I can extend my IVIG treatments to be further apart, and maybe even stopped, too!!!!\n\nIt is been a battle, but I finally feel like I am not losing! \ud83d\ude42 Yoooo! Fellow CIDP-er here. I was initially diagnosed with GBS in December 2020 and after responding quite well to IVIG in the beginning, I ended up continuously relapsing with my symptoms. I went from having just lower body involvement to full on paralysis from the shoulders down. \n\nI had a number of tests done and after the results of a nerve conduction test I was diagnosed with CIDP. My treatment at the time consisted of 20mg of prednisone and IVIG every three weeks. I also had to have extensive physio therapy to learn how to walk and do things again. \n\nI am currently independent with everything. I can walk unaided, cook, clean, play with my son. I cannot exactly run yet, but still work with physio to learn how to do some gross motor stuff over the next couple of months while I am back home. I spent at least seven months in hospital because my body just liked to throw random stuff at me and it was a balancing act to get medications correct. \n\nI have currently weaned down to 7.5mg of prednisone and still cracking on with IVIG every four weeks now. I saw my neurologist yesterday and they are happy for me to keep weaning the prednisone dose as I am not having any adverse effects from coming off it. \n\nI occasionally get a few tingles in my left hand as a result of what has happened to me. I try not to think about it and my hand is fully functional. Sometimes it randomly lets go of things too and I just laugh it off it is that infrequent. \n\nI guess my CIDP had a fairly good outcome considering how bad I was in the beginning. I am just happy to be back doing normal things with my family. Hopefully go back to work next year. \n\nAll the best! 12 years for me folks. I am maintaining with IViG every two weeks. It is getting closer together. The headaches are increasing in both frequency and intensity due to IViG, but the alternative is wheelchair. My main prob is pain and temperature sensitivity (which increases the pain). Occasional balance and falls. I had CIDP 7 years ago. Been drug free for 18 months. CIDP since 2012 Glad to hear u r doing better .. mine is can lasts 3 weeks b4 i need ivig.. thank god im still controlling the disease and only goes as far as numbness and weakness however never had to use the chair.. i keep wondering if this disease would ever just cure one day 12 years is a long time ! I always try to hydrate before my treatment\u2026 aim to flood the system like 1.5 - 2 litres of waster before i head to the hospital.. my theory is that it helps make the blood more soluble so less headaches.. so far i dont have pain only annoying numbness and warm feet .. wondering though if cannabis can help with the pain Married to CIDP since 2001.  I am in remission now. And no ivig in over a year. Neuropathy from knees to feet and in hands still. I have stayed on gabapentin. Weaned off steroids. Spent 3 months in hospital and 4 in rehab, my muscles had atrophied.  I still use a wheelchair, but can do a rollater with a seat for a few hours if I need. I am thankful every day and see my neuro every 3 months. I lucked out. The fatigue is still there. I live alone now and pretty much quarantine just to be sure. Eligible for booster vax next month so yay. I miss my old life, but not all that pain and 18 months of ivig. Every 2 weeks. Yikes. I did not think the pain would end. It pretty much has. I am thankful. Remission can happen.  Take heart. Thank u for sharing..  I recently tried prednisone.. but decided to quit and go for ivig only.. i found it very strong i gained weight and pimples and my stomach did not feel well.. currently trying to recover from my last relapse just on ivig but its slow.. i still wake up with numb feet and legs. CIDP since '09, when i was a young teen. Mine was abnormal in that it started with paralysis in my right hand then moved to right leg, left leg, left hand, and started on my lungs. So i have had my fair share of experiences but im in remission now Any eating habits advice or is there like a special diet for cidp? Sorry for the late reply, but just seeing the post.  My father has been dealing with CIDP for several years, and went undiagnosed for at least 3 years prior.  He is recently received very difficult news that nerves have been completely severed through his right leg and he has very little nerve activity in his left.  He is also experiencing very little nerve conductivity to both his arms, and is in a great deal of pain.   Has anyone else experienced similar?? I am not sure if anyone else would agree, but I have got my father on the Auto Immune Paleo Protocol.  He hates it. Lol.  But he also has severe kidney damage, and there is nothing he loves more than potassium.  :) Symptoms in January 2021, diagnosed in May with CIDP. Then had a horrible three days of CIDP symptoms in August before being admitted to the hospital and finding out I had covid (breakthrough since I got my second dose in May), so interestingly enough, I think that was what made me feel so much worse so quickly. Thankfully no covid-related symptoms, and I got Regeneron in the hospital, as well as 5 days of IVIG as a loading dose. Been feeling pretty good since that, and just had my first IVIG treatment 4 weeks since my hospital stay. At this point I feel pretty dang good, hoping to keep it up somehow. Knowing what could trigger you and getting a handle on that seems like the hardest part. My dad\u2019s situation is also very similar. He is had CIDP for about 6 years give or take, and his seems to be the progressive version I think. His doctor told him his nerve damage in his hands/arms has gotten worse and just prescribed him a medicine called \u201cmycophenolate mofetil\u201d because he is having a lot of pain in his arm/ulnar nerve area. He used to get IVIG initially, but has been on prednisone the majority of the time. I hope this new medication helps, but it is another immunosuppressant which is said to cause some side effects, and definitely makes it harder to exist with covid everywhere. Has your dad had any success with medications? It sucks that there is just not much research on CIDP :/ What did you do to be drug free? Took my health way more way more seriously.\n\nNo booze\n\nNo caffeine\n\nLess sugar\n\nCold showers\n\nMaintained a consistent weight.\n\nDo more cardio exercise and calisthenic workouts.\n\nCrucially rested when tired. You cannot outwork this. Thank you for the reply sir. Would stress worsened cidp symptoms? 1000%", "I am sorry to everyone here but I am very worried that I have Guillan Barre and I am dismissed by doctors so I have nowhere to turn Hey, I am first very sorry for asking you guys but I am scared and feel hopeless.\n\nAbout two weeks ago I got this weird sensation in my nose/throat. I got it maybe few days before that too I am not sure. Then I got tingling in the sides of my face for few days. Then I felt like my lips are weak and kept dropping. Also dull pain in one side of my face lasting one night.\n\nOne day I felt like I cannot talk but my father (a maxillofacial surgeon) said nothing is visibly wrong with my face. Then I felt the sides of my mouth get numb for two days but it also went away. Now it is one day tingling one day weird throat/nose dull nagging pain. \n\nI feel like I cannot talk well and my lips and tongue feels weird. Sometimes it does not. I can smile just fine. Sometimes my lips feel swollen sometimes not. My eyelids feel heavy but when I look at the mirror they are normal and not drooping. My wrists feel weak but I can use my hands just fine. The tips of my fingers feel weird today and I do not know what to do with this anymore.\n\nI am scared I will wake up paralyzed and suffocate because I have breathing problems and use an inhaler daily. I am scared I will end up paralyzed because of this but no one believes me. I talked to a neuro and he said there is 1% chance I have it but he sent me to a MRI and then dismissed the whole thing. \n\nCan GBS spread this slowly? When should I use my rush to the ER card? Because with COVID they will turn me back with these kinds of things. I am scared and desperate. Is there any way I can test my own strength at home to monitor my situation? I never had nor heard of anybody with any symptoms that were on and off, once you get the first symptoms it usually progresses very fast (I started with intense and sudden throat pain on Tuesday and by Friday I was on a ventilator). \n\nIf you are actually having issues breathing It is best you go to the ER.\n\nEdit: my gbs showed in the MRI and from what I heard from others, it was what helped to get diagnosed without a spinal tap. \nI do not mean to dismiss you or anything, but sounds like you are having panic or anxiety attacks. Get in contact with the gbs/cidp foundation. They have liaisons and other people there that can advocate for you and get you to a competent doctor. Your normal er/pcp doctor does not know shit about gbs/cidp and how to diagnose it (that may be rude but its true, most doctors do not want to deal with a tough diagnosis they just want to do a quick assessment, give you a pill and send you on your way. I would actually consider filing a complaint on the doctor who ordered an mri and then canceled it. That is complete bullshit and negligence on their part.)  I had to see 4 different doctors before I was allowed to see a Nuero and he diagnosed me within minutes, spinal tap the next day confirmed it. Keep being a squeaky wheel, do not take no for an answer, threaten those docs who are dismissing you with complaints, legal action and follow through if you feel up to it. I have heard too many stories of these unqualified asses dismissing cases that turn into months/years long recoveries because it was not caught in time. Your symptoms do not sound like gbs to me,(I am just saying this to maybe help ease some of those fears about waking up completely paralyzed/not being able to breathe) but it does sound like there is something else neuro going on. When my symptoms started every incompetent doctor I saw dismissed it as anxiety or ALS( I meant it when I said incompetent) but I KNEW there was something wrong, I kept going back til I was finally heard. There a many different variations of gbs/cidp and one of those could be causing your symptoms.  Get in touch with the foundation and they will get you in contact with someone who can tell you who to talk to to get a correct diagnosis.  Thank you for this helpful info, I do not know if this covers my country (I am from North Macedonia) but I will give it a try anyway.\n\nAs for the GBS, did they catch yours on time? Are you doing okay and I hope your recovery is good? I am scared from that exactly, a delayed diagnosis especially since so far it is face and hands that are getting weird symptoms. Oh and wow I was put on anti anxiety meds for it myself (Xanax). It was diagnosed about 4-5 weeks after my first symptoms. Luckily I had very very slow onset of symptoms. By the time I was diagnosed I was no longer able to walk and started having trouble breathing, but they got me on ivig the next day, symptoms plateaued, and slowly got better of the next 3-4 months. One doctor i saw before my diagnosis put me on Xanax also, still on it to this day, its tough to get off of so be careful with it. The foundation is international, doesnt matter where you live, they will more than likely be able to get you some help. I live in California and was in contact with doctors from Denmark that specialized in gbs/cidp. It was for counseling after my recovery but if they could help me with that, im sure they can help you right now. Youll more than likely have to make a phone call and wait for someone to get back to you but when I called I dont think it was more than a day before they got back to me. Just realized North Macedonia is in Europe. The best doctors that deal with this are all in Europe. Help is not very far from you. Stay positive, stay loud and you will get the help you need/deserve. MRI? It can show in that? I think I had one (where the put you in the dark tube kind of thing right?) and they did not see anything. But, I had a spinal tap and EMG and was diagnosed. Never read/knew you can get diagnosed from MRI. Yes, for me it showed heavy inflammation (I do not remember exactly the name of the area, it is been a while, but I am guessing it can be googled) and I was diagnosed and started treatment on the same day. \nI had the EMG one day after the MRI. \n(Has like 2 MRI at the beginning and 2 at the end of my stay when I stepped out of icu) \nMy husband refused the spinal tap all along. \nThey were extremely fast to diagnose me, which I am grateful for. You may want an opinion on myasthenia gravis. GBS starts in the lower body while MG starts at the head &amp; works down. Plasma phoresis or IVIG may help alleviate symptoms. Good luck and a\n speedy recovery!", "Normal Protein CSF I had suspected strept throat beginning of October. Suspected because I had the classic symptoms and I get strept several times a year so my primary called in azithromycin without running cultures. Did a 10 day course and was fine. A few days later I begin to have double and blurry vision so go to the ophthalmologist. She runs tests and sends me to ER. At ER, MRI and CT scan of brain come back clear. \n\n\nI was told to follow up with neurologist and he orders a lumbar puncture. Had that on 10/26. CSF is normal, no elevated protein. \n\n\nThe next day I begin to have excruciating muscle spasms in my legs and sciatica. Go back to ER, MRI of spine shows some herniation and they think the puncture irritated the nerves. Next afternoon (3 days ago), I am out with my kids and I fall. My legs just give out. I had to drag myself home because my right leg would not cooperate. Figured it is the sciatica, go home and rest. The following day, I wake up with some weakness/soreness but it makes sense bc of the previous events. Go to a market and fall again. Legs give out. Husband rushes me to ER. Everything is fine , high inflammation markers but nothing life threatening. \n\n\nToday I am unable to walk. I had an appointment with neurologist today and she is running tests, she thinks it is eppstein barr. I disagree but I am not a Dr. She rules out GBS since CSF protein was not elevated but I was not experiencing symptoms at the time of the puncture except for blurry vision. \nFindings so far are no/delayed reflexes in legs and feet, high SED rate, high CRP, normal CSF.\nMy voice is now extremely hoarse and I am just so tired and in pain and scared that this is permanent. \n\nIf you read this novel, Thank you. Am I just being a weirdo? I had Miller fisher variety of gbs. I had the same onset of stumbling, loss of reflexes, double vision eventually hoarse voice, although I was never really in pain, I was a bit sore around my back and mid section. \n\nMy CSF showed only slightly raised protein. All antibody tests came back negative to expected results for Miller fisher. Still, my diagnosis remained based on symptoms and I got better over the course of 4-6 months. \n\nIf things continue to worsen if I was in your position I would be looking for a second opinion. The course of IVIG helped speed my recovery. Be vigilant. GBS and MFS get bad quickly. While high CSF protein counts can be used to confirm a diagnosis, the sensitivity of such tests is poor (50-80%) and hence a negative test should not be solely used to rule out the diagnosis.\n\n( (and (\n\nThe CSF test does partially correlate with the level of demylination, hence it is not useful for diagnosis of the acute-motor-axonal-neuropathy variant, which does not cause sensory loss.\n\nWhenever your doctor talks about the CSF protein count, ask them specifically what the sensitivity and specificity of the tests are for each of the variants.\n\n( I am sorry to hear you went through that. I am at a loss. My neurologist will not run GB panel (whatever that is) but is running EBV panel. She is a top neurologist in Texas, many awards and recognition. The pain is my muscles continously contracting, especially in my buttocks. I will see if I can find that out. My csf was normal/slightly elevated even though I was unable to walk. 10 days later, though, it was 3x higher. Your doctor might request a 2nd LP It is tough that so many diseases overlap in this area. I am amazed at the work neurologists do. \n\nSo if you have faith in her then I guess you can only ride it out and trust that she will get to the bottom of it for you. Good luck with it all and keep us posted on how you go. Yes, it is astounding how many things it \"could\" be. I will definitely update when I have answers! Gosh I hope not. It was so painful! I am sorry you went through that. At least it helped with the diagnosis. In a weird way, I am glad I had diminished sensation so it was not too painful. I really hope they can help figure it out for you. Do you still have feeling in your hands and feet? All of my tests have come back negative. However, I started experiencing random numbness in my legs which eventually increased to my abdomen, vision lag and an incredible loss of appetite and (tmi diarrhea). I eventually started losing all strength in my legs. First time to ER, they thought appendicitis &amp; I left bc it was not that \n &amp; I was dismissed, essentially . But by the next afternoon I could not walk without dropping to the floor. Went back to ER and was admitted as a gbs case .. only thing I tested positive for was West Nile virus.  But even my neurologist doubted that is the cause. So if everything is negative then wtf. I had 2 MRIs, 2 lumbar punctures and 2 separate ivig treatments.. second round improved my mobility quite a bit more than 1st I have been in the hospital now for 4 days. I lost the ability to walk completely and use my right arm. Everything is coming back negative except for epstein barr past infection. They are treating with steroids which is helping a bit. I am super frustrated and bummed. I am sorry you went through that.", "Do you plan on getting the COVID-19 vaccine? Hello, \n\nI am curious, for those who have recovered, do you plan on getting the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nI had a severe case of GBS after getting the flu shot about 12 years ago. I only just started getting the flu vaccine recently.\n\nI talked to my doctor about it and she was not very helpful, she did not want to make a recommendation due to the uncertainty (respectable). I work in hospitals, labs and long term care homes in Canada.\n\nFrom my understanding the risk of relapse from a vaccine is similar to getting a regular virus. That is based on a small amount of research.\n\n( I plan on getting it months after most people. I am sorry that you are a health care worker and this must be a tougher decision for you. As a health care worker, my chance will come early then fade dramatically. I was struck down with the H1N1 vaccine in 2009, which my doctor attributes to some of that single strain vaccine they rushed out to health care workers having attenuated instead of dead virus. The mRNA vaccine is very different. I avoided flu jabs for several years but have taken them without problems for at least 3 years. I feel strongly that if I get the Covid virus it will take me out. We have had lots of exposure to it in our clinic due to patients and families denying symptoms so they will not miss their appointment. I figure masks can only do so much so the vaccine is my best chance. I had GBS from Covid in March. Still experiencing pins and needles and fatigue but finally feeling almost normal. I will wait and have a serious conversation with my neurologist. I have been putting it off because I am afraid she will say she does not know. This has been the general response from doctors in the past year. Yes, for sure.  I also started getting flu vaccines again a few years back.  If figure getting the vaccine may increase my risk of getting GBS.  But getting covid itself increases my risk of getting GBS *and* comes with an added risk of death. That is an interesting way of thinking about the vaccine for sure. I am not sure I agree with the risk on the flu shot, but I think I am probably in about the same boat as far as the COVID vaccine. The flu shots have finally seen some good research published in the last decade.  It has convinced me to start getting the vaccine again.  Of course, I always follow this with 'talk to your doctor' for you own individual case.  :) My neurologist advised me to avoid the vaccine. I just had a call with my neurologist today, I did not get GBS from the flu shot but she said to wait until more research is done and to not get it for now. Depends on how healthy you are now, how old, etc. as it is a risk balance I will share what my doctor told me: Any potential side effects of the vaccine pale in comparison to what could happen if I catch Covid. Yes, I will be getting it. As I am young the NHS in the UK probably will not offer it to me until late 2021 or something. If I was offered it right now I would turn it down until more research is done. I have been told by my doctor to not get the vaccine.  There are no studies showing the effects on GBS survivors.  I most definitely do not want another three month hospitalization so will follow my doctor's directive. I have had GBS twice- once when I was a child, back in 2007, and the second time in 2017. Both episodes left me sufficiently mentally scarred, if not physically weak. The virus has me worried sick to the point of having multiple anxiety attacks and well, the news that the vaccine may trigger GBS in patients was just a double whammy of shock and despair. So yes, I am pretty much in a fix. However I am assuming that the general population will not be receiving the vaccine until late 2021 where I am from, so I will just bide my time until there is some significant progress in studies on the side effects.  Same boat. Went in March 1st. My Neuro advised against it. Im still not fully sure if it will work out just fine but I have learned there is a lot of risk in the medical field and nothing is really promised in life so cross my fingers and hope for the best. That is a ridiculously fast recovery from GBS, I had it 10 years ago and I still have leftover neuropathy, took me years to learn how to walk again. I never lost limb function, I consider myself very lucky. I also had Covid in March and 4 weeks later, developed neuropathy (buzzing, guitar-strum feeling) in one of my legs plus non-stop twitching on one side of my tongue (which resolved after \\~1month). Had numerous tests which were negative except for the antiganglioside antibody panel which came back positive on bloodwork (but when repeated in another lab, was negative) and a skin biopsy which came back + for small-fiber neuropathy. My neuro told me what I am experiencing may be a \"very mild variant\" of GBS, but I never had any weakness and this seems like a very atypical presentation, so not sure. Still have neuropathy in my leg now, but slowly improving. I am a healthcare worker, so have been offered the vaccine already. My neuro said it would \"probably be fine\" to get it (I live in an area where Covid numbers are currently very high) but idk, I am very worried considering Covid gave me these symptoms and it is still not fully understood what happened to me. I have no Covid antibodies, but I am hoping maybe I have some Tcell protection....\n\nSo I also will probably wait for more research to come in. The uncertainty is very difficult to deal with (to no fault of medical professionals... this is all just so new). Wow, this is SO similar to my own experience. I feel a little better knowing I am not the only one. I did have weakness in my hands and legs but was never paralyzed. The buzzing still comes around from m time to time, but it is pretty rare now. Glad you are recovering well! It is comforting to know I am not alone with this post-Covid experience. Did you ever end up speaking to your neurologist? I am curious to hear if she is encouraging you to get the vaccine. As I mentioned, mine had said \"probably\" okay to get it so I am on the fence because I am not a fan of the word probably! I have not spoken to my neurologist yet. I live in Belgium and the vaccine rollout here is SO slow. The regular population will not probably be able to get vaccines until summer, so there is no rush.", "What did you guys do about your job/income? Although I can walk and get around okay, I am still weak and need help with a lot if things. My job requires a lot of standing on my feet and doing things with my hands, and I am definitely not capable of going back for a little while. Did any of you guys qualify for disability while you were recovering, or is there such thing as temporary disability? Luckily, I still live at home and my parents are helping me with a lot, however I do somehow need an income. Thoughts and experiences? Hi there! If you live in the US you can use the ( (family and medical leave act) to apply for short term disability. This will allow you to take up to 3 weeks off and keep full pay and benefits. You just need your doctor to sign off, which should be easy enough if you have GBS. The process is pretty simple. \n\nAfter that, if you need to apply for long term disability you can do that. You will keep your job but I believe you only get 50% pay. \n\nYou can also have your employer make special considerations for you if your doctor signs off. This includes things like having a stool if you are usually on your feet, have your duties moved to more sedentary stuff, etc. \n\nTalk to your HR department (if your employer has one) and ask about your options!  I know exactly what you are going through. Best of luck and feel free to reach out if you need help! I have not been able to sustain full time work since I had GBS in 2013 due to residual nerve damage and extreme fatigue. I also have poor balance, cannot drive due to numbness in my feet, and cannot lift anything heavy. I have applied for disability several times throughout the years and still have not been approved. The system is corrupt. You should try applying, but maybe try looking for some part time gig online in the meantime I was incredibly lucky. I was 6 months into a new contract when I got sick. I was paid 5 months full pay whilst in hospital and returned to work in a wheelchair whilst my employer bent over backwards to get me back to full health.      \n\nI had a year in my job (I am a teacher btw) with zero classes and worked in an admin position only. \n\nWork saved my life - I have no doubt about that. Canada.  Socialism rocks. I have struggled to hold a job due to the pain of physical demands but fortunately the career I developed can be done online, so I now work from home. My experience is NOT typical, however, and most people recover much better than me (I had it in the 1980s). I feel you! I got GBS 4 years ago. Still lived at home, and my parents supported me. About a 1 year in, I decided to go back to graduate school. So, I moved from the US to Austria, and lived there for 2 years. I was a weird sight, wobbling with my leg braces and cane. XD\n\nAnyways! Came home this time last year, been home all year, parents been supporting me especially since the pandemic began. I have been looking for a job, any job, that I can do sitting down, but man, it is hard. My MA is in international relations, so it is a little hard to move to D.C. (which were my plans) and find a job there, so my MA is a little useless. \n\nIt is weird, because I can physically do a lot now.....I can lift \\~50 pounds, and walk miles upon miles (I averaged 2 miles a day when I lived in Austria, even walked 12 miles one day). But standing in one place hurts my feet badly, and I cannot do ladders. Steps are difficult to do. So just because I cannot stand for long makes it really hard to find just any job. \n\nI did, though, manage to do a student job in the library for 4 months. It was mostly sitting at the front desk, and some moving of books (with a cart). \n\nSo best thing I can say: you are not alone! I got Calif State disability for a year before retiring on social security. Social security also has a disability program but I am not sure how it works, you have to go on Medicare after 2 years and I was not ready for that yet. Good luck! Online business! If you have any interest in business, I highly recommend checking out some of the business models and taking some time to learn and execute on a new skill. \n\nFreelance work and sales are two great options for a total career switch.", "GBS: A mental battle like no other I was diagnosed with GBS on May 14th of 2019. 4 spinal taps, an MRI and a Skype session with a top neurologist in Boston later, I finally got an answer as to why I lost the ability to walk. Why half my face was dropping. Why my knees would buckle as I walked and why I was sleeping from the time I got home from work until I had to go back in. I received 5 rounds of IVIG for 6 days in the nero ward. I am grateful it did not reach my lungs, but had I waited one more day I would have been intubated. Went to physical rehab for 10 days, re-learned how to walk and continued with outpatient PT/OT until my insurance stopped paying for the visits. \n\nIn the beginning which was only 3 months ago, the fatigue, burning neuropathy and back pain were my biggest struggles. It was very physical. Now I am in a \u201cplateau\u201d phase where only time will tell when I get better. I now find the battle is much more internal; it is mental.  this syndrome and the medication I am on, combined with isolation because I cannot drive and my significant other works full time has brought me to a very dark place mentally. I have dealt with depression and anxiety for my entire life, and unfortunately the gabapentin I take gives me suicide idealization and way more depression. But it takes my nerve pain away. I was switched to Lyrica today with hopes the side effects will not be so severe. Please be aware of the many, MANY side effects of both lyrica and gabapentin... for me it is a catch 22. I ask myself daily what is more needed right now? My mental health and stability or keeping my nerve pain at bay by continuing with both Lyrica and Gabapentin. Short answer- going to try the Lyrica and see how it goes... if I just stop taking the gabapentin not only will my neuropathy pain worsen but I could have seizers from quitting like that.  So I made a psychiatrist appt. to be re-evaluated for my mental health. So many meds, so many side effects. Feel liked lm drowning with so many questions for my neuro follow up my next week at my 3 month mark. \n\nGBS has taken everything from me. I once read that \u201cthe the opposite of depression is not happiness; it is vitality.\u201d and I just want mine back. I sought out help yesterday as I felt like I was going into psychosis? i spent 7 hours in a locked holding facility located in the hospital. Luckily they did not section me but diagnosed me with \u201cchronic depression due to physical illness\u201d (no shit) and I was released with advice to seek out therapy and make some med changes. currently taking the following  :\n\n\n- 50 mgs of Lyrica 3x a day (was originally on 12mgs of gabapentin 3x a day which seems odd to me...Such a low lyricsa dose)\n-tramadol for pain 50mgs 3x a day (rarely take it)\n-ambien to sleep\n- nebumetone (kind of like ibuprofen that is not as harsh on your stomach. Helps with inflammation) \n-vitamin D 2000 units \n-celexa 40 mgs once a day (does not help at all)\n- Xanax for entirety (been in it for years tho)\n\nI truly feel the gabapentin was is giving me suicidal thoughts and more depression. I have high hopes I will finally figure out the right med combo. soon and that the Lyrica will somehow give me less side effects.\n\nIf anyone needs to talk or vent or shoot the shit because let us be real... most of us are not able to do much except wait and hope, feel free to message me! \n\nI am in the fight if my life when it comes to my mental health right now and wanted to share my story with the hope that it helps just help one person who may be going through what I am. I am going to try my best to keep fighting but it gets hard. Really fucking hard. \n\nIf any of you have advice about medication in regards to gabapentin or Lyrica I would love to hear your stories. Are there meds I can take to help with fatigue? \n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for your time... and if you are dealing with the awfulness of GBS, my heart is with you. I am so sorry. I cannot imagine what you went through and what you are going through. My dad had GBS three times and he is the best man in the world.. and it is hard... the last time this happened, I could just tell how scared he was... especially because he knew what he was about to go through all over again. He is been getting better and better in the last months. Almost back to normal. Hang in there. Keep fighting and things will get better. I know exactly how you feel. I was diagnosed on May 9th. So many nights with the pain and negative thoughts about my recovery.\n\nI have finally reached a point where I know I am starting to make progress and the negative thoughts have subdued. I have been relying on an anti-inflammatory diet (Mediterranean), CBD oil, and the most important is the mindful stretching I do for 3 hours every day.\n\nWhen my muscles started to reactivate It would put pressure on my nerves, compressing them. I thought I was having a relapse and went back to the ER. I have had 2 more lumbar punctures because I thought I was relapsing... but really it was just my tight muscles compressing my nerves.\n\nSo ever since I have started stretching my sensation and strength has been improving much faster than the months before. That would be my biggest advice to you. Start stretching and meditating while doing it. It will relieve a little bit of the pain and also calm your mind.\n\nI spend an hour every night before bed and by the time I am done I can finally sleep without the anxiety rushing over me. 38 years old. Diagnosed in October last year. Unbelievable pain in the shoulders and scapula. Could hardly walk, could not lift arms at all.\n\n\nI hit the gym in February with a personal trainer, could not squat on my own, hand grip was so weak i could not hold a 4kg dumbbell. \n\nTaday I can squat over 100KG(220lbs), dead lift 120KG, benchpress 80KG (shoulders were hit the hardest), I am pretty much back to normal!\n\nCut out dairy and gluten today, ask doctor to start PT and prepare to hit the gym hard in a month or two. \n\nLife is beautiful, depression will go away with recovery. The k you for sharing that with me. Stories of people recovering give me hope... I have had GBS twice. Both times so hard emotionally as well as physically. You will get over this. It is not a permanent situation. Your nerves are able to recover and return to normal ( without pain).  It just takes time. \n\nI found comfort, when recovering, in understanding what my body was doing as I recovered. That my nerves were forming new myelin sheath and it took so much energy and effort for that to happen. I needed to help by resting and visualizing the process in a positive way.  I have heard from many who experienced what you are going through: this will pass. Be patient. Do everything you can to stay strong and positive. \n\nI practice mindfulness. When I find my brain focused on a negative thought I take a deep breath and  recite to myself a positive script. There are many great mindfulness strategies you can read about. They help when times get hard.  None of us are perfect but do not give up on trying. Do not over think just work on the moment your in. \n\nPlease find hope and inspiration in knowing this is temporary. You can get through this phase... Thank you so much for your words of kindness, advice and encouragement. Reading how you view this illness has really given me perspective on how to view things when I am so down. Glad to hear you have recovered not once, but twice. You are a true warrior! Gabapentin never did anything for me. I am now taking nortriptyline. Much better. Also, I take daily B12 shots. Check the web, you can buy it online. Changed everything for me. My progression with GBS sounds almost the exact same. I promise you, it gets better. I am 15 years later from it and almost 100%. I remember the dark days and isolation and it actually lead to me becoming a therapist 15 years later. You will kick ass, get better and make meaning of this. It just sucks for awhile. Nothing is forever. I am so sorry you are going through this. It is really rough. But like everyone said, the most important thing is that most people recover significantly over time. I was stubbornly optimistic about that and I think it is an important part of how I made such a \"rapid\" swing. I had paralysis below the neck (and partial on my face), required a trache, did not bottom out until nearly 3 weeks (if I took another day or two, my prognosis would have been worse), was in the ICU a total of 4 weeks and did not leave the hospital until 3 months.\n\nI was really worried that if I left in a wheelchair, my ability to walk would take much longer, if ever, to recover. But my ability to handle OT increased significantly in my last couple days in rehab and outpatient PT helped. They only spent a little time with me each week but I did everything I could to follow their stretches and exercises and wheeled around as much as I could. The PT got me to stand for longer and longer times until I was able to do it for 15 and more minutes at a time. Then I kept going from there.\n\nIt is important to know everyone is experience is different but I think what we all have in common is it gets better. Stick in there! Please PM me if you have got any questions and I can share my experience.", "Diagnosed with CIDP, well, maybe not so much. After years of having balance issues and wonky gait (and some other symptoms), I was diagnosed with CIDP by a neurologist (after nerve conducion studies and spinal tap). I had a five day IVIG inception, and 14 every-3-weeks infusions after that. During that time I was hospitalized for a 5 day plasmapheresis.*  I got no relief from that. The neurologist then referred me to a neuro-muscular specialist (also a neurologist). She did a repeat nerve conduction study last week and said flat-out that I do NOT have CIDP. She told me to discontinue IVIG\u2014and I did. She did not mention an alternative diagnosis, and plans more testing. Thankfully, she said I definitely do not have ALS. So, back to ground Zero.\n\n*I guess all that treatment, and the hospital stay, plus the doctor visits would have cost, what, around $200,000+? (the single infusions retailed for $13,000 a pop, times 14 that is $182,000 right there). Fortunately, I had good insurance. Sorry to hear that and I hope you figure it out soon.\n\nI met someone who had been diagnosed with diagnosed GBS and had no luck with IVIg. After a number of further evaluations, he was re-diagnosed with a spinal injury (a compressed vertebra, I think). It might be worth looking into that. I am not a doctor, nor do I represent myself as an expert. That said, , from what I understand \\*not everybody\\* responds to IVIG treatments or the treatment can have \\*minimal\\* results. That appears why some people make seemingly 'miraculous' recoveries whilst some unfortunately do not. Having said that, and based on only empirical evidence, revisiting IVIG a year, two years, etc. later is unlikely to have any results. Further, some diagnosticians see it as an unnecessary risk. Sorry to hear your struggles. I get the impression that my new doc (I call her Doctor Giraffe*), is a smart cookie, and a diligent diagnostician.\n\n*It is actually Dr. Jerash. My readings basically say that only about half of the patients getting IVIG get any benefit from it at all, and any benefit is temporary. I gather that large-scale studies are lacking because the IG is so expensive. When I was getting plasmapheresis, one doctor said he thought that treatment was pretty useless, with short term results at best. Case by case. That is the frustrating part. It is not a broken leg or diabetes. Add to that, lots of folks have pre-existing health issues thus complicating a diagnosis. I see you comment a lot about expenses. Healthcare is obviously a business but I do not see a relationship between GBS/CIDP being an outlier. It is just less prevalent therefore there is less IG producers thus less product. It is just price vs demand. Large scale studies will not happen because there is no onus thus no motivation to invest. I mean even on a tiny scale, go try finding a physical therapist who actually has experience w something like GBS. It is just not that prevalent. I know. It is America. So it is shocking. Because human immunoglobulin comes from blood donations, and several donations are required for one dose of iG, the current worldwide shortage may not be driven by lack of interested producers. It may be scarcity of raw material. I get it. Acknowledged. Hey! I was looking through this sub and found this post. How are you doing now? I wanted to reach out because my mom is in the same exact position right now, except the neuro said ALS is a possibility. Do you remember what made your neuro say you do not have ALS? nerve conduction. pending theory is parkinson\u2019s", "Academic Research : Facial Paralysis Hi!\n\nI am a final year design student and have just completed a project focused on supporting the massage treatment of facial paralysis.\n\nI have created a survey below to get some feedback on the final product - any responses would be great!\n\nThank you!\n\n( This survey really does not include a whole lot in it to orient you. It talks about lights, but no lights are really displayed, it asks about size, but no size metrics are provided. It provides a scale of 1 to 5 but does not say if 1 is amazing or atrocious.", "Any survivors who have symptoms of high pulse rate/ blood pressure? I was diagnosed with GBS in December of 2015, and during the time I had high pulse rate and blood pressure, after about 6 months after being diagnosed it seemed to go back  to somewhat normal (my heart has never really felt the same after my episode) but its slowly been getting worse, especially this past year. Last week I went to the ER because I woke up with my heart racing and I could tell my pressure was too high and i thought something was seriously wrong. When I got there my pressure was 166/88 and pulse was 114. I went to a cardiologist today and they put me on a monitor and are going to do a stress test on Thursday. I have been doing some research on it and have found that some people experience autonomic nervous system problems. It is what controls your pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and a handful of other things. I just wanted to ask if theres anyone else out there experiencing this and if you have any more info/advice that you could give me and I can pass on to my cardiologist so they can get a better understanding of what is going on. I would appreciate any feedback because this has got me seriously freaked out. Thanks for reading. I got nailed very bad with GBS back in 2009 that the doctors suspect was triggered by the removal of a brain tumour.  One of the hardest things is looking at any health issues and thinking they are part of the GBS.  It took me years to learn to let the Doctors make that call. It is important that your Cardiologist know about the GBS, but you should also talk to your neurologist about the high pulse rate and blood pressure.  Ideally you should have all doctor reports go through your neurologist that diagnosed you in the first place.  He/she should be able to tell other doctors what symptoms could be related to the GBS. Do you have other GBS like symptoms besides high blood pressure and tachycardia? I got sent to a cardiologist 3 months after I got diagnosed, I was in psychical therapy and walking 20 feet took my heart rate from normal resting to 124. Turned out I have a congenital heart defect that we found because of the stress the tachycardia was putting on my heart. My cardiologist defers to my neurologist, neurologist calls all the shots. I had 2 additional IVIG treatments after leaving the hospital and they clear up whatever symptoms I am having.\n\nDefinitely let the doctors work it all out, do not stress any more than you have to because the stress will exasperate whatever symptoms you are having.  Ok, thanks for the info. The neurologist that diagnosed me pretty much did just that, I was given a different neurologist after discharge and they were really bad. 1st time I saw them they thought i was in for dizzy spells and they had no experience with gbs so I only saw them 2 times. Havent seen one in a couple years now. But I did tell the cardiologist about the gbs, he didnt want to give any type of diagnosis yet until he sees the test and monitor results.  Just he usuals, fatigue, muscle spasms and pain. And I am definitely trying not to stress more than I should about these symptoms,  it is hard at times but I am trying to give faith in the doctors so as to not cause more stress/symptoms. I know it is like impossible not to stress, trust me. Did you mention those to your neurologist as well? Maybe you can ask them if it is an option to do a round of IVIG? It sucks and it is expensive but it really does help with everything. I just had my latest 2 weeks ago and since then I have not had the neuropathy or any other symptoms since I finished. I am 11 months out from being hospitalized and I feel *normal*, like I never got GBS. My neurologist is really good, she does not fuck around and is like well if you are having symptoms let us just treat them instead of doing endless tests. She fully endorsed the cardiologist doing an echocardiogram and stress test, and she thinks it is good that I will be doing yearly follow ups with the cardiologist, because she said that tachycardia is the most dangerous part of GBS.  Do not panic, keep cool. Worry about it adds to the stress of it. You survived GBS. I do not  know how bad your case was, but anything else after that you can get through it.  A survivor does what they have to in order to carry on. Best of luck with the tests. PM me when you have the results,  hang in there.   Thank you, I really appreciate it. I didnt mention it to the cardiologist, just that I did have it almost 3 years ago. It is been close to 2 years now since I have seen a neurologist just because the insurance I had forced me to go to one that had no experience with gbs let alone barely any experience with neurology in general. Pretty much the only thing she did for me was she told me \"if I go paralyzed again, call an ambulance\" and prescribed me gabapentin. I saw her twice and then insurance stopped payment for anymore appointments after that. I was going to look for a better one since I would have to pay cash but then started to feel better and it just got pushed to the back burner and I never sought out another one. Kind of wish I had now. I had TBE (tick borne encephalitis) which sent me to ER. I had to be placed in ICU because of respiratory failure + total paralysis, and I spent a month there. At this point some of you may guess that TBE (which in itself was life threatening) caused me to have GBS as well. Hooray! Anyhow, after my lungs started to do their job again I was transferred to a local rehab center, where I spent like 5 months learning to do stuff like walk and eat. \n\nAnswering to your question: \n\nI had some serious autonomic nervous system problems, like a pulse of 130 (in bed) and severe sweating. Also, my balance went haywire, and I was not able to tell which side was up and which down. The ANS problems lasted for about 2-3 months non stop, and then suddenly stopped. One morning I woke up feeling OK, which was unheard of :P The nurses checked my pulse, and it was 60, after being 130 for a LOOONG time. \n\nHowever, I have had sudden / weird changes in my blood pressure. One time I had it checked and was put on surveillance because it was so out of whack. They checked it again in 3 hours, and it was totally ok. Sometimes I notice that something is wrong with the blood pressure from the gut feeling I get, but knowing it will be ok in a few hours helps me in not worrying about it. \n\nps. Do not know about all of you guys, but this whole s\\*\\*\\*\\*y experience made me fearless regarding death / injury. The only thing that would freak me out would be to get GBS again. Being a quadriplegic was always my worst fear, and now I have seen a glimpse of that.\n\npps. sorry for this mess of a post, I just woke up, brainstormed the whole shebang + English are not my first language + all kinds of other sorry excuses Thanks for your reply, I appreciate it. I was experiencing ANS problems while I had gbs as well (fast rate, high bp) but it subsided with my symptoms over the next few months. It was about 2 years later (I was diagnosed in 2015) that I started to notice those symptoms with my heart slowly starting to make their way back and it finally got bad enough to make me go see a cardiologist. He said I have small episodes of afib along with a fast resting rate and BP fluctuations. Getting checked out put some of my worries at ease but it still freaks me out from time to time. Glad to hear that your experience has made you fearless. Count yourself lucky. Lol. I think it is done the opposite to me. I feel like Ive becime a full blown hypochondriac now, I am always worried about my health and I am stressed out about it all the time now. I have been working with my doctors and therapist about it and it is gotten less severe but my experience did some serious trauma in my case. Thanks again for the reply. P.s. your English is pretty good for it not being your first language. Can I ask where you are from if you dont mind? You dont have to give me your address, just curious what country. I was recently at a gbs conference and met people from australia and Trinidad &amp; tobago that had gbs as well. Finland :)\n\nOh, I forgot to mention one thing in my post: after the ANS problems subsided and my pulse went back to normal, I  still had some problems with my heart rate: I could not get it pumping past 100-120bpm anymore. So if I did something strenuous, my heart rate would peak at 110, and I started to feel like I was about to faint. I worked with that slowly, taking myself to the edge over and over again on an excercise bike.  That helped and slowly fixed the problem, but it took a long time (as does everything with gbs i guess).\n\nOn the fear thing: I fear for my kids now, not myself. My wife's been reminding that the kids are not made of glass when I have been a bit over the edge in keeping them safe.", "GBS Survivor with CIDP/IV-IG and Neurologist Questions I am wondering if people would be willing to share their experiences. \n\nI had a severe (chest-down paralyzed, major loss of hand function) case of GBS and did not receive good care in the hospital or afterward. My neurologist never prescribed me physical therapy, for example. I am in my mid-30s and he just thinks I should get better because of my age. \n\nI think I need more IV-IG. I do not trust this neurologist to diagnose or do what is best for me without pushing him hard, and even then. \n\nQuestions:\n- How do you know you have a \u201cgood\u201d neurologist? Mine is nice but does not take me seriously or do anything I do not research and ask for myself. I am not getting better. He thinks relapse is just 100% impossible, not a consideration. He sees no reason why I should not be better and says things like maybe it is depression, or chronic fatigue. Puts that down in the chart and sends me on to other doctors. \n\n- How were you diagnosed with CIDP such that you can get IV-IG on a regular basis or at least another round. \n\nThank You Hi, I do not think a good doctor has anything to do with being nice.  A good bedside manner is important to feel comfortable having conversations, but experience and resources trump that every time.  I suggest finding a neurologist who is experienced, and preferably associated with a large network of other neurologist, like a large, resource rich hospital.  \n\nMaybe try here.  Best of luck!  Thank you, that link is helpful. I will call around Monday and see if anywhere will take me. I just realized I did not answer the rest of your question.  If you had respiratory symptoms, I believe that is an indication of GBS, and not CIPD.  For me, my symptoms (limb weakness) came back after 6 weeks from my first IVIG treatment.  Now, they come back every 3. \u2639\ufe0f Best wishes! Thanks. I did not have respiratory. Maybe I should call it waist down, which I usually do. I apologise!  I saw chest as I was skimming, and thought you were talking about respiratory.  \n\nHad the symptoms subsided, and then came back again? And the weakness is exactly my issue. It is so frustrating. We keep thinking I am going to get better but I am not. \n\nI kind of cannot believe neurologist just thinks \u201cmuscle weakness *shrug* idk why\u201d and is not connecting it to anything. Did the IVIG work, and then it came back, or did it not go away? For me, I start by feeling like I have ankle and wrist weights on, and as days go by they get heavier and heavier until I cannot raise my hands above my head, and I cannot stand up on my own. No need to apologize. \n\nI had digestive issues and find it embarrassing. \n\nYes, after the first instance and IV-IG I got better for a few months but it is been downward on a fluctuating basis since. \n\nI keep increasing my activity and movement levels (or trying to when I am exhausted/weak) so it just seems like I should be getting stronger at my age. It is so strange to be still doing very basic stretches and activities and get exhausted at a year and a half out. I do not understand why I am not improving. I cannot diagnose you obviously, but if this is CIDP your body is constantly attacking itself, and trying to heal at the same time.  Making yourself stronger has nothing to do with it.  I thought the same thing when it first started with me.  However, it is that the insulation around your nerves is deteriorating, making the signals to move leak (for lack of a better term), and not be sent strongly to the muscles.  It is not that your muscles are not strong enough, it is that they are not getting the signal to move clearly.  Still blows my mind that I can sit there and WANT to get up so badly, but nothing happens.  It is frustrating and scary! My diagnosis of CIDP took about two years of degradation, before the doctor had enough evidence to diagnose CIDP. \n\nIt started with losing the sensitivity of my hands and feet. Then, it turned into the delayed response to heat. I could grab a raging hot dish for 3-4 seconds before it would finally hit me. Lose of hand-eye coordination was also there. Not extreme, but more than enough to be frustrating. \n\nSame things with my legs. I started losing feel of my feet. I had a common habit of taking a shower with my socks on because I could not feel them. Then, my leg muscles started giving out. I would be walking and talking with a colleague, and then I would be down on the ground with a confused look on my face. I had to consciously learn to control my muscles to walk because this started happening almost twice a day. \n\nFinally, after almost a year between my first and second nerve conduction study, where they stick needles in your muscle and taze you at the top of the nerve to stimulate it, the doctor had enough evidence to call it CIDP. I have been on monthly IVIG for the last 6 years. It lasts for right at 3 week, and then, things start progressively getting more difficult and take more energy, for the last week. I am told it is because the component they are replacing in my immune system begins tapering off, and I begin producing my own antibodies again. \n\nThe viscous cycle continuous with no end in sight. Whoa! It is always good to get a second opinion. And chronic fatigue is certainly a GBS symptom. It seemed to work, yes. I went from paralyzed to eventually able to sit, stand, and walk. Although that process took awhile. I want to say 6-8 weeks to being able to use a walker to get around a little. \n\nRe: your other comment, ankle weights is a good description. My upper body was less affected. But I just feel so heavy. My feet still always hurt and my hands get tired. My whole body after doing light housework for example is just exhausted. \n\nAnyway I do not want to take up all your time, I need to call around the centers in driving distance from me and see what to do. Nowhere is close but I cannot go on like this. I need my life back. \n\nAlso thanks for just sharing. I am glad I joined this sub. The GBS exacerbated previously managed mental health issues and that as well as the physical weakness and I have not been to local GBS/CIDP foundation meetings. I always register, but then just feel too tired that day, or afraid. \n\nIt is meaningful to connect with people with the same illness. There is so few of us. Thank You. Thank You for sharing your experience. \n\nMy last nerve conduction study showed improvement. So that is part of why we are confused/there is no \u201cproof\u201d. \n\nI do not know what to do besides keep trying to move incrementally more. I have just been doing that so long and I am still weak, sometimes worse than others. Stairs should not be this hard. Or lifting a laundry basket. I am not out of shape. I am weak and I do not get it. \n\nAnd I will call GBS centers of excellence and hope someone will see me who is knowledgeable and cares. \n\nI am very moved just by anyone responding. I think I have been in denial a long time. I just keep thinking I am young and it is over and keep pushing. And maybe God willing it will be someday. But I have to accept this is where I am now. Thank You that is good to know. My neurologist does not see it as a GBS symptom but as a vague women\u2019s disease he can send me away with to find some other doctor to look at. Every step hurts, and it always will. Getting up in the morning will always take us more than others. People cannot believe when I tell them all that is wrong with me cuz I carry myself so well with such a great attitude. It is all a guise. I hurt every day.\n\nIt is a choice you, your conscious mind piloting your animal body, makes. Each case is so unique, which makes it all that much more difficult to understand, both for uneducated doctors and us patients!  For me, I went from feeling like my purse was getting heavier, to unable to stand unassisted and unable to lift my arms in 3 weeks.  It was a gradual, but steady decline.  With IVIG, I met my doctors on the third day of treatment waving my hands above my head to say good morning!  Even they were shocked!\n\nIt baffles me how exhausted and out of breath I get from doing practically nothing to warrant it.  Even my pulse raises from little (almost no) activity!  This is when it is really bad though, and everything is a struggle.\n\nI understand, and my mental health being affected is almost worse than the symptoms.  I am so depressed.  I get a few good weeks, and then I am going down hill again.  I hate being dependent on my husband, even though he is amazing and I could not do this without him!  Do not worry about taking up my time.  It is helpful for me to talk with you, too! I had to go to 5 neurologists before I found one who looked at my emg and my blood tests and got me the IVIG. Do not give up. Also, use social media in your area to find out the name and contact information for the Gammunex representative.They can tell you the doctors who prescribe it and going to doctors who have seen it give patients their lives back, plus have the fortitude it takes to fight the insurance companies for it, will improve your chances. Your neurologist does not take you seriously? That is how you know you do NOT have a good neurologist. My neurologist listens to everything I have to say, answers all my questions, and has investigated everything I have reported to him, AND things he found that I did not understand or recognize to be problems because I have so much chronic pain, it is hard to tell what \u201ccounts.\u201d Fire this neurologist and seek out treatment with someone new. I went into a walk-in clinic. My fingers and toes tingled and everything else felt weird. The doctor had me walk across the room and called it right away: GBS. She sent me home and said it may not progress but if it did to get myself to the emergency room right away. Later in the day when I went to the emergency room they did not believe me. The ER doc said the clinic doc did not know what she was talking about. Actually laughed. I spent the whole day and night in the ER until the same doc apologized and said he thought maybe the clinic doctor had it right. They admitted me to the hospital. Then the same thing happened: the hospital doc did not believe the ER doctor. Six days!!! I progressed with the paralysis coming in from my hands and feet until I finally could not open my eyes, speak, or move. They finally started IVIG and six days later it finally stopped progressing. It got right up to being incubated.  I was 36 days in the hospital. Did have major PT and OT -- had to grow back my myelin sheath and learn all functions again. I returned to normal after some time.\n\nThree years later (almost to the day) I woke up and felt the same feeling -- tingling hands and feet. I knew it right away. This was GBS. I called my own doctor and she got in touch with the last neurologist from three years earlier. He had moved away but she found him. He said go to ER. Same story -- they said they believed me but needed proof to start IVIG. This time it was a very slow progression. I could still walk but clumsily for over a week in the hospital. Finally, one day they tested my reflexes and they were gone. You know that silly test where they hit your knee and it pops up. My knee did not move. The doctor smiled real big and said that was all he needed -- some sign (I had a spinal tap and other tests with no result). They started IVIG and I responded right away. Assigned a neurologist who I loved and promised me next time they would treat it outpatient and believe me (unfortunately he too has moved away now and I am currently without a neurologist).\n\nNote about the first clinic doctor: I ran into her just a few months ago. I told her my story after she had diagnosed. I asked her how she knew. She told me that she had misdiagnosed someone a year before she saw me. They had GBS and she did not diagnose it. She was so upset that she spent a lot of time studying GBS and when she saw me she \"just knew.\" She cried when I told her how much I appreciated it. I imagine it would have been even slower to get treatment if she had not called it.\n\nLong story: sorry. Hopefully, it will somehow help you. Hang in there. It is so hard but keep a positive attitude and take it one moment at a time. Practice mindfulness: the only thing you can control is how you deal with it... Thank You. I am glad for the long story. Honestly, I just cried too. It was all traumatic, the not being diagnosed right away, not knowing what it is and it just gets worse. Very scary. I am still struggling to accept it. Thank You for sharing. Wow ok I have never heard of this. I will look up Gammunex. \n\n5 neurologists! I believe it. It is just exhausting to think about. Especially as a (now) Medicaid patient we are not always treated the best and it is hard to be seen. I had a great job before this with health insurance. \n\nI will keep trying! Good luck! Another brand is Gammagard, look for their rep too. Medicaid is its own special brand of prior authorization hell so you need a solid EMG and a history of classic CIDP symptoms plus maybe a sural nerve biopsy to get it. Wow so many great reply's in this that mirror my experiences.\n\nI too went through 5 different Neuro's before finding the one.  First few just told me nonsense with little to no testing.  2 told me to go to a Ortho telling me I had Plantar Facsiatis.  I knew I did not and finally with an MRI we put that behind us.  I had started seeing a Psychiatrist from the obvious that comes with anyone dealing with this and she had a Nuero in her practice and started seeing her.  I liked her so stuck with her but she was learning on the job.  I had to ask for an EMG and since she did not have the machine to do it referred me to my current doc. A little about me.  Currently 48 and up until ~42 I was running 60-80mile a week, rock climbing at a high level.  I was in excellent shape even for my age.  Then things started like dropping things, tripping over things, stuff that was not me. I developed a tremor in my hands that would come and go.  Fast forward to today the Neuro I see now is the top guy at the best Nuero hospital in my city.  I am lucky to have that as an option.  I knew he was the guy when in one visit he reviewed all my previous labs, did his own exam and at the end said I am 99% certain it is CIDP but give me a few days to go over everything.  He calls me from his personal cell phone the following Tuesday to say he is now 100% certain and I was in for IVIg the following week.  All in his office.  I also had a Lumbar puncture with a really high protein value like 84 or something as well as a Surel Nerve biopsy along with the EMG it was text book.\n\n6 month into IVIg I do not seem to be responding like all the wonderful stories I hear.  We just met last week (video call) and are going to go another 3 months considering the state of the world right now.  He made mention of starting to make a case to get me into the Mayo clinic if nothing improves by then.\n\nMy frustration is that at this point I am OK with it just not getting worse.  I use a cane and a very well trained dog to support my walking or I risk another fall.  Broke my hip in a fall about a year and a half ago that required very invasive surgery to repair leaving me flat on my back for almost a month.  Lost a ton of muscle and in my head I want to toss on my shoes and pound out 15 miles but I will be so exhausted putting my shoes on I will just take the dog outback instead. Yeah I know breaking a hip at that age in very odd especially of a male.  Turns out I have / had osteoporosis and at the time of the fall I had the bone density of an 85 yr old woman.  That was treated with an injection administrated every 6 months.\n \nThe point of all of this is not to diagnose you of course but to share the story of what happens when you stick with the wrong doctors for way too long.  I cannot help think how this would have been different if  I started with this guy on day 1.  So learn from my mistake and realize you are your only advocate and you have to educate yourself and ask lots of questions.  Think about a little kids who just keeps saying \"why\" on an endless loop!  Best of luck. I know this sounds a little crazy but when I was struggling I really perfected breathing and not over thinking. I would catch myself spiraling with my thoughts (one thought leading to another) to a hopeless place and instead learned to focus on breathing slow and deep. I would also visualize getting better\u2014 a picture in my mind of my nerves calming down and getting healthy. It helped me. Maybe try? \n\nMy thoughts are with you. I hope it gets better! Thank You for sharing. It means a lot.", "GBS and pregnancy Hi everyone! Firstly, thank you all for being such a wonderful community. There are so many days when I feel overwhelmed and defeated (like today) as I work to recover, and reading your stories gives me hope and strength. I was diagnosed in November 2019, and just got worse until January 2020 when I started Ivig. I got really lucky and never had to be hospitalized and have an amazingly supportive husband who has seen me through. We recently found out that i am pregnant, and I was hoping my gbs symptoms would improve, but almost feels like the opposite is happening! I am having increased numbness and tingling in my legs, and my overall weakness has been getting worse. Does anyone else have any experience with this? I do not but I do want to say, congratulations. Do not let worry about GBS overshadow the joy of having a baby!   GBS foundation.org is a good resource, they should be able to provide some help.  Write down stuff, anything you think my be GBS related and tell you doctor. Keep us posted with your progress. All the best to you. Thank you \u2764\ufe0fI will look into gbsfoundation, and keep you posted :) I do not have any experience. However, I have experience with numbness and weakness in my legs while pregnant. The extra weight put on tons of pressure on my back and legs. I have had 5 pregnancies, and with all of them I was this way. Probably part of the reason my body was always like, nope by 35 weeks. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude0f That is incredibly calming to hear, thank you for sharing your experience! I hope you and your kids are healthy and well! 2 teenagers, a preschooler, and a toddler, it is a mad house. I am loosing my mind. \ud83d\ude02 I have been in quarantine since February when I was also diagnosed with GBS. It is been crazy! You stay safe as well. Only mom's have these super powers!  Sorry guys, time to stop complaining. Only half joking here however. Congratulations! \nMy sis in law had GBS last year while pregnant but hers was really severe. They had to put her on a vent 72 hours after diagnosis and complete paralysis from eyes down. She was on a ventilator a very long time. But she actually gave birth while on the ventilator! Now her baby is 7 mo (my niece) and she is starting to walk again! Totally miraculous, but all is well now. I do not know how your story is, but just know that there is hope! Not much research has been done on pregnant w GBS but it can have a very happy ending! Thank you for sharing, this is helpful to hear about! I am so happy your SIL and niece are doing well! This discussion topic has some useful responses: ", "Large epidemiological study finds incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome has, if anything, fallen during the pandemic. \"Although it is not possible to entirely rule out the possibility of a link this study finds no epidemiological or phenotypic clues of SARS-CoV-2 being causative of GBS. GBS incidence has fallen during the pandemic, which may be the influence of lockdown measures reducing transmission of GBS inducing pathogens such as *Campylobacter jejuni* and respiratory viruses.\" ( A key point about these types of epidemiological studies is that they can only discover excess cases with respect to a prior observation period.\n\nAs a result, any inferences about causality are indirect and inconclusive.\n\nBut I do agree with the conclusion that lower incidence could be due to lower spread of pathogens associated with GBS, which have a lower rate of contagion (R0) than SARS-CoV-2.\n\nCases of Influenza in Australia over the past 9 months for example have been very low compared to historical averages.", "My Mother Has CIDP and Is On a Ventilator; Any Advice? She is been in the ICU for 10 days as the result of having the flu and pneumonia. Since she is been up here, she has not received any plasma exchange treatments and has been struggling to wean off of the ventilator. Today she is using 90% O2 of the ventilator, and her PEEP number is 16. 2 days ago she was using 45% O2, but she had a tough night and shot back up to 100% the same night. Doctor is afraid that there is not much left to do, and is not too optimistic about doing the plasma exchange treatments. Since my mom has been in the ICU, her kidneys havent been functioning, and the dialysis is working as well as they expected. I convinced the doctor to give my mom 5 treatments over the next 10 days in hopes that it will give her the kick start she needs to start getting better. The problem at the moment is that she is not even well enough to do a tracheostomy. My family and I have decided to do the tracheostomy as soon as my mom is stable enough to do so, so the tracheostomy is honestly our last hope to continue her recovery. My question to you guys is if you have ever experienced this kind of situation. Have you had plasma exchange treatments while on the ventilator and how did it go? Have you had a tracheostomy while dealing with CIDP/GBS in the ICU? Have you ever had plasma exchange treatments while using dialysis? Any answers to these questions are much appreciated. I am just trying to have some anecdotes from people who have been in my mom's or my position before. Thank you all very much. That is really rough. I hope your mother all the best and a steady recovery.\n\nDefinitely be her advocate! I am not sure about plamapheresis but I believe IVIg generally needs to be administered before 2 weeks for GBS, so this could be very time sensitive for CIDP as well. That is why I got IVIg before I even had an official diagnosis (which happened at week 3).\n\nThe only part I completely forgot (even at the time) was a couple days early on. I think that might have been when I had the IVIg because I do not really remember it happening. But it easily could have been one of the many tubes that were hooked up to me after that 2 day blackout.\n\nI do not think there is necessarily any conflict between having a tracheostomy and plasmapheresis or IVIg though I had my treatment before switching from intubation to a trache.\n\nI had pneumonia 3 times throughout my 3 months in the hospital. Being on a ventilator basically means periodic infections. I am not sure if I had pneumonia when I received IVIg but it would not have surprised me.\n\nGood luck to you and your mom. Those are really tough circumstances. Please send me any questions you have and I will try to answer as best as I can! Thank you so much for your response. It really covered all the bases", "Flu Season So as I am sure we are all aware here it is flu season in the US. This is the first year that I am not getting the vaccine, since I was diagnosed about a month ago. I have been encouraging my friends/family to get the vaccine. Thankfully it is a requirement for employment at my workplace (with medical/religious exemptions). \n\nJust reminding everyone to make sure your friends and family are getting their flu shot, since herd immunity is a thing. GBS sucks, but I would rather not deal with this and the flu. \n\nSorry for the ramble, but this was on my mind today. So true!  I cannot get the vaccine since they think it is what caused my case, so I have been urging family, friends, and coworkers all to get the shot. \n\nHerd immunity is important! That must have been frustrating to have it triggered by the vaccine. Is your doc having you avoid any vaccines? Or just the flu shot? It was frustrating to say the least, but honestly I am just glad I can breathe and walk again. \n\nCurrently just the flu shot. I had one other autoimmune disorder when I was about 1 year old that they think was caused by the MMR vaccine. However, this is the first time since then that I have had an abnormal reaction. My neurologist is telling me to avoid any vaccines for the next 12 months, even though this was not triggered by a vaccine. My last one was the flu shot from a year ago. Yeah that is fair. Thankfully I do not think I need any vaccines anytime soon, but I will be avoiding them as well. If you believe a vaccine was linked to your GBS, there is a compensation fund you can appeal to.\n\n Woah thank you I appreciate this. My wife started having symptoms right after the flu shot. That was in October. Now it is December and just today we get blood tests back that point to GBS. It is only in her legs, so we are not even sure what this is but her antibodies test point to GBS. It is been three months now. Wondering how long this will take to resolve itself and/or if she needs treatments. Since it is Saturday we have to wait until Monday to hear from the neurologist.", "I got gbs at 23 I got gbs woke up one morning and my legs and calf\u2019s felt heavy and my mouth was numb I thought it was from smoking cause you lose your taste buds when you smoke. So I went a few days and Wednesday is when I noticed myself getting sick next Wednesday I went to the hospital I walked in there and could barley walk I was in a lot of pain, they did not let me eat from 7:30 til 9 a.m at night shit sucked, spent one week in a hospital getting ivig out into my blood stream, then I got transferred to another hospital where I did a week in physical therapy, I just dismissed physical therapy this week and I went into hopsital in November 28th 2018 and today is February 3rd 2019, the only thing not working so well yet is the nerves in my face the doctors all told me that is gona be the one that takes the longest to come back and for the last 2 to 3 weeks I have been over sleeping every single day and I pretty sure that is not helping me at all cause I feel like shit after I sleep 11 to 12 hours a day, I am trying to break it and get out of the habit cause it is not doing me any good and it just sucks that I got depressed again durning the recovery of my Gillian barre syndrome... I hope I get better sooner I mean with my facial nerves mostly! Anyone else had issues with the nerves in there face? And how long did it take for your to recover fully? The right side of my face \"drooped\" like someone who was having a stroke. That actually resolved itself pretty quickly though, the feet have taken the longest to heal.  I was 22, 34 now, still waiting for part of them to come back. Most people do not notice, it is just one side more obvious when I am tired. Eating a lollipop or drinking from a straw makes it noticeable. That said it hurts by the time I finish eating a chupa chup so do not eat them at home either. Long \"pash\" sessions can hurt it as the muscles strain.\n\nI acknowledge that most of it is mental impacts about my face that used to be symmetrical, or at least pretty damn close to it.\n\nFace mostly took a few months, it sounds like yours did not progress very far, I was 23 days in ICU, on a ventilator for 23 days, in hospital 115 days.\n\nGBS really is getting better slowly, so give it time. Sleep is good for the body, maybe try having a 2 hour nap in the early afternoon and seeing if that helps lower the sleep at night? I got gbs at 25..... 22 years later good job, married etc.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is no one can say \u2018how long\u2019. I had 4m in an ICU - for me it was about a year before I was back doing what I used to be doing  I had GBS when I was 23 also (I am now 27). I was fully paralyzed and could not even blink. Nerve damage can take a long time to heal and varies from person to person unfortunately... I still have some paralysis in my feet and cannot feel parts of my feet, but everything came back for my face. It took close to year for the majority to come back. I wish you the best of luck in your recovery! It is hard and mentally taxing, but things do get better. Got it my sophomore year in high school. I was 16 and became very depressed  I was diagnosed in July 2018. My face was the most affected, which meant I had to take extra care of my eyes (cannot blink).\n\nSix months on, I can blink but my smile and swallowing muscles are not back yet. This means my smile looks scary, I cannot enunciate when I speak and swallowing food needs extra care.\n\nHere is to our recovery!  I cannot feel parts of my feet either. How do you explain it to someone? I say it is \nIke wearing shoes that are too tight.  Cobain make a pair of flip flops with extra thick cushiony soles that help with my feet. ", "I did not know there was a sub.. Yeah, I had no idea there was a subreddit for this. I am sorry for those who have gotten GBS or who is relatives have. I got it in 2017 when I was 23 almost 24. Thankfully it was not as bad as it could get. Had a few tests to diagnose. I could not walk and had to have the immunoglobulin for 5 days. Was in the hospital for a week and a nursing home/rehab for 2 weeks. Thankfully I could breathe on my own.\n\nI was anxious about it possibly coming back just randomly.. but has anyone gotten the flu shot since they have had it? Or gotten the shot and it brought it on? I am torn between getting it now because I am scared of it triggering it, but I imagine if I get the flu it will be much worse for me. I did not get the shot last year and did not even really think about it. I basically hardly left the house though. Now I am **far** more anxious..\n\nI was going to get the shot in September but was nervous about the needle so I held it off. Then the nurse gave me some papers on it and it said if you have had GBS do not get it.. so that is what really has me scared too. Ugh. I have had a cold so far this Fall.. that was fun. \ud83d\ude12\n\nThanks for any replies and I hope you are all well. Ask your neurologist. I asked mine and she said no to the flu shot because it is an unnecessary risk for former GBS patients. But would not the flu be worse? The virus itself and bringing on GBS again?\n\nI have a regular DR appointment this week, but I should ask my actual neurologist rather than just my primary care? DONT MESSAGE THIS PERSON THEY WILL JUST IGNORE YOU They think I got my GBS from the flu shot this last January. I would talk to your neurologist. I am not getting it though. \n\nThe biggest thing you can do is urging those around you to get it. Herd immunity is our friend. There is a recent thread of n the flu shot. This comment lined up with my Drs discussions with me. \n\n Yeah, thankfully (in this sense) I am pretty alone, though my best friend told me she did not get it this year so there is that. I do not see her physically that often though. So, I am mostly by myself with small interactions here and there.\n\nYou are not getting the shot, understandable after what you said but are you anxious about getting the flu at all? Thank you. I have had GBS twice. I was told no flu shot. I got the flu two years ago and it did not result in another episode.  I want to get the vaccine but alas they will not give it to you if you have had GBS. You should absolutely ask your neurologist. Primary will be able to give a recommendation but this is your neurologist's area of expertise. You can probably just call the office and leave a message with the question rather than having to make an appointment.\n\nMy neuro said \"the flu sucks but GBS sucks more\". So she said to encourage the folks around me to get a flu shot because \"herd immunity is a thing\".\n\nHave you had flare ups? Or continuing symptoms? Or do you have CIDP? I will try calling because I think I would need a referral and everything to go see them. I will double check though.\n\nI have not had any flare ups. Just left over nerve pain/mild numbness. I do not have CIDP. A little bit; I make sure to tell everyone to get the flu shot. If they do not I do not see them and I let them know it is because of my condition. I eat well, I sleep a lot, I make sure to sanitize, and I make sure to avoid those coughing/sneezing. \n\nHowever, talk to your neurologist. I personally do not want to end back in the hospital for 1 month or more and be on a breathing tube and learn how to walk again like I did before, so risking the flu is fine with me. Understandable. I have been doing all that except for the eating well part. Well, consistently anyway, I am changing that but that is kind of a whole separate thing. My whole life. \n\nI agree, but that is where the worry stays for me because that can still happen if you get the flu... and is more likely to. It seems sorta like damned if you do damned if you do not.. \u201cpossibly\u201d. Thank you for your suggestions/input. Much obliged! So they actually refuse to give it to you? Calling seems like the best bet. Do not need to get a referral or pay a copay, and it is a simple enough question that there really is not a need to go in for an appointment. If you are concerned about getting it again, you can ask that too. It is better to ask than stress about it. Very true. I will call them. Thank you! This is what I got from the CDC expert in an email when I asked him about GBS and flu shots:\n\n\"Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is multi-factorial, and is four times more likely after influenza disease compared with influenza vaccination.\u00a0 It has occurred after influenza vaccination in the past, and therefore we consider a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome following within 6 weeks of influenza vaccination to be a precaution to further doses of influenza vaccination.\u00a0 A precaution means that if a patient has no risk factors for influenza disease, it might be wise to withhold a dose of influenza vaccine.\" Risk factors are to be very young or very old &gt;65. So towards the end they are saying if you have in the past have gotten GBS from the shot, do not get the shot again? Not simply if you have had GBS before and it is unrelated to the shot?\n\nAnd risk factors being very young or very old... but cannot anyone of any age get the flu? Is obesity a risk factor too? My neurologist told me that there was a bad batch of flu vaccine in the 70s that resulted in a number of GBS cases, but that the general avoidance of flu vaccine for GBS sufferers is BS.  But the CDC in this respect considers only age a risk factor. Obesity would not be a risk factor. Gotcha. That makes sense. I did see the thing about the 70s outbreak. Good to know obesity\u2019s not a factor. For those who do not know: please disregard 32dod. ( My neurologist says when they rushed out the H1N1 single strain vaccine in 2009, some batches had live virus and that is how a cluster of us got GBS/CIDP that October. I skipped H1N1 containing shots for several years after diagnosis, with my neurologist\u2019s encouragement but since I am on IG I take them now, as it is nearly impossible for me to do my job if I do not. One very swollen arm one time is the only reaction I have had. My doctor said no. If you disclose to a pharmacy they will not give it to you. Yeah, I kind of thought so... then there is that fear (for me anyway) of getting the flu then. \ud83d\ude12 I have had the flu since I had GBS and I was fine \u2014 did not have another GBS attack. My doctor said if I think I have flu again go to her immediately and they will do the anti-viral flu treatment that will make it  a lot less if they give it in first days. I have gotten all of my shots. My neurologist said I am more likely to suffer from something else than have a reoccurrence and the research from the CDC supports that.", "GBS Impact Survey Hi, I am conducting a GBS survey on its impact on patients and possible solutions. Please take a moment to complete it. Thank you for your time and insight.\n\n( Who are you working for? Without context, it seems like a personal data/email collection exercise. It is a personal research", "My Top Five Goals For 2020: Guillain-Barre Syndrome  Thanks for sharing! Best wishes for reaching your goals this year.\n\nFor balance, I think some things that helped me were:\n\n* using a standing desk part of the time so I was engaging my legs more than I would sitting\n* walking on the balls of my feet and doing calf raises occasionally to build my calves (which had shrunk a lot!)\n* gradually spending more time each day standing on a ( My physical medicine doctor recommended it. I cannot remember if he specifically recommended turning it over and balancing but that definitely took effort early on. Standing on the ball side, as pictured, should be an easier first step.\n* avoiding leaning on counters, tables, etc. I had to at first, of course, but I spent a larger and larger portion of my time upright just balancing on my own two feet.\n* (Talk to your PT and doctor about the suggestions above to see if they are appropriate for you though! :)\n\nGood luck! These are good tips. Thanks!", "What is going on here?? I have been dealing with some odd symptoms.\n\nI got sick in early January.  Flu-like symptoms.  Fever.  Cough.  Mucus.  You name it.\n\nI eventually developed slight vertigo which turned into ear pressure and facial tension.\n\nBy mid February, I had massive head pressure and a lightheaded feeling.  \n\nThe vertigo would go away from my eyes but the pressure was so intense in my head that I went to urgent care.\n\nThe doctor said it was a migraine.  Which is laughable to me.\n\nEventually, I saw my doctor who said it could be a middle/inner ear infection.\n\nHe prescribed me nasal sprays, amoxicillin, antihistamines, etc.  it did not help.\n\n\nNow since then I have developed some odd sensations to accommodate my head pressure.\n\nBurning feet.  Tingling fingers.  Numb hands when I sleep.  Weak legs.  Burning sensations everywhere and across my chest. Back pain.\n\nThe worst one is heart palpitations.  Especially after eating a meal (not as hungry lately).  My heart beats louder anytime I move or start feeling these nerves overreact.\n\nIt feels like inflammation or poison all over my body.\n\nNow my question is how can this happen? This all started with the flu and slight vertigo.  Then it turned into something completely different.\n\nMy vertigo even went away! Which gave me hope.  Instead i got a whole new array of symptoms.\n\nI was doing some heavy research and noticed my upper neck towards my right ear felt numb or rather swollen, jelly-like.  I think it is called the vagus nerve.  Anyways anytime I apply pressure on there, I can feel my head tense up.\n\nThe vagus nerve also controls most parts of the digestive, arms/hands and heart.  So that could explain the palpitations and tingling.\n\nNow my question is can an inner ear infection cause all of this? I was healthy leading up to the new year now all of a sudden I am sick all over.\n\nI was able to go to the gym 4 times out of 7, now I can barely walk without feeling lightheaded, with shortness of breath.\n\nDoes this sound like an autoimmune response? Virus? \n\nAnd since it is only been two months, can I recover from something at this level? \n\nI appreciate any response.  Thank you so much \n\n\n29 year old\nMale\n5\u20197\n173 lbs Please be sure to speak with your doctor about your new symptoms. We cannot diagnose you over the internet. Do you have dizzy-like double vision? That was one of my first symptoms. I would contact a specialist. This does not sound like a typical GBS response, but it does sound serious and warrants finding a doctor that will investigate what is going on with you. What type of specialist should I see? No crazy double vision just some peripheral neuropathy and head pressure that sticks around.\n\nMaybe an autoimmune response of some sort to my flu like feelings in January? A neurologist would probably be most helpful. They deal with the type of sensations your describing, as well as migraines, autoimmune disorders, etc. Thanks!\n\nI wonder if a lot of these can be attributed to anxiety and stress every day for the last two months", "How often is there an underlying cause for CIDP? Wife was diagnosed with CIDP. Doctors are continuing to do more blood tests. Is CIDP often by itself or is there usually an underlying cause for it?  The onset of my symptoms was right after a stomach bug or food poisoning. Flu shot. \n\n(CIDP with MGUS) Mine was after repeated wisdom tooth infections. Rarely is one identified nor would it make a difference really.  It is an Autoimmune disease.  Blame your body. Her neurologist suspected a blood disorder or cancer based on her blood work. We saw a hematologist who thankfully ruled cancer out. I had undiagnosed lyme disease for years.  I believe it was the trigger because I started to get neurological symptoms after 7 months of treatment for lyme.  Lyme was eventually cured with no evidence of it in my blood or spinal fluid. But the testing revealed CIDP was rearing its ugly head.  Been a rough 3 years - 2 years dealing with lyme and 1 year into my journey with CIDP.  To top it off, now I have narcolepsy, another autoimmune disease. The neurologist said no way tell for sure but suspects Zika Virus infection 2016. Virus was appeared in blood tests for 7 month and I guess usually 30-90 days is the norm. Symptoms started 45 days or so after initial infection. Suspected in 2018 but misdiagnosed as it continued to progress on a relapse/remitting course every 6-8 weeks and would have a crash so to speak for 1-2 weeks with recovery (each time never back to normal) and start over again. Final diagnosis 3 weeks ago and on 2nd treatment IVIG this week. Just relieved to know what it is and now better prepare for lies ahead. I had and has diagnosed with Young onset Parkinson\u2019s during the while all of this was showing on as well. Maybe the combination of both made it difficult to diagnose the CIDP. Not sure. \nNEVER GIVE UP! \nNEVER QUIT THE FIGHT!", "Weakness Is the weakness actual muscle loss, or is it nerves not receiving enough signals? I can barely lift normal every day objects, and it sucks (used to curl 40 lbs now I struggle with 2 lbs) \n\nAnd I cannot even move my ankles and my calves are super super tight. My feet are tingly and do not feel like the rest of my body (if that makes sense) anyone know any tricks for the tightness? Massage?

Downvote to remove.) \n\n_____\n\n  ^| ^( ^| ^( ^| ^( ^| ^( ^| ^( ^| How long ago were you treated? The feeling is so weird and hard to describe to anyone who does not have it. It is weakness but it actually is not. Do not let the sensation fool you, your muscle is still there. It is the nerves failing to communicate to lift something up, rather than the muscles failing. The best thing you can do until you can lift again is combat muscular atrophy. Keep your protein up, keep your calories up, eat healthy. When I got out of the hospital my one rep maxes were the same, yet my endurance completely sucked. Fatigue would set in real quick after a couple reps of what I normally rep for 4 sets of 10.  \u261d\ud83c\udffb what they said. Depending on when you were treated and all that stuff there might be some muscle loss just from not being able to work out. For me, after I got out of the hospital I had lost muscle simply because I did not get to work out beyond a little PT and had to rebuilt just like I would have had to if I had taken a break for other reasons. It sucks tho and at least for me took a while to get back to where I wanted to be but I did it. Hang in there!  I am currently in rehab. My family mailed me a bunch of unhealthy (but tasty snacks) to try and make me feel better. I am trying not to gain fat because I am also losing muscle. \n\nI was taken into ICU like the day after Thanksgiving I believe. I was released to rehab about 9 days ago.  Thanks. And yea even when I get out of rehab I will still have to wait several months before I can actually lift weights and go home  and stuff; due to a sticky situation.  Muscle does not go away as fast as fat, especially when you are still eating fine. Do not worry about the junk food. You are going to want to keep your protein up and healthy calories up until you can lift again.  The only way you will lose a significant amount of muscle is if you are under eating. With a disease like this, recovery time will be what determines how much weight you will actually lose (but barely any muscle). Before I even got GBS, I took a break from lifting due to an intense school and work schedule. I had not lifted for roughly two months, did not shed a pound at all, and kept my muscle, but kept a high calorie diet. The only strength you will lose is the natural diminishing strength that happens when you take time off from the gym. No matter what, your muscles are still there, and they will be able to push the same amount of weight. Wish you the best on your recovery!  I will also support what everyone else said here, adding that in some cases (like mine) our muscles atrophy from lack of use. For example, I lost a \\*lot\\* of my muscle mass in my arms, legs, and trunk. I was also off my feet for months. All that said, PT is going to do wonders for you. It is great that you are even attempting 2 lb curls now, so keep up the good work. This sub has a limited amount of folks, so I would suggest the GBS Survivors group on fb - some good info there and people. Additionally, if you ever need to talk or connect, hit me up.  Thanks, I appreciate it.  It is mostly the nerves, but also your muscles become weaker and smaller because they are not being fully stimulated by your nervous system.\n\nThink of your nervous system as a bunch of little electrical wires traveling through your whole body. These electrical wires are coated by a fatty layer called the myelin sheath. The myelin sheath coating is meant to insulate the signals, and keeps the signals very STRONG as they are traveling to their destination. A destination like your bicep muscle where the strong signals are supposed to fully stimulate the muscle and cause a big strong bicep contraction.\n\nThe myelin sheaths are similar to the rubber coating to a vacuum cleaner cord. The electricity from your wall travels directly to the vacuum cleaner, and the rubber coating keeps the electrical signal inside of the cord. The signal stays STRONG because the rubber coating is insulating the signal and it has nowhere else to go but straight to the vacuum cleaner at full power.\n\nIn GBS, your immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheaths and damages it pretty badly. The signals no longer have these nice, insulated cords to travel through. The coating on the cords is somewhat stripped. As the signals travel to their destination, they rapidly lose their power because the myelin is no longer intact and cannot maintain the strength of the signals as they travel. The wiring inside the coating is usually okay, but the coating itself has lost its ability to insulate signals. \n\nBack to the vacuum analogy, its like you strip the rubber coating off of the vacuum cleaner's cord. The electricity flowing to the vacuum no longer has this pristine, perfect, insulating rubber tunnel to travel through. The wire inside is exposed and the signals are fizzling out and are not quite making it to the vacuum. The vacuum is not being fully powered and is weak.\n\nHere is an illustration of myelin to help visualize: \n\nWhen your muscles cannot get those strong signals anymore, the muscles are not being fully stimulated, and begin to atrophy. Just like anyone's muscles that are not being fully used, they lose strength and size.\n\nAs far as your calves go, you might want to get some kind of night splints for both feet. When you are asleep, the tightness may get worse because your feet are probably pointing down, allowing for the calf muscle to shorten and stay shortened. There is all kind of different brands but here is just one example:  Something I thought about doing instead of getting a splint is to sleep in the opposite direction so I can put the bottom of my foot against my headboard (or wall if no headboard) so it does not point down. Thanks I will try it. \n\nHopefully when this is said and done I can regain my muscle.  How are things going now? Feeling stronger?", "Is it safe to do my own (Male,44) urethral catheter when I do not have full function of my hands? \nHi,  I am a 44 year old male and I have been diagnosed with Guillain-Barr\u00e9.   I have recovered relatively quickly, going from being almost fully paralyzed about a month ago to now being mostly (70-80%) functioning on my right side and about 30-40% functioning on my left. (Although my bowel and bladder have not started to recover yet)  I discharge from the hospital in a week and the doctors/nurses want me to learn how to insert my own catheter, due to my bladder issues. \n\nMy concerns:\n- Since my motor function is limited, my left hand will likely not be able to help much, other than maybe stabilizing my penis.  I can lightly grip, but not with much accuracy. Doctors/nurses say this will not be a problem as they have taught paraplegics with limited function in both hands to do it, so they can teach me.  \n\n- I have already had one UTI, so I feel that having a nurse perform the procedure is safer.  They say that there are risks with having a nurse do it at home, because they might not show up on time, and since they are going from house to house, patient to patient, they are carrying around a lot of foreign bacteria.   The staff says that doing it myself, even w/o sterile gloves that the nurses in the hospital wear, is safer because my skin and my home has my own bacteria that I am already used to. (Even though I have two cats and there is always going to be cat dander floating in the air)\n\n- The doctors also reference independence and reduced cost for nursing as benefits, but since I still cannot walk and spend a lot of my time in a hospital bed, my independence is limited anyway.  I have pretty good insurance, so it is possible that they may cover some or all of the nursing cost.  \n\nSo, with all of that, my main question is safety.  If I learn how to self-cath, is it really going to be better than relying on in-home nursing care?  Anyone else have experience, good or bad, with learning how to do it on your own?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice or feedback! Dude, I think you will plenty of sympathy here, but not much advice.   We are random, crazy people on the internet, and not doctors.  \n\nIt is hard to lose independence with GB, and its equally hard to decide when it is safe to claw it back.  I will only leave you with two thoughts.  The first is that your doctors and nurses are professionals, and I expect they know their shit.  Listen to their advice.  \n\nBut the second thing is to remember to be your own advocate.  Your health is your choice.  Get all the information from professionals to help you with that choice, but then decide what is best for you.\n\nBe well! Thanks much for your reply!   Really appreciate your supportive style of honestly. :)\n\nI completely agree with all 3 points you made.  \n\nHeaded to therapy now, but will try to loop back with more a little later.  \n\nThanks again! Ok, got a little time to make some replies.   Like I mentioned earlier, completely agree with what you are saying, and I have been following that, I have a great rehab team, just these few things that spooked me a bit.   I have posted my question to r/askdocs and r/medical also.   Already, I have received some really great replies.  The general consensus is that it is way safer than I am thinking and that even though there are some small risks, the benefits far outweigh them.  \n\nI will be getting comfortable with the catheter and will be doing some trial runs, with the goal of being proficient in the next week. \n\nThank you!", "Pfizer vaccine I had the 2nd shot 2 weeks ago. The first 2 days after I was a mess. The next 3 days, I felt great. I started getting horrible headaches after that for 3 days and 1 week to the day I got up at night and passed out. My blood pressure dropped to 80/60 and I ended up in the hospital for 2 days. I was seen by the Neurologist while in the hospital as I developed numbness in my legs and thought I was going down that road again, but it dissipated pretty much the same day. They said it did not appear to be the GBS. My BP never rebounded to 120/80, which I am pretty consistent with. I was released and felt great the next 2 days. The next day I developed a horrible headache and numbness down my left side. My BP spiked at 187/105. Had a full work up of my heart because of my symptoms. I thought I was having a heart attack but that was not the case. I was released after another night of observation. I am a 55yr old man who does 20 mile bike rides 3 to 4 times a week and have not had any BP issues since I had my bout 3 years ago. I had a follow up visit with my primary care doctor and she is pretty convinced the shot had everything to do with it. It is been a pretty scary couple of weeks. How are you feeling now?  My daughter has CIDP was cleared by her neurologist for the Pfizer vaccine.  After the first shot her arm was sore, but no other side effects.  2nd shot scheduled for this Saturday. I feel good at the moment, but it is been peaks and valleys.Luckily the GBS has not returned. I hope she has a better result. I am hoping the side effects go away soon. If the doctors released you, I think you can have confidence you probably are not in any immediate danger. Unfortunately, it sounds like they did not give you many answers though. Sorry you have had to go through all of this; it sounds pretty upsetting.\n\nI wish I could give you something more certain. But I think your body just needs to provide more data before the situation can be better understood by you, your doctors, or anyone else really. That might take another day, or possibly several. Everything is just a bit too non-specific and all over the place right now to say for sure what is going on. I am not a doctor, but I am betting that is part of the reason for why they released you. No signs of an emergency or situation spiraling out of control. If there is not a clear progression or a clear disorder, they might be hoping it is an odd interacting collection of minor things that will just spontaneously go away on its own. \n\nThere is response to the vaccine, post-vaccine systemic inflammation, pre-existing neurological condition, anxiety, and probably more things that can be interacting now and just creating a big mess. As things calm down, it will probably be more easy to figure out what, if anything, is the primary issue and then go from there. So that is not to say it is nothing. I would say more like definitely definitely keep tabs on this and treat it seriously. But I think you also have some cause to be cautiously optimistic about your situation as well.\n\nNumbness that goes away in a few days. Numbness on just one side. These do not sound like GBS symptoms to me. So I would not start worrying about relapse just yet. The blood pressure is strange. But there are not many things that cause alternating hypo and then hypertension. And there will be a bad period. And then you feel great. That is also pretty unusual. Could be your body is gradually working through some things. Could be multiple distinct potentially unrelated things your body has worked through. And anxiety can throw around all kinds of bad data that would contaminate our understanding of the situation.\n\nIt sounds like your body keeps finding a way back to feeling great. So I would have some confidence that eventually all this garbage will pass, your body will work through this, and you will be back to feeling fine. I would recommend keeping a log of your symptoms - what gets worse, what gets better and when. Maybe track what you ate, any medication, and if you exercised and when as well. What you will be looking for are any interesting patterns that start to emerge. Something that you could help tell you if you need to go back and if so point out to a doctor so that if you have to go in again, they would not need to send you home at least without more answers. \n\nAlso see if you cannot write it in a log and then just put it out of mind as well. I know I HATE it when people acted like my symptoms were all in my head. But we also know that the less anxiety you feel, the easier it is going to be to suss out what is real and what is not in your body. It might also take a couple days to get more answers.\n\nSorry you are going through this. I would treat it seriously but stay cautiously optimistic. Good luck! Good luck, I just took my 2nd shot today. \n\nI have been nervous but I figured it was safer than getting covid in the wild and get a relapse from that.\n\nHow was your first gbs experience? Did you have mild, moderate or an extreme case? I wonder if that had anything to do with it.\n\nAgain good luck and I hope you have a full recovery!! Thanks for sharing your experience. I am hesitant to get this vaccine because I have had GBS and now POTS. I had a moderate case. I lost the ability to walk without assistance and pretty severe nerve damage but was able to breathe on my own. Took me 6 months to get back to work. I was hesitant too, but I think I would rather go through this bump in the road than get COVID. I do not do well with being sick with chest congestion. I talked it through with my doctor before I made the decision to get it. Thanks, I truly believe the vaccine combined with my gbs is what is going on. I am pretty certain it is going to resolve itself soon. I have my appointment for the 2nd Shot Thursday AM (tomorrow). No matter what happens.\n\n\nI will take this minor risk over any of the side effects COVID can dish out up to and including death.  The more of us that take this the less chance we become incubators for a mutation that starts the cycle again. We can also provide valuable data for the CDC and healthcare professionals. \n\n\nI will guinea pig for others with GB like us any day. I am not regretting getting it. Just passing on my experience with the vaccine. Its appreciated! The more we report good and bad the better data is out there. I will post my experience on Saturday. How are you doing now?

I had a chronic version of GBS (not CIDP though) back in 2014 and was in and out of hospital with relapses until about 2017. I am 'recovered' now, but I have noticed that ever since my GBS started, I have some days when my arms and legs develop a weird intangible ache that is not necessarily painful, but really uncomfortable. The ache is only relieved when I massage the muscle or move around, and makes sitting down/trying to go to sleep really frustrating. \n\nI have never really seen this type of symptom being described before, and was wondering if anyone else could relate? I have had GBS/AIDP for almost 7 months. I still cannot feel my hands and also have zero feeling below my legs. The last two months I have been getting these increasing pains just below my shoulders and above my biceps. I get sharp pains when I lift my arms. It also hurts just to lay on my side. I also get these weird kinks in those spots like my bones clinking. At a total loss on this. Maybe I will start taking calcium with my other vitamins. If you can elaborate more or keep me posted I would greatly appreciate it. IMO, that may not necessarily be related to GBS.  Those symptoms could be the result of a worsening vitamin/mineral deficiency, thyroid issues (e.g., hypothyroidism can ratchet up muscle pain), even relatively mild hypertension, etc.  \n\nSomething simple like a deficit in magnesium generates that restless pain in my own body.    \n\nI would suggest asking your PCP for a script for some bloodwork - a CMP, CBC, thyroid panel and perhaps a Vitamin D level. I am only just less than 6 months out of treatment, but I do have this weird achy feeling in my legs once in a while. I cannot event say it actually hurts, it sometimes feels like something is happening inside of the bones of my legs sometimes if that makes sense. \nI consulted my doctors about this, and they ruled my symptoms out as just the nerves recovering and a side effect of the disease. I hope you have access to doctors if it keeps bothering you! I have CIDP but I totally get the whole muscle pain thing. I found that doing physiotherapy has helped when I get random bouts of pain. I spent a long time in hospital and managed to build up a bank of different exercises to work out those muscles. I am suspecting that the pain is due to stiffness and repetitive movements but I always feel a bit better after working out. \n\nI agree with another poster, maybe get some tests done. I do take magnesium and calcium as a supplement as well as iron twice a week. I also take vitamin d for my bones because of some of the medications I am on. \n\nNot sure if this helps, but I have also used massage as well. Baths and showers seem to help me as well. \n\nI am so unsure if this helps, but I hope it helps a little bit!", "Is anybody else just exhausted all the time now? Title. Since my two stints with GBS I am so tired now. I eat plenty, I sleep more than 9 hours a night, I do light exercises, and I do not work more than 10 hours a day. Yet I am still exhausted at the end of each day. Does anyone else have this experience? Do you have any suggestions? Currently I am just drinking a ton of espresso. Thanks! Yes, ABSOLUTELY. I do not have any suggestions, I just do my best to power through it. Yeah that is how I have been. It is rough too when people see me and think I am in the best shape of my life and I am like \u201cnah man I just lost 40 lbs from being paralyzed and I am super tired now\u201d It is really difficult, in a different way, when you move past the hospitalization. Do you get nerve pain still? I get it a lot during the cold months. It is really hard looking \"normal\" and people do not understand because they cannot actually *see* the issues you are having. Yeah I still have a lot in my hands, feet, and calves. I still have tremors in my left hand/arm too. I have learned to be a better advocate for myself during all of this. Yes all the time. The only thing that kind of helps is when I eat healthy, get good sleep, and try to keep stress down. I feel my best when I try to do those things. I recommend high dosages of daily B12 shots. 3ml/day. It is the only medicine that combats fatigue and lack of vitality. You can buy it of the Internet. CIDP here and I am jealous you can even do all that... exhausted but never feeling rested is the worst. I got very lucky with my recovery. Paralyzed, intubated, the works. I am technically undiagnosed since I show the symptoms of AIDP, Miller-Fisher, and like two others.\n\nI am so sorry for your situation. It is really rough trying to go back to what people consider \"normal.\" Uphill battle definitely. Yep :( And I had it when I was 5. I had an extreme case of mono when I was in my teens, did variety water polo and kept pushing until I hit a wall and nearly drowned, body just stopped working, which is a really extreme response to mono so maybe there are some compounding conditions which happened - GBS has shown tentative links to eipstein-barr. I have had several other moments like that through my life where I felt that weak, usually after heavy emotional times (like my dad dying). Did not have monk, though it felt like I did, body just got incredibly heavy and weak and I got super tired.\n\nI try to stay active, but it wears me out, which means I do not lose weight, which contributes to the whole issue. Sucky cycle. Same position I am in. I feel for you. It is tough too because the doctors do not completely understand what I have. They thought it was AIDP, then Epstein-Barr, then Miller-Fisher, and now they just label it \u201cGBS\u201d and that is it. I am pretty optimistic about everything, but the feeling of not knowing for sure what I have contributes to the fatigue. I really appreciate you sharing. Fatigue is by far the most bothersome residual. I guess I am used to it but at work it seems like people notice and they think I am angry or something and take it personally, when I am not even aware of what I am doing to make them think that. I cannot help it.\n\nVitamin D has been helping me though. If you get any, get a kind that includes vitamin K2 - D improves calcium absorption from your diet, while K2 will make sure that extra calcium gets put in your bones instead of your kidneys or arteries.\n\nI am also going to look into B12 shots like the other guy said.", "After recovering, has anyone tried modafinil/provigil to combat long-term fatigue?  I have not heard of it. Daily B12 shots work well for me.  Interesting. What is your regimen like, and how much does it cost you? I have been on it for about 4 years. I am not convinced it helps with my extreme fatigue but it has a low/mild list of side effects so worth trying.  Hi my friend, I get it from  but it comes from Thailand. They had a batch for $10 per mini bottle of 2000 mcg that lasts about a week. I bought 20 of them for $236 in total (every tenth bottle is free and a repeat customer discount of 10 percent. I give myself daily shots. Sometimes two per day. If you know a veterinarian, you can get it at cost for $13 per 250ml bottle, that is a quarter of a liter. The beauty is, you cannot overdose. It has no side effects and makes you feel so much better.  says, there are no adverse effects. I figured it out when I was in Manila for work. I have GBS, Miller Fisher and bilateral Bells Palsy. Out of a sudden I had double vision. Not a thing g you want in a developing country. I closed one eye and walked to my hotel room. I gave myself my last shot if B12 and zzzzzztt my eyes went back to normal as soon as the B12 entered my body. I went down to the local pharmacy and bought a year's supply for $80. I beg you to try it. 4 weeks at least 2ml daily, 3ml if you have enough. And after 4 weeks look back at your pain level, your fatigue, and the ability to do any kind of exercise. I am sure you will agree that B12 is a wonderful magic medication for people like us. If you know anybody in Asia it will be much cheaper for you. It is sold on cock fighting websites. :). Keep me updated, my friend.  Update: There is a new pharmacy in  Houston that sells B12 via mail order super cheap! 50000 mcg for $45.

I had a brain tumor removed, a few days later I was paralyzed from my ears down and on life support. Doctors thought my symptoms were associated with that.  They told my husband and kids to say their good-byes.  One of the doctors did the puncture and they confirmed GBS.  It took 4 IVIG treatments before I started to improve. \nAt one point my body was under a tent because I could not stand the pain of something touching me.  It was 97 days later I was finally released from hospital.  That was thirteen years ago.  The damage to the nerves in my feet is permanent.  It has been ten years and I still have very little feeling in my feet. It is a fuzzy feeling that I do have.  Like wearing shoes that are two sizes too small. It is the first thing I feel in the morning and the last I feel at night. I have good and bad years!  I have found flip flops that allow me to walk. The thick soles wear to my walking pattern and it helps me keep my balance.  I cannot wear shoes. You just do what you can to carry on. Only a few weeks ago I was able to get a work from home job.

Hey iwas fully paralyzed for a bit and it sucks but it is natural to feel Down message me if you have any quesions Try talking with a therapist, they have virtual and over the phone appointments now. It definitely gets better over time. I felt that way soon after I first came home because I was angry and depressed, and tired of dealing with the shit.

I had it last year when I was 16. Lots of days I feel like I should have died in the hospital. I spent 21 days on the ventilator and it was probably the worst, most scary experience of my life. I had flashbacks every day at 3 AM for a long time. I guess if you want to talk about it with someone your age just PM me on Reddit? Oh I just get you with them flashbacks. Was also on vent but for less days. Also, the unfortunate thing about teenagers is that the vast majority of them are shitty people until they grow the hell up.

To add on to the therapy suggestion, consider CBT - it is a much more active type of therapy and can be empowering which is important in your recovery process!", "Pregnant with GBS Hey guys, been doing so much research on GBS since my sister in law was diagnosed 9 days ago. \n\nShe has mono and hep A, we think that is how she got GBS. She is also 31 weeks pregnant. She came into the hospital Saturday and on Monday they had to put her on a ventilator and do a feeding tube for her. \n\nI am reading others stories on here and they do not mention being on life support as well. Is this uncommon? I just want to help her and I am currently staying the night with her in the ICU. All she can move is her eyelids. Any advice? Or encouragements? We want to see her through this.\n\nThanks friends I am of the opinion that the only thing common with GBS is it is largely different in every case.  There is talk of some folks being where she is right now if you dig through here some.  That is not important right now though in the big picture (again in my opinion).\n\nBe there when she is awake. Talk to her, involve her.  I personally have not heard of a case that involved loss of hearing.  Is there a favorite book of hers to read her aloud (I would avoid anything too depressing, but you know her I do not), music she enjoys, etc?  I enjoyed the interactions with people the most while I was stuck in bed, though I could always talk on my own, even if slurred. \n\nKeep a positive attitude, be positive with her. There will be ups and downs. She is highly likely to recover at least some mobility from here. Some, like myself have recovered with almost no remaining issues. I was absolutely in that same place!  And that was before diagnosis. They told my husband and kids to say good bye because they could not stop it.  But the IVIG finally took and I did recover. My only residual is that my feet are still \u201cfuzzy\u201d.    I walked out of the hospital 97 days later. She could be longer or shorter, every one is different.\nI think the most important thing is that she be reassured that her baby will be fine, make sure she has all the information the doctors can provide for her. \nSmall practical things, while she is in the hospital get her her own pillow, or a blanket from home.  My family kept a calendar for me.  Things like, they took the respirator out today, or she sat up today, or what ever they were thinking.  One sister would write that the other one was wearing an ugly sweater, or that such and such team won a game.  I suffered from a thing where I did not know where my arms and legs were, I was convinced they were off the bed.  One sister wrote \u201cshe lost her legs again\u201d.    \u201cBad poop day\u201d , that lasted a while.  Wash her hair, is she wants get her her makeup.  \nTell her not to be afraid of saying what she wants or what she is thinking.  She needs to tell people she is tired for them to go, or that she is sick of being sick.  Just being around is important.\nFeel free to message me if I can help.", "IVIG side effect management? I was diagnosed with CIDP a 2 months ago, and thankfully my symptoms have not been bad enough that I needed to be hospitalized, but I spend most of my time in bed or on the couch because I am always tired, weak, and burning.\n\nI just started IVIG on Friday , but the side effects are terrible... any advice beyond just staying super hydrated? I have my last infusion tomorrow, and frankly I am terrified. The Iv hurts when it is in, and the headache makes my head want to explode. Ask your doctor if you can pre-medicate. I get benadryl, Tylenol, and Zofran before each infusion.\n\nI do not know what to tell you about the IV except maybe get it in a different place? I am a hard stick so I have them put it in my forearm and then leave it there for the week that I need to get it. It is easier than being in my hand or wrist or elbow. I have been pre-medicating, but I will try the forearm stick, as of now I have had it in my elbow and hand. Thanks for your suggestions!!! The headache seemed to be related to the drip rate for me.  Are they able to slow the drip some, or is this a case where you come in and you are taking up space while getting treatment?  I was admitted so an extra hour was not a big deal. They showed the drip today, took double the time but hopefully it will help! Thanks \ud83d\ude0a That sucks. Sorry it is such a grind, beyond just having CIDP.\n\nI finally went to a port - so much easier, and makes all the difference. You may want to see if a different brand of immune globulin would be better - there are a few; they each have slightly different formulas/binding agents, and although it is a pretty thick, viscous fluid, perhaps your system will react better to a different one. The headaches are likely from too high a flow rate for you; everyone tolerates a different setup. Your titration rate starts slow, so maybe just keep that, then next time go up one rate level and see how you tolerate that. You should be able to find a flow-rate level you can tolerate. And, make sure to take the pre-meds, if you are not already.\n\nHope it gets better for you... it is not ever fun, but terrified is a non-starter. Talk to your nurses and your doc. Best wishes to you. Thanks for all the suggestions and for taking the time to respond! I will look into the distant brands.", "Communicating with GBS patient with tracheostomy....how to talk with my mom or how to get her to tell me what she needs.... Hello- week 8 of my mom having GBS(tracheostomy for 6 weeks). She is regaining use of her arms hands and we think she could point to words on a board or page so that she communicate more easily......is there a website or anything that I could go to and maybe print out a page of common words? I have looked and looked and all I see are pages with images...but I think words would work better\n.....also- she had a voice valve on last week and was able to say a few things but they will not let her do it again because she has too many secretions. I literally want to punch almost every respiratory therapist in the throat b/c they are the least helpful people on the planet(at least here in Aurora CO where my mom is). They gave me a page with the alphabet but that is not helping....\nSincerely,\nThe most frustrated daughter in the entire fucking world There are adaptive devices that people who are non-verbal can use, like this: ( If you look for adaptive devices for non-verbal people there are several options. Hope this helps! From someone who was on the other side of the fence, with the tracheostomy, it is equally frustrating not being able to communicate!  Can she write? My kids brought me a huge pad and markers. I could not print finely but could make big letters with my whole arm not the fine motor skills needed to write. It was almost like playing \u201cPictionary \u201c, they had to guess a lot at what I was trying to say. As my hands got closer to being useful I could communicate better. It is so easy to forget the long term goal for all the detours and anguish along the way.  Wash her hair, bring her a pillow from home and hopefully things will clear up soon. Hello I went through a similar situation and what they did was attach a laser pointer to a pair of glasses. If you put a word chart on the wall or common phrases this is a possible solution. If your mother can move her neck this is a possible solution. Sorry to hear about your mum. \n\nDepending on how much hand movement she can manage, maybe finger spelling? I used the American Sign Language alphabet to communicate to my family - it was slow but easy because it only used one hand. Initially, I communicated with a straw in my mouth and pointed to letters on a piece of paper. It was slow and often frustrating in part because some people would use the QWERTY side (which was much easier for me) and some would use the alphabetical side. Picking one and sticking with it would help.\n\nAlso, some people held the sheet too close to my face or too far to the side, making it impossible to reach certain letters.\n\nAnd people definitely varied in how well they could guess ahead.\n\nLater, I got glasses with a laser pointer on the side. That sped things up a ton.\n\nYou might also want to check out the Speakprose app. It seems to be word based but might help. I would be very interested to know if it is useful. If not, I am thinking of making an app designed to help communication in this exact scenario!\n\nI hope your mother continues to improve even if it is taking a frustratingly long amount of time \ud83d\ude41 From my experience on your mothers side (33 years ago now) laminated sheets (as big as you can get - I had eyesight issues as well) of things like those found by searching \u201chospital communication board template\u201d on google.\nConventional dry wipe whiteboards may work when her motor skills get better to be able to write again.", "Random noticing about CIDP symptoms Howdy-  I have recently been at least partially diagnosed with CIDP... \n\nMy neurologist honestly is not quite sure what is wrong with me, but wanted to start IVIG to see if my symptoms improved.  I have gone through 3 infusions  grams over three days.\n\nThis last infusion did not seem as effective upfront but in the later weeks seemed to be beneficial.\n\nAll that aside\u2014 my main issue is that when I walk in horizontal lines only- I experience drop attacks.  Meaning I literally just fall the ground and land on my knees, catch myself with my hands as if I was falling from my hips. \n\nHere is the crazy part-  I go into the woods during the cooler months of year to photograph deer and other wildlife, and have to wear rubber boots to cross water and mud and the like. All last year oct-feb when I was wearing my rubber boots and walking in the woods- no problem- when I would get back to the camp- and switch to regular shoes- I would start falling.\n\nSo fast forward to this year. I have been very hesitant to go into the woods, but made myself over the Thanksgiving break. So I dawned my rubber boots and started walking. Now the trails I was taking are muddy, uneven, and  I had to cross several areas of water. I had zero issues while wearing my boots...\n\nSo my question(s)\n\n1). Has anyone else had something like happen?\n2). Have you all found any correlation between issues and certain footwear?\n\nAny thoughts/insights would be greatly appreciated! Is it possible that when you are walking over uneven/difficult terrain you are being much more aware and careful? Walking is something people do not give a second thought to normally unless they are in difficult terrain. So maybe being aware is stopping you from falling but when you are not walking in the difficult terrain your mind goes back to thinking everything is easy, goes into autopilot and you run into trouble.", "Does GBS always affect both sides? When standing while playing my ps4 I noticed my feet started to get numb with the pins and needle feeling; then my hands started to tingle as well. I took my blood glucose measurement with my dad's monitor and noticed I did not have diabetes. Currently, my left leg and foot are numb pretty well as of right now. My right side only gets numb on and off, but my left leg is constant more than my left arm. When I sit on the toliet for 15 seconds squatting my legs go SUPER numb within 15 seconds, which does not sound right at all. Is this GBS? I am really fucking scared rn. What do I do to get tested? I visited a doctor and she said that nothing was wrong neurologically but I am getting worried. I got a blood test too, but I do not know what correlates to nerve damage in that. I think you probably just need to get up and move more. Sounds like your legs are just falling asleep because of the way you are sitting. Might be slightly pressing on a nerve. what other treatment would u suggest for a pinched nerve? Stretching, heating and cooling, and then just making sure you are not stressing the affected area. I recently pinched a nerve in my shoulder blade and it just took time.\n\nYou could also have a slipped disk in your back that is pushing against a nerve. I have sciatica caused by one on top of GBS, and the best thing for me is having good posture, controlling my weight and making sure my core is strong ok thanks!", "Insomnia I was diagnosed recently with GBS.  I have been also dealing with brutal insomnia which came on suddenly around the time of my GBS symptoms.  I now go some days with 3.5-5 hours total of broken up sleep and occasionally of absolutely no sleep at all.  Did anyone else experience this?  How did you cope?  Did IVIG help with sleep disturbances/insomnia? Oh dear goodness me too! It is terrible. I lay in bed for hours and my brain is just like nope, no sleep for you. About 3am I finally nod off and I sleep in spurts. Although just like you some nights I just give up and get up. I tried warm tea with milk, Benadryl, staying up really late, heck I even had a few oxycodone left over from the hospital and nothing worked.  I just called my doctor today and she prescribed Trazodone 50mg. So hopefully that does the trick. I will keep you posted.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention I started with plasmapheresis until it almost killed me (some sort of allergic reaction I guess), then did 4 treatments of IVIG. I originally thought my insomnia was just being in the hospital in a terrible bed with terrible food, being woken up every 2 hours poking needles into me, or asking me stupid questions. I also had quit a bit of nerve pain but the gabapentin took care of that. But the IVIG did not really change the insomnia much. And it continued after I got home, about 2 weeks ago. I never had any sleep issues before so it is very likely related. Ask your doctor for either a sleep aid or anti anxiety drug. It is part of GBS. You will have to get medication. I have been taking melatonin, but it is not working so great anymore.  I tried hydroxyzine for a few days and that did absolutely nothing.  Now my doctor prescribed amitriptyline 10mg.  I have been reluctant to take the amitriptyline because I have been trying to avoid becoming dependent on it.  I was holding out and hoping the IVIG would hopefully help with the insomnia too, but it sounds like that may not be the case.  This stinks. I could not sleep because of muscle and nerve pains, so i was prescribed sleeping tablets as part of my medication to help me sleep at night. Thanks to everyone for the info.  Did your insomnia/sleep issues eventually resolve or improve? I have used OTC doxylamine with a lot of success for years at the same dose. I also try not to eat a few hours before bed and no caffeine after 12 noon.\n\nThe GBS/CIDP and many of the meds themselves (steroids!) conspire against restful sleep. I did see doxylamine at Costco.  Apparently they have their own brand of it.  I may have to check that out. yes. I still deal with it. Omgsh, me too! And I have no idea if it is related or not bc the many doctors I have been working with never identified insomnia as a symptom but it is been painful.. maybe stress My neurologist was not familiar with insomnia being associated with GBS.  But as you can see from what a lot of others who have had GBS have said, it does appear to be an issue.", "GBS Impact Survey Hi, I am conducting personal research work on the impact of GBS on its patients and require responses to the attached survey.

Some nights are worse than others, but often flairs after heavy PT days. In an attempt to get off the heavy drugs, we have been leaning into THC &amp; CBD products, but if anyone has any suggestions we are all ears! I take gabapentin for mi e but also indulge in thc related thangs yknow I also have hands and feet neural pain, specially at night. I had been diagnosed back in September, still recovering. \n\nI take pregabalin twice a day, most of the days it works, very few does not I have that. Fortunately not too often. i have this! cbd definitely helps my pain!! My wife often has spasms in her shoulders and calves at night. I just got her a heated mattress cover. She loves it.\n\nMaybe a heated blanket will work, or a heating pad for a lot of warmth in a small area. Diagnosed in October here! I was very lucky to have not too fast of an onset (about 2 weeks before things got bad) and a quick recovery. Like you, I do still have weird feelings in my hands and feet, especially at night. Weed really helps me out. I can still feel it, but it is not as intense or \u201cfront of mind\u201d. That, and I notice that if I am well hydrated I do not feel it as much either. Maybe acupuncture?  I did not try it because I detest needles.  I know that it can help with a variety of issues.  For what it is worth, I experience that but it has decreased over time. I use Aspercreme with Licdocaine on my feet and hands. It calms the nerve pain for me. Also, I have tried Willow Balm and it works well too, but I prefer the Aspercreme. I take 600 mg of Gabapentin twice daily. They told me the pain is worse at night because there is less sensory input, as you are lying still, so the foot pain is more noticeable. Good luck - it gets better.", "Mom 67 Possible newly diagnosed with CIPD and have questions ", "Yoga? Has anyone here with GBS has given yoga a try? I am exploring it as an option and would love to know your thoughts. I did Tai Chi when I was in the rehab hospital. Really great for focusing on steady, fluid motions. Have not tried yoga though. I tried doing really gentle yoga but it made my symptoms worse (but I am not in the recovery stages yet) I do yoga weekly and I find it very helpful. I do iyengar, which is generally slow and done with assistive devices and alternative poses when needed. I use the wall for balance. \n\nI have had a few incidents where I got a very strong cramp, and there are lots of things I cannot do (headstands for example), but I am ok with not being perfect. 18 month out from diagnosis and experimenting with yoga, barre and tai chi to rebuild strength. So far, I can make it 10, maybe 20 mins into a class before feeling wiped out. I am hoping my strength would gradually build up. Here is to 2020! First and foremost, I would say listen to your doctor and physiotherapist.  The exercises they prescribe are specific to rebuilding the core the muscles you lost.  If you want to look into other options to supplement that, you might get some additional benefit.  I would still ask Physio if there is anything that you should/should not be trying at your stage of recovery though I do yoga several times a week.

Not much has worked so 5 years of suffering. I will share anything I can. Diagnosed in October, still navigating it myself but I will try to help where I can! Diagnosed one month ago but with a mild case. The course can be so variable - mine started improving on its own and then the IVIG worked like magic getting me back to normal. Waiting to see if it comes back after the IViG wears off. I think the treatments we have for this are among the best with least side effects. I have been in remission for 6 years now. Did a year of ivig for 3-4 days a month. Took months for someone to take me seriously so I have permanent nerve damage in finger and toes. It occurs mostly as not sensing temperature, like walking outside in snow with no shoes to check the mail, or touching something super hot without realizing it. But then swings the opposite way and is hyper sensitive to temperature. Diagnosed last year, caused by mold exposure, on IVIG. Diagnosed about 2 months ago, I am in the hospital right now for the second round of IVIG, I did not notice any improvement from the first infusion. Hoping it kicks in this time. Got it from the single strain H1N1 shot in 2009. Was acute, probably GBS, 4 months. Not diagnosed until 2012. IVIG, no remission, but treatable. Now on Hizentra, trying to get stronger with fewer bad days. Message me for doctor recommendation if you want. Diagnosed with GBS in April 2020 when I was having slow progression of weakness and numbness and underwent 5 days ivig. I could walk but had balance issues. I got worse and was hospitalized again in June and diagnosed with CIDP. I was on a walker and given steroids and then started ivig again every 3 weeks since October. It seems to be holding any further progression or flares at bay so far.", "Is it possible to live with GBS for several years and be undiagnosed? Or is it something that is very clear? I guess what I am wondering is: can you live in severe pain and suffer from a variety of the issues associated GBS and not have those issues be bad enough to require hospitalization or is it something tbag is very clear that once you get it there is no recovering and you will be hospitalized right away? GBS. No, it is acute onset is exactly that. Acute and usually rapid. \n\nEntirely possible to live with the chronic version CIDP though. Get in contact with the gbs/cidp foundation and they can point you towards specialists that could possibly diagnose the symptoms you are experiencing. Gbs-cidp.org", "Question about recovery - numbness Hi all, I am about a month out of hospital after being diagnosed with Miller Fisher Syndrome. \n\nMy balance has come back but I still have double vision, hopefully a gradual improvement back to 100% is on the cards.\n\nMy concern is that I wake up a few times a night with that feeling of having slept on my arm, like numbness that goes away as soon as I get it moving. I notice it happens in both arms regularly, and sometimes in my feet if I am sitting for long periods.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this during recovery? It seems like a different sensation to when my hands and feet were numb while hospitalised, but it also seems like too much of a coincidence to not be related somehow. \n\nAll the best everyone! I still struggle with numbness in hands and feet. It is been eight years now. Best advice I can give is to keep moving. I had sensory predominant GBS. Pre-diagnosis I would have crazy numbness at night (I was worried about not waking up in the morning). Whatever side I slept on would become completely numb, and if I slept on my back my whole body would become numb. This would pass shortly after I woke up, and was noticeably different from the arm and leg numbness I had during the day. Good news is that it passed during recovery and the night numbness stopped entirely. Wow, that puts it in perspective. It sounds like a much more severe version of what I am getting now. Thanks for the information. Thanks for replying. I have restarted exercise recently, hope this helps get things on track.", "New to this whole thing (tangentially) So I have been in an awesome relationship with an amazing woman (We will call her Lucy) whom I have known for years, but only really started seriously dating/being in a real relationship with for about two months. \n\nMy sister is about to give birth to her first, and asked me if I was up to date on my immunizations. I said I was, and would ask Lucy if she was as well. \n\nShe said she could not get the TDaP,  &amp; that is how I found out about GBS. \n\nI am not new to reddit, so I turned here. \n\nShe had her first/only episode when she was much younger (15 ish years ago), so I am wondering what I can do to best help her stay informed. She does not really know/use reddit. I have checked out a bunch of the top posts in this sub, but if anyone has a collection of sources, or knows of a post that does I would be forever grateful. Hello. I have been told that by my neurologist that the chances of getting the disease you need to be inoculated for, are much higher,  than the chances of getting GBS from the vaccine.  The connection between GBS and vaccines is so small it should not prevent anyone from getting them. Here is some sites I frequented when I first got diagnosed:\n\n1. ( \n\n2. ( \n\n3. (  I had GBS in 1995. I do not get flu shots, but I am current on all other vaccinations. Have never heard anything about standard (non-flu) vaccines leading to GBS recurrences, and I have seen literally dozens of doctors over the years dealing with GBS fallout. Never. This statement literally varies from neurologist to neurologist. Having been under 3 they have all told me different things. from \"Yes, do it\". To \"No, do not you dare\", to, \"Up to you\".\n\nI personally have not had the jabs. But I imagine as I age (currently 32) I will get them.\n\n Where are you based? If in the UK - Gain (the charity) have got some good info, however the helpline, as useful as its sounds should be used sparingly and you end up hearing peoples experiences, which, with this illness EVERYONE is different. You start drawing comparisons, and is the start of the slippery slope. The CDC advises GBS survivors do not get TDaP:  \n( is a link to the GBS/CIDP International Foundation. Through them, you can read/watch stories from survivors, learn more about the syndrome and find local networks. Many cities have a local representative who can help you find specialist doctors or support groups. Thank you so much  The only vaccination that GBS patients are recommend not to take is the flu. If in doubt contact the CDC. They will answer all your questions.  Were in the Midwest US I am also in the Midwest, and I got guillaine Barre from the flu shot in 2016.\n\nMy neurologist has stated I should NOT get the flu shot because I have GBS before. Thank you very much for this You are welcome! Thanks, first time I have seen that - though to be complete it does say to talk to your doctor, not a blanket ban. Yep, ultimately it is discretionary. Medical professionals will give the best advice on the issue. I had GBS in 2006, and now work in a hospital. I am up to date on all my vaccinations, except the flu shot.\n\nThere is no reason to avoid all vaccines, and I have been told because my GBS was not linked to the flu shot (and I successfully had the flu shot for a number of years prior to GBS), that I would not have any problems having the vaccination. I still pass. I am late to the conversation, but I just found this paper that looked specifically at vaccines and re-occurrence. In short, they found no conection, though understandably the sample size was small.

", "Brother still completely paralyzed after a month My brother was suddenly rushed to the ER about a month ago because he was starving to have trouble using his body and breathing. Within hours he was intubated and completely paralyzed. He then developed pneumonia.\n\nA month later he has a feeding tube and a tracheotomy and can only somewhat move his eyes left and right. He cannot open his eyelids on his own though. \n\nThe Dr said the IVIG is not working. He is on antibiotics still. I talked to him today and my heart is breaking. What can I do for him? Are there other treatments? Has anyone else been paralyzed like this? What did you wish you could have asked for? I am taking him an iPad so he can listen to shows or music. He can only answer yes it no and cannot do it for too long either. I am so sorry. In 2019 I was intubated and completely paralyzed for two weeks. IVIG worked for me but it took time.  In terms of other treatments, there is plasmapheresis. I did not have it done so I do not have any experience with it but I know it works better for some. When I was in the hospital they said they would have done that if IVIG did not work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not remember much from my time in the hospital, but I do remember my younger brothers spending time with me. Just having them there and watching movies was nice. I was unconscious most of the time but when i would wake up it was really nice having them there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne small thing I wish someone did for me was make it so my hospital blankets would not push my feet down. I was bedridden for about a month so because my feet were pushed down by the blankets for so long my calves tightened up so much and i lost so much muscle. Just make sure he is comfortable. Maybe move his legs for him if you are allowed to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, I am so sorry. I know how heartbreaking it is. Stay strong for him. Be there for him. And one of the biggest things: BE AN ADVOCATE FOR HIM. He cannot advocate for himself. I had nurses pumping me full of painkillers and I could barely do anything even once I started recovering. HAd to have my family help me out. Just be there for him. I hope he gets better quickly and I wish you both the best of luck. Thank you so much I will definitely try. They had not let anyone in with him because of Covid but just recently let my mom in. She just did a video call for me today with him. But he seemed to lose consciousness while I was taking to him. Mom said he is on a bunch of painkillers so I told her to let him rest. I am going to try and see him tomorrow. \n\nI have an autoimmune myself and I am trying so hard not to keep crying so I do not flare up. But honestly I am so scared for him. I am so sorry. This could take a long time, but you have got to keep hope. I am sure him just knowing that you and your mom are supporting him helps. If the doctors do not start giving him plasmapheresis soon maybe ask if it is an option.\n\nStay strong, you have got this. I also became completely paralyzed and intubated in 2018. The 1st hospital did not diagnose me, so by the time I got to the second hospital, my breathing was labored. Fortunately, they diagnosed me within a half hour. The IVIG treatment did not work for me either; so they did the plasmapheresis treatment, and that did work. Once I was able to move any part of my body, I was transferred to an inpatient rehab to relearn how to do everything from changing the remote to walking. \n\nWhile in hospital before I could talk again (due to trache) I communicated using a letter sheet, pointing to letters. Thank God for my sisters, who advocated for me, got me into a rehab covered by my insurance, then had me stay with them until it was safe for me to be back home. I did every kind of rehab offered by my insurance, inpatient, home care and outpatient, until ai was able to do everything I could do prior to getting sick. \n\nNow my biggest residual issue is the chronic fatigue and my wrists and toes sometimes ache. \n\nIt sounds like your brother did not get treated fast enough, same as me, so he definitely needs the plasmapheresis, then he will need physics;, occupational, and speech therapies in a rehab hospital, like Moss Rehab. Best of luck and prayers to your brother. It is a months-long recovery process. Stay hopeful.  I was paralyzed, with a feeding tube and trach.  I had the trach 83 days and the feeding tube for more than two months.  The paralysis lasted for close to two months.  Recovery started with me able to lift my index finger.  It was slow going but my family was so encouraging and each slow, tedious movement was celebrated.  The worse part was not being able to communicate other than with eye movement.  \n\nThe ICU staff asked my family what shows and movies I enjoyed and would have the TV turned on to things I liked.  It helped with the passing of time.    I wish they did audio books as well.\n\nI wish the best for your brother.  Every GBS patient is different and responds differently.  Look into the GBS/CIDP Society online.  Next month is the Convention and it is virtual like last year. Thank you so much! I will def look into that society. \n\nIt is very encouraging to know others have recovered. I am not sure how much I can help him because I have an autoimmune disease myself with many complications. I can barely manage to take care of myself. But at least I want to provide emotional support. \n\nIt really helps to get an idea of what to expect. Thank you! Same story here, paralyzed, feeding tube, trach.  Agree communicating was hard. Things I appreciated; my own pillow(big one), photo of my kids, my family had a big calendar and people wrote stuff on. What they wrote often had nothing to do with me but would be part of every day life if you were out and about, Liz bought a blue dress, Janes cat had kittens, they called a federal election.  \nI ended up with a little tent over me because I could not stand the pain of anything touching me.   It took a while for the IVIG to work.  Sometimes I thought my legs were hanging off my bed, they were not. \nSomeone took a photo of me\u2026later another one\u2026showed me my progress.\nYou take care of yourself too. There will be enormous ups and very deep downs throughout this whole thing. Did your brother take supplements, ask if they can be included in his regiment.  Explain things to him. Let him know what is happening. If you can play his favourite movies, that can help ease anxiety. \nHang in there. Keep posting his progress and keep asking questions. Had GBS in April but no where as severe as he has it. I am so sorry to hear this. \n\nIs there a specific reason they are pumping him with pain killers? \n\nWhen I was at my worst, and literally no one could come visit me, I really did miss seeing the faces of my loved ones. If he is able to open his lids, maybe bring a pig poster board of photos from your childhood, or vacations. \nI also appreciated my nurses making me a playlist of podcasts so they could just play them for me and leave me alone. \nAny audio books or YouTube playlists could work the same! \n\nThis could just be for me, but having my hygiene sorted out helped me out a lot too. I hated having my lips chapped and skin feeling tight and dry. If there is any way you or your mom could take care of that kind of stuff for him, Maybe he would appreciate it. \n\nJust wanted to add, I have almost no lingering complications from GBS. Even when it seems like you cannot even recognize him, he is still there! Keeping him and you, your family in my wishes. I was paralyzed from the neck down for quite a while. I am slowly getting strength and movement back now after four months, And I am getting close to standing. I also had both IV I G and plasmapheresis treatments. \n\nThe letter board is definitely what you want so he can spell out what he needs. Takes forever and it is very frustrating, But that is the best you can do right now. Once he gets on to a traech, ask about a passing air valve. It is a tiny piece of plastic that once he strong enough It will let him talk while traeched.\n\nI am actually typing this out via voice to text in the rehab unit right now. I can use a stylus that is strapped to my fingers, but for long form text, voice to text is easier even with the few mistakes that it makes. I got it in 1995. I posted ( on a previous thread. I was almost completely immobile for the first 4 months. In the bottom image you can see the splints that my orthopedist made for me to prevent me from developing extreme shortening of my calves.  Despite this I still have drop-foot to this day, but did not require surgery to be able to walk again. I am glad you were able to make a good recovery. I still cannot sleep with blankets covering my feet. It is too uncomfortable and I wake up thinking I am in the hospital when I do. Thank you. I know the feeling. thank you so much!   \n\n\nthese are are all things I would have never thought of.   \n\n\ni wish you a speedy recovery. hang in there. I was actually looking at pillows online yesterday night. I was going to buy a new one for myself and thought maybe he would like one too. But I was not sure what type the hospital would allow. He cannot open his eyelids on his own so i was thinking maybe movies that have audio for the visually impaired.   \n\n\nthank you so much. i think his GBS is very severe, he cannot move anything aside from his eyes but not his eyelids, and if i am understanding clearly even though his  nerves are not responding he is in pain.   \n\n\nalthough he has pneumonia and a stomach infection. plus he just had the feeding tube put in and few days later his trach. so maybe that still hurts. Are they positive it is GBS? Dr seems to think so. they did a bunch of tests - spinal tap and MRI among them and i think the last one was with  electrodes.  \n\n  \nI did also ask this since he was not responding to the treatment but to be honest my mom is the one that has been talking to the Dr this last week. I was hoping to talk to the Dr today. I am waiting to hear from my mom to head on over there. Get his pillow from home, you know he likes that one.  Watching a movie with video descriptions can be very confusing. Watching a show he knows and likes produces good feelings, because you like it, and reduces anxiety because there are no surprises, the familiarity is soothing. If it is a movie he knows he does not have to see it. Same with music. Does he have a playlist you can access ? Anything that reduces the cold hospital feeling is nice. The pheresis would be an option. High dose intravenous steroids or Rituximab are others. The maB is highly effective against certain types of GBS. How is he doing now if you do not mind me asking ? He can now open his eyes and move jaw and head slightly. \n\nHe seems to have more control over I have eye than the other. \n\nThey were sending him to rehab sometime soon. :)", "Husband just diagnosed  I did not get ivig until day 4 of being in the hospital and at that point paralysis had reached my face. It took two rounds of IVIG to slow/stop and end the peak of symptoms. I was in the hospital two weeks and a full year of physical therapy/ rehab. Everyone is so different though. When I got discharged I needed a shower chair and walker. And just attended physical, speech and occupational therapy multiple times a week for a year. After a couple months I was walking slowly and not very strongly, but within a year I was mostly back to how I was prior. I was 15, and I know rehab can be harder the older you are. Hang in there, it is a lot to go through. Oh thank you taking the time to respond. It helps me be more realistic in what is going on. Hello, I am 37 and was diagnosed with GBS Miller Fisher Variant ten years ago. Mine hit hard and fast, it was around thirty six hours from first symptom (starting at the bottoms of my feet and tips of my fingers) to being fully paralyzed and intubated. They started treatment on me around day three after being admitted. I had a bad reaction to it though and almost died so I cannot say at what point it is most effective. I also cannot say when mine peaked but I was intubated for three weeks. After transferring out of ICU, I did inpatient therapy for about three months then out patient therapy for an additional two months. I was told I would not likely walk for close to two years but was fully functioning (with minor lingering physical issues) within six months. \n\nAs many people will tell you, it seems to be different for everyone. If he does progress to the point that he needs to be intubated be prepared to just push through it with him. It is the most difficult thing I have ever been through. Family support helped but they could not take away my misery. If it does come to that point get creative with communication. My family had to say each letter for me and have me try to blink twice for the one I wanted then write it down and start from the top again until they could make out what I was trying to ask. It was long and frustrating for both them and I but it did give me a voice of sorts when I did not have one and was just stuck inside a body that hurt and would not move. Since you mentioned he has pain in his legs, do not rub his feet unless he asks\u2026 it was so painful for me when someone tried to comfort me with this action. \n\nI am not trying to scare you or ramble on but was just trying to think of things that played a role in my story. \n\nI hope for his sake that things do not progress to the level that mine did. Hang in there, if you have any questions about my experience I would be more than happy to answer them either through the thread or in a direct message. Also, if I think of any other helpful coping advice I will add to the comments. \nSorry this is happening to him. Thank you for letting me know your feedback. It is so amazing you take the time to help others understand what may happen and provide simple tips that help me understand how to support. Fingers crossed this is not his experience. Symptoms normally peak within 2 weeks. I am 7 months into my fight with GBS and still not fully recovered. It has been a long slow road and sometimes things regress a bit before starting to trend better again. I am 50 so close to your husband. I am still recovering so it is very recent for me. Mine started in my legs and feet and progressed from slight numbness to complete paralysis in 24-36 hours. Started plasmapheresis and it almost killed me. Bad bad reaction. Switched to IVIG and started getting better after 24 hours. So went into the hospital on 10/5 and I am out now with outpatient rehab 3 times a week. I can walk short distances without a walker but I am still very wobbly. Still have trouble sleeping through the night but they just started me on gabapentin for the pain and it seems to be helping. Everybody\u2019s progression and recovery will be different. Just encourage him that it will get better. Total recovery might take a long time but he will eventually be back to normal. I have to remind myself everyday. \ud83d\ude00\n\nEdit:  And I had the face thing too but mine was in the right. Almost exactly what you described. Honestly that was the most annoying part of the whole situation. Eating was tough, had to tape my eye shut at night because I could not blink, and food tasted like metal because half my tongue was numb. But this too  went away after like 8-10 days. Hi! My brother was diagnosed with the Miller-Fischer variant in August. A few things we learned:\n\nMake sure your husband's breathing/vitals are monitored throughout the hospital stay. My brother's respiratory muscles became paralyzed quickly before his arms/legs even became totally paralyzed, which we had no idea was possible. \n\nAt any point in the rehab process, if it seems like your husband is regressing, be aware he might need to go back into intensive care. Do not fight the ventilator if you think it might help. So many things we did not know during my brother's illness!\n\nPrayers for his recovery! I was in a very similar place to your husband- facial paralysis- numb from rib cage down.  For me as I peaked it got really hard to use my hands.  It ended up effecting heart rate and bowels(super slow hard to poop for weeks).   I did not need to be intubated.  I had horrible pain at night- narcotics did not do much for me-Toradol helped. I peaked in about 3 weeks. I could not stand or walk- so I went to inpatient rehab- which luckily was at the same hospital.   I was there for another 6 weeks. I was able to use the walker by the time I left.  When I went home, I needed a shower chair- and toilet safety rails.  I continued physical and occupational therapy for another 4 montgs( I used rehab without walls- they were awesome- my insurance covered it- they specialize in people with neurological injuries).   \nI am just going to put it out there that rehab is very important- not just the physical rehab, but the occupational therapy.  There are many things that your husband will not be able to do in the way that he is used to and that he will have to relearn how to do in his period of recovery.   Like using tools to get dressed and put in shoes. Stuff like that.   Physical therapy is also important because of the muscle loss- but with GBS you cannot push too hard because you are body will push back at you.   I also saw a therapist - because clearly this is all harrowing, and anti depressants really helped in my extended hospital stay.   \nAnyway, like 97% of people who get GBS, I made close to a full recovery, it took about six months for my facial paralysis to recede.  I walk fine now. It is painful for me to walk for long distances(lots of nerve pain)-and I have some numbness in my legs and feet.  I took up swimming and that really helped.   Recovery time varies- but I continued improve for over a year. Just to add I was 43. Thank you for the details! It is so helpful to understand what is to come. If you have never seen the classic 1970 comedy, Catch-22, go and see it. It is great.\n\nThe author, Joseph Heller got Guillain-Barre and wrote about it in 1986's No Laughing Matter, which describes his experience and well naturally that is the best written description of GBS there is.\n\nMost people's experiences are different with similar aspects\n\nMine came on over six weeks, with excruciating lower back pain between 1am and 5am and then increasing numbness in the extremities.\n\n&gt; He is day 2 of projected 5. 2) what was your progress by your release from the hospital?\n\nWhen I finally was hospitalized, I was in a wheelchair, and received IVIG for four days, at then end of which, I could walk again, even up and down a flight of stairs. I was released on day 5 as well.\n\nNo more pain after that, and it took me about 3 months to recover, the first two weeks with a walker.\n\nCompared to many, I seem to have been caught at the right time by the right doc and treated correctly. I was early 40s. Thank you! I will find the book. And the movie :) I hope your brother is doing better! We are not in the ICU as he is having his IVIg treatment. Hopeful that it is not progressing, except his face. Really appreciate the feedback on advocacy. My wife was diagnosed 4 days after being admitted. Started IVIG on the 4th day for 5 days.  By the last day of her treatment she could only blink and move her jaw.  She was on a ventilator.  The first day after her IVIG completed she started wiggling one finger, and everyday since she is regained control and strength.  This Tuesday will mark 7 weeks in the hospital and she is walking and doing most things she did prior to the diagnosis.  Still a ways to go to regain her full strength but we are all really happy with her progress.  Hang in there and take it one day at a time and strive for 1% better each day. Oh my goodness! What a crazy ride you have been on. How did you cope? Thank you for sharing. I feel optimistic his paralysis has slowed, the docs and staff indicated today (day 9) his presentment is mild to moderate. I guess it is good to have this insight for comparison (for me not your wife!). I wish your wife and you and family the very best in recovery. I got diagnosed in early August with Miller-Fischer. My symptoms started July 29th after having a week long cold (sore right eye and tingly left hand). The next day I had total body numbness. The diagnosis took about a 10days after lengthy MRIs and a Spinal tap. I got 3 doses of IVIG and was kept in midICU until I was discharged to a rehab hospital a week after diagnosis. \n\nMy breathing was never affected but I had a nasal-inserted feeding tube for 3weeks. Once I was able to start eating (once you can clear liquids you advance to mush-consistent food) my swallow recovered relatively \u201cquickly\u201d. I was not able to stand, let alone walk till I was at rehab but am now able to walk without assistance of a walker since being discharged. I still have slight body numbness, and now I have a lot of pain now that my body is \u201cwaking up\u201d. But everyday I see some improvement even if it is in the form of getting up from bed a little easier. \n\nThere were/are a lot of dark days but having someone at my side at all times and having a great medical team kept me from going off the deep end. Presence goes a long way. \n\nSincerely, I wish you all the best So much very similar. I am so happy to read about your recovery. Today is day 9 in the hospital, day 16 of symptoms for my husband. Yesterday was day 5 of IVIg. He had skyrocketing blood pressure (high) and hemoglobin in urine so they stopped it mid-dose, but 4.5 of 5 doses should show positive results. \nDid you have a lot of nerve pain? At night especially? He is just barely able to cope, and the lack of sleep makes it worse. I do feel fortunate in that he is not hit the same marker as you and others who have responded with internal organs. hopefully the treatments have paused it. Numbness and paralysis is creeping across his face, since he started IVIg (10/14), but not his tongue or inside his mouth. Before the issues yesterday the nurse practitioner said he would begin the road to discharge today. My hope is he goes to inpatient rehab because of the pain. I honestly cannot imagine how we will cope if he still has this level when he comes home. Thank you for sharing! I felt incredible soreness in my body throughout my hospital stay, but it did not turn into what I would recognize as pain until I was back at home. The soreness/achyness prevented me from getting much sleep at all so I understand. They gave me gabapentin for my symptoms but I had a reaction to it so I had to stop. All my therapists say that pain is sign of life so it is a good thing as hard as it is for us to hear", "Potential GBS, need advice Hello fellow redditors, approximately 4 days ago, i got a sudden tingling in my feet. Over the course of the next few days my left hand started tingling then my right. I went to my doctor who said it could possible be GBS due to the fact that i had the flu type B about 3 weeks ago (no flu shot). Anyways he told me to keep an eye on it to see if it progresses. I do not have any weakness or numbness as of yet only and pins and needles feeling. I have an appointment with a neurologist on thursday where he will run tests to determine if it is GBS. I have been freaking out about it and I am reading so many stories. I do not think I would be able to be as some of the incredible people I have read about on here. Make sure the neurologists does a lumbar puncture to test the proteins in your spinal fluid for an accurate diagnosis I wish you the best of luck my friend , 7 months ago I got diagnosed, 6 months ago I was paralyzed head to toe in a hospital bed, 4 months ago I was going to rehab 2 1/2 hours a day to learn how to walk, talk and eat, 3 months ago I was discharged from the hospital being able to walk by my self with a walker, 2 months ago I am able to go back to work and start being my old self and now I can say I am in the best shape of my life. Do not loose hope if you do end up with the diagnosis, your much stronger than you think and if you fight for it you will come back stronger than ever before mentally and physically. I wish you the best of luck friend , I am rooting for you. My advice is stay in the moment - GBS has so many diverse outcomes, and naturally you will focus on the worst outcome.\nStay in the moment deal with symptoms as they are, not what they could be. If anything starts deteriorating rapid;y (your breathing basically) seek immediate medical help. If you in fact have GBS, and they start treatment right away, it will stop the progression and you will be fine. Yes!  Do this.  If your neurologist suggests waiting longer, ask for a 2nd opinion.   To fully confirm GBS, they will do a lumbar puncture and an EMG, which is a nerve conduction test.   But the lumbar puncture (also known as a spinal tap) will provide enough information for the doctors to start thinking about treatment for GBS.  \n\nAlso, do not let yourself get too anxious about the lumbar puncture  They will numb the area, which is a little like getting novocaine at the dentist, then they will pull a few vials of fluid out. The procedure will take maybe 15-20 minutes, and you literally have to do nothing but sit there bent over a bit.  \n\n(Not a medical professional, just a guy that currently has GBS and had a spinal tap 3 weeks ago) I learned from my two \"bouts\" of GBS (now diagnosed with CIDP) that it does not help to step back and worry about what might be.  Even if you have GBS it might not progress past the pins and needles phase. I have found that I must be very mindful and stay in the moment. Practice breathing and relaxing when you find your mind racing. \n\nFor me, the spinal tap did not find anything conclusive, perhaps because we did it too early both times. Never the less, when the doctors could diagnose, the treatment (IVIG) was quite successful.  The first time they kept searching as I became more and more paralyzed, the second time they simply diagnosed as soon as I lost my knee reflex (that standard: cross your legs, tap on your knee and see if your leg bounces up). The quicker diagnosis helped with less progression (but again, for someone else, it may not progress at all -- this is common as well).\n\nStay strong. Stay positive. It is lovey that you found this thread. You are not alone -- If you need encouragement, send a message. My understanding for diagnosis of GBS, it is still a process of eliminating the other likely options, also that Dr\u2019s do not all agree on the spinal tap check of proteins. \n\nI second the deal with the now and not what might be. I also suggest making sure you understand enough from the Dr to make informed choices. Thank you everyone for your replies! Greatly appreciated. How are you doing now? All my numbness and tingling has stopped thankfully. I went to a neurologist and he believes it was caused by inflammation from the flu. He ordered a bunch of blood tests because I have only ever had it done once when i was in kindergarten. That is awesome to hear - still doing well?", "Lyme or GBS Hey guys, I am new here and need some advice. Almost exactly 1 year ago I was bitten by the tick. Ofc I was worried since I know how dangerous can untreated lyme be. 4 weeks after the bite i started to develope tingling feeling in my limbs, than my balance turned off (I felt like I am 'near my body' while moving) and the last thing was extreme weakness in legs which was constanly getting worse to the point when I went upstairs and could barely move my legs. Ofc I thought I have lyme, went to the doc, he told me to do the test which was negative but he gave me a 3 weeks of doxy just In case. It did not help at all. After browsing the web I thought that IDSA treatment is not effective so I chose so called Lyme Literate Doc and started 3 antibiotics at once since I believed that is the only way to improve, but... as You can guess already I did not at all after 3 months of abx. In the meantime I developed weird 'eye lag' feeling, like my eyes are to slow to record faster moves and pain in the bottom of the foot (it comes and goes). And here I am after a year with heavy legs (not as bad as it were), eye lag, foot pain and feeling off-balance. I have done whole tick-transmitted disease panel and the only positive one was Mycoplasma, which - I found - can cause GBS flare... Do you think it may be it? Any of you Had the same or similiar story? Should I visit neurologist for any kind of treatment or it is pointless at this point? Thanks in advance! Sending much love Hi, many illnesses can cause tingling and severe fatigue. You should see a medical practitioner, but keep in mind the characteristic symptom of GBS is bilateral acute flaccid paresis - which means 'foot drop' if it occurs in the lower limbs. Initial onset is typically 1.5-3 weeks after antigen exposure and symptoms progress rapidly to their peak.\n\nEven if your symptoms were a mild case of GBS, I doubt a neurologist will give you GBS-specific treatment as the acute phase has already passed.", "3 years post diagnosis advice ", "Gabapentin Curious as the energy levels and fatigue are still rough nearly a year out from treatment - how much are you taking and as you took less did you find yourself having more energy? Gabapentin never worked for me. I am taking Tramadol. What did not work about it and how is your energy on Tramadol? Gabapentin worked on me but also made me very tired but helped relax my nerves a lot even my anxiety went away Gabapentin also helped with my pain due to the nerve damage with Guillain Barr\u00e8 in my legs especially they felt like they were literally on fire I am still struggling with my vision with diplopia nystagmus and strabismus and gabapentin helps relax my eyes so they do not feel like they are vibrating with double vision but sadly the symptoms come back rather quickly When I took less gabapentin I felt more energetic my mind felt more awake and was much faster but the pain was back and I had to find a way to get used to that. I felt tired both physically and mentally. I take pregabalin now and I feel better. Got more energy when I got off it. Lost weight too. Energy is a problem, but manageable.", "How severe were your symptoms when you first noticed them? For 2-3 days, I have been experiencing slight numbness and a very slight decrease in dexterity in my hands. It is not something I have felt before, so I have noticed it, but it is pretty subtle.  At most, it is slowed down my typing marginally.  And during that time I have also had numbness in my mouth\u2014again, enough to notice, but only barely.  It sort of feels like I have burned the inside of my mouth.  \n\nToday, I am experiencing some leg weakness, but not to a degree that I would have taken note absent the other symptoms.  At most, I would have thought \u201cI need to work out today; my legs are feeling weak from sitting at my desk all day.\u201d  \n\nI am recovering from a recent case of COVID, so I suppose GBS is not out of the question. But each of the sensations I am experiencing is so mild that I am disinclined to assume it is anything more than a fluke, or an idiosyncratic after-effect of COVID. \n\n*So, my question to you all: how noticeable/severe were the first symptoms you noticed?

We are all quite happy that the disease is treatable, but he is very worried about the possible side effects of the two optional treatments. He has depression and some cardiac problems too, so he feels like he is already always dealing with side effects from those two conditions anyways that this will completely destroy him. In summary, he feels very anxious and sad and I feel completely powerless.    \n\n\nI would really love to hear from people experiencing this disease, how can your relatives support you to make your life a little bit better. Also, if I can point him in any direction for extra support/ initiatives/ alternative treatments or anything that can help him manage his disease and improve his lifestyle.   \n\n\n:) thank you in advance There is a YouTuber No Egg Craig who has a bunch of good videos about his experience with CIDP and eventually making a full recovery. My daughter has CIDP.\n\n  This organization has been a life saver \n\nLots of good resources I have CIDP and I know it is a real bummer to deal with especially having other health issues. I also have hearing loss from before getting CIDP and it is hard to cope with everything but your dad is going to need so much positivity to recover from this! He needs all the support you can give him, sometimes it was really exhausting to even want to get out of bed but my family pushed me and motivated me to try my best to recover. I needed to find positivity in my life because it is a really tough situation especially for people who get severe cases, mine affected my legs mainly I was nearly paralyzed from my legs last may. I started on prednisone 40mg in June and also did IVIG treatments a couple months later but I had to stop in November because the IVIG was causing me excruciating migraines. I started taking mycophenolate as well as still taking prednisone and now I have recovered enough that my dr is tapering me off prednisone and I should be completely off of it in a month. I am still going to be taking mycophenolate because I am still not fully recovered yet but I am doing much better thankfully. I would not have got through this if I did not remain with a positive attitude even though I have had plenty of days filled with anxiety but having my families support has helped an extreme amount. I really hope your dad recovers soon and that you and your family can give him all the support hes going to need! He will be in a good amount of pain, pain that is hard to describe. But mostly it is discomfort, agitation, depression &amp; fatigue.\n\nListen to his needs (AND gripes) and provide what you can to ease his discomfort and worries. -Nice bedding, healthy food, night splints, books to read, encourage friends to visit. \n\nDo not let him just lay around waiting to get feeling back though. You can get him to do light physical therapy like leg movements, upper body stretch band exercises, moving himself to sit at the edge of the bed. Anything helps!\n\nGet a walker and a wheelchair now, it is a slow recovery  and they might give him encouragement and something to work toward.\n\nThe family needs to be the ones making sure the health care portion goes smoothly, it is too much to make him do all the calls and appointments. Get a \"case manager\" from his insurance company, for when health care people drop the ball or are not being cooperative. (Neurologists have long waits for appointments for example, case managers can and will raise hell for you).\n\nGet in-home physical therapy going when he starts to recover, insoles and leg braces from a podiatrist, a \"tens unit\" to stimulate the nerves. Also, get him a doggy when he is up for it. \n\n\n.__________________________.\n\nI had depression before my GBS also.

I am currently using braces on both feet to relieve my foot drop. What braces are good/worse? Any exercises? Yes I did have drop foot on both feet. Wore the braces and also had furry boots that kept my feet up when I wasnt at therapy(otherwise fully paralyzed). My husband manually worked some exercises on both feet. This was spring 2016. Now cronic GBS. Big toe is only toe that moves much. I am sure with enough exercise and wearing proper equipment you will recover. My father has drop foot on one foot. He recently finally got an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO). I think they are available online, however instead I highly recommend seeing a doctor to see what they say and if it is an option for your case. A doctor will give you the okay, a prescription, could be covered by insurance, and you will need to go to a specialist to be fitted.

I will be in the hospital for 5 days. \nNot much else to say. I am glad I am being treated and I am glad there is a little community here! Welcome and so glad you are on IVIG! Good luck on a speedy recovery Hope you get better soon!\nKeep your head high, all the best. A positive Attitude will work wonders for you as you go through this. I hope your case is mild and your recovery quick  my friend. No breathing problems, so I think it will be okay. We still do not know what the cause was. I do not recall any infection or anything like that. I am wondering how common it is for it to show up spontaneously I was the same way. I have no idea what caused my case. They think it may have been the flu shot I received a few months before it happened but they had no real idea. My GBS was triggered by the Prevnar 13 vaccine in 2017. I went through 5 rounds of IVIG twice. Spent 1 month in the ICU, 1 month in Advanced Care, a couple weeks in the hospitals inpatient PT program, then another month at a nursing home with daily PT, wrapped up with about 3 months of outpatient PT. Still have a few issues, but overall muscle tone and motor skills is good. I have neuropathy in the toes and fingers still. Grateful to be where I am at today though! Stay positive and best of luck. I am so scared that my neuropathy will not go away Good luck! Good luck &amp; hope for a speedy recovery. Being scared is perfectly normal. GBS is the most frightening thing I have ever experienced. So much of the recovery is all about mindset. What I found that helps me is to reshape my questions. Like, when I would think \u201cwill I ever fell my arms again\u201d I changed it I wonder how much longer until I feel my arms?\u201d Just my way of changing the narrative. Meditation is clutch. I will definitely keep that in mind. Thanks. It has not affected my diaphragm, but the numbness is spreading. It is in my mouth and on my nose now. I guess we are still waiting for it to plateau. \nAt least I can still use my phone! Did it show up in your spinal fluid? Mine was cleared, but they are still thinking GBS. They plan on doing another one, in case it was just too early to detect anything. Also, I am so sorry that happened to you. Did it affect the efficacy of the vaccine? I am on the brink of tears at all times. Mourning the loss of playing piano and making jewelry.\nToday, the physical therapy team asked me to try to stand on one foot. I felt myself lift my knee up, but when I looked down, my foot was still on the ground. I tried to keep it light, and said, \"well, I am not a magician.\" But without humor, I would have broken down. Thanks. Time will tell. I have not had pneumonia since I was hospitalized. Fingers crossed. Has this made you apprehensive about other vaccines? Yes, absolutely! My doctors and neurologist said I should not take another vaccine. We will see. Wow that is intense. More reason for everyone else to get them. I am going to watch the data and see how the masses respond, and pay attention to the CDC recommendations and the GBS Foundation advice. Interesting, I will check it out as well. Good luck! Care to share an update? I am at a transitional care home for a few months doing PT, OT, and speech therapy. I can walk 350ft with a walker, but it hurts my hands and feet because I have pretty bad neuropathy pain. I am able to feed myself! Though I look like a stroke victim and can only open one side of my mouth. I do not have an alarm on my bed anymore! Which means I can get to the bathroom by myself with a wheelchair. I saw the neurologist yesterday and he said he is pretty confident that I will be walking on my own in a few months. I will have to modify a lot of things in my life, but the goal is to get me living independently again! I am a 34 year old single lady working on my career, so living independently is extremely important to me. I am taking it slow, even though my instinct is to try to get through everything as fast as possible. It is definitely a challenge and my therapists are really encouraging me to keep it up. I am looking forward to mowing the lawn. Awesome progress! Spoke too soon. Back in the hospital today. Getting more ivig for the next 5 days. I fell last night in the bathroom.

It is also worth noting that the patient in the study had a history of relapsing GBS. Just wanted to clarify what the article is based on so that members of this sub are well informed. Thanks for posting this information. I like the \u201che has since recovered\u201d part found the optimist.  :). But I agree.  So far the article cites 'several' cases where first time patients have developed GB from the virus, this is the first recurrence.  Considering there have been 68 million confirmed cases, that actually seems quite low. Great point. The history of relapse is really important to take into account here, I think.", "Tingles, constant headache and auras? plz help so here is my story. March 20th i was on the computer and all off a sudden i could not see. it looked like i was looking at a fuzzy tv screen. it went on for about 3 hours. i was frightened because i am a healthy 21 year old female (normal BMI 5\u201910 140 , taking no medications other than birth control). i went to the eye doctor that day and they said my optic nerve was fine. a few days later i developed a constant headache that lasted 24/7 for about 4 weeks. no medicine helped. at the same time i also developed sinus pressure, eye auras, tingling in my limbs, dizziness and ear ringing/ intense pressure. i ended up passing out and went to the ER. CT scan showed \u201cair fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses, associated with some patchy bilateral ethmoid sinus opacities\u201d. i was given an antibiotic told i had a sinus infection &amp; leukocytosis &amp; migraines. the next day i got my hormonal iud removed (bc i wanted to get to the root of the issue) and got an MRI. MRI was normal. my only symptom 8 months later is blurry vision and dizziness/ brain fog. should i suggest GB to my neurologist?", "Lung Problems When there is lung involvement, is this a gradual thing where you have some difficulty breathing but you have warning to get it checked out? And when you do, does your oxygen level show up as low on one of those meters? \n\nOr is the onset sometimes sudden and severe so that you have to go right away to the emergency room? Mine was sudden and severe and happened during my c section. Luckily I was already in the hospital because my other symptoms were getting exponentially worse My 4th year anniversary of GBS onset is next week. My lung capacity issues came on more gradually. The oxygen levels were being monitored closely and everything was fine early on, but got worse over the next few days to where they were standing by with intubation. Fortunately, a BiPap machine got me back on track and I started  albuterol  treatments every 4 hours for weeks to help open up my lungs. Yes, the oxygen monitor will indicate your oxygen level and they can treat any drops quickly. Today, I have good lung capapcity but not so good stamina, so I take frequent breaks. Good luck with your recovery! Were you in the hospital when they were monitoring your oxygen levels or were they able to monitor it as you went about your daily life? Did you notice that your breathing capacity was diminishing or was it the monitor that first detected it? It is terrible to get an attack like that but at least you were in the right place and medical personnel could not help but notice it. But during a c section, wow. Sounds like stress can bring this on or make it worse.\n\nThanks for replying. Yes, I was in the ICU. Since I was paralyzed from the neck down, I did not immediately know my oxygen levels were dropping - the monitors picked that up. I was ok lying down, but when the tried to move me or sit me up, I struggled for breath. It was scary. I was in the ICU for a month, advanced care for a month, in-house rehab for about 2 weeks, then a nursing home for another 2 weeks. Then outpatient PT for about 3 months. I continue to he to do PT at home daily , walking ( treadmill or outside) and I swim a quarter mile every weekday morning. I have to rest between laps though. I am grateful to be where I am at today. It gets better my friend! That sounds like a scary, rough experience and the treatment and rehab must have seemed endless. Glad you got through it and are mostly back to normal.\n\nI have no idea what I have and I am trying to decide whether I need to go to the emergency room or wait for my next appointment with a neurologist. It is complicated and no one can decide that for me.\n\nThanks for replying. You should call your primary care physician to discuss. Early treatment would be to your benefit. I was seen by a neurologist months ago and he did not think my problem was neurological, he thought it was related to my spine surgery, which is reasonable. I got several opinions from orthopedic and neurosurgeons and they are pointing back at the neurologist, they say it is not my spine that is pinching the nerves.\n\nI cannot help wondering if it is some combination of things.\n\nEarly treatment seems to be easier said than done. There is a quite a waiting list for a neurologist in my area.", "Delayed treatment of Guillain-Barre Hey everyone! I was wondering about the effect a delay in administering Plasmapheresis or IVIG would have on outcomes/speed of recovery.\n\n\nI spent about 5 days in the hospital before I received my first round of IVIG (It only took them a few hours to diagnose me. At the time my legs were completely gone but I still had some weak movement in my arms). \n\nThe delay was exclusively due to problems with insurance as the treatment was approved and available right away.\n\n\nI know this stuff is impossible to predict but this may be an important issue to at least be aware of/discuss. So my disclaimer up front is I had Miller Fisher syndrome which is a bit different, I am not a doctor, and this is just my simple understanding of things.\n\nI did not start my treatment until almost a week after the onset of symptoms. There is no cure for Guillain Barre. Plasmapheresis and IVIG just attempt to slow down the progression of the condition and limit the amount of damage to your nervous system. From what I read the condition is usually \u201ccured\u201d in about 2-4 weeks with or without treatment. Then it is up to your body to repair the nerve damage. So all that to say my understanding is that delaying treatment might potentially delay your recovery because the condition might do more damage to your nervous system which would take longer to repair but it should not affect your ability to make a full recovery I was also in the hospital for a few days before I got IVIG. It was not because of a shitty insurance company though. That is truly terrible. HOWEVER my legs were not completely paralyzed. Did you get it from a stomach virus because I have read that gbs is worse if you get it that way. For me it was a respiratory virus. By the time they figured it out after many painful tests I could not move in bed. I could not roll over or sit up. It affected my right side more. It is terrifying to put your arm up and watch it fall down and not being able to walk without two nurses holding me. But it sounds like you went through so much more and I am so sorry. Your insurance company sounds like ( excuse the language) fucking pieces of shit. I cannot imagine not being able to get the medication you need. \nI have been a part of support groups but I am sorry I have never heard of what happens if your treatment is delayed. \nI know the longer treatments are delayed the longer it takes to recover movement. \nI actually went to the ER because I could not get up and the EMTS were very lackadaisical about it and the doctor just sent me home. Two days later I fell while I was home alone and could not crawl or anything. Luckily I had my phone on me. I called 911 and told the EMTs I was on methadone ( big mistake) so they assumed I was faking it. Luckily my mom came and said she would sue if I was sent home again. \nIf you ever need to talk Pm me. I cannot imagine having the treatment available but having my insurance say no. \nHow long ago was this if you do not mind me asking? \nPlease op do not feel guilty. It is sad that a lot of people do not have access to the proper treatments for gbs, but that is not your fault. Me too! The first GBS I experienced it was close to ten days before they treated me with IVIG. Five days into treatment I finally plateaued and the progression of paralysis stopped. Three years later I had another bout of GBS. They did not believe me and it took them five days to start treatment. \n\nHope this helps you! That sounds horrible! What was their excuse? For some reason everyone with GBS I talk to has been told they were faking it at some point. My treatment was very delayed and not as robust as I was a child (not believed) and it was the 80s (less refined course of treatment). I still have nerve damage 30 years later, but I still lead a fairly active life. I played varsity sports! My biggest side effects seem to be knock-on ones, like mono hitting me much harder or extreme emotional events affecting nerve function. I had IVIG started within 12 hours of diagnosis (I was still able to walk at that point) but it do not stop the progression of the paralysis. About 3 weeks later I had another round of IVIG and progression slowed. I remained in almost total paralysis for another 8 weeks and would not be able to stand unaided for many months.      \n\nDocs have no idea on the hows and whys of what happened. To them I am an outlier but that is all they can say. &gt;Three years later I had another bout of GBS.      \n\nWas there any trigger that you were able to identify?", "Help please!  \n\nHow is everyone doing, I hope you have all been very well. My first time really on Reddit. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions or experience with hand tremors after having been affected by Guillian Barre Syndrome previously. Earlier this year around March I was diagnosed with GBS. It was a frightening and terrible experience, to say the least, but luckily it was an acute form and I ended up recovering quite fast. I still had problems regaining my ability to walk, but I felt I was getting better every passing day. I went to Guatemala around July to go and volunteer in a project where I would teach children English and help in the community. While there, I caught a pretty bad case of dengue. (This really was not my year, as you can tell by now). I went through the whole hospital bed thing and was released from the hospital about a week afterwards. The reason I am writing this post is that I had noticed I began having hand tremors when I curled my fingers to a certain point. afterward the dengue. This was especially when I picked up a spoon and noticed the soup was just pouring out by the tremors. I had not noticed it before and I am still dealing with the hand tremors to this day. It is been about 2 months since and I still have shaky fingers. My body has been recovering a lot more due to my therapy, especially the strength in my feet and arms, yet I do not know what to really do about this hand situation. Should I give it more time? Is it a sign of a weak immune system or is the GBS still taking time to leave? Does Dengue have anything to do with this?\n\nI appreciate you reading this. I would love to hear what you could recommend because I am a tad bit worried about this situation at the present moment.\n\nThank you once again! Hey there!  I am so sorry about everything!  I was in the hospital all of March for GBS and had lots of symptoms including tremors! Just letting you know it can take over a full year to heal. \n\nFor me, what is helped my dexterity is playing video games and typing. I enjoy the former, so it makes \u201cpracticing\u201d easier, but I suggest finding something as well. The more you use your fingers and hands with smaller movements, the more your myelin sheath will regrow in that area. \n\nThat being said, while a lot of my tremors have lessened, they still get pretty bad some times. Patience, time, and lots of Omega 3\u2019s are your friends!  You should probably reach out to your physician/neurologist regarding how Dengue may be affecting you. If you have any questions, feel free to DM me!  I am more than happy to discuss my experience and what you are going through!\n\nGood luck with recovery! Acute GBS 5 years ago, but I never had tremors. I am 18 months out and still have tremors, not as bad as they were at first but better. As soon as I could hold an Xbox controller I bought a console and started using it as much as possible, I think it is way better than the exercises I had to do in physical therapy. I also downloaded coloring apps on my iPad and it has helped me write much better, almost as well as I did before GBS but much slower. \n\nI do not know if the tremors will ever go away completely but I have gotten much of my strength and dexterity back so do not stress about it too much, anxiety and stress make it worse. This is what I did as well. My eyesight was affected too so I used video games to help with my dexterity and tracking. Xbox and PC helped a ton. I know, I am surprised others shy away from video games. Specially now with so many free-to-play games and gamepass. It is the first thing I recommend anybody going through GBS.", "How long did it take you to fully recover from Miller Fischer Syndrome? My wife was diagnosed with Miller Fischer a little over a year ago. She is still recovering but it is slow and it is beginning to weigh on her. Her mouth is the last thing to come back. She cannot smile, purse her lips, or close her mouth.\n\nHow long did it take for you to recover from Miller Fischer? Were there any therapies which were beneficial in your recovery? Thank you! I think I was pretty fortunate but it was around 2-3 months when I started feeling back to normal. Facial control was the last thing to come back for me. I had a lot of problems with my mouth and my eyes. There was not really anything that helped for me other than time. I was on the schedule to do speech therapy with someone that specialized in Bell\u2019s palsy which has very similar symptoms. By the time they could get me in through I was basically better but maybe that is something worth looking into. I am more than two years out and I still cannot purse my lips or raise my eyebrows. There have been mild improvements but it is slooow progress. I am 15 months out and still cannot close my mouth, purse my lips, or fully smile. I can kind of smile on the right side. I still see slow progress, my face is regaining its shape/firmness and I am getting closer to closing my mouth. 5 years in, left side of the face almost completely recovered, right about half.

Talking came first, then walking after PT. i had to re-learn basically everything but to swallow, it took me like 10 to 14 days of training and while i was at it, my speech therapist installed me a speaking valve in my thraqueostomy and there where three exercises that helped me a lot to recover the feeling of my face and regain my gestures and to try real food!\n\n1 opening full mouth the bigger (with no pain of course) the better and close it ,10 times\n\n2 do a exaggerated kiss and then smile, 10 times\n\n3 do a fartlike with the mouth 10 times\n\ni cannot tell how many times i did this while in icu (it was a looong time) but it helped, it helped a lot, and as i remember my therapist got me some sheets with those excersices copied from a book.", "Cowboys player diagnosed with GBS  I am surprised no one has commented on this yet. I have CIDP, which is the chronic form of GBS. It really is a shitty disease to have, especially if its diagnosed late. I recieve the same treatments he is having, IVIG infusions. If he is able to return to the field, more power to him. I have no reflexes and very limited feeling from the waist down, making normal every day life rather difficult at times so it would be really empowering to see someone in his profession overcome this setback and make a comeback.  Hey, staceface1789, just a quick heads-up:  \n**recieve** is actually spelled **receive**. You can remember it by **e before i**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. Hi Staceface,I was diagnosed with GBS, Miller Fisher and bilateral Bells Palsy 3 years ago. Today I am not perfectly well, but I can exercise. I want to tell you what helped me. For the balance issue get Vibrant 5 fingers. Walking barefoot is much easier than clomping in shoes, even if you cannot feel your feet, your body can. Get daily B12 complex shots, maybe twice per day. It works, infact it is the only thing that works for me. The more the merrier. You can not reasonably overdose. The overdose amount is like a gallon per day. I still struggle a lot. My face is still partially paralyzed, feet and hands hurt, nervous cough. But I can exercise. Today 30km on road bike, 2 miles jog. Slow and steady. Contact me on Skype if you want to talk at robertbwise. To add on to that list, Lion's Mane mushroom extract is said to increase nerve growth factor and encourage ***re***myelination. I will save you the dirty work of finding the best brand: Real Mushrooms. This company actually tests their mushrooms for Beta-D-Glucans (the good stuff). Plus, they use the actual fruit body of the mushroom to create their extract, while other brands might use the mushroom's mycelium (roots), which works but is not as potent. I will put a link to what I buy. I have tried the powder, and it is NOT good unless its in something strong like broth made with bullion, so I went with the capsules this time: ( Now there may be a better or cheaper brand out there as I discovered this product about a year ago, so feel free to look for alternatives. Hope this helps someone! Thanks, my friend! Super late reply (sorry) but I had the Miller Fisher type, too! Even doctors cock their heads to the side like huh? Were you treated with IVIG? Yup Immunoglobulin. Worked well to stop the akute GBS, MFS, BP. Sometimes I think it aged my body by ten years, but then certain things start working again, and I get my optimism back. Nurses usually do not know what I am talking about. Doctors have heard of GBS, but do not know what MFS is. And you are right. They always tilt their head. :) I do not know where I would be though without my B12 shots. At least 2ml/day. Makes a huge difference. Did you have months of weired things happening to you or was it a quick onset? Mine were months. ", "What was ur experience with GBS and speech therapy? I am doing a project for grad school, and am interested to hear how your speech therapist assessed and treated for GBS\u2b50\ufe0f I saw a logepedist because my swallowing apparatus did not close correctly and I was dropping food into my lungs. She told me that this usually goes away by itself, and she was right. For my facial paralysis I never received speech therapy, but a physical therapist told me to whistle freuently and that worked as well. Not perfect, but good enough for me. I had a speech therapist during and after physical rehab. She used the electric gun to stimulate muscle movement in my face as the right side of my face has long term nerve damage from GB. I found the nerve stimulation to be ineffective but the mouth exercises and facial expression practices to be effect to at least get some feeling and movement into my face as a whole. To this day, my nerve function has not improved. With consistent, intense face massages, the right corner of my lips will slightly turn up into a smile but I sto find that my smile usually looks like I am in pain rather happy just because all the muscles are working really hard or not functioning. Thank you so much for sharing your story. Did you have any problems swallowing at all? I did not have trouble swallowing While hospitalized i could not chew/talk. Once released it came back fairly quickly. Had about five sessions with a speech therapist.", "Any help needed My dad got his 2nd dose of pfizer 3 days ago and his body became paralyzed.  In ICU. He can move his right hand and squeeze,  wiggle toes but not much else. This reaction happened within 2 days of the last shot. The doctors believe its Guillain-barre syndrome.  I have never heard of this before and really scared. \nIf anyone can help me understand what and how this may effect you and your stories. How you handled it. It may help me understand how I can help him. Hi.. first well wishes for your dad.  Sounds like he is in a good place.. a lot of my struggle was doctors trying to figure out what was wrong (both times I had it). Getting GBS twice is even more rare than getting it once so do not let that part of my story scare you too much. Both times I lost use of my legs/feet and the second time my arms/ hands were affected.  I spent about a month in the medical hospital receiving treatment and then moved to a rehab facility to learn how to walk/ bathe/ eat etc all over again for about 2 months. There were times where I felt like I was not going to ever walk again but I can happily report I am typing this from a park bench while on a break from walking my dog. My first episode was in 2016 and second in 2019. I am back to \u201cnormal\u201d. Work full time, drive, etc. I have my bad days where I am tired and exhausted and cannot get out of bed. Also some lingering everyday tingling/ numbness in my toes and fingers but I will take it from where I was. But they are few and far between. This is my experience and everyone is different.  The internet has some amazing recovery stories with this illness and I highly recommend Holly Gerlach\u2019s book Happily Ever After- that book was what gave me so much hope when I was first diagnosed. Sorry to hear your story. Not a medical professional so take this with an enormous grain of salt. Acute neurological complications following a vaccine are rare, but they are usually self-limiting. That is, they get a certain amount of bad, and then they stop and recovery usually follows. It could be GBS. It could also be meningitis. It could be a blot clot / stroke. It could be something else. Unfortunately, these things can be vague and hard to pin down sometimes. It is hard to say from here. \n\nHonestly, the next few days are probably just going to be rough. Because that is where you will just have to wait to see how bad it gets, figure out exactly what it is, and then later, hopefully, start to get a sense of what recovery looks like. It is possible it could go south, but if in an ICU already, you have done all you can. And having the medical treatment available is going to help a ton. It sounds like the doctors are educated and aware of what it could be / treating it seriously, which also improves the situation for everything across the board. \n\nThis can go a lot of different ways. No situation is typical for rare events like these, so I am sorry I cannot provide a timeline. The few things to expect is to not know for days at a time when you badly want to know. To have a lot of insecurity when you badly want some security. There will be a ton of anxiety and fear, for you and even worse for your dad. I wish there was something I could say to make it seem better. But right now I think this is just going to be a tough time. My only advice is try to just take it one day at a time. Lean on the advice and information the doctors provide. If you feel like you want a second opinion, get one. And try not to play detective or researcher on the internet to doom and gloom or try to figure it out or understand it better - that can just drive a person to just way more anxiety. That is why I suggest to lean on your doctors. Do what you can to be present for your dad, try to stay positive, and just keep looking to get one day to the next. A week or two from now there will be a lot more stability and certainty. A week or two from that, there will be even more. Just got to keep going. Endure, fight, and push through. Just take it one day at a time. Good luck and I hope your dad starts feeling better soon! I am so happy to hear how well you are doing.  I just cannot imagine what one goes thru mentally. I am in awe of the positivity behind peoples posts in this sub and overall.  Thank you You have the greatest advice and insight.  I have been anxiety ridden trying to find answers and expecting answers. It is important for me to understand to be patient and breathe. I will read again when I get anxious to bring me back down. I thank you Yes the positivity within this community is one of the best tools to recovery! You never feel alone while suffering with this rare disease. To piggy back on Holly\u2019s book, I suggest following her on Instagram or watching her YouTube channel. She has a community of GBS survivors/ loved ones of GBS patients so her posts are very centered around the disease. She has polls and Q&amp;As \u2014- those posts have been immensely comforting especially during Covid times. Her handle is  Her YouTube channel has many informative videos and could be helpful for you dad to watch while he cannot browse the internet on his own.  If you cannot tell I credit her for so much of my recovery \ud83d\udc9c Will absolutely watch. Thank you so much!!! Hey, sorry to hear about that. I hope they will find good treatment and your dad will get better soon.\n\nMy personal story is kind of related to yours, my father got gbs/cidp after a vaccine. Not covid but influenza. It is really difficult to support your relatives through these difficult times. For us it took a while until a proper diagnose was found.. and the journey is not over yet, we are still searching for the best treatment, however it is note worthy that there are good treatments and even though it may take some time to find the one that suits your dad never lose hope that there is a treatment. Try to stay calm and try to be confident and try to give him that feeling. No false hope, but confident that there is a therapy.\nAnd try to spend time with him if it is possible. Hospitals are not a nice place and maybe you find something you can bring to make the environment more supportive.\nSorry that my advices are so limited but I hope it helps. Stay strong and I wish you and your dad all the best. Has he been given the diagnosis of GBS? Initially it was presumed by the doctors. Never officially diagnosed. It was a crushed vertebrae. Along with a blood infection and the vaccine possibly inflamed the area which resulted in the paralysis.  Im very sorry to have presumed it to be the actual diagnosis.  With covid it is not possible to be at the hospital or visit so information and communication was difficult with the hospital Do not be sorry! It is a terrible situation, no matter the diagnosis. I was only asking because I thought it was interesting because it seemed to be unilateral. \nIt is really scary, covid or not. I hope he heals quickly and is back to his life soon. Truly appreciate that! Stay well! Crushed vertebrae, why did the doctors not initially pay attention to the fact that your father had a severe spinal injury!?!\n\nAnyway, I wish him the best, regaining functioning is a good sign! It is a great sign and I am very grateful.  Thanks! Its unfortunate but during covid there is no one on one conversation.  You are left in the dark while the patient is being analyzed and communication is broken.  I understand,  ICU is very fragile and they do not want people there during covid. He was not in an accident or fell or anything so it was not on the radar.  I think they had initially presumed diagnosis and I was left going on what I last heard from the doc. All will be OK. Cheers! ", "I just wrote about my recovery and it helped me relieve some internal stress. For some background, im a 16 year old male who was diagnosed with CIDP (not guillan-barre but very similar) 3 years ago. It was the worst time of my life, especially internally, because I had kept all my feelings and emotions to myself.  Even when I had basically fully recovered, I kept a lot of inner turmoil, because I never shared how I felt with others, not even with my family. I felt so alone, I was angry, but I didnt know how to express it.\nBut recently, ive written about my recovery in my college application essays, as I was writing my thoughts down, I just felt, lighter? If that makes sense? Im not sure how to explain it. I know it sounds dumb, but it felt like alot of emotional burden was lifted off of me, and seeing the comments friends and teachers left while reading my story, it finally felt like someone understood me. Its probably silly considering im only a teenager, while the majority of everyone on this sub are adults, and im sure its just because of teenage hormones and whatnot, but if you still have pent up feelings that you cant let go, I really do suggest you guys write about your story and recovery.", "CIDP question My girlfriend was diagnosed with cidp a few years ago. She got to the point of using a wheel chair. Suffered a car accident (hit from behind) and sustained minor lower back injuries. My question is- she was given cidp treatment back then and it helped. She did not need it after about a year of treatment. Fast forward to today- she had your neurologist appointment and was told her cidp is progressing (worsening). Dr ordered for a spinal tap and blood work in the next few days for better understanding.\nMost like she will be given ivig again but her body reacted very bad to it before. \nSo my question being- can she be given subcutaneous ig? Or is there another medication that is not a steroid? I hope her treatment goes well, better than before. I reacted very poorly to my first two brands of ivig, with fevers and headaches. For me, Gammaked was more tolerable than Gamunex-C, but I did best on the third brand I tried, GammaPlex. Buffering with IV saline before+after any ivig also helped limit sidefx. Insurance may dictate the order of brands, hopefully her doctor will consider prior reactions when deciding on treatment. I ended up doing subq due to horrible reactions to normal ivig. Was 100x better but you have to deal with inserting needles (5 for me) every week and your injection point does inflate like a balloon for about 48 hours. The good news for me was that I did not even need steorids during the process (just normal pain killers) I did subQ 3x a week for 10 years. I had far fewer reactions than IVIg.  Legs and stomach I could do, my husband did my arms despite disliking needles and blood.  It took about two hours but it is portable, worn in a pouch. I was on IVIG for 7 months but had to go off of it because I was having issues with vein access and an inability to get rid of all the fluid.  I was on Gammagard SD.  My main symptom would be a headache that started the following night and would last for a full day.  I am on subq - Hizentra now.  Infuse twice a week for 2.5 hours each time.  Tsujiz is right, at the injection point, it swells like crazy and takes a few days to go away.  I have 4  injection sites.  I have gotten past that though because I have seen a lot of progress while on it.  Strength is much better, I can move my toes (not before), I can carry 5 bags of groceries in one hand (1 in each hand before, and that hurt).  I am hoping the sensory stuff goes away - skin burning, numbness, tingling, blurry vision, eye burn, and unregulated temp.\n\nI was told you typically need to be stable on IVIG before switching to subq because the volume is half of IVIG. Could check out clinical trials. Protocol ARGX-113-1802 is looking very promising. Drug is a weekly subcutaneous injection (not infusion). Mechanism similar to IVIg but it is synthetic and proving MUCH lighter with side effects.", "Multifocal motor neuropathy wants a piece of me\u2026 but I am blessed to have the help I need to fight back  I did a video on someone with MMN if you are interested:\n\n(\n\nI think it is really helpful to learn stories like this to understand how another person is able to cope and thrive while diagnosed. Phyllis is a really wonderful lady, and very inspiring! Oh I watched the Phyllis video right at the beginning. Really inspirational. As I recall, she is been dealing with MMN for many years.", "PCOS/endometriosis after GBS? Has anyone been diagnosed with PCOS or endometriosis after GBS? If so, were you able to reverse these diagnoses? I was diagnosed with both 15 months after my GBS diagnoses. Thank you!", "Rash after ivig I am covered in a rash from my neck to my thighs which began developing about 6 days after my last IVIG treatment. Has anyone else had this type of issue? My neurologist had nothing to say about it and was not helpful. It is definitely dishydrotic eczema on my palms and a vesicular rash that is diffuse unlike the vesicular rash of shingles. It was not itchy for the first 4 or 5 days but is starting to itch now. Yes I had them show up on my upper chest and back and a few on my neck. I just used some otc eczema cream to control the itching until they went away. Came on fast but took maybe 2 months to heal but I am guessing that was my fault for scratching at them. Oh my. Two months is a lot longer than I was hoping to hear!! I had this too! So glad that I am not the only one. I was 14 when I got the treatment for the first time and got the rash, but it went away from itself. I just gave it some time. Why do these rashes appear? Do you think it might have something to do with the whiteblood cells that IVIG gives you? It is eczema so it is probably our own body reacting to the foreign antibodies being introduced to our already over active immune system.", "Do you ever feel guilty about using your condition as an \u201cexcuse\u201d for not being able to do things? So I have been out of the hospital for a month and a half now. Even though I am pretty much normal again, I still have days where I feel a lot weaker and the tingling in my feet is very bothersome. I have been out of work this whole time as well, thankfully I had money put away and I have been careful with my spending. I feel like my family is over the \u201cshock\u201d and is getting annoyed with me being home and not working. I DO want to be able to work, but I am taking my time with it because if there is always one thing I prided myself on it is my work ethic. I do not want to promise that I can do the job 100% if I myself am not 100%. That is why I am taking my time and looking for office work/something that does not involve a lot of physical activity. It makes me feel guilty, because I feel like everyone is starting to think that I am \u201cmilking\u201d my situation. Did/do you guys ever feel like that? It makes me feel pretty hopeless. No. But it gets on my nerves that my wife does not seem to understand it. Yes, but I mostly feel frustrated. Especially when its with my own family who saw me on a breathing tube and paralyzed. Like yeah I look 100% but I am definitely not. It is such a weird thing to traverse. Take your doctors advice on balancing the work life issues. Overdoing things can set your recovery back and you do not want that. I was off work for nearly 6 months, then went back on a part time schedule until I was confident I could last a whole day. You will get tired easily, and depending on the job, could cause problems, especially safety related. I recommend doing what feels right for you, and not let it matter what others think - they do not feel the pain and neuropathy. Do not feel guilty! Sometimes I would be thinking everyone thought this way about me, so I finally asked a few family members. They did not think that way about me at all, it turned out to be me just thinking they were. For me, I have struggled off an on with feeling insecure due to my work output being less than before my diagnosis. I just try to remind myself each day to do all that I am capable of. Some days I am not capable of much, and I remind myself it is okay and I know my truth and that I am doing my best. I do think the \u201cshock\u201d wears off a little, so when people push for me to do something I just say something like \u201ctrust me I would rather be able to go do that than this\u201d and they usually get the picture. The only way you are ever going to get through this is with physical work or rehab at some point. If your job is not physical you should be doing at least 30 minutes of day of exercise within those first few months and onward. This will offset the high-fat diet needed to rebuild your myelin sheath. People will think what they want. My wife finally 'got it' after I wrote a 4-page email to her co-worker whose husband has GBS and is just making it home. The email was to help him understand what could be his next steps for a few years, what did and did not work for me etc.  She thought I was trying to scare them..I was like 'why TF would I do that for? ' How would that help them? She has not given me shit since then. It is like a closed head wound. If people cannot see it, it is hard to believe it exists. Sometimes.      \n\nThe other day I really really wanted to help a guy changing his tyre in the rain but I knew I would be of little use so I just kept walking.       \n\nStuff like that really gets me down. As an outsider, or rather the other side of the equation, I would say that I would never look at you that way. Even if you do not gave GBS, its important to be realistic about your expectations/limitations. Aside from the physical aspect, mental health days are a thing too! Oh man, I had GBS years ago but it was months before I went back to work. And, i switched careers entirely. I used to do electrical work but I could not pursue that work any longer because of GBS. I physically could not walk long distances for months. My hand muscles were far too weak to be an electrician, too. My new job had a flight of stairs and for the first few months I was worried they would find me at the bottom. \n\nI am significantly better now, though there are a few muscle groups that are still relatively weak. I am almost unable to do any physical work above my head (like mudding drywall) for any extended period of time. \n\nAll that to say you should not feel guilty about your situation - I certainly know you are not alone. My advise is to keep current with your OT/PT and invite family over to observe and watch you. I think after a month of being home one of my milestones was doing dishes myself.", "Can it start with pain all over First off i apologize if I offend anyone. \nLong story short I had to get the tdap vaccine 3 weeks ago. Well last week I started getting some pain in my legs. Friday night my lower back started hurting bad! Saturday I started having pain in my ankles, feet and random areas. Sunday and to now my back is still hurting , but every joint is too! My fingers, hands, toes, feet, knees, legs. Elbows. Everything! I get random tingles in my finger tips . \nI have really convinced myself it is happening . \nI have a history of health anxiety so my husband does not really think anything but I am truly worried! \nI have an apt over the phone tomorrow but I wanted any advice as to if anyone started with pain before their weakness and tingling?! \n\nAgain I am sorry if I offend anyone I have been trying to google everything but it is just causing more stress. Idk of this is purely my anxiety over symptoms or what but I have NEVER dealt with pain all\nOver like this and after getting a vaccine, I cannot help but be attributing it to that Hi! Not a doctor, but hopefully what I say will be helpful. First, tdap is not one of the vaccines that has a correlation - there is not a lot of information about what causes GBS,, but tdap is not one of the vaccines the vaccines - I have actually gotten it since having GBS 6 years ago, and did not have any issues. \n\nThe other good news is I do not think your symptoms sound too much like GBS, even though it is understandable to be concerned! GBS generally starts at one extremely and works it is self up bilaterally. So instead of random places hurting, a more typical presentation would have been to start at your toes, then include your ankles, then calves, lower legs, thighs, etc., instead of skipping around. While pain (I think) is normal, I do not think there is a particular reason for back pain in GBS - nothing attacking your back and sprawling out from there. \n\nIt is smart to talk to a doctor since you are worried, and fingers crossed for you that GBS is not the cause! It is possible, but it is not a typical presentation. I would see a doctor, but do not jump to the conclusion that it is GBS.\n\nThe characteristic symptom of GBS is paresis, of at least one of: legs, arms, breathing muscles, and face. Typically arms or legs.\n\nIn rare cases, GBS can be associated in rare cases with tetanus/pertussis vaccines, there is a substantial of published case studies and there is even a warning on the CDC website:\n\n(\n\nI have also seen a real-life example of a GBS case (that was not associated with any infections) and started less than 3 weeks after a tdap dose and it did not start with pain as you described. I was diagnosed 10 days ago, with pretty early symptoms starting 20 days ago. \nI did experience some pain in my legs (entire limbs from thigh to l toes) that felt like I had hiked up and down MOUNTAINS, when I had only gone to the nearby grocery store. \nI also did experience a throbbing headache, and jaw/ face pain? I could not open my mouth more than 2cm because my jaw hurt, and my whole face felt like it had been bruised. \n\nNot sure if this is any help, but thought I should write in just in case! I experienced severe leg pain as well. Did your legs ever go completely numb? That was how i knew i needed to get in the hospital, my legs gave out on me in the shower and i could not get myself back up on my own. I work from home so i am spending most of the day sitting, i thought my legs were just falling asleep since i was not getting up and moving around. It is really difficult for me to describe the feeling I got. Yes, my feet (esp my toes) did go completely numb. Sort of like they fell asleep after me sitting on them for several hours. \nMy legs (knee down) were not able to differentiate a soft towel and sand paper if that makes any sense. I could notice something touching it, but I did not know what. \nMy thighs were a little bit more sensitive, but I could not really tell if something was poking me or just touching me. \nI am so sorry you had to go through that in the shower. Yeah I feel you, I thought my numbness was from work from home as well... oh the effects COVID has had... I had all these symptoms after COVID vaccine How do you feel\nNow ? Doctor after doctor no answers. Finally just went to the hospital to see if anyone would help me. It is been 6 weeks of it. I hope you feel better", "Anyone interested in joining/starting a support group via ZOOM with myself and two others? Hi Everyone,\n\nI am posting this here again...I knew I have connected with a few of you about starting a support group via ZOOM! We have three willing participants so far, hoping to start in May.\n\nLike all of you, I have had my battle with Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Back in 2018 at the age of 26, I was hospitalized with the numbness, double vision and headaches associated with the Miller Fischer varient. Went into respiratory failure and was med flown into Boston, where I received my diagnosis, was intubated in the ICU, fully paralyzed, and hospitalized for 3 months. I have since made a full recovery, but it can be challenging to deal with.\n\nI know most of you probably feel similar. You are part of a rare, exclusive group of people who have gone through a difficult experience that almost no one in your personal lives can relate to. Because of this, it may be difficult to get the proper support needed. \n\nI have been there. I am STILL there, with all of you. I created a group on Facebook for my own recover and for your recovery in hopes of connecting with those who have recovered, and providing support from those who are still recovering.\n\n\n\nWould any of you be interested in connecting and sharing expeirences with each other? Yeah, this would be great Yes definitely! That would be great! I would be into that for sure. I was diagnosed 10 days ago, and am still hospitalized. Do not really know when I am getting out, so if there are more in the future, I would love to join. ): I am starting it up this month! Did you join my fb page?", "I have had active CIDP for 20 years, I was diagnosed as a child. Hello all! I just want to briefly share my story with CIDP in case it helps anyone out there in a similar situation.\n\nI got CIDP when I was 5 and I have actively had it for almost 20 years now. By active, I mean that it is never gone into remission. I know that sounds scary, but the truth is I am doing great! \n\nI have received IVIG every possible way, SUB Q, IV, port-a-cath. And currently I receive it every month at home. I fought tooth and nail to never be on steroids or immunosuppressants as well, so I do not have experience with that. \n\nIt is been a ride, I thought I was going to die a couple of times, but life is really great right now. I am a relatively fit person that is able to workout and live a normal life. I carried two children, 2!, very successfully. \n\nThe reason I am posting this is because I have a wealth of experiences on something that is very rare, getting CIDP at such a young age, so if there is anyone else out there that sees this and wants to ask questions, I will always be available. Even if in two years someone sees this post and wants to hit me up with a question, feel free.  Have you ever tried not getting Ivig for more than a month?  Thanks for posting this. I was diagnosed with GBS in August but now my neurologist is trying to determine if it is CIDP or not. He told me I should prepare for this being a reality. \n\nI have been so scared because I am a 26 year old female with no children, so I am glad to hear you have not one, but two of your own! Thank you this has given me hope.  Yes, about once a year we attempt to stretch out my treatments by a week at a time. If I show no symptoms then we stretch it out again, but if I start to show symptoms then we stay on the current regimen. I have not been able to stretch out my treatments since I was 16, but we are still trying. \n\nOne of the reasons that I receive IVIG so frequently is that I receive my treatment before I start showing any symptoms, which is a method I preach. If you wait to get each treatment until you are showing symptoms then your body is incurring nerve damage that will add up over time. Fortunately, unlike with MS, our nerves have the capacity to heal, but its still a slow and difficult process, and not a given, so its best to not incur the damage in the first place.\n\nI know every month sounds like a lot, but at my absolute worst I was receiving a loading dose twice a week (!) so I really have come so far with this method.  Absolutely! I hope everything goes well for you! When I got pregnant my neurologist prepared me for all the possibilities, the most likely being a regression. CIDP does not respond well to hormones, something that anyone with CIDP going through puberty can attest to, and pregnancy is nothing but hormones. So she said I should be prepared to have to get treatments more often, but she said that a regression should not affect the baby at all. I was willing to take on damage to have a baby, but I was not willing to risk the baby being hurt so that was important to me and I was glad to hear the baby should be safe. Also my medication, IVIG, is safe for pregnancies, it is routinely given to pregnant women who encounter chicken pox and that is why we know it is safe. But, other medications that treat CIDP may not be compatible with pregnancy, so that is something to consider when the times come. \n\nIn the end I actually did not have any regressions from either pregnancy, in fact, I had some improvement. It turns out that the hormone we produce when lactating, progesterone, is great for our disease! It is something that is being experimented on as a treatment for MS (which is CIDP of the central nerves, rather than peripheral, so very similar diseases). My doctor encouraged me to breastfeed for as long as I could to maintain the supply of progesterone. Alas, my stupid useless boobs did not comply and I could not maintain supply that long. But she said other patients of hers that have been pregnant have had great results from breast feeding. \n\nI hope everything goes well for you too! I know you must be really going through it right now, I hope it is just GBS though, but if it is CIDP, it does not have to be the end of the world. Fight the good fight! I am saving this for later! Thanks for taking time to tell me this info. I do IVIG so I am glad to know it is safe for during pregnancy! I am also okay with the risk of regression, but would not do it if it meant harming my baby. I am also glad to hear that you can still be a mom, work out, etc. When I try to research CIDP online it is all very grim.  That makes sense.\n\nDid you ever have any of these symptoms:\nChills, muscle aches, burning back pain in between scapula and sometimes down the arms and entire head, bone pain, feeling like you are going collapse/pass out at any moment, feeling like you are inebriated, not being able to hold your head up, nausea/stomach pain, cold sweats.\n\nJust curious.  Oh ya, it is awful. Since the disease mostly affects people over 60 all the studies and anecdotal stories are so grim because this age group is already naturally suffering from functional decline and are more susceptible to this, and other, autoimmune diseases because as we age our immune systems ability to distinguish self from nonself diminishes.\nThere is a great study I will link here about how CIDP behaves differently depending on the age that you were diagnosed. Definitely worth giving at least abstract a read.\n\n\n\n Awesome thanks again! Super helpful I have actually only ever met a few people with CIDP, and we did not really discuss symptoms. So I really only know how my symptoms present. And it does not look like what you are describing is anything I have personally experienced, except the collapsing part. \n\nSorry I cannot help more with that one :/ Thanks for relating your story. After an initial 5 days in a row on IVIG, I am on a three-week schedule. Hey thanks for the post. So Iv been getting crazy neuropathy symptoms for the past 3 years some days are very mild and others I know it is going to be a struggle of a day. I am always fatigued I get electric shocks down my body and on my skin randomly in any area my lungs and chest feel tight my heart skips a beat or I get heart palpitations sometimes my muscles feel like after you have worked out in the gym very tired really bad back pain also pains in my sides. And sometimes joint pain this has been going on for about 3 years with no paralysis do you think this could be CIDP? I am super not qualified to suggest a diagnosis or anything like that. But I am a nurse and the symptoms that you are describing are concerning to me. Though heart palpitations are usually not a cause for concern, feeling heart palpitations along with chest discomfort is something that needs to be investigated by a cardiologist because it can be a sign that your heart is not functioning properly. I do not want to scare you, because we are not talking impending doom or anything. But you do need to get this investigated. I think you should make an appointment with your GP and bring a list of your symptoms and relative dates and times of day that you experience them. And know what causes your symptoms to worsen and what alleviates them. From there you will probably see a few specialists and get a proper diagnosis. \nDo not let another 3 years go by like this, you do not have to live in discomfort. Best of luck! I hope that it works well for you! Those first few doses of IVIG are usually the worst because they are often loading doses, which makes the nausea and headaches worse. It gets better :/ Thank you for your reply and concern Iv been to several gps as most of them sent me to wrong specialist I am only on the waiting list now for an neurologist which could take 4-5 months in my country I am considering going private. I have a big feeling it is post viral neuropathy as it all started a couple weeks after a viral infection but I am not the doctor this is tons of research matching my symptoms. I am concerned myself but because I look ok and not sick nobody is taking me seriously. But I am 100% sure I have some kind of neuropathy. Maybe that could be affecting my organs?  I had more or less the exact same symptoms 5 months ago when I had GBS (not CIDP). Hi! I had GBS as a child - it really fucks with your view of the world, does not it? I always just thought I was lame and weak and that is how life felt. It was not until my mid-20s that I realized normal people do not wake up in pain or feel extreme agony after a day walking around. \n\nCheck out the new discussion topic - it is about pregnancy, so your input would be really valuable. The internet has very little regarding that and I do not think any studies have been done. Absolutely! And I totally agree, I had it young so a lot of my symptoms only got caught when my parents noticed them because I was like is not every step agonizing for everyone? lol I still struggle with feeling guilty for my pain. I wake up every day and everything aches for a few hours. I feel so bad about that, even though I know it is just part of my life, and I feel like I have to constantly make excuses and organize stuff so my pain issues do not come up.", "New (possible) CIDP patient - Had first steroid treatment today! Started feeling symptoms in my legs in January/February, and could tell my walking was \"off\", but I thought it was from a sports injury or something. Walking and especially leg exercises such as squat jumps became exceedingly hard, and arm weakness followed shortly after. I tried playing tennis but my wife noticed my leg was dragging, which is when I went to see my PCP.\n\nI did not ask to see a neuro right away until the day I was going to get my first pfizer shot in March. Before the shot, I had real trouble walking at a normal speed and in a straight line. Eventually I got both doses and the second one really knocked me out, could barely stand and my hands felt stuck. Did nerve conduction, EMG, and finally last Friday had a spinal tap. The neuro told me he suspects I have CIDP and today they asked I come in for an IV dosage of prednisone. I feel normal so far, but have to come back 3 days in a row and am a little anxious reading some of the side effects folks here have felt. \n\nJust wanted to vent, and tell my story, new to the community here and still seeking answers and information. Everyone seems super nice and willing to offer their experience, which I eventually would like to contribute to as well. Apologies for the rambling post.\n\nSide note: My wife is a healthcare department administrator at a clinic, and was able to get me a neuro referral by having one of her docs call me and describe my symptoms. My PCP dropped the ball and never emailed me back when I messaged his office saying I think I cannot wait any longer. That was two months ago. I feel very lucky to have had my wife as a resource and have read some stories here where doctors just do not know how to handle the symptoms, and thus do not act expeditiously. Even then, their neurologist may not have seen patients with GBS/CIDP before.\n\nTimeline: First Symptoms in January, saw PCP in March, had my first neuro appointment in April, nerve conduction and EMG in late April, lumbar puncture last week, and today had first dose of prednisone. Also, first and second Pfizer dose in March and April, and had a seasonal flu shot in late November, and was on a clinical trial for much of 2020, getting weekly injections of a monoclonal antibody to treat eczema, from January to September. Are either of these related? Who knows, but I am reading a lot of personal stories about adverse reactions to seasonal flu shots, so it is got me questioning, though I am obviously not an anti-vaxxer. Welcome! And sorry you are here. I have CIDP also. I went on Gammunex-C IVIG infusions and went from 90% nerve conduction loss below my knees to only 5%, doctor considers it a success story. That said I have super complex autoimmune issues and I had a severe episode of numbness all over my body due to either/both of dietary changes and Moderna dose 1. I just got dose 2 and I am still trying to figure it out. So I relate to your navigating these mysteries. You really poked your immune system with the experimental MA, the flu shot, and then two rounds of covax. That is a lot of stress. \n\nYou may get lucky and not have GBS or CIDP. It could be a freaked out immune system sending a shot across the bow. \n\nWho advised you to get those vaccines while on a clinical trial with a MA? The covid vaccines I got this year, the MA trial I did last year, so no overlap. Got cleared at the time by my PCP and dermatologist to participate in the trial, and throughout and after it ended in September I felt great, no side effects whatsoever. Drastically improved my QOL. I do agree that perhaps the flu shot and then the covid vaccines I took after we are perhaps too much to quickly, but I was pretty worried about getting covid and so far do not regret getting it. I was already feeling the CIDP-like symptoms prior to the first covid vaccine. Moving forward, I agree I should be more mindful of what shots! That is great to hear treatment has been good for you. Hopefully you will come out of the next few weeks post-shot feeling okay.", "What is like GBS but not quite? Hi all. After almost 6 months, lots of tests and scans my specialist says his best guess is GBS. Now reading up on everything my symptoms seem to some what fit.\n\n- Had gut infection that they thought was appendicitis, removed appendix, lots of antibiotics and all good.\n- two weeks later lost feeling on the outside of my left leg and foot\n- after 4 weeks similar on the right foot\n- after 6 weeks started to get pain in left leg not just pins and needles\n- 10 wks in and hands started on the reduction sensation. Like wearing thick gloves\n- 14 weeks and pain in left hand\n- 18 weeks and pain and reduced sensation in lower back\n- 20 weeks and now left hand is starting to clamp shut when resting and left foot is rotating inwards and rolling a bit\n\nSo symptoms seem to fit GBS but it is a very slow onset compared to what I am reading. Any ideas from the experts?", "Plasmapheresis affecting HR and BP After plasmapheresis my HR runs slightly tachycardic and and my BP is moderately hypertensive.  These vitals were normal before GBS and before plasmapheresis.  Plasmapheresis concluded two weeks ago.  HR and BP still elevated.  I had to go on beta blockers to knock down BP and HR.  Anyone else experience this with plasmapheresis, and did it eventually resolve?", "GBS triggered by moderna covid vaccine maybe? ", "Gammunex IVIG shortage My wife has been getting IVIG for CIDP for a few years now. It is the only thing that stems the advance of symptoms. We heard rumblings of shortages and rationing starting early this year. She is infusing this week and is now being told they will not have product for her next infusions (2 days/week every third week). Has anyone else run into this? What did you do? Anyone know why this is happening beyond the vague rumors of not enough donors or increased demand. It seems that both of the excuses are lame since it is totally forecastable from a business point of view such that ramp up investments would be wise given the obscene price (and profit I am sure) of this med. Of course, there is nothing about it on the GBS/CIDP foundation website ( I have been keeping a close eye on this too and there is unfortunately not a lot of transparency or communication from the companies responsible. \n\nWhat I have found and what the below articles basically say, in summation, is that IVIG has been approved for more disorders and manufacturers were not prepared for this increase demand creating an acute shortage. The last article mentions that some hospital expects the shortage to last into 2020, but that is just their projection.\n\nGood luck to you guys!\n\n\n\n\n\n Thank you for the links! I will try to post when we know more which will be in a few weeks. The Grifols site (which is the manufacturer of Gammunex) has nothing to say about it at all. Seems very irresponsible on their part given that it is only a few missed cycles of treatment between being functional and needing a walker or wheelchair. Also, the FDA shortage list site shows Gammaguard but not Gammunex \n\n This is not good news. Ugh", "Gbs survivor but after reading some articles I am terrified I am going to have a stroke I had guillain barre from a respiratory infection ( I say that because I know infections such as the stomach flu cause symptoms to be worse. I was a part of gbs support group, and those that developed it after the stomach flu had worse symptoms and it lasted longer. \nI had gbs in 2015, but the doctors said there was no cure. That the IVIG was like a really strong bandaid. Relapse is rare. However it happens. \n\nAnyway I read article in the NYtvimes that said most people in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s who get covid-19 combat the respiratory infection and instead have strokes. ( I am terrified of having a stroke not just because of severe anxiety but because because of Covid-19, and this new information regarding patients who are 30-40 appearing as if they have gotten over the respiratory infection, and then having mild to major strokes instead is extremely scary. ) \nI want to drink to escape. If anyone on Reddit \nHas any advice.. I would love to talk. I have a drinking problem but it is in remission. Please now I am feeling very close to relapsing. I was not afraid of getting covid-19 before this, because I was very sure my age would protect me from dying. I would read statistics which said people ages 30-49 which said people have 0.02% chance of dying. The strokes change that. Hey I understand the fear behind this but drinking is not the right way to handle this situation. Covid is unfortunately an issue that we all have to deal with and take extra caution with but as long as you are smart about what you are doing, such as wearing the proper masks when outside and following the proper guidelines for covid, but know that you are doing the best you can if you are following these guidelines. Anxiety is a huge factor right now for people like us, with health issues and autoimmune diseases, but know that we can and will survive this. I hope you know that your concerns are valid and honestly I am also very scared about the reality of this situation but we need to remain strong and get through this together. If you need any other emotional support feel free to pm me or continue posting on this subreddit because this is a community that understands you and wants to help you in anyway that we can. Thank you for reaching out. We do need to remain strong and get through this together. You are right about drinking. It is not going to make anything better. I do take a lot of caution. I wash my hands a lot, I wear a mask that my father made for everyone in my house( my husband, my mom, my dad, and me) every time I go out ( which is only to go to my Zubsolv clinic. I also wear gloves every time I go out which is only to get my meds every two weeks. I was not scared until I found out about the strokes that people my age were having. Ive always had anxiety surrounding health issues like relapsing on gbs. \nI will definitely Pm you. I love this sub. The support I always find here is awesome. Alcohol is not a good way to cope ( I know). Honestly times are scary for people like us. As an aside, I find it very interesting that its typically people who have not had a major health crisis that are saying things like, \"it is no worse than the common cold\".\n\nHowever, as survivors we have to push through this difficult time knowing that there are places for us like this subreddit where we can be cared for. We can only take all of the necessary precautions to make sure we are safe.\n\nDrinking to excess tends to lower sufficient immune responses, even though it is an anxious time I do not think drinking is the solution.\n\nKnow that the healthcare community is on our side, and that if you have an episode of GBS/something terrible there are people that will still care for you.\n\nDefinitely talk to those close to you about your fears and try to get support outside of a bottle. I have had episodes of drinking to serious excess as well, and I find that communicating my anxieties and being understood by others helped me immensely. Yeah as someone else still recovering from GBS during this time, and terrified of relapse, let me know if you ever need to talk. Shoot me a message. I completely understand your worries and fears, but we will all get through this. Hey I am terrified of relapse too even though I tell everyone I am fine. I feel like if I showed how bad my anxiety is around health stuff ( and it is very bad most time!!) they would think I was a a hypochondriac. I am definitely going to message you later :). It is very comforting to have you say we will get through this. My family has been the same way. I am just trying to be completely careful. They told me any time I get sick I could relapse and so I have been terrified since lol. Also not able to have any kind of vaccinations related to the flu or CoVid. It is all very scary. But I am always here to talk. (: Yeah they told me I could not get the flu vaccine too because it could cause me to relapse. My family except my mom so basically just my dad says if my mom gets sick she will die and it could be my fault which I feel is really mean to say \u201cyou could kill your mom\u201d. He does not think my gbs poses a risk to me getting sick but my doctor told me I am at risk. I really wish my dad would not do this to me. It is messed up. I could die if I get it too but I guess he just does not care. Some background- my dad treats me good sometimes and sometimes he is emotionally abusive. He does not believe my gbs could affect me after I was \u201ccured\u201d. But I was not cured because you cannot be cured. When I had gbs he at first thought I was just anxious and not sick. So did my husband because I have really bad anxiety. When my right hand got to weak I could not put my hair up my husband said I was fine. I was just anxious. I am really upset I am sorry. I wish my husband would take my health stuff seriously. He did not think I was sick until I was in the hospital the second time and I could not really walk. He was so sweet to me and we even had a scene straight out of a romantic movie. He \u201cbroke\u201d me out lol. We went to the cafeteria but I could not stand anymore ( I had not gotten IVIG yet)? And a nurse chad to wheel me upstairs in an office chair. He even stayed overnight and they let him. My dad was very sweet when I got home and could not walk without a walker. He got me a walker but now he is not even worried I will get sick. He is just telling me I will be fine but my mom will not. :,(. \nI am sorry I am complaining I am upset right now. I understand why you are terrified. I feel the same way. Definitely pm me. :).", "GBS to CIDP I have had two bouts of GBS. Once in 2013 and once in 2014. Both treated successfully with IVIG except I ended up with permanent nerve damage in my feet. As my neurologist described it my myelin sheathing had not had a chance to fully recover after the first episode so when the second episode occurred I ended up with axon damage. No biggie. I have numb feet and some mild balance issues.\n\nUntil recently. About 3-4 months ago my feet very slowly started experiencing burning pain. This has very slowly progressed into pain so bad that I cry out at night (it is much worse at night.) I cannot stand the feeling of the bedsheets sliding across the tops of my feet. It feels like sandpaper on a bad sunburn. Additionally my numbness used to start below my anklebone. It has been slowly creeping up my legs and is now ~1/3 of the way to my knees. I also feel like I am having trouble with stairs again. \n\nCould this be CIDP? Has anyone here had GBS then CIDP after? When I had GBS both times it was a matter of a few days before I was completely unable to move. This is very very slow. \n\nYes, I plan on seeing my doctor asap. In the meantime I would love to hear any opinions or personal stories. I have had a very similar experience. Mine has turned out to be CIDP, but there is a small percent of people that have had a recurrence of GBS. It is hard to say which one it is sometimes, for me it took time, since my symptoms have lasted and lingered so long they could not say it was GBS anymore. I hope you get through this, stay strong and positive (as much as possible). My mother had a similar experience, it could be CIDP. I have numbness in both feet and nerve pain in the left leg.  I have been wondering the same thing. I have CIDP and had the same issues have your doctor write a prescription forGABAPENTIN relieves the pain and let you sleep at night How long did your symptoms last after they decided it was cidp? I am a little over 2 years out since the onset of my symptoms. I think it was one year after my diagnosis that they switched it from GBS to CIDP.", "Diagnosed by neurologist with GBS, but hospital says otherwise So I am a type 2 diabetic uncontrolled for a long time. High cholesterol. Borderline high bp.\n\nI will start off by saying I never had any issues with body pain, tingling, nerve, muscle pain, headaches or anything like that before 4 months ago, I was nearly perfect (minus the diabetes, high cholesterol, and BP).\n\nSo 2-3 months ago. It started with left foot redness, then right foot redness. Then tingling. Then moved up the body towards arms, legs, back, head. Symptoms became progressively worse and graduated to numbness, muscle and nerve pain. Probably happened over a few days and weeks. Complete list of symptoms: burning, pain/ numbness in hands/feet/arms/legs, upper back pressure/pain, dizziness, headaches, changes in blood pressure (low dia), muscle/nerve pain, fatigue, trouble walking, throat stinging, soreness towards right and left jaw, fast heartbeat. Many of the symptoms were intermittent and they would come and go randomly. After about 2 months many of the symptoms either went away completely or lessened in severity. The only symptoms that I seem to have now are just numbness in hands and feet, headaches/dizziness, low blood pressure (low dia), back pain/pressure.\n\nWhen it all started i went to 2 different hospitals that just gave a general diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, they did not do much tests. I did a lot of stuff outpatient: emg, holter monitor, comprehensive blood work, x-ray, endocrinology consultation and they all said they could not find anything of concern. And they were not able to offer a diagnosis. Primary care then referred me to a neurologist. Then I met the director of a neurology department that works with one of the hospitals that I went to. The neurologist was able to diagnose me with GBS after talking for 2 hours. She basically said I made good recovery, seeing as how my symptoms have seemed to have improved a lot on their own. She told me to check into the hospital and get IVIG therapy, which could speed up recovery. She calls the hospital neurologist that works under her and lets her know what is going on. Neurologist said they would do MRI and a bunch of other tests. I check into the hospital the next day. They did not do any advanced tests at the hospital, such MRI or spinal test. My care team was an internal medicine doctor and a resident doctor. I overhead them talking outside of my door to their team of interns/other resident doctors and basically they were saying that I was faking my symptoms, I do not have GBS, I should not get IVIG treatment. If he has anything it is probably just diabetes. Resident doctor went on to explain to the group that this is the first time I have seen someone misdiagnosed with GBS, he is probably just messed up from the diabetes. They tell me the risks of IVIG treatment and proceed with the treatment. They cut treatment short by 2 days and just send me on my way. They did not tell me anything except follow up with  the neurologist and primary care. Discharge papers are worded weirdly and basically says based on neurologist instructions we gave you IVIG and you may or may not have GBS. \n\nSo here I am not know if the neurologist gave me the correct diagnosis and whether the IVIG will do more harm than good. I am going to follow-up with my primary care and the neurologist. But, I am also going to see a different neurologist (outpatient) through the other hospital that I went to (it is a world famous hospital if that matters) in order to see if they offer the same diagnosis. What do you guys make of this? Does this sound like GBS, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or something else? \n\nNot looking for a diagnosis. Just want a dialogue. Thanks. We cannot tell from a post, and given that you have some component doctors, suggest you work with them. \n\n\n\nDid you call back the first neurologist and tell him/her what happened, especially that the later doctors said you were making it up?  \n\n\n\nThat claim will make it harder for any new doctor to believe you, once they see your medical records. ", "Can we get the vaccine?? Hi all, I had gbs in 2015 after getting mono. I was down and out for several months but consider myself one of the lucky ones. I fully recovered and have not had any issues since. Knock on wood. Can we get the vaccine? I know dr. Fauci I came out with that video early on saying we should not. And I was told by doctors to never get a flu shot again. What are your thoughts? Hi! I got my vaccine back in March but I did ask my neurologist first to make sure it was okay. I would just ask your doctor to be 100% sure. Yes you can get it. \n\nI, as well as others here, have gotten the vaccines.\n\n( there is no evidence of someone who has previously had GBS having a reoccurrence after getting the vaccine.\n\nI hope this helps. Please consult with your doctor (preferably neurologist if you can). There are a lot of different opinions, but in general it seems like many doctors (mine included) feel it is safe. I had GBS (MFS) in 2019. I got the Moderna vaccine back in March/April and had no issues. My doctor also recommends not getting the flu shot, but felt that given the seriousness of Covid it was worth the risk. My daughter has active CIDP and got the Pfizer vaccine with no issues.  Her neurologist advised against J&amp;J Appreciate the insight. Thank you Definitely consult your doctor. But I was told by my neurologist to get it, so I did. Got it (Pfizer) in April and have not had any sort of side effects. Thanks for the reply I think the only group who might be steered away from vaccinations are those who developed GBS as a result of a previous vaccination. Definitely give your doctor a call, but in general the data suggests it is pretty safe for our group. I would also recommend getting the flu vaccine this year, if your doctor gives you the okay on that too, as flu infection can cause GBS and experts are worried about this flu season. Yes,\n\nChoose the mRNA. (Pfizer / Moderna).\n\n2014 GBS. Straight up getting the vaccine carries less risk to your life than getting COVID. &gt;According to the GBS/CIPD foundation  \n&gt;  \n&gt;there is no evidence of someone who has previously had GBS having a reoccurrence after getting the vaccine.\n\nThat statement is out of date, if you looked at that page recently, you will see they list a study from Israel which did show evidence of reoccurrence of a severe case (which if you do the math, is around 2000-3000 times higher than background levels).\n\nThere are also more than a few anecdotes from this subreddit as well as on (\n\nSo there is definitely evidence of substantially increased risk - but whether that risk is worth it for some protection against SARS-CoV-2 is up to the individual. I had GBS in 2018 and I am very hesitant to get the vaccine, but, I have also had Covid so I believe I should have some immunity that way. \n\nMy Dr did tell me to ask my neurologist but I have not yet. So for me, TBD. GBS April 2021. Doctors actually had me get it before the general public could. This is just my experience, but my doctor said there is an extremely low chance of GBS \u201ccoming back.\u201d Same. I had covid around November and was asymptomatic. I thought it was my normal allergy stuff that finally got to the point I go to the Dr. Besides that, I was easy more tired but other than that not bad and I am glad. I have gotten the shot,I was hesitant  at first but got it I had the m shot,but I hear there booster will be a combo of covid and flu so I am hesitant  again.i do not trust the j&amp;j shot as it had a lot of gbs.not sure about p. Shot.for booster. I just do not want to go through gbs again,almost died,a lot to recover.i do not know next move. Was thinking of getting shingles  shot, but it says if you have had gbs ,best not to get it.\nI wish you well with your decision. Yes I also do the gbs fondation.i find it helpful,cause there is no cure. Also back in nov.2020 my husband had covid.we are never a foot away.i never got it. I give blood often,never had antibodies, though my husband did.????? I had GBS in 2015 and got the Phizer vaccine in July/August and all is well so far. I had it in 2007, after a stomach infection. I was able to walk again and pretty much everything back to normal. \n\nI had the first shot of Sputnik V back in July and I am getting the second one this Friday. (No, I do not live in Russia, but seems like my country gave Sputnik V to all 30 to 39 years old)\n\nI have not had any adverse effects other than a sore arm the day after the first shot, I hope the second one will be the same. Yes, we can! I talked to my doctor and a friend who is a nurse before getting it in February (I work in health care). My doctor has advised me against getting any \u201clive virus\u201d vaccinations, but said mRNA vaccinations are fine. I went to cvs and they had me fill out a questionnaire. One of the questions was have you ever had gbs. So the pharmacist said I was not allowed to get it since I said yea. I was not expecting to see that question on there I would check with your doctor if I were you, and see if they can refer you to a pharmacy that will allow it.", "Three times? Four years ago, I was diagnosed with GBS. 30 plus days in the hospital: completely paralyzed, eyes closed, no voice by the end. IVIG did its job and I was able to recover. Worked hard to learn to walk, use my hands again. Then last summer I got a cold that lingered and damn if it did not happen again! Caught it much earlier so recovered much quicker but still weeks in hospital. Last week I got the flu. Now waiting: will it happen again? Waiting for that tingle of toes and fingers. Ugh... Oh shit. Did you get it again? That tingle is the worst feeling... Hope you are doing alright You should definitely keep an eye out for from now on.  I had my first bout back in 2009, second was in 2015.  Now I carry a diagnoses of CIDP (Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, chronic GBS) and I have several signs that tell me when I will have my next episode.  Early detection, as you know, is key.\n\nKind Of weird they did not change you to CIDP, as I was under the impression that once you have GBS a second time, you are automatically changed to CIDP? What are your signs? How do you know it is coming on? You had that \" tingle\" before? No! I lived through the flu with no reoccurrence. I was surprised: was sure the flu would bring it on.  ", "My Story My interesting journey began while I was at work in 2013. I was 22 and I noticed that my big toes were numb, I did not think anything of it. As you all can assume the rest of my extremities soon followed. I had the left side of my face paralyzed then couple days later the right side also decided to join in. I like to think that I am always trying to find the bright side of thing and this illness was a challenge. I quickly found that I could still make others laugh even though I could physically could not, which was a warm feeling. It took about a month, 3 hospitals and several doctors to fin out that I had GBS. I spent about a 10 days and 5 rounds of IVIG. \nI was told that I would have to physical therapy and occupational therapy. I did not mind doing these things because I loved to workout. The entire process took about 6-7 months. I had to stop because insurance did not see me improving enough so the they stopped paying for it (not happy about that). So I went on my own and tried to get the strength that I had before. 6 more months pass and I am about 90% there. I am benching 200 lbs, culling 50lbs, etc. I felt like I have defeated GBS but as time continued I still felt a little tired. I felt like I could never reach that 100%. I told my doctor and she could figure out why. \n2015 I am 24, attending college, and working. Life looked like it was getting back to normal even with experiencing fatigue every now and then (I also had nerve damage on my fingers and toes). One day the same symptoms started to come back and I was like  I went to the ER 4 times and was rejected each time. They said it is not GBS, I said ok then what is it. They told me to come back when it is worse. I ended up going to Mayo Clinic in Minnesota 4 months later. They told me I might have some residual effects from GBS and that I also have hashimotos hypothyroidism. I told the doc that no one in my family has a thyroid problem and he said it was probably the GBS that caused it.  \nNow doctors think I might have a metabolic issue but I am 28 now my insurance ran out when I was 26, so everything is taking more time and money. I still keep a smile on my face even though simple tasks are a lot more difficult to complete. My family is my rock and I am grateful to have them. I miss playing soccer, I miss doing the things that I was able to do, but I have to look at the things that can do now.  My son sees me as Superman but it feels like I have kryptonite stuck in my back. \n\nI know this is long and I really tried to take as much as I can out.", "How long to be dx as GBS Hi reddit gbs community. I am terrified right now. I went to the ER yesterday for Bilateral calf heaviness and pain for about 5 day &amp; wierd bruise like rash on one leg. I also started with numbness/ tingling and ankle pain which I thought was unusual. I originally thought dvt since calf pain and weird rash is a symptom especially since birth control makes you high risk to get them. Once what was ruled out they let me leave after telling me I might have the onset of guillen barre syndrome. They gave me strict return criteria and told me to follow up with my doctor. So I have an appointment set for Thursday. I have noticed that my symptoms progressed to wrist pain and numbness and tingling in Bilateral forearms. Last night it was pretty intense and kept me up for a few hours. The pain in my lower extremities is low level but constant and my tingling is now to a little above my knee. I know you will not be dx without MRI or lumbar puncture and nerve conduction study. How long did it take to get officially dx. I am so nervous and am not sure if the aniexty of it all is making me think I am getting worse and/ or noticing every little thing. I want to stay on top of it so if I start going downhill I can get treatment fast. I guess I am looking for reassurances and personal insight on what to expect. Thank you for listening. If it travels up your body you need To go back to the ER right away before it attacks your breathing. I am not trying to freak you out but you want to start IVIG or plasmapheresis so it stops the progression. I was diagnosed in a couple of days so after you have the spinal tap, MRI, and EMG they should be able to confirm it fairly quickly. There are some good GBS groups on Facebook that are really helpful and you can usually get an answer to your questions pretty fast. Good luck and please reach out to me if I can help. I have had GBS for 16 months now so I understand. Keep fighting! It took less than 24 hours for me to be diagnosed. The symptoms should travel upwards. I was in the hospital three days before being officially diagnosed. They did tons and tons of tests until finally I had a bedside lumbar puncture, which was failed, so I had one done with imaging the next day. I was diagnosed the same day and immediately started IVIG treatment that same day. They wanted to rule out everything else before they finally did a lumbar puncture. Hang in there. Be patient but continue to advocate for yourself.  GBS can present quite differently for different people. It can be slow or fast. Usually starts from extremities and works toward center of body. I have had it twice and neither time did the spinal tap show anything. The first time they waited too long to call it but when they did the IVIG helped. The second time they called it as soon as I lost my reflexes and again IVIG helped. \n\nIt is important to give your body all it needs to recover\u2014 rest, relaxation and care. If hospitalist or GP doctors are treating you ask for a neurologist.  I would be glad to communicate support and mindfulness if you need it, just message me. How severe symptoms when you admitted? I was paralyzed chest down. I could still feel most of my arms though. Ty. Thank you all for your response. I was able to move up my Drs appointment and am awaiting a call from the Neurologist to hopefully get in this week. I have progressed with numbness and now more burning tingling up to my low back. I now have my right leg maybe hip giving out with walking causing me to walk with a limp. My Provider had no idea what to do with me beside refer me to neuro. She wanted me to head to the ER if I became incontinent or I started with visual disturbances. I am not feeling very confident in her response but will go if my weakness and burning/ tingling becomes worse. I am so sorry you went though that. It sounds so scary. Was this a fast progression? Or did your symptoms take a few days to get to that point? Thank you so much. I am hoping the neurologist calls me soon. With the current pandemic I am willing to wait a bit longer then I am comfortable with. I feel like the ER is hesitate to do further testing until my symptoms become more severe. My primary doctor did not order any tests at all. I am trying to figure out when my symptoms would be considered severe enough for them to take quick action. Thank you so much. I appreciate the reassurance. I have been trying to make sure I am very knowledge to be a good advocate for myself. This group has been so helpful in expanding that knowledge. Thank you for the response. I basically started falling down out of nowhere one day and within a day or so I could not even stand. I had already had double vision symptoms and dizziness. Wanted to give an update. Saw the neurologist and he suspects its functional neurological syndrome. A very basic explanation is that neurologically I am not sending or receiving some messages correctly leading to neuro symptoms not due to structural damage or disease. This can be due to internal or external factors. We are doing a MRI to see if it is something internally triggering it or if it is an external factor like stress that is causing the disfunction. Thanks for the support through this group. It definitely helped me as we figured out what was going on. I am still continuing to have symptoms that baffle me but am more confident with dealing with them. \n For more information this website was very helpful. \n \\+1 on this, I was admitted to hospital with GBS symptoms and within 2 days received: \n\n chest x-ray, CT scan, brain and spine MRI, spinal tap\n\nIt was highly assumed that I had GBS before the spinal tap (all other tests came back normal) but the high protein content in my spinal fluid confirmed I had GBS.\n\nI got my first IVIG treatment from midnight-6am the night that I was diagnosed (took 1 day to get the results back from the spinal fluid) and a second treatment the following evening.\n\nMy symptoms got worse for about 2 weeks after the IVIG but then things started to reverse themselves in the opposite way that they onset (the symptoms in my toes and feet were the first and the last things to go away).  The symptoms work their way up your body initially and then heal from the top down afterwards. How are you on your recovery? When were you diagnosed? How is everything going? What did your neurologist say? I was diagnosed in August 2019 and as far as I am concerned I am fully recovered now.  I have been able to return to bike racing at a competitive level (the same or higher than before I got sick). And the fact that I had GBS does not not limit me in any aspect of my everyday life. I still have some weakness and numbness in my toes and on the arch of my foot (I cant run or jump like I used to) but I have been able to return to an elite cycling level with no issues surrounding fatigue/endurance/strength anymore  (using custom orthotics and very stiff shoes) That is awesome! I hope to get there someday. I was diagnosed in January 2019. I had axonal damage also so it is been a slow recovery. Started walking with a walker a month ago so hopefully it will be steady progress. That is awesome, the fact that you are now able to walk with a walker is a very good sign that you will not need one soon! Keep up the good work and stay consistent, one day at a time.", "GBS gotten to lungs? Hi i posted for the first time and got some great feedback. My question is this. I hand tingles in my feet, they are 95% gone. Then i got it in my hands and fingers. They are about 80% gone. During that time i felt sporadic tingles in my lower arm then my upper arm. I am not sure if i have been worrying too much and giving myself anxiety but i feel that my breathing is heavy and i cannot get enough air. I read that if it travels too far up (either up hands or feet?) It can get to your lungs. Am i worrying too much? Would i lose mobility and function before it got too that? What would be the initial symptoms? Im on day 4 of symptoms. All feedback is greatly appreciated. You would most likely lose mobility first. You may be having panic attacks. \n\nBefore I lost the ability to breathe and was intimated, lost the ability to walk and use my arms. \n\nIf you are that worried the best thing would be to go to your doctor. However, it does not sound like you will be unable to breathe anytime soon. I was tested daily while in the hospital with a little ball in a tube setup to test, iirc, peak air flow.\n\nAt my worst the breathing felt shallow like I was not able to breath in all the way. I did always pass the test though, and never got intubated. \n\nI would let who ever is helping you medically about the issue.  Also be careful with over exerting yourself. Difficulty breathing will be another way to get exhausted easier. When I was going through all of it, I did not end up having respiratory issues until after I was unable to walk or move my arms on my own.  \n\n\nIt is really terrifying when you are just watching symptoms, and right now, a lot of what you will feel as you are looking for signs of improvement/change is anxiety. A ton of psychosomatic issues can arise, and even now, after I have recovered, I still freak out when I feel those slight tingles in my legs and hips.  \n\n\nIf you keep thinking you are seeing problems, you will find that there are more problems, and that takes a huge emotional toll.  \n\n\nI hope you get better, OP! I wish you all of the luck in the world. Please, please talk to your doctor or call a nurse help line ASAP. If this is GBS, you do not want to wait until you are immobile or worse.\n\nMy general practitioner initially thought my GBS was something less serious so please follow through. Unless your GP or a specialist says otherwise, ongoing tingling is not normal and should be taken seriously.\n\nGood luck! Thank you so much! How are you doing now?", "Fatigue after GBS? What are people's experiences I was recently diagnosed with suspected GBS ( nearly 6 months ago).\n\nI have thankfully nearly fully recovered from my initial symptoms which was severe weakness all over my body and badly affected my strength, swallowing and breathing. \n\nUnfortunately the Hospital I attended at the acute stage was awful and didnt treat me or offer and diagnostic tests - I really am thankful that I still retain most of my physical ability as before.\n\nThe one thing I am suffering from is extreme fatigue.... there are literally days where I feel I have climbed a mountain and the occasional weakness which comes and goes - I am definitely improving and again I am grateful for this!\n\nI am just wondering If others suffer with the above - occasional extreme fatigue and weakness?\n\nIf so did your neurologist prescribe anything to help? How long did the fatigue last for you?\nDid and form of rehab help? I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this is quite common, and can be lifelong, unfortunately (and rehabilitation approaches are not a cure).\n\n(\n\n( I have been tired and had issues with my left leg for nearly 7 years. Just keep a healthy diet and get exercise. The worst part is my strength is at best 60% of what it used to be. I lift 3 times a week with nearly zero improvement. Oh yeah, levels of fatigue I never experienced before GBS. I basically have to pace myself. It is like my brain gets fatigued and I cannot function much mentally either those days. Are you being treated with any medication?\n\nAs others have shared, fatigue is just part of it. In my experience a noticeable increase in fatigue is an excellent indicator it is time for an infusion. Energy returns after one.\n\nStaying active helps keep the fatigue down a bit. I know it is hard to do and some days impossible but each walk, each time you lift a weight or do some yoga, that is a nice big middle finger to the disease.  Thanks guys!\n\nAlthough its an awful disease and seems to pull your life from underneath you, in a strange way its nice to know your not alone and we are all going through similar  experiences - although I would not wish this on anyone.\n\nIn regards to treatment I have not received anything.\n\nWhen first displaying symptoms of GBS I presented myself at the hospital 3 times only to be sent away. I eventually managed to be referred to a neurologist at different hospital where he then carried out a lumbar puncture, MRI and NCS/EMG - all of these were unremarkable so not treatment was offered, I feel due to the length of time from my acute stage to the point of tests any clinical indicators had diminished.\n\nI am due to see him again on the 1st of April due to the continued weakness and fatigue. Something I definitely suggest if whether IVIG is an option at this point. I suffered from fatigue for about a year after onset.  My neurologist said it would pass, and it did.  He did offer some meds, which I declined.  I just did not have much energy and did not feel like exercising.  My neurologist told me that I needed to exercise and suggested mornings, which I did.  I found exercise to be very helpful, in many ways, such as regaining strength, balance, mobility, and mental health. I was typically asleep by 8 pm and slept until 6 am. I fully agree with giving a middle finger to the disease.  Whenever it was getting me down I used to say F you and the horse you rode in on.  If nothing else, it made me feel like I once again had control of my life. I had extreme fatigue for months after. And still do a bit now but not nearly as bad. I am a year out. My neuro suggested vitamin B and B complex. Plus I take magnesium for a deficiency. We also found out the pain meds I was on was contributing to my symptoms. I seem to get the worst of the side effects, yay me! I was told it will get better, but may also be a life long problem. The vitamins seem to help some, and coffee. Lots and lots of coffee. Sorry to say it, but I have had it for 30 years, ever since I got GBS. I once developed mono and did not even realize it until I nearly sunk in the middle of a water polo game - I interpreted the fatigue from mono as just \"more\" of the normal variety and pushed as normal. Ended up unable to even swim to the pool wall when it all caught up to me.\n\nMy case is a very old one, however, and current treatments seem much better, even at substandard care. Doctors are so much more aware of GBS these days and that will be really helpful with recovery - if your GP does not know about GBS get a referral to a specialist or switch to a GP who is aware of it.", "TENS unit for GBS? Did anyone use a TENS unit as a treatment for GBS nerve damage? I could not find much on it apart from reading online that it may help repair nerve damage. \n\nMy mother has nerve damage from GBS that affected her 20 years ago. I have damage in my feet that has lasted well over ten years, I sympathize with your mom.  My Achilles\u2019 tendons get swollen ever few years because of my adjusted gait. The physiotherapist uses TENS to help with that. Does not seem really to help my feet where the damage is. The treatment did not hurt and is not like a harsh chemical in your body, I would have your mom try it. I used one on my legs a lot when I first got home from the hospital. It does not repair nerve damage as far as I know, but it absolutely helped relieve some of the pain I was in. My moms nerve damage is on her hips and feet and legs so she walks slowly with adjusted gait. I will her the tens unit to try out. Sending u lots of love and well wishes Thanks a lot", "Looking for support. It hurts so bad. Hey guys. I am looking for just a little bit of support right now. You are the only people who know exactly what I am going through. I am only a month out of the hospital and usually I am pretty positive and doing everything I am supposed to, but damn it hurts right now. Just kind of sick and tired of feeling this way. Anyone else feel like me? I know it is so rough. Are you taking any medication? Like Gabapentin or Lyrica? Lyrica changed my life. It is literally the worst feeling in the world and you are super strong for making it to where you are now. It does get better. I have been out for 2 months now and improvements in pain and mobility are tremendous. Make sure you are eating a lot of protein and B-1 rich foods. The doctors kept giving me potassium pills but I am not sure if that was related or that my potassium was just low lol. Thank you so much for replying. Not one of my doctors offered me pain meds, but I see my neurologist on the 24th and will be asking for something. I am not a wimp. I handle pain pretty well, it is just this long lasting pain that is getting to me. I really appreciate your reply. Oh man, I was not given any pain meds either so I just took Advil  like there was no tomorrow, I also got acupuncture done, the acupuncture made a huge difference, definitely need to talk to your doc on the pain you are feeling to get the proper meds. \nIt sucks, and It will possibly continue to suck for a  bit but it will definitely get much better (but again, pain meds will definitely help) \nHang in there! Acupuncture? I am going to look up some in my area! I go to my neurologist this coming Wednesday and I am going to talk to him about the pain. I appreciate your reply! My husband has found a good bit of relief with amtriptaline or nortriptaline. Has used both. Takes about 30mg. Thank you so much for your reply! I will look into it Noritriptilin helps me as well. Plus daily B12 shots. I take b12 vitamins and niacin. Thank you for your reply! I will ask about Noritriptillan when I go to my neurologist this week. I am (21F) about 3 years out so I cannot compare my pain to anything you are currently going through, but I do experience \"flare ups\", not sure if anyone else feels like they have these (suffering from one right now). I feel so tired, and EVERYTHING ACHES. Every muscle, every thing. I was not given any medications either but my flare ups usually come from increased stress. I would start finding things that really relax you. I tend to get stressed easily, and with this syndrome it is never easy :( I am so sorry this happened to you! I also do not know how you feel about CBD, but it REALLY helps me, especially when the pain at night is a little more unbearable. If you ever need to talk please feel free to send me a message. I feel like this syndrome is so rare that we can never find people who truly relate to what we feel. I wish you the best and hope you start feeling some relief soon! Also just saw the comment about B12. I do take those vitamins daily as well! Thank you so much for your reply! Wow you got this so young! I am glad most of the pain is over for you, but sorry to hear about the flare ups. And pain at night is my issue too!! It prevents me from sleeping and I dread going to bed at night knowing what is most likely to come. I will look into CBD, I have heard good things about it. Thank you again for replying, I really appreciate you taking the time. I take nortryptaline as well as B-12. Still have some tingling neuropathy but no pain B12 shots are way more powerful than pills. .5 mg/day of B12 makes the world of a difference for me. Thanks for your reply! I got gabapentin prescribed today so I am hoping that helps and if not I will be going back to my doc for an adjustment if needed. I have CIDP 30 M, the pain for me to as the worst at my 4 month onset/diagnosis. It is really hard to really articulate to people how painful and difficult it can be when the myelin is gone or damaged. They do not see any clear pain, it is not direct, so it is kind of like to them you might be making it up or exaggerating. For my family and friends they seemed to understand how bad it was when I could not walk normally or open the car door without both arms and great effort, but they did not really understand that just sitting there and even trying to do anything was so painful. Falling asleep became my only solace. And even then I would wake up every hour or so to try to reposition and oh man the pain in my wrist and elbows and knees and feet. Arg even spreading open or closing my fingers was so painful. I have been on prednisone for a few months now and I got better within 2-3 days of starting it. I am also on an immunosuppressant that will kick in as i wane off the pred. Stick in there, treatments will help! Thank you for your reply and sharing your story. I think my family gets how painful it is, just do not know how to help. I was able to get some gabapentin to help calm the nerves at night, but it has not helped as much as I hoped, but it is better than before! You hang in there as well, hope your recovery is coming along. I know it is long and difficult.", "was it supposed to get better? (diagnosed in 2003) so it is been 16 years that it took me to find the strength to talk about this (some of us are a little slow lol) but i am 24 now and able to address my disability \u2013 GBS never went higher than my hips and up to this day my feet are paralysed and there is some nerve damage in random places up to my hip. after it was clear that this was not going to get better, the doctors said that it was not GBS after all but something else. since they did not have any better ideas i stuck with the diagnosis. i never researched this disease (i was in denial for a very long time) \n\nnow my question: is it true that with GBS it is always supposed to get better? is there a similar disease that does not get better (and therefore would be more fitting for a diagnosis)?\n\ni live in a small town and the doctors do not seem to be very up to date with these things and i do not know who i should ask (in my experience doctors are always kind of at a loss for words) I am not a doctor, however I have a fair amount of experience and I will \\*try\\* to respond appropriately - First, GBS is (typically) both ascending and descending by nature. This means that (typically) if what you experienced was GBS, it would have affected you from the head to the toes focused on your peripheral extremities. It is \\*atypical\\* to not have your upper extremities affected as you are describing (does not mean it is not possible, just atypical). Second, around 90% of GBS sufferers make a 90-100% full recovery (with some residuals but still), and this can happen anywhere from a few months to years. GBS is not a \\*degenerative\\* disease by definition, as opposed to something that looks\\\\presents similar like MS or ALS. There is really no need for me to expand on this much more because I would say you most likely do not sound like a GBS patient, plus if your onset was at 8 years old, you likely would have recovered by your 10th birthday (kids bounce back quick).   \n\n\nAs far as advice - ( would be a good resource to help you find a neurologist who might be able to more properly diagnose you, GBS not whithstanding. PM me if you need some more help. thank you so much for your words and time \u2013 i will check out the homepage and do some more research.", "Age of GBS Diagnosis So, when I was 6, I was given my diagnosis of GBS. My memories are foggy- the days run together, the nights do not seem to have any sort of definition. I cannot really tell you what I lived through since it was so long ago. I cannot really remember things other than the numbness.   \n\n\nHowever, now, since recovery, I have been really, WILDLY into neurology! I love learning about what happened to my body and how to help others in the same situations. I am hoping to go to medical school one day, and work to become a neurologist or researcher of some kind.   \n\n\nBut, I wanted to ask, when did you all receive your diagnoses? How old were you, how did you find out, etc.? What has been the common age of this?   \nI know that I have Googled this time and time again, and I know that usually charts on the subject show a bimodal spread, with age of onsets happening at ages 15-35 and again at ages 50-75. I just want to hear it from people who have actually been through it. I was diagnosed at 26. Tingling in fingers and toes and no sense of taste. 5 days later I could not feel below my elbows or knees, could not stand, incredible nerve pain, and my right side of my face stopped working.\n\nI got IVIG and plasmapheresis, spent a month between 3 different hospitals before being discharged, and then 2 months of outpatient OT/PT. 49, m, Miller Fisher, persistent cough for 6 weeks, then tingling in feet and biletral Bell's Palsy in hospital I was a  53 year old female in good health. Diagnosed at 5 years old. Cannot remember anything except spinal taps sucking and not getting to see Snow White and the Dwarves visiting Children's hospital from Disneyland because grandpa came to visit that day. It is actually a real headache - my mother is abusive and withholding, so I have to slowly bribe my own medical history out of her. From what I have gathered so far, in the 80s when I had it, they thought it was polio at first. GBS was much less known - growing older, it is actually been something I have observed. Over 30byears, I went from having to explain what GBS was to every new GP to them hearing about it to them actually knowing basic diagnosis for relapse. It is awesome but also makes me wonder if it is becoming more common or something? I was 3. I am now 28. I was 20. In college.\n\nHad consistent cold for 4 months. Also had allergic rhinitis. Just 14 days before getting diagnosed with GB syndrome, I had a severe upper respiratory tract infection. My nostrils were bloody red!\n\nThe type I had was AMAN. All motor functions damaged. Could barely lift my hands.\n\nI just woke up one day and felt weirdly uneasy while writing with pen. Started having difficulty while trying to type on smartphone screen. Had difficulty walking. Like my legs would not listen to me.\n\nI went to college and gave a minor test. There I realized that my voice did not work the way it did if I spoke in high voice. Fast forward to next morning, I could not _climb_ a floor one inch higher than the floor level. Had difficulty opening and closing my jeans' zippers. Shit escalated quickly!\n\nI read multiple research papers in last few days and read that 60% of people had an upper respiratory tract infection two weeks before they had AMAN. I am sure that is where I got it. I was diagnosed at 25. A week after routine gallbladder surgery, I had extreme soreness in my knees which became weakness to the point of not being able to stand. 36. I am only a week out of the hospital. I was sick in January which they suspect was covid and which left me coughing through February. In mid March I began noticing tingling and numbness in my feet and hands. My shoulders were extremely sore and I suddenly had lost significant flexibility. About two weeks later balance was a mess and stairs became hard. I went to my primary and she was convinced it was MS. The nuero the next day confirmed my suspicion with lumbar mri and emg. I was hospitalized that night and underwent 5 days of ivig. I am pretty much at the same point right now as when I was hospitalized. I am hoping the ivig begins working it is magic soon.", "Supporting someone through confusing recovery set backs?? My girlfriend was diagnosed with gb (miller fisher variant) a few weeks ago and it was a really scary, chaotic ordeal, in part because her family lives across the country. She is completed the IV treatments &amp; is definitely getting better (back in school/working almost full time), but she keeps having these minor/unexplainable set backs - like suddenly, her double vision will become a lot worse, but only on the left side. Or today, her legs have started feeling weak/trembly again (this has not happened since her last iv treatment). I know this is so mild compared to what most of you are going through, but would you have any advice/insight for me or her? There is so little online about he recovery experience, and she will not have another check-in appointment until December. I know this is freaking her out, so any words of comfort/shared experiences would be helpful! I also had Miller Fisher, back in 2010.  Most of the little things coming back I remember came when I got fatigued.  Also fatigue going into effect changed for me.   Over those first ~4 weeks I learned not push as hard since I no longer had a good understanding of when I was going to be \u201ctoo tired\u201d.   This changed slowly over the first few months afterwards. I had a variant of Miller Fisher. In the hospital for a month. Double vision, paralysis, breathing tube; the works. Biggest thing is making sure she does not push herself. You can help her, but she also has to be an advocate for herself. It took me some time to learn how to express my fatigue to others, but it is necessary for a full recovery. There will be set backs, but just keep supporting her. I agree with what the other people are saying about not pushing herself too hard.  \n\nIt is really difficult to force yourself to take time off for a disease, but she might really need to. A few weeks is not much time at all to let herself recover before jumping back into school and work. Especially because this disease is made worse by stress. But it is obviously way easier said than done. \n\nTo your other point you sound like youre already doing a lot for her just by being supportive and inquisitive. Your best role here is probably to keep being patient and support and encourage her resting more. Consider anything that fatigues her and try to mitigate that. \n\nHelping with chores so she does not have to do them, making sure she has nutritious meals, if she has trouble sleeping maybe earlier bed times, black out blinds, etc. You could plan fun low key date nights because emotional support is important too. If you are going somewhere drop her off at the entrance and then you go park. Just things like that. \n\nI am sorry you are going through this! Hope it gets better. You are doing a good job. Take care of yourself too. She is going to have good and bad days. Through the days she going to have good and bad moment. From here she has to adapt to this new feeling. Take it one day at a time.

Now that she is been taking through a voice valve a bit, we have noticed she is had some confusion....such as why she cannot go home....forgetting her parents have passed, etc. She is on gabepentin for nerve pain and I am wondering if this might be causing this....or if this is a side effect of recovery....she is not on any narcotics.....just some Tylenol now and again...... wondering if this is common..... Thanks so much Glad she is doing better!  Was she on any Propofol?  This can cause confusion and memory loss. \n\nI was on propofol for a while when I was on a ventilator. I have no recollection of the first two weeks of this past March. That could be it. \n\nI wish you and your mother the best of luck! I had no effect or side effect from Gabapentin. I stopped it pretty quickly. I have been taking Gabapentin for 2-1/2 years without any of the side effects you describe. I had a severe bout of GBS in 2017. \nI hope she recovers quickly and gets into a PT program to get her back on her feet.

Physios focus on muscles, using things like guided stretching, massage (not fun relaxing massage, but deep tissue in problem areas), dry needling (science-based, needles relieve pressure in muscles, not the same as acupuncture). Athletes use these specialists. They also will give you helpful homework in the form of different stretches and exercises to do at home!\n\nThis can be a useful long-term maintenance to help with muscle use especially if you notice yourself favoring some muscle groups over others due to uneven nerve damage. I have found it very helpful to deal with pain and muscle issues which occur as a tertiary effect of things like foot drop. I agree 100%.  The physio group when I was learning to walk again are the main reason I regained as much as i did.  It was not easy, but they 'forced' me to do everything right and not take short cuts. I spent five weeks in a rehab center with several hours of therapy per day. When I got there I could barely move one arm, but I was discharged walking. Highly recommended!! We are a little over a year into my husband's diagnosis. He spent two weeks in ICU, then a few months on the long term care, then spent one month at a rehab and then had home health for one month, and that ended last May. At the time they said to save his home health visits until he gets more movement back. So I have been doing ROM and stuff at home. Anybody have any tips on what I can do for him to help him not lose strength? He says I am not, but I really feel like I am just failing. He has amazing trunk control, but is unable to really do anything with his arms and legs Is he in physical therapy? Mine took months, and I was a kid so my recovery was quicker.\n\nPool exercises maybe? The water can help build strength with less resistance.", "I do not technically know if I was diagnosed with GBS but back in Oct I started having balance issues, followed by some weakness in my legs. Went to the hospital and the lumbar puncture showed elevated proteins. My blood work, and the mris of my head and spine were all normal. I followed up with a neurologist and was given the nerve conduction tests. Given the presentation of all of the results, he said I mostly likely have a mild form of gbs or a variant of gbs. O was not given any treatment because what I had was mild. I have never been really able to wrap my brain around what this means.  The strength in my legs has come back and my loss of balance has gotten much better, but the random muscle twitching has been consistent. Up until a few days ago the twitching that was originally all over my body basically receded to only my feet. I just tested positive for covid (for the second time even though I have been vaxxed) and the twitching has all come back. Is this just related to my immune system ramping back up from the covid infection or do folks typically have twitching as their nerves heal? I am just confused as to what is normal and what I need to follow up with the neurologist about. Any advice would be appreciated.", "Bilateral facial paralysis Hello! I am a 26yo female. My first GBS symptoms presented themselves the first week of September 2019. One of the first and worst symptoms was intense facial/jaw pain. Constant throbbing to the point I thought it could be broken and having hallucinations. I tied frozen veggies to each side of my face day and night. \n\nWithin a week, the pain was gone and my face has been paralyzed since. I have been unable to close my eyes or my mouth completely so I have to bandage my eyes at night to sleep and can only drink from a specific water bottle and closing my mouth manually. I had 8 ivig treatments, a month of inpatient therapy with daily e-stim an hour daily, without improvement. \n\nNow, I have a single muscle above my right eyebrow, a second muscle underneath my right eye, and a muscle in my chin that slightly move. Because I am no longer doing e-stim and the muscles in my face are paralyzed, my face is swollen from lymph fluid and I cry uncontrollably 24/7. I am worried that my progress is extremely slow or that my face will not fully recuperate. \n\nI was wondering how long it took you/someone you know to regain control of their face and if there is anything in particular that helped.\n\nThank you! Have you asked your doctor about plasmapheresis? That works for some folks who do not respond as well to IVIG. I also had facial paralysis, not close to as bad as how you describe, but very similar where one half would not move. Just like everything it takes time. I had to use a straw for a long time after the hospital and I still prefer to two years later. I had partial control of my right side by the time I was out of the hospital 2 months later. I wish you the best with you are recovery. Heya! My experience is eerily similar to yours, the facial paralysis that is. \n\nI am 18 months out from diagnosis and still have significant facial paralysis. I cannot move my eyebrows. I close my mouth manually and cannot use a straw because u I cannot make a kiss shape with my lips. \n\nI could not open my eyes for weeks and when those nerves recovered a little, I could not close them for weeks (muscles are weird). For a good 6-9 months, I had to lubricate and tape my eyes shut to sleep at night - so I feel you. \n\nDM me and let us talk. You must have so many questions. Five years in, face hurts all the time. Left side is better than right. I have a stiff upper lip and a wrinkle free forehead. :) I had while in the hospital but we have not revisited since I was discharged. My doctor told me the plasmapheresis would counteract the IVIG.\n\nWeirdly enough, my body has recuperated rather well. I am nearly independent.. I cannot drive or carry heavy objects. So I do not know if the doctors would recommend plasmapheresis in my case. Thank you, you as well :) The silver lining, no Botox haha I feel like it is at least worth the question. Plasmapheresis would counteract the IVIG if you got it right after getting IVIG, but independent of each other or with enough time between, it would not. Facial paralysis can take longer to recover from than other areas affected by GBS. Please keep up to date with a doctor, but also please do not despair! Recovery can take several months or even longer.\n\n\n\nI cannot find the abstract now, but a year or so ago I read a case study on GBS where heightened emotions actually had physical symptoms like facial drooping. Have you been able to see someone regarding your mental health? GBS is incredibly exhausting in every sense and it is a massive life event. Therapy is encouraged to help with the emotional side effects of the syndrome. You are absolutely right! Hey I am 25 now and also have bilateral facial paralysis. For my face it was mostly isolated to the left side, and it never really got back to 100 percent. My paralysis was severe to the point that it looked like I had a stroke when I first got sick. I was 22 when I first got sick, but now I get Botox injections every three months that work very well for me and really help my face look like it used too. It is difficult seeing pictures and making comparisons to before but ya know at least we are still alive. You got this", "What does recovery with IVIG feel like? My wife was diagnosed with CIDP. She had her 4 day loading period of Gamunex C IVIG and a 2 day maintenance dose. She is due for her second maintenance dose tomorrow. She will have 2 day maintenance doses every 3 weeks for the next 16 months.\n\nShe is starting to notice more tingling and pain in her feet. Also having muscle cramps throughout her body. She was diagnosed with nerve damage prior to the CIDP diagnosis. I read that nerve regeneration can be painful. Is it normal to have pain in the beginning of the recovery or is this something else? I have had several lapses in treatment due to insurance problems and have always found that the needle-pain, fasciculations and muscle spasms tend to start again as they did at the beginning of the CIDP and then lessen backwards. I use magnesium malate and take muscle relaxers at night to help ride it out. Lots of omega 3 in the diet helps shorten it as well as keeping a therapeutic Ig dose. Good luck to her!  In my experience with it over the years, it takes a couple days to kick in where I feel the difference. I would not say it works immediately. \n\nWith my CIDP it drains the physical energy \"battery\" and IG recharges it. \n\nMoving forward, since she will be under active treatment, those sensations are a tipoff that it is time for an infusion.

Anyway I noticed tingling in my fingers and toes on Monday night and now my feet are numb.  I went to see a doctor today and got an urgent referral to a neurologist.   Has anyone on here relapsed?  How severe was your gbs before they started treatment?   This shit is so scary, and it is worse now that I am older  and not a teenager and have google. Had GBS 22 years ago (wow...feels weird typing that) - never had a relapse. Back then, I was fully paralysed from the neck down before they started any kind of treatment on me - left with bilateral foot drop, chronic fatigue - the usual.\n\nHave you noticed yourself being any more sick I.E Cold? Flu? Tonsilitis? It usually occurs due a to a weakness in the immune system (So I was told...) - so could be related.\n\nBut if you have been referred that is good - the earlier they get it, the better. &gt; This shit is so scary, and it is worse now that I am older and not a teenager and have google. \n\nWhy would you ask a bunch of people who cannot give you any actual insight on a 'relapse', and have probably read the same info as you have these questions? By even insinuating this, \\*you\\* are part of the problem, sorry. Just go to the neurologist.\n\nFor the \\*\\*rest of you\\*\\* - the likeliness of a relapse is the same likeliness as contracting GBS in the first place. I am sure OP means well and is just scared, but he\\\\she is also broadcasting self-doubt to many of you. Please do not do this. If you are sick, go to the doctor. Do not come here because you are trying to connect dots. But somebody might be able to give some light on a 'relapase' - somebody else MIGHT have been in a similar situation to them. It might provide OP with some comfort/knowledge that someone else has come through it.  \n\n\nThey are not broadcasting self doubt - OP is scared and looking for reassurance - why cannot you let them have it without making them feel guilt for asking for reassurance? Do not misread. Reassurance from what? I am not trying to dismiss op. I am trying to dismiss this reoccurring idealism that people connect \u2018relapsing\u2019 to anything else. It is simple a poor choice of words. I am speaking from a place where I have observed this. It is not helpful. Not to op. Not to anyone. In fact the only someone who might actually lend insight is a doctor. That said you have the right to your opinions. So does everyone else. I just find the message irresponsible and fear mongering. I am not misreading...I actually think you are misreading my comments...\n\nReassurance that they are not alone??? That someone else has went through the same feelings?? Same symptoms?? GBS is that thing where no one can have the same symptoms or we all have similar symptoms. \n\nWhen people are scared - they go to somewhere to get reassurance/advice and, well, this is OP's place.  \n\n\n&gt;I am trying to dismiss this reoccurring idealism that people connect \u2018relapsing\u2019 to anything else. \n\nOP was not trying to do this - OP stated that he is going to see a Neurologist, so I feel your point telling them to talk to a Neurologist is pointless. OP was simply asking if others had a similar scenario - they were not trying to link it to anything.\n\nPeople like OP and hell, even me, should be able to come here and ask questions about GBS without people scolding them for potentially poor choice of words.\n\nYou are right - you are entitled to your opinion, and so am I - and so is OP and if OP wants to ask for potentially related symptoms from fellow redditors, they should be allowed to do without people knocking them down for it. Alright first of all, this is extremely condescending. It is not necessary to speak to *anyone* in this community that way. You are not doing anyone any favors by speaking like this. \n\nOP already said they have reached out for medical advice and have seen a doctor. As anyone who has had GBS knows, it is extremely isolating because there are so few people who have experienced it, and even those who have experienced it often have wildly different symptoms, timelines, etc. As long as OP has reached out to a doctor, which they already stated they have, there is nothing wrong with asking if anyone has had something similar happen to them.\n\nYou are not the gatekeeper of this community or subreddit, you are not the one to tell people what they can and cannot come here to do. So because you disagree with me, you feel entitled to tell me what your interpretation of what is acceptable or is not acceptable. And you assume I am \u201cgatekeeping\u201d. I offered my opinion. And further, you sound uneducated about the condition. Do not be a dick.   What problem am I a part of?  Like is not this a forum for people that have had GBS?  Ergo I am asking if anyone had relapsed, and what their experience was . Also I *HAVE* a referral to see a neurologist. And WTF having gone through this BEFORE I know what I am in for only now I am middle aged and have a fully developed frontal cortex, a full time job, a family and google, and therefore It is scarier than when I was a teenager.    Nothing about what I wrote has anything to do with self doubt. Are you saying it is odd that I expressed fear?  Newsflash: people have feelings. I have relapsed. I am currently waiting for another IVIG treatment because I lost feeling in my feet. I give it about a week of continuing symptoms before I call my neuro and tell her what is going on. My neurologist is really great and does not wait around for things to progress any further, she will just order IVIG and normally a week or so after I get the treatment, I am seeing improvement.\n\nTry not to panic, be sure to take care of yourself. You can PM me if you want to talk more or hear about my experience. Best wishes! I hardly call asking people what their timeline was idealistic.

She was paralyzed for several months but, thankfully, made a complete recovery. Since then she has been very hesitant to take vaccines, though she is by no means an anti-vaxxer, quite the opposite. In fact, she took the Pfizer vaccine after talking to several specialists and had zero issues.\n\nFast forward, I am pregnant with my first child and her first grandchild. We are very close and obviously I would like her to be around after I give birth. We are both trying to do research to see what risks are involved for her getting the TDAP vaccine. She had it once before when she was very young with no negative impacts and her doctor is very for her getting it. \n\nI am hoping this community may have some resources for research or studies in terms of the TDAP and GB. Obviously, I would never do anything to force my mom to get something that could legitimately harm her. I completely respect the fact that the idea can be terrifying to her for legitimate reasons. I would be lying if I said I was not anxious about it as well. But on the flip side of that, I have to be cautious and protect my child as well, even if that means keeping her away the first 3 months of his life until he can get vaccinated. \n\nThank you for your time and any advice or resources you might be able to point my way! Definitely check with the doctor. If your mom's doctor is in favor of her getting it, I do not see why she would not get it based on the doctor's recommendation. We are looking for other resources because her primary care physician is pretty much a small town doctor and my mom is most likely the first person he is ever dealt with who has had GB. We would love to contact a doctor who specializes in GB or at least someone who has more experience for a second opinion. I do not have anything hand right now, but from talking to my doctors, they are not concerned about TDAP. I had GBS in 2015, got TDAP in 2017 for school, and actually got another dose yesterday following an injury. Definitely have your mom talk to her doctor, but according to mine, TDAP is not one of the vaccines of concern.\n\nETA: I do not get the flu shot, so I am vaccine-wary because of GBS If you are looking for a specialist try to find a neurologist, as they are the experts on the subject. \n\nIt looks like the swine flu vaccine had an increased risk of GBS in the 70s. I have only been able to find one study within the last 20 years regarding the TDAP vaccine and GBS ( Looks like only one person has got it. \n\nI would still find a neurologist and talk to them, even if it is a remote meeting over the phone or video. I completely understand your worry, as I developed GBS in 2019 and my wife gave birth to our daughter in April 2020, right near the beginning of the pandemic. We did not let anyone see her for a long time. I hope you are able to find more information and a good neurologist, and I hope you, your child, and your mom all stay healthy. Thank you, that is good to know. Thank you! I will definitely recommend she reach out to a neurologist. And thank you for the link to the study. Neurologist was going to be my next suggestion! FWIW my neuro told me to get TDAP. I was supposed to get it while pregnant but my son was born prematurely. I will still be getting it though, based on recommendation of my neuro! I second talking to her Dr. But, I got a TDAP 15 years after recovering from GBS and had a bout of GBS following the TDAP. There is warnings of GBS and the TDAP. Ultimately, the shot call will rest with your mother, as a physician will likely use word \"can\" but stop short of \"sure go for it!\"\n\nHere is why I would say that:  1) The waiver indemnifying the provider that she will sign will ask a specific question about previous serious illness from vaccination.  Some ask specifically about GBS.  Checking that box usually pauses an immunization and they ask you to go get a sign-off from a physician.  I do not know if your CVS does that but most healthcare systems do at that juncture.\n\nTwo, in the ACIP general guidelines for immunization,  Table 4.2 shows conditions incorrectly perceived as contradictions or precautions to vaccination.  Tdap is in the first category.  History of GBS is listed but with a superscript C.  That superscript reads:  \"An exception is Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome within 6 weeks of a dose of influenza vaccine or tetanus-toxoid\u2013containing vaccine, which are precautions for influenza vaccines and tetanus-toxoid containing vaccines, respectively.\"  This table is on pages 61-62 of the current guidelines.\n\n\"A precaution is a condition in a that might increase the risk for a serious adverse reaction, might cause diagnostic confusion, or might compromise the ability of the vaccine to produce immunity.\" (page 50)\n\n\"Contraindications (conditions that increases the risk for a serious adverse reaction) to vaccination are conditions under which vaccines should not be administered.\" (page 49) I joined the GBS/CIDP Foundation and have found it to be a great source of information   \nfrom GBS patients, caregivers, doctors and other medical experts. There is an online forum that you could ask questions in. The website is (   Good luck!", "I relapsed, but my doctors do not think I had GBS ever? I am writing this while in the hospital right now.  I had GBS back in May and was hospitalized for 10 days.  I had to relearn how to walk completely and was on ivig and plasmapheresis.  My lumbar puncture in the ER the first time was normal but I did not have reflexes in the ER.  After I got out, I was able to walk but with a cane and am unable to run, drive, swim, or use stairs.  I have been going to outpatient physical therapy.  \n\nThis morning I woke up with stiffness in my arms and legs.  I was also having convulsions (I have epilepsy).  I have bad days and good days with GBS but this was a red flag.  I could not walk so my boyfriend had to carry me to the car.  At the ER I was told that the convulsions were just muscle spasms and that the GBS was likely psychogenic in nature and that I would benefit from counseling.  Their reasoning?  My lumbar puncture was normal in the ER the first time.  My reflexes were present in the ER this time.  My EMG after I left the first time was normal.  Also, they said it is not possible to be awake while having seizures which is not true at all.  This is not the first time a doctor has told me my GBS never happened because the tests did not fit the mold but I am feeling so discouraged.  I am having even more trouble walking and they are keeping me here overnight.  Any advice would be welcome.  Has anyone had their experience denied like this? Go to a stroke center. They have neurologists on call or if you can wait get an appointment. Have you had any neurological tests like an emg or nvs? The ER head wanted to admit me to the hospital, but the hospitalist said I had run of the mill peripheral neuropathy and I would recover..... even though I could not stand up or barely use my hands. I am pretty sure it was because I did not have insurance, but still pretty shitty. I was especially pissed when I found out people can die from untreated GBS(it is not very common though). My symptoms continued to get worse for another week before I stabilized. My mom talked to her doctor and he said it sounded like GBS and recommended I go to Erlanger hospital, which is the closest stroke center and they had neurologists on call. They did not disregard my condition and treated me right away. They gave me complete financial assistance and it did not cost me a dime. 35 days in the stroke ward and another 35 days in a nursing home. Ivig, steroids.... even a fucking nerve biopsy that the neurologist who took over my case said was completely unnecessary and worthless. Oh and the original neurologist said I had CIDP and no one ever told me I had a new neurologist or that my diagnosis was changed to GBS until I met with the new neurologist over a month after being told I had a chronic condition.... I was so relieved that I was not real pissed until a few weeks later that it set in that I was completely uninformed as a patient. I like to imagine it was because I was a charity case, but I  think it is just because of our fucked up health care system. When GBS first struck me, I went to the shitty ghetto hospital that the ambulance would only take me to. Despite being unable to walk, and losing use of my fingers while there, the shitty doctor told me he was sending me home because he could not find anything. He said it was stress. I had to ask total strangers to help me into the Lyft car to get home, then more strangers to carry me into my house. I got to a second hospital literally as my breathing became labored. My sister and brother picked me up and drove me to the hospital near them, an hour from me. I ended up getting intubated and was in the hospital for 2 months. I made a full recovery in 6 months and now have CFS and numb toes. It will be 3 years next month since I got sick.\n\nI would go to a different hospital if I were you. I am wondering if it is CIDP, which does not have as bad of an onset as GBS, but does recur and needs ongoing treatment. If you have not already, check out the GBS-CIDP.org for a wealth of resources. Best of luck to you. This right here.  I had the opposite experience as you. I went to a hospital I would never go to.  It was the closest to me.  I was trending down so fast it was the only choice.  Well guess what the Doctor had survived GBS in Med school.  Be your own advocate and speak the F*ck up.  My ex wife who is an ICU nurse had never even heard of GBS.  I had heard of it but only knew one person.  I was a Navy Corpsman(medic). So please get the best care you can. No test, especially the lumbar puncture test have perfect sensitivity. Ask the doctor to show you the data on the reported sensitivity of the test. If they cannot, ask them how they know the test is 100% accurate.\n\nEMG tests can often have poor sensitivity if tested around 6-8 weeks after onset, if the individual has started to recover during this time. It is quick to have reflexes return this short after - repair of damaged nerve myelin is very slow. Your symptoms are real - so an option would be to go with what they suggest to get better? Get someone to go through their thinking with you slowly and explain the treatment plan, allowing time for questions When I first went to the hospital with GBS, I could stand up on my own but could not walk or anything else. All my tests in the ER came back negative but they did not do a lumbar puncture or EMG because they did not think my condition was neurological at all. (I did end up at a second hospital where they did all the testing and it came back positive still.) The doctor told me my condition was psychological and I needed to stop being so stressed. I could not take two steps on my own but the doctor assumed it would be fixed if I stopped being stressed, which obviously was not the case. I am here for you 100% and I know what the experience of being denied and shut down by your doctor's is like. Do not be afraid to see if it is allowed for you to switch doctors or hospitals even. Good luck and I am hoping you get the treatment you need soon! Of course you can be awake during a seizure. My daughter had many of these. Trust yourself. It does not matter what name your condition has, if it affects your motoric and sensoric abilities, then the insulation of the nerves is probably affected. I am diagnosed with GBS, MFS and Bells-Palsy. It does not matter what name they tell you. You are the best person to determine what it is. What worked for me are massive B12 complex shots, 3ml/day. I buy mine when I am in Asia for work for a fraction of the price. It helps me greatly. B12 is greatly important for the nervous system ( My insurance pays for 0.5ml/month and that is not near enough. You cannot overdose on B12. It is the one magic bullet for me. So, for me it is 3ml intramuscular per day. But you should check with your neurologist. All I have to say is fuck the American health care system.  I mean that with all respect.", "CIDP remission Hi there!  I am new to Reddit and joined after reading through this sub.  I was diagnosed with CIDP when I was around 7, went into remission a couple years later after treatment.  I am now 25 and still in remission.\n\nIs it normal to be in remission this long?  I guess reading everything here has made me question whether I actually had CIDP or if it was something else.  I know it was a decently rare diagnosis at the time and IVIG really helped me, but just curious!  I have been doing more research lately due to the new covid vax and all that, and would love to hear any thoughts you might have. Hi lgd\\_247 - I am actually newly diagnosed with CIDP, so someone else might be able to give you more information, but because I have done a ton of research recently the details are pretty fresh. So two things:\n\n1. Being misdiagnosed with CIDP yet still seeing effective results from IVIG is entirely possible. Take a look at this recent ( where they discuss a study from 2015 which estimated that 47% of CIDP patients do not actually meet the criteria for CIDP, but most do respond to treatment which suggests IVIG is an effective treatment for a number of neurological diseases.\n2. Despite the word \"Chronic\" in Chronic Demyelinating Inflammatory Polyneuropathy - there are three accepted progressive courses of the disease, but the main clinical distinction separating CIDP from AIDP (Guillain-Barr\u00e9) is where initial symptom growth progresses beyond 8 weeks :\n   1. Progressive - What most people think of, the disease progresses throughout one's life.\n   2. Relapsing/Remitting - This involves flare ups weeks, months, years, decades after the initial onset.\n   3. Monophasic - A one time course that lasts between 1 and 3 years and never shows up again.\n\nSo in essence, it is both entirely possible you were misdiagnosed and also possible that you had a Monophasic course. Having CIDP does not guarantee you will or wont have another relapse but as long as you are not concerned about any new symptoms then I would not overthink it. If you look at this sub you will see plenty of articles stating that the mRNA covid vaccine is unlikely to be of concern for CIDP/GBS patients.\n\nFor further reading, I would take a look at this retrospective study of CIDP in children: (", "can you share your recovery time? well, I still have residual weakness in my feet 7 months after the paralysis started. and I am extremely worried that I am not going to recover completely. so can anyone please share their time of recovery just to know the ranges between different people? thank you &lt;3 I recovered quickly. I would say it was a couple of months, maybe a little longer. But, I did have pain in my left leg for quite a while. 3 years for sure, but it was not bad. I would say it has gradually gotten better, but it and my balance still are not perfect. I can do almost everything I did before, except skiing. The boots are just too painful. It is been almost 14 years since I had it. I was in the hospital for 8 days. Used a walker for a 3 or 4 months after that. Thanks for the reply! \nHope you are doing well now. Sorry for asking, but have you completely recovered by now? If yes how long did it take you? Thanks for sharing that! I am just being anxious and there is nothing I can do about it I am a little over a year out. Everything is back to normal essentially, however, my feet are still affected. They hurt to be touched and are still numb from the middle of my feet out to my toes. I am very hopeful that I will keep healing and eventually this numbness/pain goes away. My descent started in my feet so they are the last to heal. I used a walker for a few months, then went to a cane. I do not need anything to walk now and I look \u201cnormal\u201d walking now. I still have to sit to take a shower because I do not have full feeling back and I am afraid of slipping and falling. I wish you the best to keep healing and hope you get back to 100%.

If you do not mind me asking, when did the \u201crecovery\u201d stop? A year? Or a couple of months? Thanks for sharing, I hope you get better! \nIf you do not mind me asking, What about the motor abnormalities? and did you stop recovering or are you still feeling that you are getting better? Thank you! You as well. Honestly, I have felt pretty stagnant for at least a month. I am still very weak in general from being so much less active than I used to be, which is incredibly frustrating. I am pretty much back to normal minus minor things i.e. the pains in my legs, the neuropathy, in my feet but also my hands on occasion, and I think that is it mostly. I do have bad days every few months where it is just a little bit harder to walk, but I take my foldable cane with me everywhere just in case. Not to be grim, but it never has. All the time I am regaining sensitivity. On the outside you would never know anything was ever wrong but I can. I had GBS when I was 19 and I am 35 now, so I really do not know what it feels like to be \"normal\". GBS symptoms vary so broadly though,  I was in some sort of a 10% bracket. I was 8 when it happened, I am 26 now. I know there were a lot of lasting side effects but it is all a bit fuzzy.  I am fully recovered now the only lasting thing is I have to get shots cleared by my doctor before I get them.  I got my tetanus shot about a year ago and it messed with me. I was achey and all that. Not sure if that is normal but it didnt feel good at all.  I had to talk to my doctor about it first and he cleared me to have it but he had to review a bunch of stuff before.\nSide Tangent - i am the reason you should vaccinate your kids, herd immunity and all that, I cant always get the shot so I rely on those around me to get it. I have permanent nurve damage in my feet and face. i was mostly back to full strength in about 4 months. But i have CIDP so i received multiple infusions. Happened almost 4 years ago, hospital 4 days, took about 5 months after hospital discharge from inability to walk, to walking around the block.  Fast forward 4 years now, I have learned that cycling is best for me.  I still cannot run or walk too long without my lower legs getting all tingly, weak and numb.  When I go (slow) hiking, I use poles and that allows me to \u201cstay on my feet\u201d longer.\n\nI also learned that there are many mornings where my lower legs feel like they have just climbed a mountain the day before, even though I did not do anything.  I learned that these are \u201cfalse signals\u201d and if I force myself to go for a bike ride, I am able to stay on my feet for most of the day!  Not sure if anyone else experiences that but I have learned that my brain is trying to trick me!\n\nFor the most part, \u201cgetting back to normal\u201d is not really my focus anymore because I have also aged 4 years... to share with you personally, I was very hard on myself when I could not achieve normal, and it definitely messed me up on the mental side.\n\nIf I could encourage you, do not focus too much on when recovery is, but look at the daily progress you are making.  And you are not alone :)\n\nEdit:  I still suffer from fatigue if I push too hard.  I feel like a bag of rocks hit me in the face when I get fatigue, and I fall asleep realllly fast once I hit the bed/couch.  30 minutes later I have energy again. I am really glad you shared your experience. When Doctors could not diagnose me, I heard them talking privately saying it might be something serious. So I spent a day worrying I might never walk again or maybe worse, quadriplegia. A day later they did the mri, ncs and spinal tap and said that I have GBS which have very good prognosis and I will be normal again. I was so happy and eager to gain back my \u2018full\u2019 motor strength. But now, 7 months later. I am really really depressed that I still have foot drop... cant drive my car.. etc. It is hard not to be anxious. Keep thinking positive and moving forward. It will get better! Good Luck! I was 9 months before I was confidently walking. Threw a lot of errors trying to do things like bike riding, it was about 14 months before I had that down again. That was 17 years ago and I have had complications because I had significant atrophe, but the physical therapy wound up way too early. My muscles did not redevelop any where close to normal, and instead there with a fair imbalance, especially in my legs. That led to feet deformities, that creeped in over a decade, and corrective surgery down the line.\n\nSo if I could change one thing, it would be to have continued the physical therapy until I was beyond my normal fitness. I went in on may 9th 2017 and came out 15 days later but recovered fully about 6 to 8 months down the line I had 8 weeks of full paralysis after a slow onset and was hospitalized for sixth months. In a wheelchair for a further 3 months after that.      \n\nIt is been 5 years since discharge from the hospital and whilst I am almost totally back to normal I still have numb feet, I cannot run and I experience transient nerve pain - especially in feet and hips.        \n\nRecovery progress stopped after about 3 years post-discharge. I had CIDP so my recovery time was naturally a little prolonged. Once I started IVIG treatment I began to improve fast. I would say that within 6 months I started to feel like I was regaining my independence back. But it was obvious that I was still recovering up to 2 years, regaining my strength and ability to walk \"normal\" again.\nI considered myself disabled at this time with mobility issues, and this lasted up to 3 years as I was still walking \"wobbly.\"\nFast forward 10 years later and looking at me you would not know I experienced and recovered from such severe motor issues. I can walk fine. \nI do personally experience weakness in my hands. I struggle to grip things and type, and I have general issues with tiredness and fatigue. Although, I do consider myself fully recovered, now. I assume this is because of permanent damage done to my nervous system. I am going to provide a bleaker perspective, just to show how far treatment has come. I had GBS back in the 80s as a child (so my recovery was ideal). There was no plasmapheresis or IVIG and I was put on basically an iron lung. \n\nIt took me over a year to recover and I was an exceptionally good case for that era. I still have nerve damage but I also beat a case of pneumonia a year ago. I am on the bad end of the scale and I have still lived a full life! I still have nerve damage, but I am doing well and living life! \n\nHow are you doing now?", "Hello Hi. I got GBS when I was 8, post flu shot. Fast forward ten years and after some stomach virus I relapsed again. 2 months inpatient between icu and neuro floors, then 3 rehab. I too struggle with wondering if and when. I also worry about when I want to have kids. For me onset feels like this warmth and inflammation in my spine, a tightening of my back muscles and all-over weakness.  So sorry to hear about your relapse. You are still young so you are likely to recover well. I was around 21 when I was diagnosed. Feel free to message me about anything. Feel free to message me if you want to talk or vent or compare. I got diagnosed in December 2017 and since being hospitalized I have had one additional round of GBS and will be having another in about 2-3 weeks because symptoms keep coming back. It is really frustrating and you get to the point where you are just waiting for the other foot to drop.  Thank you! I am 27 now and I have residual weakness and strange sensations but sometimes I wonder if I am so used to weird feelings  Yeah the whole experience is pretty weird. I ask my friend weird questions like \"Hey how far can you curl your wrist with your fist closed?\" Random questions like that because the disease makes you notice things that you never noticed before. I am not sure what is normal and what is not normal about my body after GBS so I have to ask others.", "Useful tool! A cane+chair. Awesome for visiting places like musuems or concerts where you need a break from standing  My only downside is you have to straddle this to sit (the cane handle goes between your legs). It is like riding a very silly horse. Could not find any with a different design.", "took physiotherapy , can walk but cant run or sit on my thighs my physiotherapy got discontinued and i cannot run or sit bending my knee. i am getting fatty due to lack of movements. should i hit gym or take physiotherapy again? i do not know i just got heavy and do not think physiotherapist can rebuild my muscles. my gbs got me bedridden for 1 year almost but want to join in sports again like i did before . i am just helpless. Hey there I am so sorry about your situation. I lost over 40 lbs (mostly muscle in my legs) from being bedridden. Physical therapy helped me a bunch, but I think what helped me the most was just walking. \n\nI started walking about half a mile, then a mile, then 2 miles, then 3 each day. Over about the course of a year I regained a bunch of my muscle back, improved my lung capacity, and had better cardiovascular performance. Honestly walking is great and was the first step (pun intended) to getting back into more intensive exercise (weight lifting, circuit training, etc). \n\nI hope you have a speedy recovery and best of luck Most larger health systems have patient gyms where patients can talk with a trainer and set up an exercise plan that fits what your body can do and the goals you would like to achieve (or get something from your PT).  It is sorta in between a PT session and winging it on your own at the gym.  You can stay there for a couple months, and then transition to a gym of your choice.   \n\nTrying to do what you used to do without that professional eye could get you hurt.  You do not want to fall or twist an ankle.  \n\nYou are not helpless if you get out of bed every day.  One day at a time, do the best you can. You are not helpless and not sure why your physiotherapy got discontinued if you have not recovered properly. I suggest you get a leg trainer for home to help with your leg movement if you cannot go to gym for now. Hopefully this will gradually help you. I try walking. But my leg muscle pains alot if i continue for long. Like i had to wait 3 days to reduce leg muscle pain. I just think they are not strong enough. Should i still opt to walk? Or can doctors come to any help in this case? What is your diagnosis if you do not mind me asking? And are you taking any medication? Thanks for giving me hope but unluckily  there is no such institute where i can gym + pt in my country. My condition was so bad that i had to take pt for almost 6 months. Discontinued  due to financial problems and the covid situation. Is leg trainer different from pt?  Where should i look for a leg trainer? GBS(aman). \nMeds: vitamin B complex for nerve reviving\nKind Of loosen my med habit though. \nThey gave me more meds i forgot and it was to be continued Ha Okay! Yes, it is actually called Seated Elliptical Trainer when you search for it Will keep this in mind If you have that much pain I would ask to go on gabapentin. I would also add omega 3/6/9 to your diet. Helps with myelin sheath growth. \n\nBesides that it sounds like you should probably be in physical therapy given your description of how bad the pain is \ud83d\udc4d For 3 days walked for  1 h each.  So had to take a 3 day rest. The pain is like  i feel the need to stretch legs and massage with oil  and the thigh too. Another thing is my thighs cannot bear the weight of my upper body so cannot get up from knee bending pos. Yeah I completely understand. Probably before walking that much you should do 15 min at a time. And stretch regularly. One thing about being sedentary all the time is that your hamstrings  and calves are going to tighten a bunch Thanks for suggestions bro Of course. I know what it is like to stop physical therapy because of cost. US healthcare system sucks. But hopefully you can figure out a system that works for you. Hopefully you seem some improvement soon I am from bangladesh actually.  I will look for some muscle grade upgrading techniques online. Your encouragement will be remembered If I may suggest, get a stationary bicycle. Far less stress on your knees and hips. Also helps you to get more cardio while still weak. \nI had GBS in 1995 with 7 months hospitalization and continued physio up to now. \nPeople do not realize that GBS has an acute phase, but is really a chronic condition.\nI am now 51 and the paralyses is slowly returning.\n\nKeep fighting and good luck. Yeah i can understand. When you stand up after you recover a bit no one else understands what one goes thru. In my case it has been 2 years.  Someone experienced said the residual weakness does not go off sometimes", "Looking for answers to a very long period of no diagnosis. Potential GBS? Hi everyone, I hope it is ok if I ask some questions about GBS, as I am just learning about it and someone I know mentioned that it is possible I might be suffering from it and was adamant that I go get it checked out.   \n\n\nFrom what I have been reading, it sounds like a lot of the symptoms start to pop up rather quickly and can be quite debilitating. Though I hear others say it differs greatly for everyone, so here is a little backstory on what I have been going through.  \n\n\nI have Been dealing with muscle pains and joint pains accompanied with muscle weakness for about 7 years. Trying any rehab does not work as it seems like the body can not convert the exercises into positive results, even the weakest/lowest impact of exercises makes my pains flare up for days unless it is straight-up stretching. Sore eyes tend to itch and burn quite easily and will cause double vision if I try to focus on something for too long. I have chronic fatigue syndrome accompanied by brain fog and a lot of food intolerances that prevent me from eating any sort of carbs/sugars/starches without flairing up drastically. Constant abdominal pain as well when/after I eat. Symptoms have been \"maintained\" to a degree by diet and herbal supplementation. Fatigue and fog increase as time goes on and cognitive function diminishes. It has vastly become more and more difficult for me to think and communicate to others without losing focus on what I am trying to say. Any new herbal remedy I try that is supposed to help with immune function and or kill bacteria works well for a short period of time, then stops working, no matter how much I rotate them.  \n\n\nI bring this all up because all of this started one day when I was in school 7 years ago. I was drawing and everything seemed to be fine then all of a sudden my arm became very weak and was trembling. I was in school for animation so I thought it was due to my drawing habits at the time as symptoms kept progressing. I thought it was carpal tunnel at the time, which spread to both arms. Eventually, that spread to my eyes and they burned so fiercely whenever I looked at any electronic screen I could not look at anything without feeling pain. I saught to cure boredom by trying to be more active and the pain spread to my knees. I have gone to a neurologist but they said nerves are fine. I have seen a naturopath who helped me reconfigure my diet which has helped me over the course of several years to at least get 80% function out of my eyes again, but my arms and legs (pretty much all joints) and abdomen still plague me with constant pain. I have been told of the possibility of /parasites (though I have only been tested for some) sibo/lyme/ Epstein barr virus. All negative.   \n\n\nI just want to get some of your opinions before I go to my doctor with this, as I have been in and out so frequently doing so many tests while being so tired, it is hard to drag myself back there on something that does not have any relation to what I am going through. I should mention that symptoms SEEM to have manifested after a case of antibiotic abuse partly due to my fear of being sick from other symptoms I was feeling at the time, and partly due to either incompetent or just out to lunch doctors. To me it does not sound like it 100% is what that is, but I figured I would ask in case someone has any insight!  \n\n\nIf you have made it here thank you for taking the time to read. This does not sound like GBS as it is missing the key feature of rising bilateral weakness/paralysis. Myasthenia gravis maybe? I am sorry you are going through this. How did the neurologist assess your nerves to be fine? And how long ago was that? Yeah, I figured that might be the case, but was not sure as I have no idea if everyone that has it goes through that. Definitely no paralysis. Any muscle weakness I have I feel like is due to the lack of using my muscles because of the constant pain/fatigue and so have weakened from inactivity over the years. Thank you. He did a nerve conduction test and attached electrodes to my fingers. He believed it was more myofascial than nerve at the time because I could not feel my thumb either. After getting a few myofascial massages and some help with a naturopath, the feeling in my thumb came back. Though the pain in my muscles and joints still remain. This was at least 4-5 years ago. Belated response but I would definitely recommend another nerve conduction study. That will be really helpful information for you. I last had one in October and I am getting another one done soon. It is key data and since it is been 4-5 years you are definitely going to get something useful from it. You can also ask if a skin biopsy will help to study your nerves more.", "Please let me know what you think of my symptoms Hi everyone, I started having this strong pain in my stomach on Thursday last week which led me to seek medical attention the following day as I felt a balloon was inflating on the right side of my lower back. I thought I might had been appendicitis but I did not have any fever or nausea, the doctor examined me, told me to get a few tests (a blood test and an ultrasounds) and apparently everything was normal with only signs of an already contained food poisoning. \n\nThe colon pain is gone now but when I felt the balloon on my right side I could also feel that something was pressing against a nerve there because my right leg felt very very slightly numb, that started on Saturday before going to sleep. The next day I started feeling a bit of tingling in my foot. I went to the doctor yesterday (that is when he told me I was basically all good) and I still had the tingling on my right foot, I mentioned that to him and he told me to get an x-ray of my sacro lumbar section. \n\nThe thing is that later that day the tingling extended to my right hand, then left foot, then left hand. It was mild but noticeable, at night I decided to do some stretches for sciatica pain and it seemed to relief the numbness on my right foot. I did the same thing in the morning and so far I have not had much tingling and I believe zero numbness on my feet (it actually comes every ones in a while like just one needle slightly pinching somewhere there). As for the hands, they kind of feel the same as yesterday but now it is more localized at the tip of my middle fingers and my thumbs.  Two things I would like to mention is that the tingling comes and goes and also I can feel a slight pain in my hand joints that also comes and go, also when I clench the muscles of my right leg, it feels as if had worked out, it is a slight soreness as well.\n\nI know it is very early to come to conclusions but nothing like this has happened to me before, it is overall a very mild sensation, it is not debilitating. I want to wait a bit longer before seeking medical attention just to see if anything gets better or worse as time passes.\n\nIf anyone can give me their opinions or thoughts I would be very grateful. I know this is a serious condition and I am very sorry for coming into this space with such little information, I hope it is really something else and my heart goes out to any of you who have actually experienced the condition. If pain/tingling comes and goes it is probably not GBS. (Disclaimer: I am not a doctor.)", "Tingling in genital area, hands, feet Hi, I had sex a month ago. Two weeks later my tongue was covered in a fungus. Now, since two weeks or so, I am experiencing weakness in the legs, and the tingling in genital area, but also hands, feet etc. Also I noticed when lying face down, my arm and neck start to go numb from lack of oxygen. Did not happen like that before. Could this be Guillain-Barr\u00e9 ? GBS is a rapid-onset syndrome characterized by ascending paralysis in arms and legs. The first sign is pins and needles, like when your arm or leg falls asleep. Your situation does not sound like GBS to me, but definitely see a doctor.", "Thoughts on getting covid vaccine? Hi all. My grandma has been dealing with GBS since 2015, and has not been able to recover. She is 70 now. I recently talked with her doctor about getting the covid vaccine (mainly because I live with and take care of her but I need to start looking for a job and do not want to get her sick.) Her doctor said she would not suggest she get the vaccine. Has anyone else gotten similar or different advice from a doctor? I just do not know what to do. My opinion is her doctor is always looking for excuses to not help. I really need to find a new doctor but... I just do not know where to start when it comes to her GBS condition and who to trust since I always here \u201cit is rare and we do not know much about it so there is nothing we can do\u201d \ud83d\ude44 I am exhausted\nAnyway... have any of you heard advice from a doctor about getting the covid vaccine? Hi, and I truly feel for your grandma.  Tell her that everyone on this sub is rooting for her.\n\nThe first advice that anyone gives on this sub is to discuss your individual situation with your doctor, and absolutely get a second opinion.  I think most here appreciate the need to be an advocate of your own health, and I am sure your grandma is grateful to have you help.\n\nSo, yes, there is a lot we do not know, but many of us here follow the literature on what we do know.  We know that the elderly are hit harder by GBS, and tale longer to heal, and I am sure you know.  But we also know that covid is *extremely* dangerous for the elderly, and that 70+ is probably the most at risk group.  We know that the flu and other common vaccines are not as much a risk for GBS as we used to think.  I get why dr's are still advising caution, and this is why we still say talk to your own doctor.  We do not know yet about any potential dangers of GBS with the covid vaccine because it is so new, but we have not seen a problem yet.  \n\nWe have shared links to a lot of research in the past, and that research has led me to start getting vaccines again.  I am 50+ and will certainly get the covid vaccine as soon as it is offered to me.  I have discussed this with my doctors (one is my sister) and they agree with my decision.  Good luck and I hope you find a second opinion you can trust. Thank you so much\u2764\ufe0f Because my grandma is 70 I just want to make sure she can get the covid vaccine as soon as it is available without interference from the doctor denying it for her or passing over her because of her GBS. Her doctor literally said \u201cI am not sure if she would be a candidate for the vaccine given her condition.\u201d My initial impulse reaction was \u201cNOT A CANDIDATE?! She is 70 and has other health issues\u201d after healthcare and essential workers I had assumed she would be first in line. So I just thought I would ask the community on what they have heard to make sure. I really appreciate your reply. I would definitely get a second opinion. The CDC has said folks who have/had GBS can safely receive the COVID vaccine.", "Diagnosed CIDP and starting IVIG next week My wife is a 32 year old female and was diagnosed with severe small fiber neuropathy and CIDP. Her neurologist is putting her on a treatment plan that would require intravenous immunoglobulin injections every 3 weeks for 18 months. He believes that her nerve damage can be reversed.\n\nWe plan on getting second opinion but just want to start treatment ASAP first. Is what he said reasonable? My wife feels like the nerve damage is getting worse everyday and everyone is just taking their time starting treatment. How soon after starting this treatment will she notice the progression stopping and her nerves regenerating? Hello, I have no medical background but have recovered from CIDP.\n\nI do not know what Small Fibre Neuropathy is so I cannot speak for that either.\n\nWhen I finally started to begin treatment for CIDP my nerve damage was progressing further and further. I was put on corticosteroids as the first line of treatment which made no difference in halting or reversing the progression.\n\nWhen my treatment changed to IVIG it was on a very similar programme to what your wife has been put on. I swear to this day it is like a miracle drug. I received a round of IVIG approx. every 3-4 weeks for 1 year. After a couple of months there was a huge noticeable difference, my mobility was still very much disabled, but things were getting better and easier. I was regaining feeling, strength and stability.\n\nHaving CIDP is a long road so it is a bit hazy, but I know that after a year, I said I was finished with IVIG because I was physically ready to be independent again. I voluntarily took myself off it, and for the next 3 years I walked with a slight wobble and suffered from general fatigue and tiredness, other than that I was cured.\n\nIt is possible, though, if I had carried on with the treatment for a few months like the doctors wanted me to, maybe that stagger would have totally gone and I would have been cured much quicker.\n\nSo In my opinion, it is reasonable what the doctor has suggested to you, a 3-4 week wait may seem odd but it definitely worked for me, there is a purposeful reason why it is spaced out like that.\n\nI have made a full recovery in mobility and the IVIG treatment is ultimately what saved me. To clarify I no longer have that stagger or any symptoms now. It is definitely worth noting though that this syndrome affects people so differently. My experience may be different to others. Best of luck. Went through the treatment for CIDP. It took me 8 months just to get diagnosed, then it took 1 month to find out I wasnt even compatible with IVIG and switched to SUBQ instead which is a weekly process instead of every 3 weeks for 6 months (6 months is what I was prescribed\u2026many have longer depending on the severity of their condition). \n\nIt does take a while to get it kicked off since the medication is expensive and insurance companies do not like paying for it without the proper documentation.\n\nAs for how soon does it work? It really depends on the person. I went through the first 1-2 months thinking it didnt do anything. It was the 4th month when I started feeling differences. I still have some issues (whenever the weather gets bad) but I feel much better compared to the beginning. Hi there! I was also diagnosed with CIDP 4 years ago when I was 13, and my first treatment was also IVIG. I took 2 injections every month for about a year, before switching to a corticosteroid called Prednisolone due to the injections interfering with school. Currently im on an immunosuppressant because I recovered enough to the point where I could slow down the recovery process, so that I could take a drug that didnt have so many side effects. (Prednisolone causes moon face, excess water retention). In my experience, IVIG was the most effective treatment out of all my 3 treatments. I saw almost immediate improvments in my mobility and balance a few weeks after my first treatment, and overall I improved more in the year on IVIG, than the 3 years on the corticosteroid or immunosuppressant. It does take time and there can be side effects from IVIG.  I continued going downhill the first 7 of 10 days intensive care IVIg, but then things turned around and the numbness start receding. I got out of the hospital,  did IVIg for 7 years, then SubQ for 8 years. Most motor functions have returned BUT cranial nerves, small fiber nerves and autonomic nerves haves not made much progress in 16 years. Treatments have surely progressed since then so I encourage you to keep a binder of test results, symptoms, treatments etc. to have on hand.  Good luck, I feel for you both.  I was 40 and in the best shape of my life when CIDP smacked me down. I was diagnosed with GBS in October and started IVIG in February. Personally, I did not see any difference until the 4th-5th month of treatment. I always felt exhausted right after treatment but I did not feel like anything had changed. I do feel like if I started treatment earlier, I might have recovered faster, but I am not sure. I think that the time it takes to see change is different for everyone but it definitely took a few rounds for me. If you found a Neuro that is capable of making that diagnosis a second opinion may not be necessary but by all means do so.  If it is small fiber that a good thing  and I presume a nerve biopsy was done to make that diagnosis?\n\nI agree starting IVIg immediately is a smart thing to do but forget the 18mo thing as their is NO way to predict how her body will respond and how quickly.  It may be that is was just that got Insurance auth for 18mo.  I have had no real side effects other than I learned to space out a day or two between infusions otherwise I am so wiped out I will sleep for 2 days after...  These treatments are very expensive so getting the Insurance company on board can be challenging and that may be causing delays.  Also I have experienced some supply chain issues that have made me have to wait an extra week that is no fun, but that may also contribute to delays for her.  I was diagnosed on a Thursday and started IVIg on the next Tuesday, but that was 2 years ago.  Also, remember she is probably dealing with a great deal of anxiety as I know I was and that amplified the issue.\n\nAs others have stated, everyone is different so zero way to predict when improvement will happen.  I started in a chair and can now walk mostly unassisted.  So are things better for me, sure but I have permanent damage and have my peace with that.  Sounds like she has everything going for her.\n\nClassic disclaimer, I am not a Dr just a guy who waited way to long wasting time with the wrong doc's while the CIDP got worse.\n\nLet her know an Internet stranger is thinking about her. I am 33f diagnosed last year. Feel free to reach out to me for any help. Its great your wife got a diagnosis and the treatment plan of ivig every 3-4 weeks is the gold standard. She is young and the nerves will heal with the right treatment. I responded well to the ivig and saw improvements after 2-3 weeks. I get ivig only once every 3 months as my disease activity is low coz of some diet and lifestyle changes I made. \n\nI am back to being active, running and lifting weights. Leading a normal life. At my worst I was having issues with balance while walking and could not run at all. I have some minor tingling once in a while which is annoying but I refuse to take any medication for that. I will be getting off the ivig soon as I believe in natural healing. IVIG is the go to treatment. \n\nMy only concern is for a new case, I would hit it harder (infusions) and more frequently (a week of daily infusions) up front. That three week injection approach is more commonly seen when you are more or less in maintenance mode.", "You could currently be living with a permanent and constant physical illness but never know it because you think the way you always feel is normal.  This happened to me. I lived with increasingly numb toes, then feet, then legs for months. But I was busy working 2 jobs 6 days a week. I powered through that. Until I started to fall, a lot. Not pretty. I got pretty banged up before I saw a doctor.  I think it was falling into the brandy aisle at the store I managed that got my attention.  Glass and booze everywhere!  Luckily my doc knew something was up, sent me to a neurologist,  who, in fairly short order got an EMG  and spinal tap and after dozens, it seemed,  of other tests, and determined I had CIDP. .  My second EMG last week, after 6 months of ivig, showed improvement...so I am hopeful.  Do not give up hope! So true for me. I had GBS when I was 5, so all I know is life with residual pain and weakness. Until I was in my 30s, I thought that was normal!", "Face/mouth strength exercise help Just as a backstory, in 2011 I got GBS at 9 years old. I could no longer walk and the left side of my face was paralysed which left me in hospital for 2 months. I am now 18 years old in 2021 and I have pretty much been fully recovered for the past 9 years, except I noticed that when I blink the left side of my mouth does a little twitch. Also when I smile, it is not symmetrical as my left side of my mouth droops down a little bit. Some people have pointed this out to me and I was wondering if anyone has experienced this and if they have any exercises which I can do to help rebuild the strength on the left side of my mouth? Cheers Have you seen a speech therapist? Mine was really great. My left eye still does not close as tight, but the rest of my face has improved a lot No I have not but I will consider this. Thank you I had GBS in 2009 when I was 13 and right now when I smile my cheeks still tremor, not sure if it ever will go away but let me know if you find of anything that helps", "A cornucopia of autoimmune fuc*ery after GBS Ok, that is a bit of an exaggeration. Hello, all. I had Miller Fisher which progressed to full blown GBS 10 years ago. Pretty severe, long recovery. \n\n\nThey (I do not know who they are) say that if you have one autoimmune disease you have a higher chance of being diagnosed with another one. \n\nWho has been diagnosed with an additional AI disease or had one previous to the GBS? \n\n\nI will start. Today I learned that I have lupus. \n\n\n\nI told my doctor that ^ but she disagreed. I have heard that too.  I have seen yes &amp; I have seen no.  \n\nI had GB 32 years ago at 18.  10 years after that I started having joint &amp; back pain.  Eventually I was diagnosed as having the auto immune disease psoriatic arthritis.  \n\nBoth my grandfathers ended up with type 1 diabetes in their middle age &amp; I believe that my dad had a psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis &amp; my brother has ankylosing spondylitis.  So I think my family just has immune systems that just high. This is interesting. One of my best friends had PA and it is horrible. Scars from it everywhere on his skin . Hate that you deal with that. \n\nI guess it is a chicken or egg scenario. Yeah, your family\u2019s immune systems hate you all! I have CIDP and chronic inflammatory response syndrome. Do you ever do IVIG infusions? I have not heard of CIRS. Is at all similar to rheumatoid? Probably more widespread? I am on IVIG 2 days in a row once every three weeks. Yes it is widespread. I am on 20+ other supplements and medications to try to manage it. My skin has always been pretty good in that I do not have what we think if as psoriasis.  I just had weird skin issues &amp; patches &amp; things &amp; I can think of a few times in my life that I had something I would call psoriasis that would be brought on by stress.  It all pretty much cleared up once I was on meds.  Other than my scalp, lol I have an unspecified connective tissue disorder that is likely linked to a type of rheumatism. We are still doing panels. I am currently in the hospital for GBS , and the doctors suspect I have an underlying immune disorder. It would not surprise me if GBS occurs more often when there is already an issue. Or, maybe GBS can cause the immune reaction to trigger an autoimmune issue?\nMakes sense to me. \nBest of luck and I hope you get really good treatment! I had autoimmune hemolytic anemia when I was 1. Was in the hospital for a year and it just went away. They think it was caused by the MMR vaccine. \n\nThis month actually marks my 2 year anniversary of being diagnosed with Miller Fisher. Was 23 at the time, and was diagnosed with AIDP initially in February but it got extremely severe. Paralysis from the neck down, breathing tube, the works. Do not know what caused that. \n\nThankfully I am like 80% good now. Still have some problems with strength, fatigue, and feeling.  But yeah TL;DR had two AIs about 22 years apart Upvote for the House quote alone.  :) My GBS was a one-off, at least so far. I have had mono several times - not autoimmune, but linked to GBS via epstein barr, so I have always found that interesting.\n\nAutoimmune-wise, I have a pretty terrible chronic (4+ years) rashish scar thing as a result of autoimmune issues (lichen planus). It is down to one arm (from each leg and both arms) but it is starting to spread again. Managed to stave off an offshoot in ears and around my eyes, thank fuck. I have CIDP and was recently diagnosed with narcolepsy, another incurable but managed AI. I looked up lichen planus because I would never heard of it. Reactions to metal fillings in teeth might trigger it? The human body is so fickle. You will be cruising along life and bam your body decides it hates something that is been there forever and declares all out war on your body. vitiligo and psoriasis over here", "In Rehabilitation from GBS My name is Mosun, over a year ago i was diagnosed with GBS and am currently in recovery. Hi, great to have you here, and hope this group will be of benefit during your journey to recovery. All the best Thanks Oluforbes, Great to be here. Just remember every recovery is a different path. Some people have relatively short recoveries and some take a little longer. But remember you will get better. Best of luck with your recovery, it took me 6 months to get my strength and mobility back to where it was before I was sick. I was intubated and the hospital for 1 month, had both IVIG and plasmapheresis, then was in a rehabilitation hospital for another month. I then had outpatient rehab as well as home care. Stay determined as you work on regaining your strength and keep doing the exercises and you will get there. Saying a prayer for you. Thank you Thank you Great to know you have a quicker recovery time. Were there any gyms that supported your type of therapy or were they a home regime?\n\nIf I may ask which country are you resident? Well said. I am in the US. My sisters contacted my health insurance provider to find out what was covered and which hospitals. When I was in the hospital, once the 2 GBS treatments were completed there and I began to regain feeling, I was transferred to Moss Rehab, an inpatient hospital near me. The first day there I began to relearn how to do everything, even hold and change a tv remote! I pushed hard thru all of the exercises. As soon as I was able to walk just a little bit, they released me. Then we found home health care, Bayada Nurses, who then came for a couple months to further the physical rehab. Finally, once back home, I went to a outpatient gym to get the last of my strength back. I used every single resource that was offered to me by my insurance, and I am forever grateful to my sisters who made sure I got to where I needed to be. \n\nAs I recovered and met others in a similar situation, I saw how fortunate I was for my sisters getting all the info. Many people linger for years because their insurance did not go above and beyond to help the, get what was needed. The gym was affiliated with another physical rehab company. Also, if you have not already, check out GBS-CIDP.org, an international organization that provides a wealth of information on all things GBS. Thank you for sharing your story and resource Will appreciate you share the name of physical rehab company and the affiliated gym which helped you with physical therapy Not aware of any such physical rehab companies in the UK I was discharged from a rehabilitation hospital to prioritize Covid patients. I was assigned physiotherapists to help with my rehabilitation but later told to register to a gym because they did not have the required equipments.", "My CIDP Story ", "How long was it before you could drive again? I know it varies for everyone. I am just curious when you were able to or felt comfortable driving again? \n\nI am almost eight months into recovery, and I am not there yet. For me it was about 1 year before i could drive a manual car again. That was about 6months after I was discharged from hospital. Much easier to drive an automatic.\nKeep going and good luck! It took me about 10 months (7 months post hospital) to where both me and my doc were comfortable with the idea of me driving again.     It was easy once I started too. Best wishes on your recovery! I went into the ICU on early February and came out of inpoatient rehab late April. I immediately entered outpatient rehab. One day in late June, I asked my wife (she drove) if I could drive. The problem was I could not yet feel my feet. She pulled into an empty parking lot and let me try. I could feel the pressure of the brake pedal enough to control the car. She still would not let me drive for about anothe month. So, for me, it was about 7 months until I was confident enough to drive alone. I wish you luck in your recovery! Keep a positive attitude - it really helps a lot! 4 months Same situation here. I still cannot 100% feel my feet. I am able to control the car. I am definitely not comfortable enough yet to drive in traffic. About 7 or 8 months for me. 6 months confined to a wheelchair, then a couple to get enough strength to walk again. At 7 months I began driving independently with hand controls. I used a transfer board then and it was harder to break down the chair. Now at 10 months, I am still using hand controls. The transfers and breaking apart the wheel chair is quick and easy. \n\nIt is been a long journey. I was able to drive with confidence once I began wearing AFOs. They changed my life. I would offer that if you are not feeling confident about how you operate your feet, think about seeking out a orthosist near you that fits and makes them. I have not  had issue with insurance paying for them.", "Anyone know if former GBS patients should be particularly concerned about Covid-19? Hey all,\n\nI contracted GBS after a bout of mono in Summer 2017. I have since made a full recovery and the only lingering effect is a somewhat stronger health anxiety.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea whether former GBS patients have an elevated risk to this coronavirus epidemic? Commenting for later info I have a son that just went to Thailand so I asked my neurologist about this. I am paraphrasing so bear with me.  We got an autoimmune disorder but that does not mean we have a compromised immune system.  AIDS, HIV, people undergoing cancer treatment that is an example of compromised immune system.  We are within the same risk factors as anyone else,  like age and general health.  However. We could have the genetic makeup that makes our bodies over react to a virus by turning it into auto immune. Allergies, eczema are a couple of examples of everyday autoimmune, your body working against itself.  That is how the discussion with my doctor went. I feel a little better after his explanation. If , God forbid, I am in a position where I am not well and go to a hospital or doctor, I am bringing all my medical records and you can be sure they are going to know I had GBS.  To answer your question, no I am not particularly concerned. Great response.  I think this covers everything I was going to say. Thanks. Thank you! What about people who recently went through immunotherapy? GBS (all auto immune disorder) patients are at a higher risk of a relapse, any time their immune system is compromised.    \n\nFor clarity: you are not at a higher risk to *get* corona virus/Covid-19, HOWEVER, if you do contract it, or any flu/anything that triggers an immune response, you have a significantly greater chance of kicking off GBS than one who has never had it. That being said, we now have bodywide nerve damage, which includes our nerves on organs like our lungs. When our nerves regrow, for some of us, they do not regrow as strongly - I experienced this when I had pneumonia recently and had to be hospitalized. The doctors were very confused - they had sent me home because they needed beds and I am young, but then a day later I was back in the ER needing oxygen and I explained that I had been on a respirator as a child due to GBS. They still shrugged it off until I passed out and (from what my husband says) all the alarms started blaring. Our residual effects are still very unknown because GBS studies are new and long-term studies are rare and not extensive.\n\nIn some ways, things are way better for us as GBS survivors because doctors now know about our issues - when I was younger, GPs had never heard of GBS. On the flip side, a little knowledge can be more dangerous than a lot of knowledge, and I have found doctors dismiss it as a potential issue because they are not aware of how it affects us long-term and do not include things like weakened nerves or residuals into their advice.\n\nI, personally, am concerned - I saw how pneumonia went for me. It should not have been as bad as it was, according to doctors, and their confusion over why it was bad (despite me repeatedly trying to explain residuals and GBS) meant that treatment was delayed because they were not listening. I nearly died. Does this apply for both chronic and acute forms of GBS?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that those who have had the acute form (acute inflammatory demyleinating polyneuropathy) usually dont have a reoccurence. I am not sure how long after diagnosis/recovery this would apply or how it would be affected by a new respiratory infection. Any thoughts welcome! Does this apply for both chronic and acute forms of GBS?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that those who have had the acute form (acute inflammatory demyleinating polyneuropathy) usually dont have a reoccurence. I am not sure how long after diagnosis/recovery this would apply or how it would be affected by a new respiratory infection. Any thoughts welcome! Honestly, this question might be going beyond my knowledge. My answer is that it is all \u201cacute\u201d until it happens with regularity. I would imagine that if your immune response consistently triggers GBS, then it is chronic. But, again, any time the immune response is triggered, GBS is a possibility. It is just a *greater* possibility in those that have already had GBS.    \n\nTo put it in completely pulled-out-of-nowhere and oversimplified numbers: the chance of having GBS is 1 in 1 million. The chance of a former GBS patient having GBS is 1 in 1 thousand. I am someone who has had GBS more than once. The first time was in December 2012 a few weeks after getting a flu/whooping cough vaccine. I had it again 6 weeks ago. I do not know what triggered it. I was not tested for Covid 19. From everything I have read, people who have had GBS are not more likely to contract Covid 19, but if they do get Covid, it can trigger GBS and make treatment much more complicated.", "Is this situation unusual? Currently in the hospital with GBS. On the 4th of Oct I started noticing some weird tingling but did not think much about it. By the 5th I could barely get out in the car to go to the ER. By the 6th I could not move my legs at all. Started plex and started to get facial issues and hand numbness with some fine motor function loss. By the 8th I started to get some movement back in my legs. Really bad reactions to plex so they switched me to IVIG on the 10th. By the 11th I could walk with a walker. Have my last scheduled IVIG today the 12th. From everything I have read this just seems way too fast from the degradation to the recovery phase. Anybody else have any similar experiences? I had numbness in my face day 1\nSlight stumbling day 2\nEnough stumbling to take me to hospital day 3\nIn hospital for 9 days, got ivig and started walking by day I left for home \n\nAs I had Miller fisher variety my main residual issue was double vision for around 5 months They have not mentioned any varieties to me. But this timeline seems very similar. Does age matter? I am 50. Age does matter. GBS is usually more prevalent as you age. \n\nHowever, I was 24 when I was diagnosed two years ago my degradation was even quicker. The first time I was admitted I had tingling in my face and a day or so later half my face was paralyzed. Then two days later it was completely paralyzed. And then I started having weakness. Was admitted for a week to the hospital for IVIG and felt much better.\n\nThe second time I was admitted I started feeling weak the first day, I could barely walk the second (my mom and wife had to essentially carry me into the ER), and the third day I was intubated and completely paralyzed. Was in the hospital for over a month the second time.\n\nIt can hit hard and quickly. I do not think it is unusual.  The speed and severity of the attack varies with each case.  Sounds like you caught it early and got yourself to the ER.  That was a great decision.  I am glad you did that.  \n\nThe good news for your recovery is that it sounds like you have got some solid physicians on the case who know what they are doing. I had a similar experience at 50. Arm and leg weakness that progressed quickly. It was thought to be GBS at first but after two hospital stays with two rounds of plex it came back again in two weeks after the last plex, so it turned out to be CIDP that returns every two weeks.  After the first plex, I was up after 2-3 days like nothing was wrong. Two weeks later, it was back again but the plex took longer, about four days, to get me at the same point as the first. Two weeks later and it is back again but it happened faster and harder, had to be carried to the ER. IVIG that time but I left the hospital in bad shape and it took the IVIG a while to do it is job which was a little over a month before I could fully walk again. Now I get IVIG every two weeks and it keeps the CIDP at bay. It is fast, but you got treatment quickly. Most people do not because it takes a while to diagnose since they do not go to the ER immediately. Immunglobin worked for me similarly. I did not fully recover, but I could walk right away after the medication. Full recovery depends a lot on how old you are. I was in my late 40s when I got it and that did not help. So here is my story,  for comparison. I am a 41 yrs old male from Mumbai India.  I weigh 125kgs but am a regular bicyclist. Its been about 1.75 months since first GBS symptoms, and I am almost back to normal.\n\nDay 1:  Achy legs in the evening, like when you get a fever. But no fever.\n\nDay 2: Feeling weakness in legs,  pain  in calves while walking. Some weakness in hands also. Checked BP, Sugar, Heart Rate all normal.\n\nDay 3: Difficult to walk, very painful. Unable to walk except short distances. Difficulty standing up from a sitting position. Unable to spread my fingers or even turn on a tap.\n\nDay 4: Cannot get up from a sitting position. Cannot hold cutlery . Head to the emergency department of nearby hospital in evening. Doctors diagnosed GBS after dinner tests and sent me to ICU and started ivig at 2am\n\nDay 5: No change in condition. Still in ICU on IVIG. Doctors say if no deterioration its good news.\n\nDay 6-9: still in n ICU. Mobilized by Physiotherapist in ICU. Able to take a few steps but very unstable.\n\nDay 10: Able to walk for short distances unaided. Able to stand up from sitting position ( which means I can independently go to the loo). Discharged from hospital.\n\nDay 11-20: Steady improvement with physiotherapy at home. still painful to walk but increasingly independent. Could drive  car by day 17. \n\n\nDay 30: Resumed work. Able to walk, bicycle and climb stairs, but weaker than before and less stamina.\n\nDay 50(today): Almost back to normal. Working on endurance on my bicycle. Physiotherapy twice a week. Working full time. Sometimes get cramps in one leg just before my wake up time.\n\n\nI did not get any altered sensations so my GBS was focused on motor nerves only. I had/have mild ache with a warm sensation in recovery phase, but not strong enough to require pain meds. That I do. Lots of smart people helping me out.\n\nEdit: I cannot spell. Thanks as this is the kind of info I am looking for. How is your vision? I think the basic difference is that classic GBS starts at your feet and moves upwards, whereas Miller Fisher starts at the face and moves down.\n\nI am middle aged. I believe the younger you are the faster you can recover. It is a scary disease but the way I think of it, it is the best case scenario out of many possibilities given that we can recover 100% in nearly all cases. Started in my feet and legs. Never really moved up except for my fingers being tingly and some weird Bell\u2019s Palsy like symptoms (one side of my face sorta quit working). Mouth not working right, eyebrow and eyelid not working bilaterally similar. So my right eye is a little dry because I cannot blink right but not vision problems. No double vision or anything. Great job going early. Mine was the same, I started getting better but then I got pneumonia and it was downhill from there. Good luck OP Not being able walk is scary \ud83d\ude00 Good luck with it mate just remember as hard as it is, most people recover 100%, so push through Thank you so much!! That is the plan. It is. Super scary. I could not walk for a couple months. Wheelchairs were awesome sometimes though. Luckily I am recovering pretty quickly. I am able to move about in a walker. Now I do look like a newborn horse trying to figure out how is legs work for the first time, but I am slightly ambulatory. It is an individual thing. Different for everyone.", "Has anyone looked into alternative treatments such as psychedelics? Just wanted to ask if there are any other treatments or information such as?( I have not, and I do not think it would help me. I cannot see how that could work. Some say they could help regrow cells damaged by the disease.\n\n TNFa plays a big part in GBS, and psilocybin is a strong TNFa blocker. \n\nIt is a unique treatment, because it can actually cross the blood brain barrier while other TNF blockers cannot.\n\nThe ant-inflammatory effects are strongest within a week of dosing, so this guy was pretty smart to continue dosing until the symptoms relented.\n\n LSD helped me walk again. I would not knock it until you try it. Glad to hear that! It is actually for my 77 year old mom that is why I am doing as much research as I can. I was thinking mushrooms but would you mind sharing your story with how LSD helped you? Hmm, that very interesting to me about TNF blocking in general, thank you for sharing.  \n\nI (51F) had GBS in 1989 as an 18 year old after exposure to the flu &amp; was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis about 5 years ago after 15-20 years of symptoms.  I have been on TNF blocking biologics for the 5 years.  Not sure which exact TNF type blocker each is though but still very interesting to me.\n\nI have been very interested in looking into psilocybins for both microdosing &amp; casual use so this is super interesting to me. It is important to note that the TNF blockers on the market do not cross the blood brain barrier. The molecules are too big. They can only effect peripheral tissue.It might even be dangerous for demylelinating diseases if they did, because there are several types of TNF. Some types play a protective role in the CNS, so introducing a broad spectrum (non selective) TNF blocker could actually be harmful.\n\nPsilocybin does not have that risk. It works very precisely.  I will have to do some reading, it sounds very interesting so thank you for the added information.  \n\nI should add I was not advocating for using TNF blockers for GBS but more just general interest for me at being surprised by the TNF connection having had GBS &amp; now having PsA &amp; using a TNF blocker.  \n\nMy original rheumatologist &amp; I had a long conversation about the possibility of Humira (but I would imagine all TNF blocker biologics) being a risk factor for getting GBS.  The number seemed low, like incredibly low &amp; having had GBS at that time 25 years earlier I guess I am not as concerned as someone who is just recently had it.  I have a few lingering effects from GBS but time has really blunted them in my mind &amp; I have lived longer with them then I did without so it is my normal &amp; I do not really think about it. My mom is experiencing a GBS relapse and will try to see if she is will to try microdosing mushrooms. I have started growing this year as it can get expensive to buy. Just keep in mind that no significant study has been done on micro dosing. Also, micro dosing daily can be dangerous for the heart. It has a similar effect to fen-phen, which was pulled off the market for causing heart valve damage.\n\nIt is better and safer to do larger doses, but less often. The anti-inflammatory effects of psilocybin are strongest for about a week after the dose, so a once a week mini dose would probably be better. Thanks you. I will be sure to keep that in mind. Relapse is my worst nightmare. Seriously, I have had that naked at work/school nightmare a few times recently and have gone \"huh?\" in my dream and moved on.\n\nI have made a few people promise to kill me if it happens again like it did. Uneducated response here. From a semi-regular substance user.\nI suspect all the physical responses are only provable in a lab in doses too high and too specific/targeted to recreate in the real world. \n\nHowever, most psychedelics have the ability to create a plasticity in your brain. And allow new pathways.  \n\nWith the right doses at the right stages, you will definitely be able to break through the pathways and blocks created during your GBS. \n\nPlus as a casual user, in the right settings it is an amazing experience. I was completely paralysed, on ventilation, had double dose of ivig and went blind in one eye from GBS. 5/2019.\nWas told I would be in a wheelchair for life but I am walking. I have been using a mix of magic mushrooms and lions mane and am recovering well beyond doctors expectations. I asked about lionsmane in ICU and was told it is nonsense but I have not touched any of the prescriptions since 11/2019 when I left care. Just marijuana and the mushroom mix. If anybody wants more info feel free to message. Worth looking into a mix with lionsmane which is affordable and readily available I do not know how alternative this is, but I had a doctor put me on low dose naltrexone and I think it really helped. ", "Has anyone suffered from permanent muscular atrophy/wasting from GBS? I had a minor form of  GBS back in December 2009 ( I was 13 years old) , despite being almost 11 years since this happened, I have muscular wasting on my arms (wrist area) and calves which I was never able to recover despite exercising, going to the gym, physiotherapist, etc. Alongside the wasting I have minor tingling sensations and slight weakness, which do not really annoy as much as the wasting to the point where I avoid wearing short pants for example.\n\nFrom the majority of testimonies I have checked most people did recover their muscle mass  after a few months, I am curious if someone else has had a similar experience to me.\n\nGBS was minor in my case, I was only hospitalized for 2 days (only my feet/lower leg area was paralyzed) and I believe I was able to slowly walk in a matter of 2 weeks after I left the hospital. Despite how minor it was in my case compared to others, I probably will carry with me all these collateral effects that I explained above for the rest of my life. Thankfully, this has not prevented me from doing sports I like and other activity. \n\nBe safe and best wishes to everyone who is going through this disease or a similar right now. I have had GBS twice- the first time in 2007, when I was 9 and the second time in 2017, when I was 19. The first time was pretty serious, my folks had no clue what it was and medical science was not quite as advanced back then where I am from, so it took the doctors a while to figure it out. I was in the hospital for about  two weeks, and it took me almost a year to get back on my feet. I went through extensive physiotherapy and never noticed any difference in my abilities.\nI was rather prepared the second time, despite the fact that it came as a shock and baffled the doctors. I was in the hospital for about 8 days, and was back on my feet in around 2 months, which was counted as a quick recovery. However, this time I believe GBS left some long lasting effects. I often have painful muscle spasms in my hands and feet, and I have developed a chronic hand tremor. Apart from these minor impediments, I have been able to carry out my day to day activities without any issues. My doctors say that these issues will typically resolve themselves in a few years, and I am banking on that! Thank you for sharing. I hope indeed the issues you are carrying fade away promptly. I am 2 years out and continue to lose muscle mass. Have you tried asking your doctor if it is normal? I visited a neurologist like 4 years ago who told me due to the GBS I had (I had a very strong diarrhea 1 week before due to bacterial infection ), it was normal to still have these effects a few years later on, but told me I eventually was going to make full recovery alongside regain of muscular volume. He also performed electromyography and sent me some Arginine supplementation to help with the recovery, but I honestly have not felt any improvement at all, so throughout the years I just tried to get over and live with it daily.\n\nIn my case I noticed that my muscular mass was pretty much gone like 3 years after GBS... even though in those 3 years time frame I was already able to exercise and play sports, etc. It may have to do with some nerve damage that probably does not recover at full. Have you brought it up with any doctor recently? It is worth checking out. They may be able to see if something else is wrong or help you try to gain it back? I have not however I do think it is time to recheck with another physician. In your case you have only lost muscle mass since GB went away with no signs of regaining it back? I wonder if it is a similar scenario to mine I am in a weird place. I am 2 years out since diagnosis. I cannot tell if how my body is now is just the way it is going to be (I am not anywhere near the physical capabilities I had before this), or if there is going to be more growth. I have been at a wall since April of this year. I have noticed the muscle loss most in this time. For myself, I have recently (this last week) sought a second opinion. I felt I needed another doctor to look things over and make sure I was indeed heading in the right direction. I could not recommend it enough. I have learned more about all of this from this doctor than I did in 2 years with the other one. He ran a bunch of tests to get a new baseline and compare them to the ones I had in the hospital 2 years ago. So right now I am just waiting on the results to get back and go to the follow up to discuss it with him. He was happy to review the case and had treated others with GBS/CIDP. I am not sure if this helps. I am surprised by your condition as you had it for such a short time. My wife\u2019s condition the first symptom was muscle wasting below the knee and foot drop due to enlargement of the sciatic nerve. And it kept getting worse. There is still no diagnosis so we are now starting IVIG (today is day 1). It is been about 2 years since her muscle wasting started and now it is at a level where the latest MRI showed that her muscles has been replaced by fats and that even if her sciatic nerve condition improves her leg will not. We are hoping that atleast it will stop it from getting worse. I would be surprised your muscles would be replaced by fat in such a short time. Sorry for the late reply I have had some busy days. I appreciate that you have shared your journey with this disease, hope your recent tests do show improvement over the last ones. Unfortunately since I was a child I was not as self conscious of my physical status at the time I suffered from GB, but I remember that I noticed the muscle wasting 2 years after I had the disease since I had a school class mate who told me \"wtf had happened to my legs\" and then I realized they were definitely out of proportion with the rest of my body, it is strange as I feel my forehands/wrist were also affected by this kind of wasting , even though I do not recall issues with my arms when I had GBS. At this point its probably worth it to recheck with a physician and see what the options are.", "Vitamin B6 and Neuropathy Hey all, just found this awesome community!\n\nMy dad was diagnosed with CIDP a few months ago, after dealing with some painful neuropathy and debilitating muscle loss and movement difficulties. We have gotten several opinions from doctors, but recently got another batch of tests back.\n\nApparently his b6 levels were super high as a result of taking a daily multivitamin, which apparently is toxic to your nerves in high doses. The vitamins were actually making the neuropathy much worse! It is surprising because most people myself included look at vitamins as something that can only help. So of course he is stopping taking b6 and b12 which is also causing some issues.\n\nI am just curious, has anyone else had this experience with b6 and neuropathy? Or has anyone else discovered something they thought was helping but was making their Guillain Barre or CIDP worse? \n\nI would love to hear some more experiences/advice/input from the community about this! I actually developed a B6 deficiency in May. It caused something called a Pellagra. I was admitted into the hospital with people thinking that it was an infection or something of that sort. This was a few months before I was diagnosed with CIDP. They were still running tests at this point. It is definitely important for people like us to have regular vitamin level tests because I run low due to malabsorption. I had this problem too! I used to take a b-100, but I was never regular about it. I finally got serious and at my next check up I did worse on the basic Neuro tests. Dr asked, I mentioned the B and he did a blood test and I had too much. I did not think it could possibly have a negative effect. I went back to my normal after stopping. I still take a multi that has B. That is ok for me.  Wow that is really cool to hear that you stopped experiencing issues after heavy vitamin b6 intake, I certainly hope my dad sees similar results. Thanks for the response! That is really good to know, I think vitamin level tests will be a new norm for us going forward. Thanks for sharing your experience I was mistaken, my deficiency was in the B3, niacin vitamin. It is still extremely important to have all of your vitamin levels checked. My D level and vitamin 12 levels, and sodium stay low as well to where I have to take daily meds including shots monthly. I am a past RN that can no longer work. It is very frustrating to know everything that is wrong with me and how to fix it, and not be able to fix it at the same time. Does anyone know how to post pictures? I believe you need to post a link to an external site such as Imgur Ok? To be able to post pics? Yea, I have never done so but if you post an image on imgur then post the link to it in a comment then people can see it Thanks!  Oh man that looks super rough. It is insane how that could be caused from just a deficiency in niacin. Definitely hope you are recovering from that and doing better.\n\nAlso, I definitely connect to your frustration in a previous comment about knowing what is wrong but not being able to fix it. That may be the worst part about the disease. Just keep on pushin, you always have support here I have recovered from that. It is amazing though, being an RN, and not being able to do anything about my own condition is very humbling and depressing. I have a husband who is amazing, he is a paramedic. He actually lost his vision due to bilateral retinal detachment. That was last January. As he was recovering I was declining. I lost my first husband at age 36 while I was in my LPN year he died of a heart attack in front of me in 2010. I also have a 17-year-old son who is on the autism spectrum. He does online school and is absolutely amazing. We are actually moved in to our parents houses more than a year ago to save money to buy our own home. Then all this started last December with me taking a leave of absence due to the numbness creeping slowly at my legs and the critical low white blood count. We were thinking leukemia..something cancerous, I also had OB examination that showed a mass in my uterus. I had so many things going on, I did not even know where to begin with my issues. My neurologist suspected CIDP and ordered a spinal tap. The test showed elevated protein and elevated B6. He said stop taking B6 supplements. I told him I was not taking any. As it turned out, my Vitamin Water Zero had 100% of daily B6 in each bottle, and my BodyArmor water had 200% per bottle. I used these drinks for hydration and potassium (trying to get the recommended 4700mg of potassium per day)*. I averaged two bottles of each every day, getting 600% of my B6! I had never paid attention to the B6 in the stuff, and would not have known that too much was a bad thing. I quit drinking the stuff, and have no idea if I would caused myself permanent nerve damage (Doc said there is no way to tell for sure). He did diagnose CIDP but that is a post for another day.\n\n*The good news? All my blood tests showed adequate potassium.  I do not know of a way to post a pic on reddit directly into a comment. Wow that is super interesting, thanks for sharing. I woulda never thought vitamin water had that much of your daily value in vitamins. How long ago was this discovery if you do not mind me asking? Did you notice any improvements after reducing b6 intake? When you submit, select image under submission type and there is an option to upload in app to imgur.", "Mods and suggestions welcome!

Recovering from spinal tap now :) I now insist they pull in a radiologist to do a spinal tap. He throws me on the table and uses the picture to do the spinal. So easy compared to the \"digging around\" regular doctors do. You might ask if it happens again (never hurts to ask). You take care. Oh thanks for that tip. I had insurance issues so I went to a teaching hospital. It took 3 rounds (numbing shots wore off) before he could poke properly. It was like an hour with shooting pain every time he poked nerves instead. Definitely will ask for radiology next time.", "Feet vibrating for about a month Hi there. I had GBS in 2017 and have been having what I consider to be symptoms of a relapse. I have been to the ER like 3 or 4 times in the last few weeks due to bad panic attacks and fear of relapse.\n\nI have been having a vibrating feeling in my feet on and off for about a month, and also tingling in my fingertips. Along with that I have had numbness/pain in my feet.\n\nNow I definitely did have lasting nerve damage but I guess the reason I got scared all over again was because it seemed like it had stopped completely or almost completely, then a month after a September cold went away it came back. I might just be tripping because I have pretty bad anxiety. But, in my head that is how it seems. My strength and balance is fine, though sometimes my legs feel a little shaky, but that could be cause I am an anxious mess lately.\n\nMy PCP said they do not think I need a spinal tap as they do not think it is coming back, but boy am I scared. It is been an all consuming thought everyday for the last few months. I am terrified.\n\nAnyone know what symptoms to look out for or know if they are on/off? When I got it the first time it came on pretty suddenly. Was in the bathroom at the hospital due to another illness, suddenly fell and could not get back up. So I did not start off with tingling/numbness the first time.\n\nI am trying to keep my anxiety under control but every feeling is scaring me.. and raising my blood pressure which also is not good lol.\n\nI had what my doctor today said may have been a URI that lasted maybe a week and went away about 4/5 days ago. So, besides my cold I am scared all over again because of that. It was just right side chest irritation and mucus coming up, but still. And every time I go outside I have throat irritation/running nose for maybe the rest of the day and then I am fine. But, that is also scarring me. Ugh. Maybe that is just allergies though.\n\nDoctor seems to be confident stuff is good, but who knows. Guess I am just venting here and asking......\n\nJust looking for some other POVs and experiences. I hope you are all well. \u2764\ufe0f", "How do you mentally handle the long recovery? Full disclosure. I do not have GB. I have another neurological issue, cerebellitis. I have had it for nine months now and am still not better. It has made me unable to walk and is scaring the crap out of me.\n\nMy issue is really rare so I cannot find a community of people who had something similar. But I know GB is another neurological issue that takes a long time.\n\nHow do you stay sane? I am so anxious and depressed. I long for recovery. Just looking for some support. Thanks When I was diagnosed with CIDP I was scared, angry, tired, and in a lot of pain. I had been very depressed previously (I have pretty severe depression), so, honestly, I did not notice the difference in my mood, except the wanting to die was more extreme. The constant treatments kept my mind off things for a while. I was not in therapy then, and I got this pre-internet, so I felt very alone. I tried to join some MS groups, but they would not have me.   \n\n\nI read a lot. I watched a lot of TV. I worked when I was not in the hospital, and because I could no longer walk well, it would take me a long time to get home. My time was very filled, and I think that helped.   \n\n\nI got CIDP in September of 94, and I did not start to see any improvement until May 95. And it took 2 years until I finally stopped falling all the time. No one understood what I was going through (and my boss thought I was faking!), but my doctor was the absolute best, so I knew I was in good hands. I try not to deny how i feel. If I am sad/angry/jealous/stressed-I feel it. Stuffing it inside just makes things worse. BUT, then I tell myself it is time to move on from that feeling. Sometimes I do a mental pep talk (\u201cyou can do this, you are strong\u201d), sometimes it is making a gratitude list (mental or handwritten), and sometimes I need to vent to a friend or online support group. \n\nAll I know is feeling my emotions in the moment is important, but then I quickly need to move forward. I hope you find something that works for you. Trial and error, just do not give up! Good luck on your journey. Were you ever scared that you would never recover? I was diagnosed almost 6 years ago and recovered over the course of a few months. There is still residual numbness in my legs/feet and I cannot feel hot or cold sensations well. When I was first diagnosed I was originally told that I had multiple sclerosis or brain tumors. Being 16 at the time and hearing that I just assumed I was going to die and accepted it. Eventually I was properly diagnosed after 6 consecutive lumbar punctures about a week or two while in the hospital. After finding out what I actually had I just tried my best to remain positive and do one more thing independently each day. It is just as much of a mental battle as it is a physical one. I got into word games and sudoku to try to keep my mind sharp when my body was not. If I am being honest, I cannot or try not to remember much about that time in my life. Stay strong dude and try to remain as positive as you can, your mindset is so important on the road to recovery. You can do this and are always welcomed here I wish you the best of luck! Yeah, of course. My doctor was confident I would, tho. At least my good one was. My second neurologist was not so sure. Wow, my neurologist will not promise me anything although he said odds were in my favor. I thought doctors did not make confident claims like that to their patients. I am scared and the lengthy recovery time is not helping. My doctor was the expert in CIDP at the time. He of course was vague about the future with regard to relapses, but he was very confident I would recover to at least 80%. My initial recovery was almost 100 after 2 yrs, but I have relapsed a bunch, and I have been on steroids the whole time. \n\nI was lucky\u2014I know that. Although stats say most people recover, I know plenty who need AFOs or walkers.  Just assume you will be one of the ones that recover. \n\nI have had this for like 20 yrs now. And each relapse I recover less. I cannot run any more, but I really hated running. I could never rollerblade or skateboard. You adjust. It takes a while. You find new things. I used to like to play guitar, but my fingers are messed up. But I can play ukulele, and it is so much fun. \n\nI loved going to see bands, so that first year was tough because I was not able to deal with standing in a crowd. At various points I have been better, so I do not let opportunities pass me by as much as I used to. How was he so confident?\n\nI have clean MRIs and am making progress. But when I google my issue I am long past the usual recovery times, which scares me. Was your progress steady? I find that progress is really nonlinear for me My progress was not steady at all. I would get better and worse, or I would get new symptoms. I was stuck at like 60% better for a long time, and then completely relapsed. That was hard. That Neuro was very jovial, though. I was sad when he retired. \n\nMy recovery was neither typical nor atypical, but the regular treatment (IVIG) did not help me by itself, so I can relate to you being concerned about your progress being slow. It was quite a while before I found a neurologist who was willing to try different things. \n\nNeurological crap is scary. It is ok to feel anxious and depressed about it. I would be concerned if you were not! 3 years in, and having gone through another mental roller coaster more recently, I am much stronger today both physically and mentally than I was in all the past three years.\n\nI know this may sound superficial or pessimistic, but optimistically I have finally learned how to surrender to the fact that I have little to no control over anything in life.  After coming to that conclusion, anytime sh*t happens or I am having a physically weak day, my mind is now re-wired to just shrug it off and not fight it.  The added bonus is that I found out I have more energy because I am not expending it on fighting.  \n\nThe word surrender really sticks out for me to stop trying to figure it out and helps to live in the moment (ie: family or friends visiting you, having a meal, reading a good book, etc.).  My best wishes to you, and for us to remind ourselves that we are survivors! 26F diagnosed with GBS 9/19. There are 3 things that keep me sane: travel, art, and exercise. I have had to adjust how to continue enjoying these things but when I make the effort to push through, I feel infinitely better. \n\nBefore GBS, I was planning a trip to Florence. Since I cannot go at this time, I am learning Italian with an audiobook when my vision is too blurry to read. \n\nOn the days I cannot control my hands to paint, I will read art books. Or I will ask someone to take me to the museum (they have wheelchairs). \n\nAs for exercise, I started small: gentle aqua in the therapy pool; aqua fitness and aqua Zumba; and now I can swim a few laps. When I am in the water, I no longer feel sick.\n\nAnd therapy, therapy, therapy. Finding a good psychologist saved my life.\n\nFind something that makes you happy and forget your troubles for just for a moment. I am incredibly lucky to live close to my family so they are able to drive me places but on days they cannot, I take the bus or an Uber and even that builds my confidence.", "Finally discharged from hospital!

Just jot the first of two jabs yesterday.  \n\nThe funny part?  walking home from the clinic, I kept asking myself \"do my legs feel weak?\"  The brain is a powerful drug, and I guess my entire life I will watch for symptoms like that again.  But so far, so good.  Not even a fever today, which is one of the more common side effects. Fingers crossed! Hope the vaccine works well for you. Hope it works with no weird side effects, please keep us updated. so far all good.  No fever, no aches.  I go for the second stage in 3 weeks Are you in Argentina? Thanks for sharing! How are you doing? Do you feel you like communism a little bit more? (Somebody had to tell that joke) I was a socialist even before the jab. ;). I keep hoping I will learn to speak Russian as a side effect though!", "Post Covid Strange symptoms Hey guys I am about 30 days post Covid did for GBS, I know it is quite rare however I am having strange neurological symptoms now.\n\nWhile at rest, not actively moving, I have nonstop muscle twitching\n\nI seem to be weaker on my left hand while holding my cell phone almost shaky, and I will have random zaps almost like burning but not often at all\n\nI do not feel weak per se or tingly, I do not think in fact I did a leg workout yesterday and it seemed OK, however I am not sure if it is progressing and I should get a test\n\nHow did you progress? How did it start? How hard is it to get diagnosed? You should try to see a doctor. I know they are kind of overwhelmed with COVID, but try to see your Dr or neurologist. It is always better to ask a medical professional, as we cannot diagnose you here. \n\nTo clarify, have you been diagnosed with GBS? Or you are concerned that you have it?\n\nI started with tingling (like pins and needles, like when your hand falls asleep) in both fingers and toes, which progressed up my hands and feet into my arms and legs. Weakness, difficulty walking and then inability to stand. I lost my sense of taste also. But this was in 2017, way before COVID, and my symptoms came on 5 days before I was hospitalized. Hi! I was not diagnosed, but I know viral\nInduced GBS is possible with Covid.\n\nI have got bad health anxiety so it is not fun..\n\nMy onset was 11/14 of Covid. Since recovered...all except for muscle twitches all over my body.\n\nI would not say I have \u201cweakness\u201d but I do noticed a reduced ability to hold my grip and almost like a tight neck feeling.\n\nI do not know if GBS would present this late last the acute stage of a virus though.\n\nYours came out of nowhere? \n\nI am so sorry you had to go through this. This does not sound like GBS to me but could be another neurological condition, or something related to the Covid. A neurologist can do testing to rule various conditions out. I had a fever for a week or so before my symptoms started, but that was it. The hospital diagnosed me with \"viral syndrome\" as the cause of GBS. I took a nap one day, woke up with the tingles and 5 days later was being intubated in the ER. \n\nBest case is definitely to talk to your doctor. You can even ask them about GBS, they will let you know what they think. Nerve conduction test or lumbar puncture to check protein in the CSF is how it is officially diagnosed. I had my LP while intubated. Be on the lookout for rising, bilateral tingling/weakness/numbness starting at the toes. Those are many of the symptoms that led to my CIDP.  It does not mean you have it but it is worth seeing a Neurologist, there are non-invasive tests the can run to see if you have nerve damage.  I call them the \"needle and the taser\", if they do not hurt when testing then you can start to worry. How are you managing your condition? Very well right now.  15 years ago I was paralyzed in the ICU, 5 years in a wheelchair, 5 years stumbling, and now I walk pretty well.  High doses of IVIg for 7 years, subcutaneous Ig since then.  I remember how bad it was and never complain about flare ups now.  I am lucky Igg works for me. I had GBS at 19, I am now 30 and still get random muscle twitching and spasms regularly.", "Jenna Jameson, 'unable to walk,' has Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome ", "Struggling with GBS and Treatment Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with GBS about 4 weeks ago and it has been so taxing emotionally and physically. I saw some progress from the IVIG, went to rehab, but then I started getting worse. I am now back in the hospital trying plasma exchange. I feel so hopeless. This is my first time posting and I just was reaching out for support and I was curious if anyone else recovered after the plasma exchange as a second treatment. I feel lost, sad, and angry. I am scared things will not get better. Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. I am sorry you are going through this. You are not alone.\nGetting GBS again after a bout of recovery is not something out of the ordinary. The neurologists that treated me told me that some patients get these bouts of relapse during their recovery. So just keep trying and hopefully you will get through this stronger than ever! I was diagnosed in \u201c05\u201d had both, in one visit. (over 90 days). Relapsed in \u201c06\u201d only received plasma exchange. Relapsed twice in \u201c09\u201d, diagnosed with CIDP.  Learned to walk twice. Take each day as it comes. Get mad, do not bottle it up, and then funnel that energy into helping you do things to help you.  Things like stretching and range of motion. When I was wheelchair bound I would go to museums and just experience and learn. It will get better, it just takes time.  Wishing you the best. I am 4 weeks out from diagnosis as well (vaccine related). I have not gone back in for treatment but I have had regression... it is very disappointing but I am trying to focus on the things that are getting better..or at least not worse I just got out of the hospital two days ago with GBS.  I had a severe reaction to the IVIG and they put me on plasma exchange.  I am so sorry you are going through this.  Plasma exchange is really traumatic (in addition to all the GBS stuff).  I am doing so much better since starting it though.  It was like a 180.  They went from telling me I needed a full time caretaker to me being independent and walking with a cane in a week.  It worked so well.  It is hard on your body, make sure you rest afterwards and that they are checking your fibrinogen levels, CBC, renal function, and ionized calcium.  You can do this.  I promise you will do this.  You have a community here who loves and supports you.  My story is not the same as everyone is though.  The thing that helped the most for me to get through it was: sleep, distraction methods (tv, reading a book, online shopping without buying anything, browsing Craigslist missed connections lol).  Those feelings of anger, sadness, and being lost will linger and that is okay.  They are valid and a reflection of this difficult situation.  Your body and mind are going through so much, be gentle with yourself.  Again, we are all here for you and you can do this.\n\nEdit: I also saw a counselor/social worker while in the hospital (I requested one by asking my nurse) and I just let it all out on her.  It was so helpful and she was very understanding.  It is sometimes nice to have someone to unload on in the hospital who can come see you while you are there just for that purpose. The same thing happened to me and it is been traumatizing. I am so sorry you also went through it. I got IVIG April 1-5, got a little better at rehab and then so much worse at home, returned to inpatient neuro for plasmaphresis is April 27. I am now back home and doing much better physically, but it has been psychologically traumatizing for me. I have intrusive thoughts of it coming back. I empathize with you so much. But I went from being paralyzed and unable to feed myself to now being able to use a walker short distances. I believe in you and the plasmaphresis, I started feeling slightly better on day 2. Please keep us updated on your progress, you are in my heart and thoughts &lt;3 Thanks so much for the kind words. I hate the grey area that comes with the condition and that it varies so much person to person. Your experience must have been so hard and traumatic. Hearing your story is inspiring. I think that taking things day by day is great advice bc I get so scared thinking about the future and my recovery. Thank you. I heard somewhere that four weeks is when the symptoms are most apparent. Stay strong, we are in this together. Staying grateful for what I have is great advice, thanks :) Hi, I really appreciate hearing that this community is here to support me regardless of the fact that I am new and I do not know anyone. I am glad plasma exchange has been helping you. I have done three treatments and they may have helped me a bit. It is so hard measuring progress since it is so slow. Thanks again for rallying for me! I am happy to hear that the plasmapheresis helped you despite the IVIG mishap. Our situations are very similar and I really hope to make the progress that you have. I have had three treatments so far and it is difficult to tell it I am improving. Thank you for being concerned for me, it has helped me a lot reading these comments. I feel so cared for! Have they given you any plasma transfusions?  They had to give me a bunch because the treatments were so hard on my body.  Like I said, you can do this.  I was so happy to find how supportive this community is during one of the hardest times in my life.  It is helped so much. I am supposed to get a total of 5 plasma transfusions. I have got three done! I am still trying to grasp at what my body is going through and why this happened to me. Me too.  I had a complete breakdown last night.  I already have C-PTSD and was working hard on trauma therapy when this happened so I feel so heartbroken and a sense of why?  If your plasma transfusions or any part of the exchange ever feels off you can always request meds :) I had to have a ton of calcium, Benadryl, zofran, and Tylenol because my body was struggling to handle the plasma.  I am glad we have each other and others to lean on. Hang in there. It will get better. I got sick in August 2018, worst case scenario. I became completely paralyzed and had to be intubated. They first did IVIG but it did not work; so then they did the plasmapheresis and that did work. That was only the beginning. The real work was with the therapies. I was in hospital for one month, inpatient therapy at Moss Rehab another month, lived with my sisters for 2 months after that and had at-home therapy with Bayada Nurses, then once I was able to go up and down steps, I went home and did a couple more months of physical therapy twice a week until I got all movement and strength back to where it was before I was sick. Amazingly, I do not have PTSD from the ordeal; that is all instead from workplace bullying, but that is a movie for another day, lol. You will get thru this, just keep doing all of your therapies, no matter how tired you feel, just do them and you will get stronger every day. If you have not already, go to GBS-CIDP.org which is an international organization with survivors from around the world, and so much info and support. The residual effects I have now are Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Numb Toes, and occasional weirdness with the scarring where the trache tube and the peg tubes were. Best of luck to you! I was diagnosed on 6/18/20. It gets better, it is been a long journey but I recovered my ability to walk on my own in December and continue to get better everyday. You are not alone here. Please feel free to message me. I have tons of advice to help you with mobility issues or just a person to vent to Hello! I have been diagnosed with GBS when I was 8 years old. Now, I am 24. Fortunately, IVIG worked well for me and I did not have to go through plasma therapy. For 6 months, daily, I went to hospital to do physiotherapy. I continued my strength gaining exercises for 3 more years. Even to the present day, I have shivers in both my hands and my right(it attacked right side of my body) leg toes are folded inside. I can not write neatly even now due to the shivering.  But the only thing that can help to getting back to normal is doing a lot of strength gaining exercises. I hope and believe you will also get well soon. It took me a while but I bounced back from the plasmapheresis treatments. It takes some time for sure. It can definitely be emotionally taxing but do not give up. If you have access to it talking to a therapist definitely helps. Keep your head up and I wish you a speedy recovery. I am so sorry that you were dealt these hands of cards. There are so many ups and downs so we just have to take it day by day. I am focusing on progress even if it is small. We are strong and I have got your back! Thanks for the support:) I think the plasma exchange really helped me out, but I still cannot help but worry about the future. Hi, your story is very inspiring to me. It shows me that although this disease can be extremely debilitating, things can get better with time. I need to practice patience! Thanks for the resources too, I am going to check them out. You seem so strong and that makes me want to be strong myself! Thank you. Hey, I am really happy for you that you regained your ability to walk, even though it took a while. I am hoping that I recover too, even if it takes time. Everyone in this group is so supportive and I may message you for support or advice. It is nice to talk to people who can understand exactly what I have been dealing with. Thank you so much. Hi, I cannot imagine what it would be like to be diagnosed with GBS at such a young age. I am glad that you are doing better these days, even though you still have some residue issues. I have to stay focused on my exercises and not let my emotions get to the best of me and impede my progress. Hopefully, in the future, this will all be a blip in time that does not continue to severely impact me. Thank you for your support. Hi, I am hoping a couple of days ago I had my last plasma transfer ever. There is a possibility I may have to do more, but I will worry about that when/if that day comes. I am working with my therapist and she does help. The GBS community has also really helped, I am so glad I found it! Thank you for the kind words/support. A thanks! When I was at Moss Rehab, the first day there, my occupational therapist said that she loved seeing GBS patients as they recover. This was a day when I was unable to change a channel with the remote control, and unable to button a shirt. From the first day at the rehab, I immediately began to make progress every day! Once I was able to do a task, no one was ever allowed to help me with it. My personal rule which was also the whole point of the therapies. \n\nOoof, the very first time I sat up was hard! I think that was when I realized how important our core muscles are! The first time I stood up, with a machine, my blood pressure dropped way down! It was hard getting on my feet. But once I did, each day got easier. As soon as I was able to go up steps with assistance, they released me. I had to live with my sisters for 2 more months until I could safely go up and down steps on my own. So no matter where you are in your recuperation, just keep on pushing. You will get there and you will have a new appreciation for the most basic things in life. For me, it was water! I could not drink even a tiny sip of water for almost 2 months because of trache. Honestly that was the worst part of the whole ordeal for me, excessive thirst. I would beg the nurses for wet swabs or wet towels, and suck up as much water as I could from either. Water is the greatest beverage on Earth! \n\nKeep on going, you got this. Hi, I really appreciate you sharing your experience. Also I LOVE that rule and I have been following it ever since I read your post!! Thanks again for all of this support. I am so glad I found this group. I had many days where it got worse after getting better. It takes a while. Stay positive even though it is hard a times. I was admitted to the hospital in October 2020, received IVIG treatment and showed little progress. They started in patient physical/occupational therapy during which I experienced relapse of GBS so plasma exchange was initiated. This also showed little progress so I was once again back to IVIG. This second time around was more promising. \n\nI just got discharged from a rehab center a few days ago, still not @ 100% but I am optimistic I will be getting there soon. GBS is VERY taxing especially on your mental health, I went through all kinds of emotions during these past 8 months, but just try to keep a positive mindset, talk to someone and let it out and you will do great! You are not alone. You can do this. We all belive in you.  I am not diagnosed with GBS, but my soul mate/  best friend is. It can be hell at times. I watched her get sick. Then very weak. Then in a hospital for a week. The first year was hell. She bounced back. Walked even ran on the beach for a bit. And it comes and goes at times. It is crazy one day fine next day. We change our plans because she cannot do what we had going.  This year since January has been tough on her. Especially this last month. Her leg paid has increased. Her mobility is down. Its tough. \n\nI am an electrician by trade. And at home I fix things. I am a fixer. And when I cannot fix something I get more headstrong to get it going right (part of what makes me a darn good sparky if I may say so). And being completely helpless is one of the worst feelings I have had in my life. I realize when she hurts I cannot give her a Tylenol or a hospital trip. It is a Gaba and go to bed. I hate it. This is taking a toll on her and myself. She feels the pain. And I feel the pain of watching her go through this with no solution. I am a man of action and when there is no action. Wtf can I do? \n\nWord of advice. You will obviously feel this harder than anyone around you. If you have caring friends, family, significant other. Please do not deny their pain. I assure you they are feeling pain in a very different way. It may not be a physical burning. In my case it is definitely eating me alive. Be patient with them.  \n\nI hope you get through this and never have GBS rear It is ugly head. That felt good to get it off my chest. Thank you all this is an amazing community.", "Advice for someone helping a GBS friend and what to expect Long story short a friend went to the Dr with the flu like symptoms, they give her a flu shot and now she has GBS. Sad thing is I advised her not to get the shot this year as I felt some kind gut feeling with all that is going on to stay away for now. Ive also seen my fair share of people recently being administered the rowna vaxx when they went in for the flu shot. Then the place saying sorry we made a mistake when they handed them a vaxx card. \n\nSpoke with one of the nurses that helped my friend. She stated she was a travelling nurse and one of the places she worked had an entire section of GBS patients that all got it from the rowna vaxx. Something this year just does not feel right. One of my friends clients got it and from the vaxx and they now have to sell their home to buy a bigger place in order to dedicate a section for her husbands as her life is now turned upside down from this unfortunate circumstance. She told me it is gets worse before it gets better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend is a senior at 82. One day she was walking, the next day after the vaxx she is paralyzed. Her family n I have been taking care of her, feeding her, changing her diapers, giving emotional support. This is terrifying as I never knew someone with this. The nurses that have seen her in the home dont really do anything but check vitals which I do. Psychical therapy said they cannot properly treat her in the home. They recommended a 3 week stay at a nursing home which will offer 24hrs care + physical therapy.   \n\n\nFrom my research they say most eventually recover from GBS, while its possible they dont. I know recovery is dependent on a lot of factors. For those who might know or actually recovered how long did it take? What is a realistic time frame? It is been almost a month for her and she cannot walk, can barely remember things, takes a long time to answer questions, only eats 400-600 calories as she constantly complains shes not hungry. She lost a ton of weight &amp; muscle mass in the legs.   \n\n\nIm lost, im heat broken and dont know what to do. Her insurance only covers a 3 week stay if we decide to send her to a nursing home. Her condition at the home is sad nor ideal. I have read many places it takes many many months to make significant improvement. Any advice for someone whos totally caught off guard would be greatly appreciated. Every case is different, but according to my doctors people who normally start to recover in the first 6 months usually make a full recovery. That full recovery can take an additional 6-36 months. Thanks for your insight. That Is a lot longer than I thought. Scariest part its like she has like 80% full on dementia from this.  Im going to need to start researching nursing homes. These darn vaxx I tell you. I will continue to pray daily she recovers.", "Experiences in surviving surgeries while in the worst of it So my wife, 35, had begun experiencing symptoms after coming home from work complaining of a migraine on dec 29th. A week later we were in the hospital with basically total loss of her arms and legs, having a hard time eating and little gastric-intestinal function. Today is over a week after the completion of the IVIG treatments and blood pressure crash with cardiac arrest. Had to have emergency surgery and currently around 36 hours in recovery. Scariest damn day of my life. Things are trending better at the moment. Any stories of folks going through something similar? This has all been so crazy I was diagnosed with Guillain Barre my 2nd month of kindergarten. I had full, body-wide loss of function. Head to toe. My mom spent 3 days awake standing beside my bed while the doctors did their tests and I was finally diagnosed properly. From there I was intubated and had a feeding tube installed. 5 months later I was finally released to go home, where I was still connected to a ventilator and external feeding tube. \n\nIt is a terrifying process. I recently looked through our small book of pictures from this stage of my families life. Watching someone you love go through this is just as horrible as fighting for your life day and night. I cannot imagine the thoughts going through my moms head. \n\nI promise you it gets better. Depending on how thoroughly she is affected it can be a long recovery process. After a certain point it becomes less about fighting for survival and more about recovering to the point you were at before being affected. The best thing you can do for now is remain by her side and continue to help her with the process.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to pm me or respond here! I only recently joined this community and I want to help anyone I can with any questions or concerns. I had it just about as bad as it can get. Jesus I my mind cannot comprehend what it would be like going through all this with our kid. Some people get felt some insane hands. Glad your on the other side of this thing. Right now she is fighting just to get back to the process of healing from the GBS. It will switch at a certain point from survival to getting strong again. Obviously everyone handles it differently and age plays a part, but if it is any reassurance I am now 19 and back to lifting weights heavier than my body weight. Just help her stay motivated and feel safe. Soon the scariest part will be over and she can focus on getting back to normal.", "Question for those who have recovered Was your recovery rather linear or did you go through multiple waves of pain/tremors, etc?\n\nI am now on my 3rd wave of symptoms worsening and then relaxing. I am 7 months in. I am 1yr 1month post GBS now, although I dont know when my true recovery phase started as the healthcare a received was awful (UK based)\n\nMy journey felt as it came in waves, where I had one or two good weeks followed by a week where I felt I had regressed. I also feel I had a relapse where I was extremely weak and unwell due to pushing myself too hard during the recover phase.\n\nFrom reading on here, and other forums, everyones journey is different and I dont think there is a specific \"one size fits all\" recover process.\n\nFor what is it is worth I have come from not being able to walk 100m (at worst 10m) without feeling horrendously fatigued, pain and stiffness in my legs and feet, feeling of numbness at night.......to now being able to go to the gym 3-4 times a week stronger then what I was pre GBS and working on my running and currently doing 1.5miles with the limiting factor being my Cardiovascular.\n\nEveryone is journey is different and I think its important to be aware that for most people (definitely myslef) that there is a physical and mental journey The only thing I can say for everyone is recovery is that it is not linear for anyone. You have to be on the look out for new symptoms like you face was not paralyzed and then it becomes paralyzed. That is a doctor trip! I am only less than 5 months out, but I have recently felt a bit weird symptoms. I feel so tired after maybe 20 min of walking, combined with restless legs at night. \nI can never sleep through the night and sometimes I feel weird erratic tingles on my fingers and toes. \nNot sure if this is necessarily connected, but I have had migraines and weird muscle spasms too. It is all very weird. Thank you, that is very comforting. Yeah, those are pretty similar to my symptoms. Pain and numbness varies by the day. Twitching/muscle spasms comes and goes. Weakness comes and goes.\n\nDefinitely cannot exercise/push myself even 1/4 as long or hard as I could pre-GBS. Is not it so frustrating and scary at the same time? I try not to think about it too much, but at the same time I do not want to end up in the hospital paralyzed again. I would say mine was fairly linear and I am now 3+ years out. I get some numbness when I do too much but that is about it. \n\nStaying positive is key because you will recover. My nerves get more pain as they grow back. Hang in there. I was posting a few weeks ago I was discouraged I was seven weeks into recovery and still having to use a walker. I am walking unaided now, but after a minute or so it is incredibly painful. I have learned that you will definitely have good days and bad days. For example, yesterday walking was almost unbearable after a few steps\u2026 today it is not bad at all\u2026 who knows what tomorrow will be like. I am two years and change out.  It seemed like my doctor thought I would have a linear recovery,  but I definitely did not.   It would be a couple good weeks then a couple bad weeks, but most bad times were a little better than the last bad time (apart from one major setback).  I did not start feeling like I was going to fully recover until this past August,  which was a full two years after onset. Thanks, that gives me hope that this is a somewhat normal recovery process. My recovery came in waves; but I would say they were in direct correlation with steroids. Without steroids, I would think that it would have been a slow, steady improvement.", "Is there any hope for my mom with GBS? My mom had GBS 15 years ago, she was fully paralyzed. She recovered and was able to walk within 6 months. However, her feet (especially toes) and hips are numb with tingling sensation. If she squats and sits on the floor she cannot get up by herself without any support. She gets tired easily from walking short distances (100 meters). Her feet feel permanently cold so she has to wear thick socks even during peak summer. \n\nIs there any remedy out there for this? I have heard hospitals in India are pretty good with neurological disorders but I want to know if 100% recovery is even possible. It seems to be a toss up on 100% recovery. Some people get through it without much lingering effects, and others have issues the rest of their lives. I am 6 months out and about to go back to work. I still have numbness in my feet and hands. My strength is about 75% of what it used to be but I am hoping that continues to improve. It is one of those thing where time will tell unfortunately. Slow and steady seems to be the rule with this crazy disease. You have to really listen to your body and not overdue it. Get her in to Physical Therapy. Hope she has a good outcome. I am sorry to hear about your mom. \n\nGBS affects everyone differently with age being the only indicator for how well recovery may progress. \n\nI am 11 months out from diagnoses and took 3 months to get back to walking. I am also in my thirties. \n\nAround the same time in the hospital, a teen was also diagnosed with GBS was walking within 2 weeks. He is more likely to recover fully compared to me. \n\nPhysiotherapy and regular exercise has improved my physical abilities but I still have numbness and weakness throughout my body. I am not sure if I will ever recovery 100% and I have made peace with that most days. Physical therapy 15 years after onset? How is that supposed to work? I think there is hope. I am in my fifth year now. B12 shots are my magic potion. One shot a day goes a long way. Good luck to your mom. May I ask where do you do your treatment i.e; which country and hospital? I have heard Indian hospitals have great neurology hospitals but I need more reviews and positive word of mouth from other GBS survivors. In my experience neurologists cannot really help us. I was told three years ago that my nerves sound great (some sort of accoustic test) as if I never had GBS. The problem of course is that my lower legs, feet, arms and hands (GBS), my chest (Miller Fisher) and my face (bilateral Bells Palsy) still hurt a lot. I live in Texas, but I had to travel to Manila a for work. While in Manila I got double vision. I had one B12 shot left. I gave myself that shot, and the double vision went away. So  I bought a 2 year supply of B12 shots for around $80 at the local pharmacy. B12 helps me with the pain, with the motivational aspect, tiredness, and it lasts sometimes to the next day. Nobody knows about these hyper dosage B12 shot, because there are so few of us, but I cannot state enough how much they help me. You can order it on the web as well. So to answer your question, I treat myself, even though in Texas and with my health insurance I have access to some of the best neurologists. They just do not know what to do with us. And B12 works really well. Thanks a lot for this information, I had no idea about the B12. I can imagine how much of a struggle it must be to have to continuously manage your pain, I am going to  e telling my mom about this. You are so strong, may we all be blessed with this type of strength and positivity. So she has trouble walking, and PT would do no good? Your right, she should do nothing. I had it as a child, 30 year ago. I still have residual effects, but I find that moderate exercise helps a lot. When I did not exercise a lot and I was fatter, it was really bad, but when I do some light exercise each day I can stay fairly active overall. I still have some lingering issues, however, and I think some things are just inevitable due to the nature of the syndrome.", "I am a teacher who recovered from GBS, should I be worried about returning to the classroom? I had GBS back in 2017 and recovered over the course of a few months. My doctor still sees that on my medical records and says I should not take things like the flu vaccine for fear of a relapse (I guess).  Does this mean I am part of a higher risk group for Covid?  Should I get(am I eligible?) A note from my doctor to stay virtual for as long as possible?  I am a little scared to go back, but I dont know if those fears are grounded in reality.   Any info would be great. I found this article that says those with GBS are not at any higher of a risk of contracting Covid... unless you have been treated with immunosuppressive drugs, in which case you may be at risk for any infections, regardless of Covid.

My office moved to work from home in March and we do not have a re-entry date yet. Please discuss with your doctor on what they suggest, as each person\u2019s case may not be the same. Also, here is a ( from the GBS/CIDP Foundation with their official statement on COVID-19. \n\nPersonally, I was scared also, as I am actively dealing with this. I work at an inpatient rehab. My specialist did not suggest leaving work, he said I was not at more risk for catching COVID-19. He said I had the same risk as other healthy individuals, but if I caught it, it could cause worsening GBS/CIDP symptoms. I returned to classroom before I could walk! My principal and the school board were absolutely amazing.     \n\nAs for the Covid issue - always consult with your physicians.", "Looking for other people with potentially vaccine-induced GBS I received the meningitis C vaccine and DTP booster 3-4 months before my GBS diagnosis. I am now naturally worried about receiving the covid vaccine, just in case my GBS relapses, and by reading this page I know that I am not alone in this. \n\nI am a masters student in science, and am thinking of conducting a small research project to look at whether people with vaccine-induced GBS specifically had any adverse effects after the COVID vaccine, or any other vaccine. Before I do this in a larger scale, I wanted to try this page to find out the numbers of people to which this might apply. \n\nIt would be really amazing if you could comment below if you had a vaccine in the 6 months before your GBS diagnosis, and no other severe infections/surgeries which could explain the GBS instead. If you are willing, it would also be great if you could describe how long after the vaccine you got the diagnosis, what your disease progression was like, and whether you have had any bad experiences with vaccines afterwards. \n\nThank you :)", "Be part of research on GBS \n\nIt is a paid gig if you get selected.

I was paralyzed from neck to toes about five days after the first symptoms appeared", "Is it a good idea to work in healthcare after having GBS? Hello! I should start off by saying I got guillain barre from the flu when I was 11-12 years old. I had full paralysis for one month and recovery for 2 more months. I am 25 and normal for the most part now. I am in a program at my college for the moment to work in the healthcare field and due to having guillain barre I am not allowed to get a flu shot. I am doing clinical at different hospitals and am deathly afraid of corona virus and/or possibly getting the flu and being paralyzed again, it is my biggest fear. \n\nI love working in the healthcare field and interacting with people but corona virus has really woken me up to the possibility of getting seriously sick again from working with sick people in the hospital. I am more than halfway through the program so I do not really want to give it up and there is nothing else I really want to do.\n\nI guess my questions are: do people get guillain barre twice? Is there anyway to prevent it from happening again? Is it a good idea to work in the healthcare field? Given the severity of the consequences, this is a conversation I hope you will have with your health care provider if you have not already done so.  Having said that though, I used to work in the health care field, I have also had the flu twice,  all with no problems. Thank you! I have talked with my doctor and he had no objections about it. I guess taking the proper precautions and using proper PPE could definitely help. I guess it is just me being scared more than anything. As I read your response the thought occurred to me that if you do go into the healthcare field you will probably end up being an excellent example of using  proper PPE. If it strikes your interest, perhaps you could even specialize in infection prevention and control. I work in healthcare and have since my initial diagnosis. I take the standard precautions to prevent getting the flu. The shot is more of a risk to those with this than getting the flu is (my doctor told me this). Still it is good to just check in with your doctor just in case, as everyone is different. I have had GBS twice. No known triggers either time.", "Do you find it is harder to talk about as time passes? I do and I do not know why.

Someone close to me was diagnosed with GBS around two months ago. As I have an autoimmune disease as well I really empathize with their (and all of your!) pain and want to do or suggest anything I can to help. She is having a lot of trouble sleeping because of the pain -- do you have any suggestions? She has an appointment with a specialist for pain management but it is a ways out due to COVID.\n\nThank you so much for any suggestions and well wishes to you all. I was diagnosed on the 18th of February, and am having a ton of nerve pain. The only thing that has helped is gabapentin plus sleeping meds. If anyone else has suggestions, I am open! When it was at its worst I used gabapentin and melatonin. Not to mention a fuck ton of physical therapy wore me out so I was too tired to stay awake. Best of luck to you and your loved one! Thank you for the suggestion, Gabapentin sounds like a popular choice. I am definitely going to suggest that to her.  I hope everything is going as well as it can for you in the early stages after diagnosis! I appreciate the well wishes and am absolutely suggesting Gabapentin to her. I hope you are getting rest and relief now. I will keep you informed if I get any more suggestions. The neuropathy pain is my chief complaint, also, so I am searching for answers, too CBD + knee pillow + v pillow. I would recommend having vitamin and mineral levels checked. A common theme of GBS/CIDP is D3 deficiency for whatever reason. I was very deficient in D3 and felt better once I got those levels back into the normal range. \n\nI also would not rule out blood sugar spikes enabling that pain either, especially if she is  or has been taking steroids. May want to experiment with either not eating for several hours before bed or staying away from high carbohydrate foods. If blood sugar is constantly elevated, that can impact already damaged nerves. We tried a cannibis derivative and have had some luck so far! This sounds like awesome advice, I am also D3 deficient with my autoimmune disorder and feel crummy when that is the case so it makes perfect sense. I will suggest that and the blood sugar check! I have had great luck with cannibis as well. Takes away enough of the anxiety associated with the horrible nerve pain. Then puts me to bed. Very nice sleep according to the Apple Watch! Make sure they speak to their doctor if they are interested in exploring this option.", "Has anyone had a TB skin test post-GBS?

Ive been to the internal medicine specialist, who ordered blood tests as well as got an X ray for my knees and elbows, and said everything looks good.

I contacted 3 doctors and they all give up after a blood test. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nI really appreciate the help. They could do nerve conduction tests and lumbar punctures, but I do not think they would be inclined to at this moment. Maybe you should be checked by a neurologist or a neurophysiologist. Even if it is not GBS, they could give you something to make that pain a bit more bearable.\n\nGood luck. Take some magnesium, it should go away in a few weeks but if it gets worse go to the ER immediately and tell them you think you may have GBS. Upping this. Go see a neurologist.

Does anyone happen to know if there are any guidelines yet for GBS and the Covid vaccine? The GBS/CIDP organization put out a statement today: (\n\nBasically, there is no hard information yet, but while we wait for more safety info, the organization seems to be supportive of GBS survivors receiving the vaccine. Thank you! Thanks for the good article. It is encouraging. However, the doctors and neurologists that treated me in the ICU and my family doctor have all advised me to decline any further vaccinations, I think out of an abundance of caution. I did not understand the flu part. Does it say that they recommend the vaccine for anyone or to GBS patients? I wish someone could point me to a scientific explanation of why the H1N1 vaccine made my body decide that having an endocrine autoimmune disorder and a GI autoimmune disease were not enough and therefore served me up a steaming helping of incurable lifetime neurological autoimmune disease. I know it is generally the swine flu, both the disease and the rushed-out vaccine of 2009, that set it off; but why the H1N1 and how is that different from what the mRNA vaccines do? \nI probably already had Covid last February but could not get antibody tested until summer, so I am guessing my IG treatments saved my ass. I have spoken to both my primary care doctor and my neurologist and both were in support of it unless the clinical trials showed a link (which apparently they have not yet) While there is no proven *causation* between the standard seasonal flu vaccine and GBS, there is a strong *correlation*. My husband came down with GBS 7 wks after getting the flu shot for only the 2nd time in his life; during his time in the hospital and residential physical rehab, he met 2 other patients who contracted severe GBS about 4-8 wks after receiving a flu vaccine.\n\n\nWhile he was in the hospital, the neurologist told him that, to be on the safe side, he should not get the flu vaccine in the future, as it could potentially trigger a relapse; the risk of catching the flu \u201cnaturally\u201d was deemed to be less of a risk than a vaccine-triggered relapse. OP is asking if it is safe for people who have had GBS to receive the Covid vaccine, or if they should treat it like a seasonal flu vaccine and avoid it in case of a potential GBS relapse. We are monitoring this situation and keeping an eye out for a statement from the GBS/CIDP Foundation International website. We are getting closer to a vaccine being made available. I will sticky the foundations statement on the COVID-19 vaccine to the top of this subreddit once they make one. We strongly suggest that you speak to your neurologist prior to getting any vaccine. Great link, thanks for sharing.  I will certainly be booked for my shot as soon as it becomes available.  One important thing to add is that we may also be at heightened risk of reoccurrence from getting covid itself. Added it! This is a copy paste from a recent post regarding this statement:\n\nI feel like their statement does not address people who have had GBS. Sure a vaccination can cause 1 additional person out of 1 million to develop GBS, but those odds are for people who have never had GBS. Do they know what the odds are for people who have had GBS previously and then receive a vaccine?? I do not think they do, pretty sure there has not been a single study looking into that (please correct me if I am wrong). Might be because the majority of people who end up getting GBS do not get flu shots. I have had GBS twice so the probability of it reoccurring is most likely higher than the average person.\n\n\nJust food for thought, they have not actually made a statement saying GBS survivors are safe to get the vaccine, they are just stating the average person should be fine with those odds.", "Hospital Sheets What type of material do you recommend for sheets in order to easily get into a hospital bed?", "I am one of the 100\u2026.

It can be a pretty traumatic experience and I still get some of the fall out. How about you? I had it when I was 5, so I grew up thinking my body was normal. It was not until I was in my late 20s that I began to get so frustrated that I started asking around and turns out, no, it is not normal to have massive foot pain from just walking around for a few hours, to wake up in pain and have to ease into the day, to deal with random pinpricks and tingles or to feel like your legs weigh a ton halfway up the stairs.

I underwent an arthroscopy. \nIntense pain associated with frozen shoulders subsided after a few months, but in the process I lost finesse in my right hand and to date, my right side upper limb mobility is limited. \n\nAgain, I am not sure if these conditions are just a matter of coincidences for someone who also had a GBS attack or otherwise. Anyone here consider hsv virus could cause this ? Mine started just as I contracted it ... GBS happens after your body fights off an infection, so a virus could have triggered it.", "Recovery advice Two weeks into GBS and following IVIG I think I notice slight improvement in face and limb strength and doc wants to discharge me. \n\nOther than rest, a healthy diet and physio, anything I should consider for accelerating my recovery? In case helpful, I have bilateral lower limb numbness and weakness and bilateral facial weakness.\n\nThanks for any tips. Hey there! I recommend reading up on Myelin repair. ( by the MS Society in the UK. While I know you are asking about GBS/CIDP, MS has a lot of similarities in symptoms and treatment.\n\nI also recommend you take a look at this ( by the Mayo Clinic regarding diet and exercise in the rebuilding of Myelin.\n\nOne of the biggest things for recovery is just use and time. You will find from other users on this subreddit that the process takes a long time, and its all about taking it slow and just focusing on the wins.\n\nBest of luck in your recovery! Shit.  Rest, healthy diet and physio sounds great to me and I am 30 years post recovery.  ;)\n\nJust remember that recovery is a marathon, not a sprint.  There will be bad days, so try keep your progress in perspective.  My dad has CIDP, he has the leg numbness and weakness but not the facial part. It is been about a year and a half since he was diagnosed.\n\nAfter you get discharged I would def take it easier to play it on the safe side. It is a slow process. My dad goes for walks every day with his walker, now that it is colder he has an indoor stationary bike he uses. He gets monthly IVIG, that is the most helpful. It is important to keep your legs and limbs moving as you recover to get some strength back. But I am not a doctor so definitely only do what your doc advises. In my dad\u2019s experience PT has been helpful to both relieve pain and strengthen some of his muscles. \n\nI wish you the best with your recovery! GBS is such a strange and shitty disease but this community can help ya through it I have the exact same GBS. Daily 3 ml B12 shots helped me greatly. And for walking, Vibram 5 Fingers shoes. Good luck! Great - thanks. Excellent community here! Many thanks - getting the vibe that staying active despite the physical challenges is important. Thanks - helpful to recognise that I will not necessarily see a sudden improvement. Curious - how do the vibram finger shoes help? Did it take your dad long to be diagnosed or was it straightforward and quick? What kind of tests did they do? If I may ask. Yes it absolutely took a while to be diagnosed. His situation was a bit weird. He had a back surgery ~2 years ago now to fix his sciatic pain. It only made it worse, they thought tried to fix it with another surgery. Still was having pain getting worse and worse until about 7 months later CIDP came into the conversation. His diagnosis largely came from the fact that he was in absolutely horrific pain, and we had absolutely no reason why. So CIDP was brought up, and his symptoms are consistent with it: numbness and weakness in the legs, flare ups when he feels \u201celectrical zaps\u201d in his legs, and of course a lot of pain.\n\nI honestly cannot remember the tests he took and do not want to misinform. But I remember him getting an MRI, and he got another scan that I cannot remember the name of a few times.\n\nI believe CIDP is largely an exclusionary diagnosis. We went through so many possibilities before arriving there. Just sucks that you expect a back surgery to fix an issue and be recoverable, only to discover it is something else and you will never be able to walk again Do you happen to remember if they did an EMG test, in which they stick needles in parts of the body and see how well the nerves conduct electricity? It is something memorable if you have had it yourself. Yes yes yes 100%. That was the name of the test that I could not remember (I wanted to say EKG but knew that was not it). I know he got multiple EMGs throughout the first year of him having problems.\n\nI cannot confidently say if the EMG was the \u201caha\u201d moment in his diagnosis, though. It definitely showed evidence of his nerves not functioning correctly. But I think at the end of the day he was diagnosed with CIDP because they excluded all other possibilities. It was only after this diagnosis that we could affirm that all of his symptoms are consistent with CIDP &gt;I believe CIDP is largely an exclusionary diagnosis. We went through so many possibilities before arriving there. Just sucks that you expect a back surgery to fix an issue and be recoverable, only to discover it is something else and you will never be able to walk again\n\nI keep reading that a lot of other neurological diseases are diagnosed by an exclusionary process, and I am wondering how they can therefore diagnose anything. There would be too diseases many left over.\n\nBack surgery does not even always solve things. Some people, end up worse than before. Like me. I am here because I have had nerve-related problems since my back surgery. Now all the spine people are saying it is not my back, it is a neurological disease. But I cannot help thinking the back surgery triggered something. Yes it definitely did trigger something. That is what happened to my dad too. \n\nThe only similar thing I have to compare this to, is when someone becomes mentally ill after taking a psychedelic drug like acid or mushrooms. Sometimes people take acid and it brings out their bipolar disorder. They already had the genes, and it would show itself eventually. But the acid can be the event that brings it out. I think that is probably along the lines of what happens with surgery.\n\nAnd yes you are correct that there would be a lot of diseases left over with an exclusionary diagnosis. So you look at the symptoms and make the best diagnosis possible. Then start treating that disease and see if there are improvements. None of this is ideal which is why these neurological diseases blow Your dad does sound similar to me except that I have not been diagnosed with anything neurological yet. I had some blood work and an EMG test, but the results of the EMG were not as bad as they should be, I guess. No one has done a spinal tap, I should ask them to.\n\nI am working on finding a neurologist who has more experience with neuromuscular diseases. Not a sleep disorder neurologist, or an epilepsy neurologist or a vascular neurologist. Some neuromuscular diseases are so rare that not even many neurologists have seen cases, I have read.\n\nI do agree that surgery (or a drug) can trigger an underlying disease. It is a stressor, and I had very stressful, prolonged family issues going on at the same time. Although I was very optimistic about my surgery and not afraid of it. Definitely true that not many have seen cases! My dad has been to countless doctors and neurologists by now and none of them have seen it before.\n\nI really hope that your neurologists will be able to pin down a diagnosis soon so you can get some relief. It sucks being in pain and no one can tell you why Your feet walk as if you are barefoot. The toes spread out and help balancing your body.", "Advice for friend in recovery ", "Long-term numbness with CIDP I will keep the background as brief as possible, but essentially I am curious about other peoples' experiences with long-term numbness due to CIDP/GBS.\n\nMy Mum went into hospital in April and was on a ventilator for 10 days and spent a fair few weeks in ICU. She was initially diagnosed with GBS but has since been told it is CIDP. She left ICU to spend some time in a normal ward and is currently in a neuro-rehabilitation ward where she is been for about 10 weeks or so. She is currently in a wheelchair and is learning to walk with a frame and is making slow but encouraging progress.\n\nHowever, despite all of the things she is overcome (now eating, breathing, going to the loo without help), she is still struggling with daily debilitating numbness, mostly in her hands and face. This seems to get worse as the day goes on and doctors have said it is possibly fatigue, but frustratingly it is so bad it is beginning to hinder her progress as she is struggling to use her hands on some days and is forced into her bed after lunch on occasion because it is all too much.\n\nThey are offering her Duloxetine to try and help, but I was just wondering if anyone else had experienced this long-term numbness that did not go away despite other improvements? It is so frustrating to not be able to help her or for the doctors to not know exactly how to alleviate this issue, but any support or information would be hugely appreciated! Thank you in advance :)", "Covid 19 vaccination Was just wondering if anyone discussed with their doctor what to do when a vaccine is developed. I know we are not supposed to get vaccinated, but was curious. I did. They will only know once it is tested on GBS patients to see if there are side effects. \n\nAnd BTW the only vaccine you are NOT supposed to get is the flu shot -- you are still ok to get the standard DPT, measles, etc. shots... I assume that is what you meant but I do not want anyone to read this and think otherwise. My bad. I should have said vaccinated for the Flu. Go to GBS foundation.org. A lot of information about it. They say yes get the shot, including flu. Second occurrence is so extremely rare. Getting the flu could be way harder on us. My neuro told me to get it when it comes out. Including flu? My neurologist said no flu shots. Pretty sure that is what caused mine to begin with. Even if your gbs came on by the flu shot, you still have the same odds of getting it again by the flu shot. It is extremely low. I was at the San Diego gbs/cidp symposium where they had the worlds top neurologists specializing in gbs/cidp and even they said to go ahead and get the flu shot/ other vaccines because the odds of getting it again are so low. They did say there are some cases where someone got it again, but the odds of it are so low that it does not outweigh the pros. You should do whatever makes sense to you, or that you are comfortable with.  I know someone that has not flown since 9/11 and people who risk themselves doing extreme sports.  It is whatever is your comfort zone. Talk to your Dr, get their opinion, make your own choice. I will probably get it, especially if things keep looking as bleak as they currently are. I do not get the flu shot on advice from my docs, but I will prob get COVID shot.", "Meds for energy i currently take vyavanse for my add and that helps a lil bit with my constant fatigue..but i recently saw someone recomend either Provigil, Amantadine, or Nuvigil. Has anyone here tried these...I will share more of my story later. i am in a support group on facebook and just now thought about Reddit..not sure why it took so long.  Thanks in advance. Welcome to our community! I have not taken meds but I am interested to hear which ones worked in which ways. I often want to ask my dr to prescribe me something to help with my fatigue but I am afraid of being labeled a drug seeker. My friend gave me an adderall to see if it would help my stamina and it did amazingly. I have a psychiatrist appt. coming up soon and will ask him and my neurologist if there are any meds that will help me.", "High Risk or No? I have been CIDP free? In remission? Whatever it is called, for 6 years now. The original neurologist who diagnosed me originally told me he did not want me being a teacher because of all the germs I would be around. He said because of CIDP, I would get sick more often. And harder. \n\nI was completely healthy and hardly sick before CIDP. But since I got it I have always claimed myself as high risk because when I get sick, I usually take twice as long to recover as the normal person. Any time I get a vaccine, I feel crummy for several days after while my body adjusts. So not high risk in the sense of easy to catch, but when I get sick, it takes forever for my body to recover. \n\nEverything I am reading about GBS/CIDP and COVID says this does not put us at higher risk. So should I consider myself high risk for COVID because of CIDP?", "How worried should I be about vaccine-induced Guillain-Barre syndrome?  I would not be concerned as it is not the same type of vaccine as the flu or others that have caused it in the past. Those vaccines contained the virus in it (live or dead depending on the vaccine). The COVID vaccine uses mRNA (( At this time you would have higher odds of getting GBS (or similar autoimmune disorder) from COVID, than you would the vaccine (( ( of current adverse events that have been recorded after receiving the COVID vaccine.", "Not sure if I have GBS I live in a small town and recently was diagnosed with Covid. I am experiencing a numbing feeling all over my body and especially my face. Not necessarily tingly feeling just a numbness. I am also experiencing muscle weakness and having a hard time going to sleep. Is this how GBS presents itself? What should I look out for? There are so many things that will sound similar, especially trying to describe it on the internet.  Talk to a doctor, and see if if they want you to check in with a specialist. Hi u/lmorris123,\n\nNumbing, tingling, and weakness are some of the first signs of GBS/CIDP. If this persists, please go to a doctor immediately. One of the largest factors in reducing the severity of GBS and CIDP is catching them early in order to start treatment.\n\nContact your primary physician and provide your symptoms. If you are still worried after you speak with them request testing ASAP. Many times doctors will not test until much later, so you must be an advocate for your self.\n\nBest of luck and I wish you a speedy recovery with both Covid and (hopefully not) GBS. Seconding this. Especially as covid can present some neurological symptoms for some people, this is not a question that can be answered by the internet. Thank you. It is just frustrating that I have been to the ER twice and it is always being dismissed as just a symptom of Covid. Right now I am sitting outside my parents patio trying to sleep. I am only getting about 2-3hours of sleep a night because I constantly wake up as soon as I fall into a deep sleep. Try to get an appointment with a neurologist, as that is probably who you will eventually want to see. Even a video appointment might help get things moving one way or another. one thing that happened to me along with what everyone else has been saying is that my reflexes were completely wiped, but yeah best thing to do is prob consult with a neuro UPDATE: It was my thyroid. Doctor put me on levothyroxine and symptoms gone. So happy to hear!", "Anti GM2 anribodies I finally got my spinal tap results. Anti GM2 are positive. Anyone of you has that? No clue what that means. Most cases of Guillain Barre Syndrome are characterised by autoantibodies specific for gangliosides. There are different types depending on the number of sialic acids and variations of the lipid structure they are bound to. Named GMx for one sialic acid, GDx for two sialic acids, GTx, GQx for triple, quadruple), with the x referring to the lipid structures, in order of discovery.\n\nGangliosides are cell-surface glycoproteins (which are useful for cells to stick to other specific cells), which are common in many cell types, but are found in abundance in schwann cells which wrap around nerve axons, providing a myelin coating which protects them and alters nerve conduction speed. They are also in abundance in the nerve cells at unprotected motor axon junctions which are not protected by schwann cells.\n\nAttack of these nerve cells lead to the symptoms of GBS, with some symptom variations dependent on which gangliosides are targeted by the autoantibodies (or in rare cases other targets of cell surface proteins found on nerve cells such as siglecs, which I will not go into detail here). Thank you for your detailed reply. That is way more than any doctor told me!", "My wife walked into emergency on Tuesday morning and was put on a ventilator Friday afternoon. I know we are in for a long road ahead everything seems so overwhelming and moved so fast.  I would appreciate if anyone has some similar experiences and managed to over come them.  I know recovery will be months/years but At this point our focus is on keeping her alive to come back to us.   \n\nThank you for anyone who shares, know that you will help potentially ease some pain/fear for our family. That is roughly the timeline I was looking at from first onset of symptoms to ventilator. I think it was 4 days. I was 34 at the time and in decent health otherwise, and the doctors figured out early what it was so they were able to begin effective treatment soon after I was admitted.\n\nThat was 2014. I think I can say that I have fully\nrecovered, with no noticeable ill effects. I think it would have been fair to say I would fully recovered within a year or two. I was well enough to work part time again a month after coming home from the hospital, and was back full-time six months later. Thank you for sharing. I can only hope for a similar outcome. Keep us updated, I will be thinking about you! Thoughts are with you. I walked into the emergency room and 2 days after being admitted I lost the ability to walk. \n\nMy symptoms did not progress to the ventilator but they had no clue as what was wrong with me. I told them I had no feeling from my biceps down and also from my thigh down.\n\nThey proceeded to run me through every test imaginable up to and including a spinal tap. After still no diagnosing GBS they did detect numeral blood clots. So, no IV plasma etc.\n\nThey left me alone for 5 days in the hospital bed. Physical Therapy did try to get me to walk the halls by holding me up but that was about it besides blood draws. \n\nI ended up with bed sores all over me. I had to argue with the staff for hours when I wanted to sign myself out. Hours later they reluctantly gave me a wheelchair for my mother to wheel me out after having to try to dress me. Hey he pain was excruciating.\n\nFive months later I am living with my parents after having to give up my house. I am getting more dexterity but still have no feeling in my arms and legs. It is a rough road but trying to stay positive. It was 10 days for me, I was out of the hospital after 6 days. 6 month recovery and 7 years of strange off and On issues with my left leg and ankle. The key to recovery is leading a healthy active lifestyle. Even if the simple activities feel like a marathon Key is aggressive, prompt treatment and a neurologist who has seen it before and knows what to do. \n\nDo not be shy about that last point.  If the neurologist you have is not up to the task, request a new one that has that experience with neuromuscular disease. This is not for the headache \"specialist.\"\n\nKeep the faith. I am so sorry. I started feeling weak and then a day later was essentially carried into the emergency room by my wife and mother. Within 24 hours I was on a ventilator. \n\nI was lucky where I was off it in two days but was still in the NCCU for about a week. Was put in the regular neuro wars for another week unable to walk and could barely move my arms. Spent two weeks in rehab after that learning to walk. Left using a walker. It is now been two years and you would not know what happened. I still have a lot of weakness and neuropathy but it does get better. It just takes a lot of time and treatment. \n\nI am so sorry for both you and your wife. I was put on ventilation within a few hours of arriving at a&amp;e and tetraplegic for just over two months.

Doctors told me I would most probably be in care for two years and a wheelchair for life. I never once accepted that. Left in November 2019.\n\nIt has not been easy but I left care after seven months with a frame and am currently walking few kms most days without an aid. I can also ride a bicycle again. Still cannot run, but I am working on it. \n\nBelieve the diagnosis but not the prognosis. \n\nThe mind is a powerful thing, determination and focus can achieve so much. Reassuring your wife will help even if it seems otherwise. It is confusing and scary, knowing she has your belief and support can achieve miracles. Love is the ultimate medicine.\n\nI wish you both lots of luck, for me it is been the hardest most beautiful lesson about life. Post Traumatic growth is real and achievable, you just have to want it. Feel free to message me directly if you want to chat. \nSending you positive energy 3 days for me. 3 weeks in ICU. 6 at a rehab center. One year later, 95% ok. \n\nIt will take time, but eventually she will recover. I started collapsing, my legs were giving out. The first hospital sent me home saying it was stress. The next day, my brother and sister took me to another hospital and by the time we got there my breathing was labored. I was in bad shape, intubated, hallucinating/nightmares. I was in the hospital for a month, inpatient rehab another month, living with family 2 more months and once I was home I did outpatient therapies. I regained my strength and independence within 6 months, but I have Chronic Fatigue. Like someone else said, aggressive therapies as soon as she regains movement is key. I went to Moss Rehab and highly recommend if there is one in your area, check with your insurance company what rehab places they will cover. It was this time 3 years ago I was relearning how to move, and now I am painting my basement. Good luck and hang in there, sending prayers your way. My husband was diagnosed with GBS at the start of 2019 (and eventually had the diagnosis changed to CIDP - the chronic version of GBS). He was paralyzed from the waist down when we made it to the emergency room. It was a very stressful time. He had two relapses, but has been stable for the last year and a half. He still has numbness in his hands and feet, but he learnt to walk again and we are currently expecting our first child.\n\nOne of the things that really helped me while he was in hospital was watching the YouTube videos of peoples recoveries. Seeing what the next year of recovery would look like really helped me process.\n\nWishing you and your wife the best. I am so sorry for all of this. I am sure you are feeling so overwhelmed, esp with the pandemic going on. Are you able to see her in the hospital? \n\nI had GBS in April this year. I was almost at the point of going on the vent, but since there was a shortage in my country bc of the pandemic, I was never actually on it. \nAt my worst I could not even keep my eyes shut bc my facial muscles stopped working first. I could not read anything on my phone anymore bc my eyes I guess stopped focusing well? Swallowing was impossible for me for about 4 days. \nWent from 110 lbs to 85 in 3 days, every part of my body felt so weak. My legs felt so heavy my head throbbed with every heartbeat.  \nNow about 4 months out, I am better than ever. I did have some problems with tingling, and random migraines here and there, but I am back to normal for the most part. I was able to go hiking and camping just last month. \n\nLike  said, I hope your specialists actually know what they are doing. If it does not seem like they are, do not be afraid to get second opinions! \n\nBest wishes. 110 lbs would need 498.95 human hairs to lift. This is assuming a hair can lift 100 grams, which is usualy but not always the case. 110 lbs is 49.94 kg 110 lbs is 49.94 kg Thank you everyone who have commented we really appreciate you sharing your stories.  \n\nIn terms of an update - yesterday was the first day I will say she did not get worse.  She is still breathing using her own muscles and the ventilator is adding in O2 to fill her lungs. She is a very strong person. I am really hoping for another day that she remains stable.  Today is day 3 of 5 for IVIG treatment.  \n\nLastly, I wanted to share how resourceful she is, When she wants something she is figured out how to flick off her o2 finger probe to set off the alarm because she knows they come running.  \n\nThank you all for the prayers and well wishes we really appreciate it. How is she managing? All the best. She received IVIG Sept 10 to 14.  On the 15th she was able to wiggle a couple fingers after being completely immobile. Everyday since she is improved a little, can lift her arms above her head, breathing has greatly improved.  Tonight is her first night to sleep without a ventilator since September 10th after 2 full days and only using when sleeping.  Her legs are slower to return but she is able to kick from a chair position.  She is still in the ICU but she will likely be moved to neurology this week.  \n\nShe is looking forward to the day her Tracheostomy comes out and she can drink water.  \n\nThank you all for your messages and experiences it is made the world of difference to us.", "For those of you who had a very slow recovery, how long did take you to make a full recovery? What symptoms took the longest to go away? So it is been four months since my GBS symptoms started. I have never had any of these symptoms before getting GBS. I have had one round of IVIG treatment last month. A lot of my symptoms, seem to have gone away completely, but others seem to linger. The nerve and muscle pain, feet tingling and severe headaches, seem to have gone away completely. Only symptoms I seem to have left are fast heart beat, low blood pressure, dizziness, pain/weakness in hands and feet. I have been reading that some people make a full recovery fairly quickly, while for others it takes a long time. For those of you who had a slow recovery, how long did it take to make a full recovery/good recovery? And what symptoms took the longest to go away?\n\nThanks for sharing. Just over 5 years out from a 6 month stay in hospital. I still have numb(ish) feet, balance issues and I will never run again.        \n\nOther than always have a muscle twitch *somewhere* I guess I am all good. 4 years out from 6 month stay in hospital. I could see slow and steady progress for like 2-3 years, and then the progress slowed down significantly. You will get there, given that you are only 4 months from the start of the symptoms! I was stilll in hospital at 4 months, learning to walk and eat by myself.  \n\n\nWishing you a quick and total recovery! My symptoms started this March. I spent 3 days in the hospital so I could see a neurologist. Currently I can only walk with a walker and I wear out fast. I have had IVIG 4 of my 7 times. Each helps some. Gabapentin mostly. I hope this gets better. I would like to drive myself again. My GBS diagnosis was February 2017, resulting in chin to toe paralization. They called it a severe case. After 2 rounds of IVIG, I began to slowly regain mobility, spending 3 months in the hospital (2 in ICU), then spent over 6 months in rehab. Today, the muscle strength is good, but the nerve pain and neuropathy remain. I still cannot feel several fingers, none of my toes, and the left shin is numb too. I take Gabapentin for the nerve pain, and use Aspercreme with Lidocain on my fingers and toes - it really helps. They told me the farthest extremties would take the longest - that makes sense as they are farthest from the spine.  I swim every weekday morning, walk 3-4 miles on weekend mornings, and play golf every week, so I am able to do things I like and the physical activity really helps. So, nearly 4 years later, I do not expect much to improve at this point, but if this is as good as it gets, I can live with it! Attitude is everything, my friend! Best of luck in your recovery. It does get better! February 2018. 3 months in the hospital (1 icu, 2 regular ward) then another almost 4 months in intensive therapy before I could even go back home. Had to stay at my mom's because I still needed around-the-clock care, but did not need immediate access to doctors. Still have a lot of pain and occasional numbness. Random double vision. Random trouble swallowing. Strength is still shot. Recovery time after activities is still a day or two. Balance is laughable. Get sick easily and when I do it is BAD. And half of my face is still partially paralyzed and numb.\n\nBut! Luckily for you, recovery time varies a lot from person to person. Some people get better with few to no lasting effects, some people never shake it. 4 years ago since diagnosis.  Running is bad, spinning teacup ride at an amusement park is worse.  Tingling has gone away for me, but what remains is poor balance especially when I do not get a good night sleep, and the worst is fatigue that comes and goes as it pleases.  I have learned to to adapt and look out for body signals, so I have much better \u201ccontrol\u201d of when fatigue is coming.\n\nWishing you a smooth recovery as well! I was diagnosed in August, but I was suffering unknowingly with gbs since about April. I am still recovering. My biggest problem was pain and losing my mobility. I was walking with a walker, showering with a chair, but with physio I have used one in a couple months. After nerve medication the pain has went away. I still struggle with my walking and walk with a limp, but everyday it is improving! Here are some things that helped me: Vibrant five fingers help with balance issues. They helped me walk without a cane. Massive B12 shots (3ml/day) helps with everything. These are over the counter in many countries. I have bought mine from Thailand. Just Google it. I am rowing on a rowing machine instead of running. Works great. I am one year out and still living with nerve pain and no sensation in my feet.  I use a cane most of the time.  Bad days (muscle fatigue) I use a walker.  The best thing I did for myself was start therapy for the PTSD that I developed while in the hospital (3 months).  Mental health plays a big part in your overall health. 2 years since my diagnosis. 1 month ICU and 4 months rehab. Paralyzed from neck to toes. Recovery is slow but I am 63, so not a spring chicken. Walking with walker, still have numbness in feet and hands, and nerve pain managed with gabapentin &amp; CBD oil. My balance is slow to return but I am working on strength in arms &amp; legs. Yes, attitude is 90 percent of recovery. Keep up the work and do not give up! Diagnosed in early September, paralyzed from neck to toes, 1 month in ICU and other month in a rehab center. I have nerve pain in hands and feet, with no sensation on the latter. I walk by myself but wearing afo braces for my slight foot drop. Other than foot drop, nerve pain and no sensation on toes, I am pretty well. Hi! I am in a similar situation as yours, diagnosed September 2019, still have a very bilateral paralyzed face. Do you still notice progress as youre approaching 2 years since diagnosis? Thank you! *Incredibly* slow progress. Like. I can tell a difference between now and six months ago, but not between now and last month. Especially when I am tired, because the problem is more noticeable which also makes the progress more noticeable. Six months ago, when I was tired, my speech would slur pretty badly, that side of my face would be heavy and sluggish, and that eyelid would droop almost closed. But now! Same issues, just way less severe. \n\nHighly recommend one of those jade (or whatever) face roller massage things. I like to use it in the morning and it really does feel like it makes a difference for the day. Then if I get tired at some point and start noticing my face being silly, I use the roller a little bit and it helps. Kind Of like doing push-ups before a date or something. Makes a noticeable, if temporary, difference.", "COVID-19 VACCINE 2nd Dose The COVID-19 Vaccine #2 Update \n\nI want to be completely honest with everyone in this group about my experience getting vaccinated for COVID-19 because I know there are so many people who are struggling with this decision right now.\n\nI am writing this the day after my SECOND vaccine and I want to be completely transparent-I am really struggling physically today. I have a horrible headache, fever, chills, body aches and pain in my joints. It is definitely far worse than the first one. \n\nAlso, I was not able to sleep well last night because of the same symptoms plus I had some numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. The numbness and tingling has stopped but it sent my anxiety through the roof which I was not prepared for. I was really questioning whether or not I had made the right decision in getting the vaccine. \n\nNow I pretty much feel like I have the flu and yes the second dose is worse (I was prepared for it to be) than the first one. I could not even get out of bed this morning. If you get this vaccine be prepared to miss work and all other activities. \n\nSo there you have it folks-day two post second COVID-19 vaccine. Thanks for sharing. \n\nIt does sound like the known potential side effects for the vaccine. \n\nThat being said, I wonder if it is better to wait for the J&amp;J vaccine which is one shot. My doctor did clear me to get the vaccine once it is available (finished subq recently), but I have been a bit nervous about it. Thanks for this info. After my tetanus vaccine a few months ago I had similar sensations, they are still coming and going, but not nearly as severe as what you are describing.\n\nPlease keep us in the loop with updates, thanks! Also at day two post second dose.  Symptoms are strikingly similar.  Feel miserable and I am thrilled.  Good that the body is responding as though lots of energy is going to produce antibodies.  I would be more concerned if I felt no reaction. Yes! We will make it and it will be worth it! Thanks for the update.  My second shot is scheduled Monday, and I already booked off Tuesday sick. My second shot (Pfizer) gave me absolutely no symptoms. Arm was barely sore. Either I developed no antibodies or my IG treatment had already gotten my immune system used to corona virus antibodies. The younger, healthier coworkers tended to get the most reactions in our workplace. I see a pattern of females with their second moderna shot feeling flu-like for a couple days. Do you fit that demographic? All those symptoms are exactly what tells you your body is doing its job correctly. Congratulate yourself! Hi! Any updates these months out from your second dose? Hope all is well!", "Back in hospital one month after ivig Welp, turns out it is CIDP and so I am here for 5 doses of iv prednisone. Exactly one month after my last ivig treatment I woke up and could not walk. I had never had that much trouble before that. Luckily I am responding well to the prednisone so I am hopeful for a good recovery and maybe even remission! Good luck!! I hope you make a speedy recovery! Sorry to hear that. Good luck and do not give up. My wife was first hospitalized last July and had probably had to go back to the hospital 5 times since. She is doing much better currently. Good to hear! What did they treat her with? I had a bad reaction to the ivig so now we are trying iv methylprednisone.  I would love to know what worked for her. My wife said she had a bar reaction to ivig and they premeditated her with benadryl and tyenol.", "Megathread: The coronavirus vaccines and us There have been conflicting reports from CDC and GBS/CIFP foundation so I want to create this megathread for us to discuss the vaccine. My personal experience: I visited my GP today in Australia and discussed this during the consultation. My GP thinks I should absolutely avoid the vaccines right now, based on where we are and my medical history.\n\nCaveats:\n\n- I am in *Western Australia* where there is no community spread \n\n- The vaccine schedule in Australia is far more delayed and we likely are not starting it in earnest until March or April\n\n- My GP errs on the side of caution\n\n- My GBS was very long ago and I did not have treatments which are common now\n\n- My GBS was fairly extreme in how far it advanced before treatment. I was not brought in for treatment until it had ascended almost fully up both my arms and legs and I was unable to walk or lift items and as a result I needed artificial respiration\n\n- My intial infection vector is unknown and could be vaccine-based\n\n- My mother refuses to share or clarify my medical history so we have a large window of unknowns we are working with\n\nBeing in WA means my treatment advice is incredibly locally specific. Your own GP may have different suggestions. For me, my known (and unknown) medical history + the low community risk is why we decided this, but I suspect I am an incredibly niche case here. \n\nSidenote: search around to find a GP who understands GBS. I did that before this and I am so grateful and feel very safe under his care. My father had GBS in 2016. He got the Pfizer vaccine on January 9th. So far so good.  Will get second shot in a couple of weeks.\n\nEdit: He is 74 and we live in Florida, USA  My father is 77 and got his first dose yesterday. Consulting with his neurologist helped us determine that contracting covid would be worse than the vax in any scenario, and keeping him in a bubble is unrealistic. That slight chance of GBS relapse from a vaccine is equal to that of actual COVID infection, and normal symptoms COVID infection would probably devastating for a person in his age group. Harm reduction analysis helped us choose for getting the vax. Interesting.  FWIW, I agree with your choice, it makes sense.\n\nMy medical experience with gbs is very similar to yours, but I am in California and due to that alone would like to get the vaccine so I can get out of my damned apartment Yes this is exactly why I am emphasizing the importance of personal circumstances. Covid here vs Cali is totally night and day. The risk of having a GBS-induced reaction to a COVID infection is higher than a GBS reaction to the vaccine partly because your chances of getting covid are MUCH higher every day of every month of every year. so a 4% chance of contracting COVID every day you are exposed to someone vs a 3-5% chance with a single vaccination cycle. The math says to get vaccinated and roll the dice. \n\n\n\nHaving said that, I will wait until the end of the year if possible to allow as much data to be collected worldwide and reported. My neurologist also suggested to avoid vaccine. My first gbs as a child was caused by flu vaccine. Or shortly thereafter. I suppose is the best way to say it. I have had both Pfizer shots. Nothing but a sore arm the first time. I have Epi pens for anaphylaxis responses plus the ones they send in my IG emergency kit, did not need them. I got CIDP from a poorly attenuated H1N1 shot back in \u201809. But if you look at how H1N1 causes CIDP, and compare it to how the Pfizer vac just gives your body instructions on how to make spike protein antibodies, it makes sense to get vaccinated. Can you explain your math, where these figures came from?\n\nI have never heard that there is a 4% chance of contracting COVID on a daily basis.\n\nIs the 3-5% you are citing from the fact that the vaccine is 95-97% effective in tests? it has nothing to do with the vaccine efficacy. It is all about % of re-occurrence or actually dying/disability from COVID19. \n\n\n1-3% (3% worst case) is the chance of re-occurrence of GBS from any viral infection, it is extremely low.  Your chance of having a repeat GBS event from the vaccine is theoretically just around 3%  (one time only). \n\nNow....if you do not get vaccinated and go on with your life:  While most states have a 5% infection rate,  you are running a chance of being exposed, getting the/a virus at a higher % every time you are out and about. Not to mention the chance (2%) that you die From COVID19 or have permanent side effects worse than GBS long term,  than the vaccine GBS risk (depending on the current infection rates in your area). \n\nA 3% risk of a 5% potential exposure risk daily seems small but in compounds over time. \n\n\nIn all situations, exposure, getting sick, permanent disability, including dying, etc. risks on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis (depending on your work home situations) are higher than the risk the vaccine could ever pose. \n\nWhen I wrote this 1 in 46 people were currently contagious in my general area with a higher than 8% infection rate state-wide.  This never accounted for any of the mutated super contagious variants. \n\nIn no situation is not getting the vaccine safer than getting it as time goes on barring an unforeseen side effect.. \n\n\nHaving said that I am still going to wait a bit until more data is collected for GBS folks like myself. We are still on the list of \"No-go\" according to Fauci because we just need a ton more data as inoculations move forward. Good link, thanks! \n\nI am personally avoiding the vaccine because that is what my GP advises, but I am in a unique situation in that I am in Western Australia where covid barely exists - I think if I were still in America, the GP suggestion would be different. Hey GBS Family,\n\nI got different feedback from each neurologist I talked to about the COVID Modena vaccine. I decided that the rna based vaccine feels less risky because of how the mechanism for creating antibodies works. I got GBS February 6, 2020. I had my first vaccination shot with the Medina vaccine about four weeks ago yesterday I got the second shot. After the first shot my arm was very sore for a couple days and I immediately felt a few GBS style tingles in my arm and in my feet but nothing aside from that and all of the symptoms of the first shot went away after a couple days. My lingering symptoms from GBS are general fatigue and when I do not get enough sleep or if I am exhausted I will get tingles in my feet and hands. Yesterday I got the second round of the vaccination and again immediately felt some bizarre very focal nerve pains immediately after getting the shot they subsided but towards the end of the evening when I was up rather late I did start to have a general malaise and I was even having some visual weirdness akin initially had GBS. I woke up this morning with the expected symptoms of the second round of vaccination which are over all body soreness and all of my muscles a general fatigue some GBS like tingling in my hands and feet as well as a headache and general malaise. This feels like a viral infection much like the virus they gave me GBS in the first place which was the Epstein-Barr virus or mono but it does not feel out of what was described from most peoples experience of getting the vaccination. I expected to have a much more intense set of symptoms from the second vaccination which is what the pharmacist who gave me both doses prepared me for I do not think that I am going into a GBS backslide but I will keep this thread posted over the next few days in case anything changes it seems like I am having exactly what most people experience after getting those rounds a vaccination. When I was deciding whether or not to get the vaccination I determined that an RN a vaccine was a much safer bet than an actual viral infection both have the possibility of triggering GBS but as far as I can see on the Internet I do not see any evidence that the Moderna are in a vaccine has created a GBS response in any patients. Feel free to send me a direct message if you want to chat about the vaccine or about my experience getting the vaccine I am always here to be helpful for anybody. Hey guys, Found some articles that I found interesting. And I am going to talk to my neurologist about them tomorrow and decide if I am going to get them. Theses articles show cases of GBS following covid-19 vaccine: \n\n\n\n Non-AMP Link: (\n\nI am a bot. ( | ( | ( I had GB 30 years ago as an 18 year old after having the flu. \n\nI had the first shot of the Pfizer vaccine on Feb 3rd and everything has been fine.  I was concerned because I would had GB, granted a long time ago but still.\n\nUnfortunately I fell on ice 3 dsys before and broke my nose &amp; cut it pretty badly which necessitated a tetnus shot.  The following day I took my weekly biologic shot from my auto immune disorder &amp; then a day later the Covid vaccine so my immune system was probably banging away from all that.\n\nGet my 2nd dose in 2 days &amp; am wondering if I will have any type of reaction.  The only other vaccines I have had in the past 30 years are hepatitis &amp; tetanus, never a flu one obviously, and no problems from either one.\n\nI am glad to read thru this thread because even though it is been a long time I still worry about getting GB again.  I do not think I would do so well bouncing back this time. I also had GBS as a teenager in the early '90s, so I am in the same boat as you. I have not had to think too much about it for decades, but now of course it is on my mind every day. I have an appointment with a neurologist in a couple of weeks to ask some questions about the vaccines. Until then, I am just monitoring this thread closely. Thanks for posting your experience here. It is really helpful. Good luck! Care to folllw up? Got scheduled for Pfizer shot #1 tomorrow (Northern California), 26 years out from my GBS experience. Nervous but looking forward to it. Please DM me or reply here if you have any questions... and I will try to remember to update this over time. I had GBS in 2000 and fully recovered. I work in a High School, and I am scheduled to get my first Moderna Covid shot tomorrow. \n\nI am nervous, but also incredibly excited. I have extreme anxiety about Covid and it is caused a lot of obsessive behaviors, anger and frustration at others, and depression. I will feel much better knowing that I am protected. I think the risk is worth it. I will update this sub to let the community know if I have any side effects. so far so good I also have facial nerve damage from GBS! You do not hear about it often, so just wanted to say hello!\n\nI am scheduled to get a first dose on Friday and the part I have been most nervous about is a full facial paralysis again (my GBS was a unique case). Glad to see you are doing well after the first shot, that gives a but of comfort to my nervous self! Good luck on your first dose! Hi everyone I had GBS 6-7 years ago after receiving the flu vaccine. I also caught COVID back in November and currently have antibodies but am eligible for the vaccine now. I am concerned about which vaccine to get and also if it may potentially cause more issues since I already have antibodies and I do not want to overload my body. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. All of my doctors have been saying it is my choice and I do not know what to do. How is he doing? He is doing great. Hi everyone, I had GBS 9 years ago at age 19 that was triggered by a respiratory infection. I got my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a few days ago. Only symptoms were a sore arm for about 36 hours, a headache for about the same amount of time (went away with a couple doses of ibuprofen), and some nausea the night after that may or may not have been related. Next dose scheduled for end of the month. Awesome!  I got my first shot nine days ago. Ok so far. Great to hear. I just had my 2nd Pfizer shot about 3 hours ago. I am doing fine so far, but noticing a mild sore throat -- though that is said to NOT be a side effect of the vaccine. I am a little tired but I slept badly last night so that is probably why.\n\nI will update again tomorrow. Thanks for the update!!\n\n\nI took my first shit of Pfizer yesterday.....I will update when I get 2nd shit... Assuming you meant SHOT, but...\n\nThe night of day 1 was a little rough, some chills and a lot of body aches throughout my body -- literally everywhere. I had some of that tingling in my face and fingers, the residual stuff I feel any time I have a cold, but that passed by lunchtime. I went to the gym and did a little cardio to try to keep my muscles loosening up, which was effective. Most of the pain is gone now, save for a low-grade headache. I will report back in a couple of weeks but feel like I am out of the woods, side effect wise, about 28 hours after the shot. If anything develops in the meantime, I will try to let you know. Yes I mean shot lol My father (66) had the 2nd shot of pfizer Wednesday, 14th of April. Experienced severe muscle spasms Thursday and went to the ER, sent him home with pain killers and muscle relaxers.  He woke up this morning and could not move.  Able to slightly move his arms but could not sit up or move legs. He is in ICU right now and had surgery to relieve some pressure on a nerve. \nThe doctors are saying the vaccine triggered this reaction and has caused guillain-barre syndrome. I have never heard of it. \nReading thru your posts I see a lot of GBS had begun after a vaccine.  It is not confirmed just yet its GBS but it really sounds like it reading everyones experience.\nCan someone please explain to me what I can expect for him? Recovery, overall well being and pain? I am really scared for him. Thank you Final update now that I am officially \"fully vaccinated.\" I had a very weird night about a week ago, strange sensations and \"buzzing\" all over my body that made me seriously panic, but I finally fell asleep and in the morning I felt completely fine. No idea what caused that, probably unrelated. But other than that, everything's been fine. Happy to be done with shots (for now, anyway). Howd u do with your 2nd shot? No problem! Barely sore arm for one day. Vaccine for everyone! Any issues after your second shot?  Just got my first today Thanks for that link. I heard Fauci say to avoid it, but not the follow up I ran a 100\u00b0 (f) fever and all over body aches for 12 hours, starting at the 20 hour mark. Was really extra tired after work the following day. Seem to be back to normal at day 3.   Wife got her second shot Friday\u2014no side effects. Thanks for the follow up! My GBS symptoms began 3 days after my first Pfizer shot Quick follow-up- I have since had both Moderna shots (2nd was on 4/21).  After the first I had some pins and needles in my face and arms - it was minor and went away after about 4 days.  I had looked that up and it was reported that some people get that for a few days.  After the second shots, no pins and needles, but the same as many people report: chills, fever, body aches and sore joints.  It started about 16 hours after the shot and was gone by the 24 hour mark.  I did have fatigue that lasted another day.  But all in all, same reaction as everyone else and 5 days out all is fine. Interesting. Walgreens in Oregon asks if you have had any other shots in the two weeks prior, and does not want you to get the Pfizer shot if you would done a different vaccine recently. Had you had it previously? Nope first onset Mine was gradual, could not grip onto heavy items at first, had trouble running. It got worse over a week or two (it is been a long time.) I did get a spinal tap, which was the most painful part of the whole ordeal. \n\nIve not heard of spasms, and next-day not able to walk. That is some seriously fast onset if it is indeed GBS. But I have also not heard of surgery on a nerve. When I went for my initial vaccine injection they asked me if I would had any other vaccines recently &amp; I explained to them I had.  I really has not even thought about all the other stuff until they asked.\nThe nurses there said they were not able to give medical advice on whether or not I should go ahead.  They left it up to me &amp; since I was there already I decided to proceed.  Everything was fine but if I would had to make an appointment that day I probably would have waited 2 weeks. Thanks for the update!  I had my first shot 30 hours ago, and so far just some soreness and a headache to report Do u mind me asking if you have an autoimmune disorder now?  \n\nI have psoriatic arthritis now, which is basically an overactive immune system attacking various parts of my body &amp; I always wonder if the two things are connected.  Also the one injected medication I am on for the psoriatic arthritis has a side effect of GB, yippee.  When I first went on it my rheumatologist &amp; I had a long conversation about my concerns &amp; I ultimately went on it after weighing the pros &amp; cons.  \n\nI have to say I ultimately felt more confident after listening to an author, who I believe did medical type, research stuff books, say he had GB and had talked to the people he used to research stuff for the book about him taking the covid vaccine after having GB &amp; he felt very comfortable taking it.  Not a lot to go on I know.  I will have to go back &amp; see exactly who it was.\n\nGood luck with your appointment, I hope you get information that helps you feel confident in whatever decision you make re vaccination.\n\nEdited to add:. I believe the interview was with Lawerence Wright on the Joe Rogan Show in early January. I have never had an autoimmune disorder other than the GBS, thankfully. \n\nAnd thanks for the well wishes. The neurologist gave me the all clear back in March, and I am the happy recipient of two shots of the Pfizer vaccine, with no complications to report. I am feeling good and starting to return to parts of normal life. That Is great, glad for you that you got the info you needed to make a decision!\n\nThanks for indulging my curiosity about other autoimmune disorders after GB. Hi everyone thanks for sharing your experiences.\n\nDiagnosed with GBS about 4.5 years ago.  Cleared from my doctor to receive Covid vaccine - as long as its the mRNA.  Received first Moderna shot last Saturday and had a sore arm for about 72 hours.  The past few nights have been bad for my legs, the constant throbbing of muscles and even one morning I felt tingling in the toes.  The tingling is gone but the throbbing is still there, even as I sit on my chair.  I was nervous at first, but I would like to think I am back to my \u201ctake it a day at a time\u201d mentality but cautiously monitoring if symptoms worsen.\n\nUnfortunately due to supply issues in Canada, I will need to wait 4 months for my second shot lol \n\nStay safe everyone. Just received my pfizer dose 1 after careful consideration, lots of research, and consultation with my GP. I am 15 years out from GBS, and must admit I have alot of anxiety and fear around getting vaccinated despite the rational understanding that there is a very small chance of recurrence of GBS.\nI will plan to give updates on here to let you all know how things go moving forward. Appreciate you all for holding this community for us to be a part of. Heya - checking in. How are you doing now, post vaccine #2? Thanks for reminding me! I got the second dose a few days ago. I was completely fine for the first 24 hours and then got hit with full body aches that lasted about 12 hours. The next day or two I was pretty tired and had a mild headache, but once that cleared up I did not get any other symptoms, and now I am completely back to normal. Please note: I am in no way an antivaxxer. I have been vaccinated, I encourage others to do the same, and I believe in science. With that disclaimer out of the way, my mom got her first dose of the covid vaccine back in February and about a week later developed what they believe is GBS (Guillan Barre Syndrome). She is in a lot of pain, very at risk, no one can give her answers, she is not allowed to get the 2nd vaccine, and they cannot be sure of the efficacy of the first vaccine due to the treatments she received in the hospital. I am seeking info on any studies/trials that are quantifying vaccine efficacy. So far all her antibodies tests have come back negative. I read some stuff on T cells and the UK's t-spot discovery kit. We are in the US. If anyone has any leads, I would be eternally grateful. I keep seeing almost everyone is had the Pfizer vaccine (RNA) but has anyone had a Vector Vaccine? (CanSino, specifically?) Update: \nHad joint pain in days after the vaccine. I also did a 10mile, intense bike ride on Sunday which got my knees hurting more than normal. Anxiety increased because my legs have felt extra tired since monday, but at this point I am attributing that to the bike ride and not anything likely to do with my history of GBS. Probably should have like, taken it easy after the vaccine but I love biking. Neuropathy flared up in my feet since vaccine, but no other neurological effects. Finally feeling like my legs are going back to normal. Will keep updating as things change/evolve and after second vaccine. Another update as of 5/10/2021 everything is back to normal for my body. I will update you all when I get the second vaccine :) I am also member of the Crooked Smile Club. ;\\] I have had GBS twice so I am waiting a bit to see if more data comes out, but am extremely appreciative of this thread. So glad I found this thread, every doctor I have spoken to has had a different opinion. I had GBS age 5 (now 30) and was heavily affected by it. It was brought on by the MMR jab. \n\nI have been super nervous about having the vaccine but I went to go get the Pfizer due to a surplus at my local vaccine spot, but when I mentioned GBS they all got weird and said I should get it done in a hospital. \n\nHaving now found this thread and seen that there does not seem to be any one being affected by it for a second time I think I will go back and get it done. \n\nI read of just one case of GBS but that was from the Astra vaccine. My mother got GBS from a flu shot 15 years ago and we are both concerned about COVID and wether or not we will be able to get the vaccine. Planning to talk to our doctors about it soon. I am glad I have found this subreddit!\n\nUpdate: I was just talking to my mother about this whole situation and she told me that a cousin of mine on my father\u2019s side also got GBS from a flu shot. Now that I know it is happened on both sides of my family, I am really uncertain if I should get the shot. I really want to get vaccinated since I live in the selfish jerk capital of the world (USA) and most people here refuse to mask or distance. This thread is giving me hope! I would continue to mask myself but I would feel so much better with another layer of protection! \nI had GBS from a Pfizer flu vaccine in 2005. I am also in the droopy face club. I am left side affected.\nResidual symptom worst for me is fatigue and restless leg syndrome. I get RLS in my arms too sometimes.\nI will update if I decide to get vaccinated. My doc told me to go ahead with any mRNA vaccine - which is either Pfizer or Moderna. I had the Pfizer first dose two weeks ago and so far I have felt absolutely nothing besides a mildly sore arm. I am 29 now and had severe GBS causing full paralysis from the neck down when I was 7-8 years old. How is your father doing? Hope to hear your 2nd dose goes okay! Thank you, I appreciate it! Hoping it goes ok too. Scheduled for 2 days from now (Thursday!). I will update afterwards and in the weeks following I just got dose 2 yesterday and I am in that liminal space of \u201cthings could start happening any moment...\u201d wish you the best! My doctor told me he would not advise getting the vaccine but the CDC told me I should be ok, just to avoid the J&amp;J. I have had GBS twice, once when I was ten and once when I was seventeen. I got my first shot of the Moderna a couple hours ago. So far no symptoms! Hes slowly improving.  Right arm is strongest,  left arm is still struggling.  Legs are fairly strong and working on walking (well assisted).  I see improvement but he is discouraged.  Good days and bad. Hes still in a rehab but will soon be moved to another place (cause insurance sucks!). Very hopeful and all in due time he will get there. But, its a long road. \nSo appreciate the check in! I am glad to hear he is improving but I am so sorry he is had to go through this all. Did he get a definite GBS diagnosis? Since I got GBS from the AstraZeneca vaccine, my doctors have said I should avoid my second shot Got my first Pfizer dose 6 hours ago. Just a little tired and my arm hurts but nothing too crazy. Had GBS 13 years ago. My vaccine experience with CIDP:\n\nI had my Pfizer vaccine exactly 7 days ago. I had CIDP diagnosed in 2008 with no known flare-ups and unknown initial cause.\nI was very worried about taking the vaccine despite my diagnosis being so long ago, but I did my research and so far, it has gone fairly well although I did have some symptoms which I will update and document.\n\nTimeline:\n- Approx 4 hours after the vaccine\n \nFeeling completley wiped out and lethargic, as if someobody had zapped any last remaining energy from my body, I immediately went for a midday nap and had a sleep I found it extremely difficult to wake up from. My entire body felt weak, and I struggled (more than normal!) to get out of bed.\nI felt uncoordinated and clumsy, walking into things and dropping things, scarily reminiscent of my CIDP symptoms. I had really bad brain fog, bad memory, and was forgetting how to do simple tasks like use a petrol pump to fill up my car. Felt a bit like being drunk/concussed for! Not pleasant.\n\n- Approx 10 hours after vaccine\n\nMental confusion continues. Pain radiating sharply in my vaccine arm, neck and wrists. My vaccine arms feels stiff at the elbow joint and it is hard to drive. I get some tingling in my face and feet.\n\n- Next day\n\nAbsolutely normal all day, no symptoms.\n\n- 2 days after\n\nI develop a sore throat and what feels like a swollen tongue, it hurts to swallow food. \n\n- 3 days after\n\nSore throat gets worse in severity, it feels like I have a cold. Immune system kicking in and working well?\n\n- Day 4\n\nSore throat eases but is still present, tongue no longer feels swollen.\n\n- Day 5 - 7\n\nBack to normal, no symptoms. Although I do feel much tireder and weaker than normal.\n\nSo far it seems everything has gone well. The side effects I described, on researching, are all fairly common for the Pfizer vaccine as found in the clinical trials. I will update after another week, and 1 month. I am interested to hear more. I am in the hospital now being treated for GBS. I received my first dose of AZ 12 days ago. Sorry to hear that. My doctors included on my discharge papers last week to avoid the second shot till more studies have been conducted. Can I ask what country you are in? Canada If you want to chat DM me and I can get you my info Update after does #2: \nReceived on 5/20 (today is 5/23). Sore arm was evident. Starting about 6 hours after, abdominal cramping and digestive issues (apparently common). That lasted about 48 hours. Now, three days out only side effect in feeling is my sore arm....zero neurological symptoms, feeling good actually! I will update in a couple more weeks, or if things change. my grandma got the Sputnik vaccine and a month later died of respiratory failure due to GBS, i do not know how they would be related but I am learning she was not the only one. \n\nI do not understand how though, because the vaccine cointains an inactivated virus. The antibodies that are supposed to fight covid got her nerves instead? Does anyone have any study about the vaccine in people who have had GBS? Feel good anecdotes about feeling fine a week after the shot is well and good but are meaningless in the grand scheme. \n\nHow is this shot any better then other vaccines we are told to avoid? As the risk of getting covid lowers due to herd immunity and vaccinations is it worth the risk to take the shot with a prehistory of GBS?\n\nWhy have people with GBS not been given clear science based judgement for them as individuals? My husband 58 got GBS for the first time in his life almost a month after receiving his second Moderna vaccine. In all of his diagnostic testing, elevated proteins in his spinal fluid is all they could find to be the cause. No infection was present. Not having any idea if it was the vaccine and not having experience with this syndrome. I have questions about susceptibility now. Is there risk with flu or pneumonia vaccines or immune suppressant medications? What would be the advise of those that have had GBS? How has it affected how you conduct your medical decisions? \nWe were able to catch it early within the first week of onset and he received 5 days of IVIG inpatient.  He is in his first week of being home. Mostly affected facial nerves, fingers and toes, some balance issues and head/neck pain.  Thank you Hello! I hope you are well and doing good. Hello. I have had GBS when I was 8 years old. Now, I am 24. When did u get GBS and how was your recovery after first time. Back then, I was told that this was very rare like 1 in a million chances. Getting it twice is 10^(-10). Any idea why you had relapse? Thanks in advance. Exactly Same for me! How are now? Did u get IVIG? Please share your experience when possible. Thanks in advance I am ok, walking with a walker very slowly now. I was paralyzed twice which I am still coping with psychologically. I got IVIG 4/1-5, but then got worse 2 weeks later, so I went back to the hospital and got plasmaphresis. Hello! Thanks again for the reply. I hope you get well soon. It takes a lot of patience and time to regain strength like earlier. Please take OT and PT after your Plasma Therapy. You will get back to normal. I wish for a speedy recovery. I was told the same thing: that it was a 1 in 10,000 chance of getting it, and that getting it once did not increase your chances of getting it again. (Which would make it a 1 in 100,000,000 chance to get it twice, right?)\n\nThe first time I had GBS it was when I was 10 years old. It was spurred by some kind of flu-like illness beforehand. I was in the hospital for only a weekend, and it took maybe three months total to fully recover.\n\nThe second time I was 17. It was spurred by intense stress and illness, and was much more severe. I was in the hospital for about three months and it took over a year to fully recover. As I said, I still have minor facial paralysis, and I walk a bit funny because my insurance stopped paying for physical therapy. It was same for me as well. Just before I got GBS, I had severe fever and cold. \n\nPlease continue physiotherapy and other physical exercises. It will help you regain strength. My doctor said that exercises were only the way I can be back to normal. \n\nPlease take care. Thanks for the reply. Another update! Almost three weeks out from 2nd dose of Pfizer, feeling great! No big issues, no neurological flare ups at all. Will update if anything changes! How are you doing? I agonized about getting the vaccine ever since it received authorization. After scrubbing the internet and talking to my doctor I set a date in my mind that by June 1st, after millions of people have been vaccinated and more data was available if the CDC still recommended it for GBS patients, I would get it. So on June 6th I got my first shot of Moderna. My arm was sore for a couple days and that is it! The relief I feel is indescribable. I had GBS 35 years ago. I have been told not to get the flu shot or a tetanus shot and now that I am approaching that age I should not get a shingles shot either. But, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are formulated differently and therefore are safe for people like me. All I can say is, please do not worry, get vaccinated. Getting Covid could cause a flare or worse, live your life and help your community. Happy to find this thread. I had GBS as a kid... Like 30 years ago and I was hesitant to get the vaccine. This thread and a lot of reading has convinced me to get it soon. Thanks! Thank you! My second dose experience was nowhere near as fucked up as the first. I had slight numbness but nothing like the terrifying numbness after first dose. Still struggling with autoimmune neuropathy but I am finally on a trip and getting to enjoy some destressing. How are you? I was on a call (called the coffee chat or something) sponsored by the GBS/CIDP foundation.  There were 19 of us on the call.  2 were new GBS patients that developed within 2 weeks of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.  There was one other (previous GBS) that had an adverse reaction to the Moderna vaccine that required hospitalization.  I am about 16 months post hospitalization for GBS after a minor surgery that included IV antibiotics - I believe this was my trigger but there is not a doctor anywhere that will touch what caused it...  Anywho my primary care doc said no flu shot, no Covid shot - just not sure of the outcome. There \"is\" herd immunity with Covid look it up... the experts agree. Glad to hear it was not as bad! How scary that must have been :( The anxiety of the vaccination process on top of Covid anxiety is a lot. Glad you get a chance to go on a trip and relax! \nI am doing great! I felt shitty for the following 36 hours after my second dose but no neurological symptoms (unlike my first dose where I had quite a bit of neuropathy flare up). Weeks out im doing great - just so glad to be vaccinated now GBS onset February 10th 2020 you beat me by 4 days, lol.  My provider suggested I not take the vaccine which I am fine with.  My wife had Covid as did my sons girlfriend and a couple friends.  I got sick, not sure if it was Covid, never got tested did not see the point as everyone I know who was tested was never treated, just sent home.  Point being if given the choice, I would take getting Covid any freaking day over what I went through (ongoing) with GBS. Thankfully they caught it early!  It will get better with time (and patience).    \nI cannot find a doctor that will even speculate what caused it for me so I have poured through hundreds of case studies and documentation to find the determination on my own, or at least as close as I can get to it.  In my case it was within two weeks of a minor surgery but there a numerous articles pointing to the IV antibiotics they gave me during surgery.  \nFor me personally, I am hesitant to put any damn chemicals/vaccines into my body.  As I posted previously if given the choice I would take a Covid infection over GBS any day of the week.  I used to have to get the flu vaccine every year (work requirement), on my providers suggestion we opted out last year but I will also continue to opt out, not worth the risk for such little benefit. Not four months ago you tool. \n\n\nWe need to reach a 70% rate to have true herd immunity. We are not there yet. Does / can it exist?....sure, we are not quite there. You said \"there is no herd immunity with Covid\" now you clarify with 4 months ago and call me tool... yeah OK, solid work man.  Grow up and work on your statistical math while you are at it...\n\nHere let me help, there is no herd immunity with Covid, yet. Wonderful, glad to hear it :) :) There was no herd immunity. Context of the time of the conversation. Also, there still is not herd immunity, but we are getting close. Which is good.  \n\n4 months ago (when the comment was written) most states were still only allowing 50+ and at risk to vaccinate.  Less than 15% of the country was vaccinated. Most states were seeing the highest % of infections since the pandemic began. There was not herd immunity and all data was showing zero GBS risk with the mRNA and nothing more than normal GBS rates 1:280,000 rates with the JJ AZ vaccines. Herd immunity was not even in the cards of the conversation at the time.  The comment was posted 4 months ago, and herd immunity did not exist, nor does it now.  \n\nYou were reading it as an absolute statement without the context of the conversation. My mother had GBS in 1987 and has had lingering nerve issues since. She has also had colon and breast cancer since then that she beat. \n\nShe has had several doctor\u2019s tell her it was ok to get the vaccine and several other doctors tell her it was not a good idea. The pharmacist at Walgreens told her just today not to get the shot. \n\nShe wants it but is too afraid to get the shot. She has said repeatedly that she would rather die than go through GBS again. I had GBS in 1995. Got my first shot of Pfizer March 24th and second shot June 9. Other than a sore arm, I had no issues. I am a GBS survivor of 15 years. I got my 1st Pfizer shot Friday (6-25-21) evening. At the 24 hour mark I had swelling and itching on the lower half of my forearm, my forefinger and thumb, along with mild soreness at the injection site (all on the injection side. My right).\nAt hour 36, the left side of my forehead and the apple area of my left cheek were swollen and my eye felt like it was going numb (like when you get lots of novocaine at the dentist, kind of like your eye was exposed to strong wind). \nI added this odd swelling on my daily Vsafe account. Today I got my first Pfizer shot. The arm is very mildly sore so far but that is it. Of course a few hours later I look on Daily Mail Online and the headline is breaking news that J&amp;J vax caused Guillain-Barre in around 100 people, mostly men over the age of 50. I decided to go with the Pfizer shot after reading here, and was debating whether or not to go up until I just went and got it over with. If anything, I am a little nervous because I was struck down 3 years ago in August; I always get anxious around bad anniversary dates. Yes, cannot emphasize enough to do all of the therapies, months of therapies, until you regain your strength. It took me 6 months to get all movements back (I was a worst-case scenario). Physical and occupational, inpatient outpatient and at home. I feel you. I got Moderna over 2 weeks ago after waiting a while and now this headline comes up. Sketch", "Encouragement to advocate!! TW: GBS death I want to share our family's experience with GBS, partly for catharsis and partly to encourage you to advocate and seek second opinions.\n\nMy brother was diagnosed with GBS in mid-August of this year. Over the course of a week, he experienced loss of sensation in his hands and feet, then loss of balance, and paralysis of his upper and lower extremities. They initially thought the paresthesia was due to anxiety, and there were a few days of ER and doctor visits without any answers. \n\nHe started having a facial droop, and after the doctors ruled out stroke, they confirmed GBS with a spinal tap. We were relieved to finally know what was going on and we are hopeful with the prognosis. My brother was diagnosed with the Miller-Fischer variant of GBS and was started on IVIG. He then got plasmapheresis. This entire time, he was under the care of respiratory therapists who continued to confirm that based on his spirometer numbers and oxygen levels, he did not need to be on a vent. \n\nHe was discharged from the ICU after 2 weeks, and went straight to rehab, where he got 3 hours of services a day. He complained of chest tightness and fatigue and it was dismissed as anxiety. Typically in rehab he had been monitored at night, but for some reason one night he was not. My dad, who was sleeping in the rehab room that night, woke up to find my brother not breathing. We have no idea how long he was gone.\n\nHe coded twice that night and finally became stable, but was unresponsive and on life support. After 5 days like this, we were told he was brain dead. He was an organ donor, which we are thankful for, but it is such a small consolation.\n\nI have really hesitated sharing this story with this community, but if it can convince anyone to advocate more for their care or push for second opinions, it is worth it. I do not wish this situation on any family. Please listen to your body and demand good care- ask for physicians who have seen GBS before and are familiar with its progression. We thought that the main goal was to avoid the ventilator, having no idea what could happen without it.\n\nTo this GBS subreddit: I am so thankful to read your stories of recovery. Please keep them coming! I am sorry for the loss of your brother, it is tragic. My prayers are with you. I  lost my mother this way in 2003. She also had the Miller Fischer variant.  It was awful. My heart goes out to you and your family. My condolences to you and your family. I am really sorry this happened to your brother. Those rehab centers and nursing homes are negligent because they typically do not have enough staff to properly oversee each patient. I would file a complaint with the local health board and potentially seek out legal action. Was it a heart attack? Did he work to hard in rehab? I am so sorry for your loss, this is a tragic story. Sending love and strength. Thanks for sharing.", "My experience with GBS ", "Please advise My bf got diagnosed with CIDP two weeks ago. It is supposed to be early stages and prognosis is good, ... however he is changed completely, refuses to see me and does not want to continue the relationship. I really wish to be there for him and with him. Anyone with CIDP and some relationship advise? Your boyfriend either:\n\n1) Does not want to be with you because he is realized life is too short and wants to find someone he likes better\n2) Does want to be with you but is to ashamed to be due to his diagnosis thinking he does not deserve you\n\nMaybe you should give him space and ask to meet in a few days. \n\nThen just accept whatever decision he makes. He already said he does not deserve me, so it is def the second. I gave him about a week, he just does not want to be involved with anybody apparently. Does not want me to help him through it. He said : there are plenty of healthy guys out there. Well, it sounds like he needs a therapist that specializes in either DBT or ACT so he can regulate these strong emotions he is having and move on with his life despite his health problems. Thank you, you have been very helpful. I was just wondering if it is normal for people to react like this after this diagnosis. He is early 50s btw. It is a predictable enough emotional response for a guy his age who is just been given any diagnosis he thinks will decrease his independence and \"fitness\" in relationships/family/etc. He probably believes that he owes you things in a relationship (potentially, in the long run, as a husband and a father to your children) that he sees as inconsistent with his diagnosis--possibly based on an overly pessimistic assessment of what he will be able to do in the future.\n\nI am not sure what to recommend as far as how you can get through to him. If he thinks he is doing this to benefit you, you could counter with the things you want from him that have nothing to do with his health (things to do with emotional companionship, shared values, etc). Focusing on what you want to offer him is just going to play into his idea that he is being noble by abandoning you, so go all in on the \"selfish\" reasons you want to be with him right now. (And go ahead and use the word \"abandonment\" to describe how he is treating you, if he keeps on giving you the cold shoulder, since he may really not understand the negative effect his actions are having on you. He is probably still too upset to step back and look at the big picture, but if he was empathetic and caring before, likely he will come back around in time, if you are patient and keep reminding him that he is not inside your head, and does not actually know what you want until you tell him).  \n\n\nI wish I could say that it will be okay, and things will work out, but honestly, I do not know. You are allowed to do your best to keep communication channels open, and I recommend contacting him regularly, at maybe half the frequency you were talking before (if every day, every other day, etc), as long as he is responding to at least some of your messages. Good luck, to both of you. Hi, thank you very much, we did continue communication for a couple of weeks when he said that he is been pushing me away because I need a healthy bf, not someone who \u2018struggles to put he is socks on\u2019, then he insisted on having a clean break and not even being friends, which I suggested, simply because I care about him and do not want him to stress about \u2018 what are we doing together \u2018. (We are both divorced  with grown up children.)  \nSo, as it stands at the moment, I have not seen him for more then 2 months, his sister told me he is responding well to the medication and still working. I am sending him short emails weekly with something positive and hoping that he is going to see the things in a different light one day.", "Becoming hopeless at getting this diagnosed. ", "How effective is plasmapheresis? A member of my family was diagnosed with GBS on Monday. His symptoms first got concerning on the Friday before. He has been given plasma for the past three days, and will receive two more on Monday and Wednesday. First she was able to sit up in bed, could talk normally, move his hands. Now she struggles to move her whole body, and her shoulders are somewhat effected. \n\nThis freaks me out as she is been getting plasmapheresis day after day. Does this mean it does not work? I thought that it helped to slow down the disease and potentially stop the symptoms from getting worse. Or does the treatment take some time to kick in? (Up to a several days/week?)\nJust really worried, thanks all Did they do a spinal tab on her? That is standard before you diagnose GBS. I never received Plasmapheresis, they gave me Immunoglobulin. Maybe they should try that. I assume she is still in the hospital. 5 days of plex is standard of care for GBS (or IVIG but there has not been shown to be any difference)\n\nTreatment usually takes some time to kick in. The deterioration of your family member is probably just the natural course of the disease. \n\nSorry you and your family are going through this but based off your post it sounds like they are getting the right care. Hang in there! Yeah they did that. I believe they caught it early, I am just scared it is going to progress to the point of a ventilator or something. Hope the plasmapheresis will kick in soon. She still has two more to go So it is possible for the disease to progress somewhat, and then after (I assume days?) the treatment kicks in? Thanks for your comment I once saw Dr. David Cornblath at John's Hopkins for my CIDP. He is on the forefront of CIDP and one of the few experts of the field.\n\nHe told me that he and his colleagues were working on a theory that some people, myself included, have a type of GBS/CIDP that only responds to IVIG and will not respond to plasmapheresis, immunomodulators, etc.\n\nIf this therapy does not stop the progression, maybe talk to your doctor about trying IVIG. Sure thing\n\nYes. Especially given that they have not received all their doses yet. \n\nIf you have any questions I would ask the treating physician. Sounds like they know what they are doing. this is interesting. Is there an article or some other information that I could see for this?", "ALS Drug - Potential for GBS or CIDP? Hello, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father has been living with CIDP for a few years now so I have been learning as much as possible in that time about CIDP.  IVIG was not all that effective for him and he is starting plasma exchange, which is very taxing on him.  I was sent the following link about Novus Therapeutics and their clinical trail for ALS drug.  Since it is an autoimmune disease effecting the PNS, my questions is would a drug that is effective against ALS potentially hold any therapeutic value in treating GBS or CIDP?  I looked into the respective immunogenesis of each disease to see, but an answer is out of my wheelhouse.    \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny information one way or the other would be very helpful.", "People who were diagnosed with GBS, What were the initial symptoms like? I am from 3rd world and I do not know our health services are equipped to handle GBS.\n\nI have growing weakness in my right leg from 5 days, should I be worried? At what point, I should seek medical help? The speed GBS develops varies from person to person (mine took 3 days). If you suspect something is wrong, go see a doctor. \n\nBest case scenario, it is nothing and you get sent home. Worst case scenario, it is GBS (or something else) and you are in the hospital where you need to be.  My onset lasted about 2 weeks. Started with tingling in the feet and hands and worked it is way up my extremities followed by weakness. If you are in a 3rd world there is still good treatment being done for gbs such as plasmapheresis. It takes a little longer for symptoms to abide but they have been having positive results. Usually GBS is symmetric. Meaning it will effect both sides at an almost equal rate. If it is only one leg than maybe it is not GBS Mine felt like both my feet hand fallen asleep. It progressively got worse through the week to the point that I could no longer drive after 2 days and could not walk without assistance after 4 days. Honestly at first I thought I was imagining it or that I was going crazy. I did not see how my feet could be asleep that long. It was that numb feeling you get after you have realized your foot is asleep and you cannot feel anything, like it is connected to your body but you cannot feel it. Anyway by day 5 I went in and was in ICU that night. It spread rapidly upwards after that. I was paralyzed from my diaphragm down and both my arms were severely weakened.  Yeah. Just consulted a senior doctor. He said same thing. According to him this is nerve irritation caused by some viral infection. He did not bother to identify the virus as he said, \"They are millions of viruses around us, not all are identifiable\". I kind of got feeling he did not take me serious. Damn. That is scary. How are you now? It is been 4 years now so I am better in a sense. I am not who I was before, that is for sure. I have lasting problems that my docs think are permanent. Mainly neuropathy in my legs, chronic pain, chronic fatigue, etc. I function well enough day to day that I live fairly normally though I no longer work, I just do not do many active things anymore. I am still working to try and build up strength so walking is not so hard on me.  Wish you a more speedy recovery mate. Thank you! Good luck to you. I hope you find some answers.  Most probably it is not GBS and doctor also told me to stop diagnosing from internet because it shows you what you want to see. That being sad, it just broke my heart to know that there is such a cruel disease with such a docile name which just paralyses people suddenly. It is just so cruel. All the world's strength and blessings to you and everyone recovering from it. Luckily medication for nerve issues can be very broad so you may still have luck even if u do not get an exact cause/diagnosis. As long as you progress! And second opinions are always helpful if u have the means.  Hey there. GBS'er here too! I would love to hear your story. I am 44, and 2 years out since onset.\n\n&amp;#x200B; The utter dipshits that call themselves doctors will turn you away if it starts in your hands. Because apparently in their extensive knowledge from reading webMD to study for their degree, they learned it only starts in the feet. But let me tell you THAT IS FUCKING BULLSHIT I am having symptoms for the last 2 years the prickling and pins and needles also electric zaps that I can get anywhere on my body extreme fatigue pressure headaches nausea and frequent urination. My penis has also developed some bacterial infection not that it is a symptom but has anyone else had other infections with there gbs ? Iv never falling or been unable to walk could this still be gbs ?  Get your blood sugar checked if you also feel thirsty all day, frequent urination and extreme hunger. I have high blood sugar. I just found out yesterday. Iv had all my bloods done i do not have extreme hunger or thirst that I notice.  What was your sugar level in blood? If you can remember. I do not know the levels I just got a text message saying all my bloods wore fine afterwards I changed doctor to get the mri.  From what I know, GBS onset is for a week and you will be in emergency. If that is the case I can rule gbs out I guess ... Did they check your vitamins? Vitamin B12 or Vitamin D? Vitamin D causes muscle pain and B12 deficiency causes zapps and numbness in your feet  Yep I had them checked. ", "Is there anything that helped you during hospitalization? Hello. My dad is currently in the icu recovering from covid and gbs. I cannot visit him at the moment because he tested positive but once he tests negative and i can visit him, is there anything that helped you throughout your visit that helped you feel better or pass the time that a family member brought you? My dad is able to move a bit and is not completely in paralysis and he can completely hold things. I was thinking maybe a book or something of the sort. I imagine being on his phone as his only source of distraction can get boring. If he can eat on his own (and the hospital allows it), non-hospital food was the best thing anyone brought me! Unfortunately he is unable to, he is on a feeding tube because he cannot really swallow or chew but once he is able to and has the appetite for it i will definitely start bringing him food. Even if he can hold things, it may be tiring to do so.  Audio books might be a good solution.  Or Get him a spotify account for some music. My grandparents got me a blanket and I really appreciated that. It was my favorite color and a nice little comfort compared to the hospital blankets. Covid and GBS?! Wow, that stinks. Glad it sounds like he is stable and talking about recovery now.\n\nAn extension cord for the phone in the hospital can be pretty nice. Helps keep the phone charged and/or potentially in a more comfortable position. \n\nI second the blanket suggestion and motion to also bring a pillow if he likes. Hospital blankets and pillows stink.\n\nI really liked the Sudoku.com app on my phone. Very minimal ads. I liked the app so much I wound up paying the one-time $5 fee to just remove ads. Not because the ads were even annoying me. I just liked the app. It does require some level of fine motor skills to do the finger taps. But is forgiving of mistakes if you misclick. So that suggestion is going to depend on how good with his hands he is right now. And how much he likes Sudoku, I guess lol. I liked that sort of thing because it was very bland but just cognitively demanding enough to keep my mind off things...\n\nMy only other recommendation is to remind him to not be shy about asking for stuff. You are paying for the hospital visit, so make sure to get your money's worth! Once he starts eating on his own, if he wants a dietary restriction or something that is easier on the stomach or low inflammation (e.g. gluten-free), they can usually accommodate that. If there is something about the bed is uncomfortable - bring it up with the nurse. Drugs as well! Would not ask for anything hard, but if a symptom is bothering you, you can ask if there is anything they can do about it and they are usually pretty nice about it. Like, if he is having trouble sleeping during such a difficult time (which would be totally understandable) he could try asking for something like a benadryl or an ambien. My family kept a calendar by my bed. Big one with space in each square. They wrote things like , bad poop day (she drew a little emoji), finally wiggled her toes, wants a hot dog... all kinds of things. Before long nurses and Dr.s contributed. It created a lot of conversations. It was great fun. Totally agree with own blanket, pillows jammies if he can. I had a photo of my kids that meant the world to me. iPad with Kindle app for books + whatever apps float your boat. Garage band and Procreate kept me occupied for weeks. Once able to tolerate, chocolate pudding was my best friend (because let us face it, hospital food is not the best, especially pur\u00e9ed). Books and tv shows also helped- maybe an iPad/tablet with some of his favorite movies/shows loaded on it would help (or introduce to a new series on a streaming service). A comfy pillow will make a world of difference- at one point, in the early stages of the diagnosis, the back pain was unbearable and it was hard to get comfortable. Once out of the hospital, warm gripper socks- my feet stayed cold, but I was too clunky for shoes most times (unless I had to have them), but still needed the non-slip grip of shoes, so they helped. And above all, he never needs to be afraid to ask for help, even if it is something he thinks is small or silly. I hated it, but had to do it as I healed. \n\nSending your dad all the best and wishing a quick recovery from both!! My family hung a photo collage of all of them and my four dogs.  My husband brought in my favorite pillow and hung an angel and cross in my room.  When I started using my hands again he brought yarn in and I learned to knit using only my fingers.  (Great for physical therapy for the hands) I hope I am not too late, and I hope he is doing well enough now to enjoy some non hospital food. I am currently in the hospital with GBS and unfortunately, I am unable to concentrate on books or the phone for long periods of time bc of the double vision/ throbbing headache. Audio books are saving my life, and family picture albums/ photos from past trips/ vacations lifted my spirits when I was at my worst. \nI really wish you and your father the best. YouTube to pass the time. Family could not visit due to COVID. But I had an angel of a nurse. Actually, she was not even my nurse. She came in when my nurse button was going off for an hour. And I do not fault the other nurses. I did not know this at the time but An older gentleman went into cardiac arrest on my floor. But the nurses father had/has GBS and she would rub his feet and hands. So she did this for me! Incredibly relaxing for me due to the swelling, nerve pain and sensation loss. I think this took away some of the anxiety. Made the time pass. I also have Ehlers Danlos, so the ankle rub and wrist rub loosened the joints! She really was a blessing.", "Hello everyone, I think I need to know I am doing the right thing - doctors seemed unphased but I am worried One week ago, I went to the emergency room because my hands and feet went numb and tingly all of a sudden. My chest felt tight and I felt out of breath, and my extremeties felt cold. \n\nMy smell and taste had also disappeared and I told the doctor this, they did a covid test and I was positive. I had started having symptoms about a week prior to this emergency room visit but my previous test was negative. However, they said my tingling was anxiety. I have had anxiety for years, and knew this felt different but I do not like to argue. They discharged me.\n\nThe numbness happened again a few days later and this time my lips felt tingly too. I went back to the emergency room. They gave me an inhaler and discharged me. \n\nYesterday the numbness was worse than ever. It was my legs and arms and whole face. My fingers and knees felt hard to bend. My heart was racing. My vision felt as if my eyes were looking different directions almost. I went back again. This episode lasted 4 hours, much longer than before, and I was shaking. I was having a hard time holding a pen to fill out forms and could barely speak to them.. my vocal cords felt like they were going numb too if that makes sense.\n\nThis time they did bloodwork and a cat scan. They said everything looked fine, I was just a bit low on potassium and they discharged me again...\n\nHowever, guillain barre does not show up on a cat scan from what I know. It seems they were just looking for stroke signs but my numbness is on both sides and I stressed that to them.. they just said I need to follow up with my regular doctor. I am calling my doctor when they open, just a couple more hours, but I think they are going to tell me to go back to the emergency room. \n\nI really suspect guillain barre but what is your experience? Does this sound like it? Its been a week, but I am so afraid it is going to be so much worse in just a few days and I want the doctors to take me seriously. I know it is rare but I think covid may have caused it. I have never had eczema either until covid, and my body is covered in itchy bumps and patches. Eczema is an autoimmune response, and so is guillain barre and I think it is connected \n\nSorry for the length I hope I am wrong and it is not guillain barre but I do not know what else it could be. Any advice is welcomed, I just do not want the doctors to push me off until it is too late.\n\nNot sure if it matters but I am a 25 year old female in the united states. 140 lbs, 5'3. I hope it is not gbs. 10 years ago I had it.took 3 trips 3days in a row to er,they gave me an inhaler the 2nd day also ,said tingling was because I smoked. 3rd day is when my husband told the dr,Dr, not leaving look in a book..did spinal tap,he then suggested  it may be gbs.icu for a week,6 weeks in rehab,months of physical  therapy. Remember  doctors practice  medicine, and there is a lot out there. Hope it is not gbs,get wellsoon. I was the same age and close in height and weight when this happened to me a few years ago. I did not have covid, but I had a routine surgery about a week before my onset of symptoms.\n\nTry to get a second opinion by going to a different ER, if there is another one near you. Tell them you had covid and when the numbness began. Do not say you went to another hospital and they could not find anything wrong. \n\nThey typical test to diagnose GBS is a lumbar puncture, but they do not typically perform this in an ER. You would likely have to be admitted and then you will have a consult with a neurologist and they will run neuro tests and a lumbar puncture, likely an EMG as well. \n\nIf you do not go back, make sure to have a plan if / when your symptoms get worse and you lose more function so someone can take you back to the hospital. Hopefully it is not GBS, but try to be prepared. Good luck to you This is exactly the same as my husband's course.  Started with the hands and feet. But after 5 days he developed right sided facial paralysis and that got us to the front of the line in ER because ?stroke.  His potassium was 2.9. Very low. You need an LP immediately. He got his IVIG within 24 hours of the LP. 5 day course and stopped all the symptoms from progressing. Almost forgot. 3 negative covid swab. Upper respiratory infection. Likely viral x  2 weeks beforehand.  Entire body covered in red rash that nothing relieved.  Skin is an organ.  It can be reacting to active infection or body is mounting hyper response to infection.  His rash did not go away until IVIG finished. Overnight just gone. LP is expensive and yes they do them in the ER.  Another thought I had was disseminated Lyme disease.  IT IS THE SEASON! What did his rash look like? I have clusters of red bumps on my elbows, hands, feet and scalp that itch like crazy It was red and patchy. It also moved. No blisters or bumps. No itching. One day on the chest and torso and next on the legs and under the arms.  Made no sense at the time until we got the diagnosis of GBS.  Tested neg for strep and EBV.  It reminded me of a rash transplant patients get when they have not so perfect bone marrow match.  When you go to see a provider just ask to have a conversation about what is wrong with you.  I knew going in we most likely had GBS but I never said it out loud. My experience with the Miller Fischer variant of GBS was not episodic.  I progressed steadily from both pinkies being in pins and needles to being unable to walk in about 4 days.  My understanding is it is not episodic because the numb comes from the myelin sheath being stripped off your nervous system, which causes the signals to be distorted or lost completely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe S for GBS is syndrome though, which means Drs get to it by ruling out the things they can prove that you do not have.  The spinal tap folks talk about is afaik still not officially accepted as proof that you have or do not have GBS.  I personally believe we have a number of different autoimmune diseases that are actually slightly different that we lump together as GBS.  I bring this up because you might have GBS and your symptoms and case might be incredibly different then others in this subreddit (including myself).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGBS or not the breathing thing is important, more so if you are Covid positive.  No one can know your internal feelings better then yourself.  If it is possible find a nonER DR relationship that you feel that they really listen to you and ideally work with you to come to next steps that make you feel more comfortable.  If that is not possible you need to continue to decide when you need to use the ER.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are willing and can make the time, you can explore some of the options on you tube or in a class setting about learning some of the anxiety coping tools.  If you find these practices reduce or eliminate these episodes then you are better off, if they do not help it is another data point to discuss with a Dr.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck, and personally I am hoping it is just anxiety, because GBS sucks. :) 25f, diagnosed with  GBS in April in Japan. \nIm obviously not a doctor, but I did got the diagnosis after a cat scan and multiple blood tests from what I was told. \nI know there are cases where the progress of symptoms can be very slow, but have there been any progression in your numbness?

I do battle fatigue almost every work day. I am hoping the TRT will help but I also wonder if it will make things worse by pushing me too hard. I am probably going to give it a shot anyway, but I am interested to hear from someone who is in the same boat.\n\nThanks I do not know what TRT is, but I am a year out and still struggle with fatigue. My neuro has me taking vitamin B and Bcomplex. It is helped some. I have strongly considered it and have not ruled it out. There are studies that suggest testosterone therapy does help in male GBS/CIDP patients.\n\nThat being said, if I were to do it, I doubt Id get a script from my neuro. I would go through telemedicine and manage it myself. Just got prescribed through telemedicine today. Remind me in a couple months and I will let you know how it is going. I am very interested in knowing how you are doing. Please keep in touch. Might have a partner for the test...of the test. :) Hey, I am on trt for the past 6 months. My levels were terrible, like 100 total. I feel a ton better, but have not found my real sweet spot yet. Happy to answer any questions. I had GB as a 5 year old, about 30 years ago Hey. I am similar age and had GBS at 5 as well.\n\nJust about to start trt in Aus.I have got no questions at the moment. But commenting so I can come back Have you got any links to these study\u2019s? I am struggling with my google today. Here are a couple to get started.  \n\nFirst and foremost, this thread is where I first read about it and started considering it:\n\n ( \n\nThe second and third articles discuss nerve remylenation relative to MS.  Since GBS and CIDP does not usually have brain involvement, it would appear testosterone would be of help in remylenating GBS and CIDP male patients.\n\n ( \n\nThis is a study that explores testosterone's ability to decrease inflammation in the body.\n\n(\n\nThis study reveals \"the potential of testosterone treatment to stall (and perhaps even reverse) neurodegeneration associated with MS.\"\n\n ( \n\n\"These data establish the efficacy of androgens as remyelinating agents and qualify the brain androgen receptor as a promising drug target for remyelination therapy, thus providing the preclinical rationale for a novel therapeutic use of androgens in males with multiple sclerosis.\"\n\nI have yet to get my levels checked.  I imagine I would only be cleared to proceed if my levels were low. Awesome to hear from someone else in the same boat. The trt community here on reddit is good. Big thing for me was to know to keep trying doseages to see how they felt. I think I went too far down, and am going back up now trying to find the sweet spot. It is been a big change for me, but not a silver bullet That is amazing. \n\nThanks heaps! Hi. I have not tried that, but I am currently taking modafinil, and it is helping me with fatigue. \nPlease let us know how TRT goes.\nRegards. Yeah I have noticed some improvement with vitamin B. This is what I take. I bite them in half and keep the half under my tongue.\n\n So...how is it going? It is going. I am not completely sure if it is helped my fatigue or not. If I had to give an answer, I would say no. I do think you should get your levels checked if you are curious. Total T and free T at least. I gotcha. I was wondering how you were feeling. Too bad about the fatigue. Have you noticed any changes, good or bad? Honestly nothing major, but my levels were mid-range before I started. I think I can function better on less sleep now (I still try to get as much sleep as I can). I do have a bit shorter of a fuse. I noticed a slight boost in confidence. A slight strength increase at the beginning. My face is puffier which I have read may go away with time.\n\nSo yeah, nothing major. I plan to ask for a higher dose at my next follow up, which would put me in the 'almost above range' levels.", "Is it normal for symptoms to fluctuate during the recovery process? I have been out of the hospital for two months now. At my worst, I could not walk without assistance and had extreme tingling and weakness in my hands/feet/arms/legs that all occurred within a two week period. I would say 2 weeks after I got out of the hospital I could already walk normally again. Every now and again I still get some tingling in my hands and feet, but not nearly as severe, and typically happens at night. Is this normal during recovery? My understanding is yes as your nerves are healing and that causes sensations. (Like an itchy scab?) I had ... Temperature issues.\n\nI would talk to your doctor if you are concerned. I still have issues with hands and feet eight years on now. Forget the concept of normal and stay in tune with your body.  It is never too early to go back to your Neuro with concerns.

I am experiencing the same GBS symptoms I had before. It just started, will wait to see how it gets in the next coming weeks. Hospital could not diagnose anything despite describing my past history with GBS, blood work, ekg and x-ray showed nothing and they refused to do a spinal tap.

The article is decent, but the title is horrible.  Throughout the article, it is clear that neurologists are looking for a *possible* link.  So far there are 10 confirmed cases of GBS out of more than 10 million cases of Covid.  I am glad they are monitoring for this, but I wish they would be more careful when many will only read the title. \n\n(Edit:  thanks for posting the link though.  I am sure most of us were watching for something on this) I have a google alert system set up for this and we will continue to monitor news around this. Right now I am thankful that there is only handful of cases. There are certainly other times in history where it has happened, so it will be worth watching to see if there will be any other reported cases. Due to the mysterious nature of GBS/CIDP, and doctors often struggling to identify the cause, it is important to have more data due to potential blame on COVID-19. Hopefully there will not be, though. \n\nThank you for your post and let us know if you see anything else in the future. I have a neurotic family member who happened to post this on Facebook. She had a lot of anxiety and paranoia about the pandemic and went on to explain how dangerous the pandemic is, and how people can get GBS, a rare autoimmune disease which caused paralysis. She knew I went through it. And was supportive. However, she posted this basically on my 2 year anniversary of diagnosis. I was livid. I thought it was ignorant. It is such a fine line to walk these days. To us, this is important info. For others, it is a rare fear. That sounds really insensitive of her!

That turned into pretty serious (like I was on oxygen) pneumonia (sorry for being MIA as mod, I was in the hospital for a while). \n\nSome of us just cannot fight stuff off as well, so it is super important that the people we see day to day get vaccinated to reduce our chances of infection.

Yesterday I woke up from a nap and suddenly my arms and legs were extremely weak, I felt like I was suffocating, and like I was going to throw up.\n\nI put two and two together and found realized the tingling and weird sensations in my arms and legs over the past month were characteristic of the buildup of GBS before an attack.\n\nI went to the hospital.

It feels like a human rights violation. I deserve to live.\n\nWhat can I do?", "New diagnosis of GBS, looking for some information on what \u201cback to normal\u201d means I was diagnosed last Wednesday, spent 5 days in the hospital getting 5 IVIG treatments. I am very very lucky in that once I had a neurologist appointment, they admitted me to the hospital, did spinal tap, MRI, and EMG all within 24 hours. Everything came back negative (except EMG showed no response in my feet), and treated me on symptoms alone. I have been able to walk the whole time, but I am very shaky and weak. I have fallen many times before the hospitalization and use a walker now. Sorry if this is long, just trying to give my background and symptoms. My legs are weak, my finger tips are numb, and my feet still feel like blocks of cement that have pins and needles and tingling pretty constantly. Oh I am a healthy athletic 37 female. I have no idea how I got this, but before I started with the tingling in my feet, I was exhausted and had diarrhea for a few days last month, which may have been it? What I would like to know - for those who are \u201cback to normal\u201d  does that mean you do not have the numbness/pain/tingling 24/7? I am starting PT next week in home, but I have been doing pretty well getting around, even with stairs in my home. I am trying to stay as physically active as possible without trying to push too hard and fall. I am really looking for stories from those who have gotten through this, what your limbs that were affected felt like while healing, and what you feel like today. I am planning on working like crazy through PT but just want some help to stay sane working through recovery. \n\nThanks in advance for anything you can give me! I was diagnosed with GBS in 2000, I was 20 years old. It started with tingling in my hands and feet and weakness that spread upward. I started falling down, so was taken to the emergency room. They diagnosed me after a spinal tap. They kept me in the ICU and did IVIG. They sent me home after a month and it worsened. They gave me plasmapheresis. This is what finally stopped it from worsening. \n\nI spent 6 months living in a rehabilitation center where I learned to use a walker and had a foot brace for drop foot. I was also incredibly depressed and lashed out at staff. They put me on prozac. It was very depressing not knowing what would happen. Medical professionals remained neutral. They had no clue if I would even function normally again. I had daily physical/occupational therapy. I had to use forearm crutches for a while, have in-home physical therapy, and continue to wear the foot brace for 2-3 months extra.\n\nFast forward to now, I have absolutely no tingling in my hands and feet, and I walk 7 miles a day. I honestly do not notice any residual weakness at all. There is still tightness in my calf muscles, but I am not certain if this is from having drop foot. I have CIDP, so a little different, but very similar, and I am also a nurse that has dealt with this disease a few times, I can give you all the information I have. \n\nMost people will heal, even if it takes years, and return to a normal level of functioning, but some people do not quite get back to where they were. Residual symptoms vary greatly, and again you may have no residuals, but it can include tingling, weakness, numbness, a burning sensation, difficulty walking, etc. \n\nGBS is great in that it affects your peripheral nerves and not your central nerves like multiple sclerosis. Your body has the capacity to heal peripheral nerves, so unlike central, damage can be undone, but it is a slow process that just requires patience. And even then some damage cannot be undone.\n\nLastly, I completely understand your desire to heal as fast as possible, but I would caution you about working too hard at PT. GBS is one of a few diseases where exercise can actually exacerbate symptoms and make it worse, setting you back further. It is important to work through PT at the pace they set. When doing PT for nerves a lot of people come at it with this \"muscle\" mindset where they assume that more work = better results, but nerves just do not work like muscles. They require so so so much more patience to heal. And I really feel you there because I am also an athletic person and it can be so frustrating to want to go on a run because your muscle strength is there, but your nerves impulses will not let you access those muscles. It is one of my biggest struggles with the disease. \n\nSo I would just say talk to your doctor and physical therapist about your zeal to improve as fast as possible and work with them to create a plan that will challenge you and not set you back.\n\nCheers! Thank you so much for sharing, I really appreciate it! I am so happy to hear that the numbness/tingling is gone, and 7 miles, impressive! Thank you so much for your response, I really appreciate it. I will follow doctors orders, and pace myself with the PT. I have never been a patient person, so this will be a good time to learn to slow down and let my nerves heal Oh my goodness, give yourself some time to recover! I had GBS when I was a child and children recover the most quickly from it. It took me over 6 months to get back to full function of my fine motor skills, but I was full body paralyzed and this was in the 80s so treatment was more rudimentary. Still, be patient! Your body has been through the wringer - you need to literally regrow the protein around your nerves. This takes time, so be patient with yourself!\n\nHow are you doing emotionally? GBS can be really rough to go through, especially if you are very active. Thank you so much for your reply! And you are absolutely right, I need to allow myself to relax and heal. I have never been a patient person, and this is going to force me to learn to be patient and slow down. I feel very lucky that I was not paralyzed besides my feet. I am going to try and practice more gratitude for what I am able to do. It sounds like you are doing pretty good! Keep up the progress! Thank you! Just had PT again today and am making progress.

It is been a long time since I recovered, but I really thank my grandma for instantly getting in contact with a nurse she knew (she used to be an animal vet) since I was walking really weirdly and having huge amounts of pain at night. If it were not for her, I could have been very well been in a wheelchair right now and even possibly dead. My mom and dad gave me vitamins and stuff at the time, since they thought it was just something out of the ordinary like muscle pain or whatever, my thankfully, my grandma instantly reacted.

However, he is not getting better. He cannot move his arms, hands and legs and tonight they put a mask to help him breathe a little. I love him very much and I am very sad. Do you think it is possible that he would be fine? How long can the virus take to quit advancing? Or the meds to do some kind of effect? Thank you! Hello, sorry to hear your dad has been diagnosed with GBS, I my self was diagnosed over 3 months ago, it is a scary thing to go through something like GBS and it is going to get hard before it gets any better. I was lucky to get treatment(IVIG) very early on and lucky to have lots of family support that kept me positive through the entire journey. When I felt like there was no getting better at times and my family kept reminding me I would get better which started happening fast. I was stuck in a hospital bed for almost a month before I could start rehab and about a month and a half of rehab in the hospital  I could walk enough to get discharged and 20 days out now I have gone on a trip have been playing golf and slowly coming back to being my old self. I still have a long way to go but your dad is going to get better. Your dad is going through something really tough but with the support of everyone around him and a lot of hard work he will come back even stronger! I wish you, your dad and and family the best of luck through these times. Sorry to hear what happened / is happening to your dad.   \nAs humansafe said, it gets rough before getting better. I had GBS 3 years ago, and went from my normal self to a quadriplegic who needed breathing support in a few days. After a week some of my fingers started to function a bit, so I could use an iPad, which helped a ton; I was sooooo bored. I spent a month in ICU + additional 5 months in a rehab facility. It took something between 6-10mos for me to be in a health that I could be \"independent\" again. Nowadays I still have some issues and I cannot work, but otherwise life's good.\n\nMy tip: be with your dad if you can. Hospital is a lonely place. I am sorry to hear that. It is going to be a long road to recovery. I was diagnosed over a year ago and still recovering. It took me 10 weeks to walk again. \n\nIt is not the virus that causes GBS, but the immune system attacking the nerves. Ivig will halt the process but the damage will be done, hence the long recovery. There is nothing that can be done except manage the pain (if any), exercise when the nerves comes back, and wait for the nerves to heal. \n\nIn the meantime, visit him often. Hospitals are really lonely and boring. Bring socks, moisturisers and lip balm because hospitals are cold and dry. Bring books, audiobooks, long chargers if he is using devices. Daily visits kept me sane. \n\nI wish you and your family all the best. Why cannot you work? My arms are pretty useless from elbow up, plus mental fatigue. I tire VERY easily, and sleep does not help much. This explains it pretty well:  \n( Ask his doctor about plasmapheresis. IVIG did not work well for me at first, my doctor had me do plasmapheresis and I started recovering quickly after that. I got another sound of IVIG 2 months after I got out of the hospital. Thank you for your kind words, they encouraged me. God bless you. Thank you, I will be with him the most I can. :) God bless you. Thank you very much, and thanks for sharing your experience, it helps a lot. God bless you. Thank you, I will ask. :) God bless you My dad had a similar scenario. Started with leg numbness, progressed rapidly before they even knew what was wrong with him. He was in the ICU and they told us to prepare for a ventilator. He was adamantly against that and we were able to avoid it. Luckily, at his worst he could not move his arms or legs and had trouble breathing but each day after his worst got a little better. 3 weeks later he was home, and returned to work a couple weeks after that. It is incredible how rapidly you can decline with this illness but aside from some lingering occasional numbness, my dad is completely recovered and self sufficient again. Good luck and best wishes! Same here, only plasmapheresis worked for me too. \n\nHowever in some cases (like mine), you will reach a peak of gbs where one gets in terrible condition, I needed intubation and was paralysed from the neck down and body shut down from the inside. After the peak he will start recovering. \nMake sure to move his legs, arms and body around in different positions, i gets quite painful to be in one position at all times. Also, if you can and when he is stable, grab his legs and start doing bicycle movements, also move his arms up and down and bend, my doctor said those movements are quite important for the limbs.  I was one of the lucky ones and after one month in the icu on life support and one month in the \u201cnormal\u201d hospital ward i was able to leave kind of walking. \n\nA lot of support, encouragement and patience from you and those surrounding him will be very important. \n\nGood luck to your dad, just know ** he will get better** little by little. Thanks sooo much for your reply. Last night he is got to be intubated and I have reread your message a thousand times and it gave me so much faith. Thank you thank you for everything you said. God bless you! Thanks so much for your words! Every comment is very encouraging! God bless! Can I ask you something? Did you have pain in your body while you were paralyzed?

First off you do want to drink lots of water and eat foods with omega 3s, 6s and 9s (helps with myelin growth/repair). Next, you are going to need to request a spinal tap from your doctor. That is really the only way to be sure. You are going to have to be your own advocate. Best of luck and if you have any questions we are here for you.  Nobody is advocating for me.

There is no sense of urgency while my ability to walk and live hangs in the balance. \n\nWhat can I do to speed along this process? Do I need to go to an ER? Why are they sending me to inexperienced doctors so far away from where I live and acting like they are doing me a favor by squeezing me in?

Does the spinal tap test itself hurt and leave you impaired for a period of time?\n\nIf I got to do it I have to do it, but I do not want to waste time. I feel like time is very valuable with this illness, am I right? The earlier you start treating it the better your outcome will be. \n\nHow horrible is what I might have to face in tests and treatment? Prepare me. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best.  \n\nShould I tell them not to waste my time with an MRI? This will be quite long but I know what you are going through so I can field this one, to an extent, yes, the spinal tap will hurt, but at the point I got mine, I did not care what they did or wanted to do to me. I just wanted to get fixed. \n\nImpaired, no, but the GBS did that. \n\nI had my GBS in 2018. Had my random allergy nonsense before all of it started, maybe a little worse that normal. \n\nI woke up on a Sunday at 4 when my son started crying and got out of bed but I was walking like I was drunk and I could not understand why. \n\nI woke up later and same issue, but with pins and needles and a pulsating feeling going through my feet. I ended mowing my yard that day too. My wife thought it was a pinched nerve from New furniture. \n\nMonday came around and I drove to work in downtown Dallas and I could not feel my feet. Walking down stairs or am incline was the worst, I had about 0 control there. By the end of the day my vision was not tracking right but I made it home.\n\nI got a Dr's appointment Tuesday and the nurse practitioner told me, \"I think you have Guillain-Barre Syndrome\".\n\nI basically had a blank stare on my face because I had never heard of that. \n\nI ended up getting a CT scan later that day on Tuesday, nothing there. \n\nWednesday I got in with a neurologist and they sent me to the ER for tests which is where I did the spinal tap. Now they gave me morphine before, but even if they did not, I really did not care, I was going to do whatever needed to be done to get me fixed up. \n\nAfter 2 hours or so they came back and said my proteins were twice the normal amount and I was being admitted. \n\nThey did an MRI while I was in the hospital and I did 5 days of IVIG treatment. The hardest part is after you are out. \n\nAt first I could not drive, could not pick up my kid, could not do much except lay there.\n\nI missed 3 months of work doing physical and occupation therapy. \n\nI made my therapist push me so I could get better, I was not going to let this beat me. At first everything was hard but it got better. \n\n3 years later I am almost where I was but after I got Covid I feel like my nerves are angry at me again. I definitely get tired and when I do about done. I hate that, but it is what it is.  \n\nIf you suspect you have it, try pushing the Dr's about it.  According to the neurologist I had a mild case, but I was also very prompt in getting in to a Dr and I was pretty healthy. \n\nI do not think you can prevent it but you can hopefully stop it from effecting you as badly. \n\nHopefully this helps what it is like and I can answer more questions if you have them. \n\nI know that I am not the same, it is hard accepting that, but I am not going to let that stop me. I do not have sick leave, I am a self-employed worker on medicaid.\n\nMy family and friends will probably help take care of me and I do not have any dependents. I will do almost anything to not have my life ruined by this vaccine.\n\nIs the prednisone expected to help at all or did I just waste a week essentially doing nothing? I basically want to know if GBS is stoppable early on or do you have to let it progress to a really shitty point before they start taking it seriously and doing the real tests and treatments?\n\nMaybe I should not waste my time and money with a CT scan for example. Once I mention having Guillain-Barre, I have had every medical person tell me I cannot get the vaccine, which I am OK with, I should natural immunity. \n\nWorst case, you have got it, but it is not the end of the world and you can beat it! Maybe it is something else not so serious. Should I just be going straight to the ER and forget about wasting time going to doctor's offices?\n\nAre they able to treat GBS long before it gets to the point where you started getting tests? The CT scan and MRI sounds like a complete waste though. Obviously, I would like to avoid a spinal tap, but maybe I should push for it if I think they are being too patient/cautious. \n\nAny idea of what I am looking at here in terms of expenses on Medicaid? I agree, lets hope it is not this. But if it is then I want to skip a lot of the steps that waste time and delay treatment. I feel like they might be inclined to slow-walk the diagnosis and treatment to make sure it is really happening. Of course, that also benefits them ruling out other illnesses and it is more expensive. The thing is whatever is happening to me happened from the vaccine and we know vaccines do this to people. So wasting time looking for cancer is stupid. I literally had this start happening to me minutes after being injected with Pfizer. The spinal tap, unfortunately, is the key test because it is testing for the protein level. You might have to go to the ER and say you think you have Guillain-Barre for them to get you some help - I would hope a Dr would listen to you though. From what I understand after researching it is that it is pretty rare. I am glad my Dr suspected it but I wonder how many Dr's out there are aware of it?\n\nAs far as cost go, I cannot say, my insurance covered a lot of it. I know my hospital stay cost me $144k for 5 days. I think the IVIG treatment I did could make me hit my deductible with one go around. When I found it is immunotherapy I understood why it costs so much. A neurologist is exactly who diagnosed me with GBS. In fact I had 3 different ones while I was in the hospital. They did a spinal tap on me on like the 2nd or 3rd day I was hospitalized. GBS is an incredibly rare and painful disease so I hope you do not end up having it. GBS progresses rapidly, but can self-limit without progressing to the whole body (particularly in younger people). \n\nPred might slow it down a little, but is not enough. The standard treatments plasmapheresis or immunoglobulin therapy are necessary in rapidly worsening cases.\n\nDoing aerobic exercise could make it worse, I would recommend resting and talking to another medical doctor.       I had GBS 30ish years ago &amp; Prednisone was the, maybe only?, treatment at that time, so I do not think it is just blowing you off or trying to slow walk your diagnosis.  Prednisone lessens your immune response &amp; in your situation that is probably what they want to do while sorting out what exactly happened.\n\nI was on it from the time I was diagnosed which was probably a week after it started to develop after a particularly nasty bout of flu.

Putting out the fire as fast as you can is the key.  I would go to the ER of the closest, largest hospital where you would have a good chance they would have a neurologist that is seen it before.   That is how I got diagnosed...because I waited way way too long.   \n\nAs others have said, if it is GBS, there are specific tests that can rule it in/out, and treatments that are effective.  \n\nDo not be afraid to be an advocate for yourself.

When I had GBS 30ish years ago Prednisone was the treatment, maybe only treatment?.  \n\nI was diagnosed about a week after onset by a spinal tap.  I got GBS after a really bad bout of the flu &amp; thought the leg weakness was just residual flu stuff &amp; did not mention it to my mom, I was 18, until I started getting the burning pain sensation.  She took me to the hospital at that point.  I think they had the diagnosis in a day or two but cannot exactly remember the timeline.\n\nThey put me on a TON of Prednisone &amp; sent me to the ICU.  My nerve involvement never made it to my chest (breathing), but affected my legs, arms, &amp; face.  I do not know if that was just my personal GBS experience or if the Prednisone stopped it from advancing more than it had given I would had it about a week before saying anything, getting diagnosed &amp; getting set up for treatment.\n\nI think it is good you are under physician's care even if they are still in the figuring out stage &amp; have a jump on getting treatment.  \n\nFrom my reading &amp; hearing personal accounts about people &amp; their GBS journeys over the last 30 years it sounds like early diagnosis &amp; treatment help, granted that'sl anecdotal. I will start by saying, it sucks to not know what is wrong with you and I hope you are able to find answers soon! \nLumbar puncture/spinal tap is considered one of the best diagnostic tests for GBS. If they can complete this (or already have), and they diagnose you with GBS, they should be able to then correct with the right treatment (which for many is IVIG). It is my understanding that receiving IVIG sooner rather than later is generally best for slowing and reversing the decline with GBS. If there is not already a neurologist on your care team, I recommend asking to have one become part of it. When I was in the hospital with GBS, The infectious disease doctors told me that I should get the covid vaccine. The symptoms from GBS regressing my healing would be better than if I caught covid. But, they told me to never get the flu shot. Covid is a different make up than flu shots. Mine said I should pass so I am, but I do have long Covid symptoms so I am not opposed to the vaccine. \n\nI do not know what the chances of getting GBS again are, but honestly, I would rather have Covid again if it is that or GBS. Maybe as we get more information about the vaccines it will come to light that there really is not a risk. My wife is very much against me getting the vaccine because she told me the GBS could come back worse. Yeah. Like I said I was in the hospital already. So if it came back worse, I was already there to get the treatment again and such. When I got the shot I just barely had my trach removed. And was still getting fed through my peg tube. So I was not in too much danger. Unfortunately, it has to run a course. There are interventions to mitigate but not fully stop it. Not everyone reacts the same way to the same treatments also. I relapsed last year. I was also frustrated at how slow they were- particularly over the first 5 days.   They explained that ivig would not have stopped how severe it got- but would only shorten the overall recovery time. The er did nothing for me until I could barely walk- but my doctor told me to go to the er to see a neurologist faster. I have never heard of Prednisone being prescribed to treat GBS. My advice to you is go to the nearest ER ASAP and explain them the situation. GBS is taken very seriously. You need to have several tests done to diagnose it and time is of the essence. The symptoms progress rapidly. If you do have it, they will start you on several rounds of IVIG or do plasmapheresis. \n\nDo not try to do any exercises at home because you need to be assessed by a physical therapist. You do not want to inadvertently cause more damage and potentially pain. Rising bilateral weakness is **the** tell-tale sign. You must immediately speak to a neurologist and seek confirmation. &gt;I have had every medical person tell me I cannot get the vaccine       \n\nI have had the opposite. I was told to take the vaccine as soon as it was available. Which I have done.      \n\nWhat reason have you been given for not taking it? That it could cause GBS again. I was asking about it because of some long Covid symptoms that I would like to disappear. &gt;Does the spinal tap test itself hurt       \n\nYou could opt for a nerve conduction test instead. That hurts a little but at least they leave your spine alone.       \n\nI flat-out refused the spinal tap. I am mystified. I was told that the vaccine is as likely to cause GBS as you are to get it in the first place.     \n\ni.e. not likely at all.      \n\nSeems like no one out there knows what the fuck they are talking about sometimes! When it comes to getting GBS they do not know, they have no clue. I suspect my really bad sinus infection is what triggered it and my body just kept trying to fight it off causing the nerve damage. \n\nI remember my son got his flu shot and looking at the docs came with it and it said if you have GBS, do not get a flu shot. I think it is the same premise, it could cause your body to start fighting itself again. \n\nI had Covid and I guess it was a mild case because I was just tired and I knew my body was fighting something off. My wife was worried since I am technically immunocompromised and have asthma that Covid would be bad for me. I guess I was concerned about getting it because I did not know how not l my body would react. Besides being really tired it was like my normal sinus junk. Given the choice between Covid and GBS, I would rather have Covid than deal with GBS. It took me a really long time to accept that my body hurts for no reason. What if you have shooting pains in the nerves of your legs like vines of pain going up from the shins to the thighs every time you take a step? I think the prednisone was prescribed to stop the facial palsy from developing and thinking that the cause of immediate paralysis in my leg was an autoimmune response to the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nThe concern I have is if the vaccine triggers a two-week immune response and I have prednisone for 5 days is that enough? Spinal tap will tell\nBut they want to do more test also, your patience  bill will add up .400k. It is never is cured, it stays in body They are incorrect. I am a doctor of pharmacy who also got GBS from Covid, and you can have the vaccine. The CDC says you can have the vaccine. And you bet your sweet ass I got it when I could.\n\nAnd I got the \"jogging and weight lifting Friday night, paralyzed Sunday morning\" variety of GBS. 50 days in the hospital. The vaccine has, so far, seemed to have caused LESS GBS than viral diarrhea.\n\nI fucking begged for death in the hospital. So believe me, if I thought for a MOMENT a vaccine would have been a worse alternative, I would not have done it. CT will not show anything. As far as I know, nerve conduction tests and lumbar punctures and more robust methods of determining it, but they are not going to order some for someone whose symptoms can be explained by other things. But this is only out of some outside research I did while I was hospitalized for GBS. I have asked my doc about it. I am cool with it if he is. I would like to get rid of some long Covid stuff. GBS is terrifying like that. It comes out of nowhere and can happen to anyone at anytime. I am scheduled for EMG and MRI... a month from now. I have an allergist/immunologist appointment on Monday. Keeping an open mind, but I think this is neuropathic or rheumatic. New England Journal of Medicine study from Italy links covid-19 and GBS to chickenpox and epstein-barr viruses. There is also a link between MS and EBV. \n\n50mg prednisone has been helping. I wake in the morning with mild numbness in face and pain in legs, but by afternoon after prednisone kicks in I feel much better. Worried what happens when 5 day prednisone prescription is over (Monday). How long does the immune response last from vaccination? Depends on the vaccine. Some like Moderna could possibly\u2026POSSIBLY\u2026 confer long term or even lifetime immunity to certain strains. The one shots probably will need boosters soon. But a year does not seem too far afield from the research I have been able to read. But I no longer practice so my ability to read full text primary research has been diminished. Sorry, I was not clear. How long does your immune system continue responding to the mRNA proteins? Is it a short process or does it take place over weeks?\n\nI am trying to understand exactly why my immune system is freaking out and causing so much damage right now more than a week after vaccination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few things I think are at play are:\n\n1.) I have a rheumatic immune disorder like arthritis that allows my immune system to attack healthy parts of my body.\n\n2.) I have a dormant virus like herpes zoster trying to re-emerge.\n\n3.) I have a strong/aggressive immune system. (this would rule out some older folks)\n\n4.) The mRNA proteins are provoking my immune system into overdrive. I am not exactly sure. I would research but I am drinking with my best friend right now. Me. I am drinking alone. I am being treated with IVG, plasma phoresis, and solumedrol currently for Vaccine acquired GBS and it has significantly slowed down the progression of the disease. My understanding is that these treatments are to halt progression however it will not hasten recovery time. My hope is that I do not end up getting intubated but as the disease is still getting worse daily it is hard to tell how bad it is going to get. Good luck to anyone suffering from this disease. I had a spinal tap.  Did not feel a thing, but the doctor instructed  me to stay laying down for 48 hours after and not lift anything heavy. I did it on a Friday and spent the weekend in bed. Are you any better? I had exactly same story. Symptoms started developing right after Pfeizer. After I could hardly walk I went to ER, they kept me in hospital for Spinal Tap, MRI, today I will finally have EMG. They have been suspecting Multiple Sclerosis, but MRI came clear. My symptoms have not progressed from difficulties walking but for a week I have been not going further than to toilet, not sure how it will be after leaving hospital. So far zero treatment. Best of luck to you. What was the result of the tap? Hey there OP , how are you doing now? any updates? For me, prednisone is the most effective. Plasmatheresis did help but the steroids are enough to calm my immune system down.. the urination, water retention, sweats, hunger and voices aside.... I got my 2nd Pfizer shot about 7 weeks ago. I was worried it would trigger it but did not..  the stomach bug the kids brought home 10 days ago from school has and im back on prednisone shaking off the mild tingles and thumb numbness and fatigue...\n\nIt is annoying and always in the back of my mind. Update is I do not have GBS, thank God. However I do have lasting neurological pain from the vaccine 2 months later. Some stinging pain in my legs and swelling in my joints leading to occasional numbness in extremities, and a 2 month long cough/chest irritation that is most likely pnemonia. I think I am gradually getting better, but there have been flare ups that concern me. \n\nWhen my doctor said it could be GBS that was one of the scariest weeks of my life.\n\nWhile I am grateful to not have the worst outcome I am really regretting my decision to get vaccinated. I was so healthy before all this, to have to live with pain and no treatment is demoralizing. Please update how you are doing. I am so sorry this is happening to people and so many do not believe us that the vaccine can have these ill effects because the media will not cover us. That is Great news u/muhname , I had some similar weirdly similar symptoms that lasted about 4 months after my vaccine (mine apparently had something to do with the vagus nerve, got tested and probed from several doctors and it was concluded that it was an adverse inflammatory/allergic/autoimmune response from the vaccine)... One thing that my doctors told me that may serve as a silver lining to you is that these reactions seem to be due to the toxicity of the S-Protein (Spike) encoded by the vaccine ...so had we (those who suffered strong adverse reactions) not taken the vaccine it may have been the case that we  would be at much greater risk when in contact with the actual virus (due to it having the same protein but being of a replicating nature)  \nin my case I am slowly getting better after 4months (lost 12pounds , physical  conditioning went to hell and will need to rebuild up muscle mass so I can do any physical labor ) Sorry for late reply, I was focusing on healing. They let me out of hospital with no diagnosis (apart from it being vaccine injury) or treatment, so it was not classical GBS. At least I would have got treatment if it was. Now after 2,5 month I can say I am doing slightly better, I have good days and bad days. I am taking vitamins, supplements, going t acupuncture and physiotherapy. And I am on restrictive diet. There are 100s like us. Sadly no acknowledgement from doctors or government. There is a very helpful fb group for people with neurological injuries after that. How much did you pay yourself? I considered it quite a bit but I think my total bills for the hospital and all the treatment was $3500 or a little more. I did a 401K loan to help pay for the hospital bills. \n\nI probably had met part of my deductible throughout the year from other stuff but I am not really sure. Damn that is a lot. That is what I thought, but I am glad I had insurance. I have heard that the IV/IG treatment can hit your deductible all by itself and I had 5 days of that stuff. As someone who does not need to go to the doctor much here, I am still trying to learn some of this stuff. I was pretty healthy up until getting GBS. I was doing good in 2020, almost back to the way I was but I ended up gettig Covid and 2021 has kind of been a lost year.\n\nWorking out has just been abysmal - Covid seems to have made my allergies, sinuses, and asthma super awful.\n\nSo I get to go to an ENT, an Allergist and Asthma guy, and a Pulmonologist. To be honest, I just want to get some relief and if it takes one, or all of them to help, that is all I want at this point. Fuck man....fuck... I am sure some of it is in my head but I can tell. It helps knowing that other people who have had Covid are complaining about the same thing.\n\nThe one thing I am not sure is that all my muscles seem to be more tight this year which made me wonder if I had a reoccurance of GBS which I do not think happened. I worked with my Dr a lot this year. I am ready to get back to feeling kind of normal-ish. \n\nAny time I get a tingle where I had it with GBS it makes me pause. When you had it, how long did it take from the symptoms going from pins and needles feeling to getting much worse? That was pretty quick to be honest.\n\nSunday I had trouble walking and my feet felt like they had this wave of pins and needles going over them. I thought my shoes or socks were to tight because I mowed my yard that day. I was still able to play my accoustic guitar. \n\nMonday, drove to work but could not really feel my feet and my arms, specifically my triceps were getting slugish. I had trouble walking down stairs, but not up. Driving home I had trouble with my vision tracking.\n\nTuesday I go to see the Dr, I had a nurse practitioner because at that point I did not care who saw me. She looked at my symptoms and said sounds like GBS. I had never heard of GBS at that point. I get a CT scan scheduled for later in the day. While waiting I tried to play my electric guitar which is easier than the accoustic and I just could not. I go get my CT scan and it comes back clear, which was awesome.\n\nWednesday I go to see the Neurologist and he sends me to the ER to get tests done. I get my spinal tap and it did not really hurt because I did not care, just help me getter better. I did not know you could have Protein in your spinal fluid but mine was super high which confirmed the GBS suspicion. I then get admitted to the hospital. They classify me as a fall risk - yay. The IV/IG stuff made me pee - A LOT - so the nurse was in frequently.\n\nThursday, lay in bed, get treatment, get an MRI which was clean, and do some therapy.\n\nFriday - Sunday the same except Sunday I go home.\n\nI could not sleep under the covers for a long time because it made my feet feel the wave of pins and needles. I live in Texas so the day I was able to feel my feet burn on the concrete getting the mail was a big day!\n\nI did 3 months of physcial and occupational therapy and I made them work me hard because I had to go back to work at some point. I also did a test, twice, to test the nerve response or something between them. They stuck a ton of needles in me and I wish I could remember what that test was called but I did that pretty quickly after going home from the hospital and I was normal.\n\nThe neurologist sent me to a \"Super Specialist\" and she confirmed I had GBS but because I had the eye stuff going on I probably had a more rare version called Miller-Fisher syndrome. \n\nAfter going back to work I could either go to work, or workout/exercise, but not really both. Kind Of sucked. When Covid caused us to work from home I got back into working out and was doing great.", "Joining the Navy ", "Rate of Recurrent Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome After mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine BNT162b2  It turns out that there is likely to be increased risk of relapse due to the Pfizer vaccination. \n\nThis is a retrospective medical record study and as such, it is suffers from diagnostic biases (mild relapses might not have reported to hospital). There was one serious relapse and several minor possibly linked cases. \n\nGiven an incidence period of 4 weeks, 579 patients, the incidence of the one serious case is roughly 2000-3000 times higher than background rates over that incidence period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo note however, the rate of (initial) GBS cases reported after Pfizer or Moderna vaccines is very low. It is around ten-fold lower than that of AstraZeneca, looking at UK, Australian and Canadian reports per total people vaccinated. Of course there may be some background levels interfering with those reports, since they are not limiting it to a strict 4 week followup period (GBS will almost always start showing symptoms within 4 weeks of the infectious (or vaccine) trigger, but that does not mean the patient will get a reported diagnosis within that time.)\n\nRemember that background rates of \"0.75-2 per 100,000\" per year is 0.058-0.15 per 100,000 for a 4 week period.\n\n\n\n(\n\n( Even that slight risk is enough for me to want to pass. I know Covid sucks, I have had it, but I would rather have Covid over GBS. Thank you for sharing this. I know personally, I have been waiting for more research on this so it helps to be more fully informed to make a decision. You are also at risk for a relapse from covid.  I have relapsed- but not from a vaccine.  I understand being concerned if you got GBs the first time from a vaccine- but the risks seem minimal All this really says is that there was some minor GBS impacts on people who received Pfizer.\n\nThere is no one admitted long term to the hospital as one would expect with a GBS relapse. We do not know at what stage in recovery people were following GBS incidents in their history.\n\nI would anticipate given the recovery time for GBS that 3 months after discharge they may be more likely to respond poorly to anything including Pfizer when compared to someone who recovered 20 years ago.\n\nWe do not know the ages, if anyone has GBS and any other medical conditions. The information is seriously lacking, nor do we know the treatments received for people's initial GBS diagnosis.\n\nConsidering that Covid-19 is a massive trigger for GBS, I stand 100% by my decision to take Pfizer, I had zero reaction in the last 5 months since I got vaccinated. \n\nWho would rather risk Covid-19 with a side of GBS when your body is already wrecked, over a couple of days of treatments following a vaccine (this is not a relapse of full GBS described, just an easily treated flare up)? &gt;We do not know the ages, if anyone has GBS and any other medical conditions.\n\nWe do know the ages, if you read the letter... The one serious case was a woman in her 30s and she was initially hospitalised with classic GBS symptoms. \"Minor proximal weakness\" was reported at most recent followup. Those of us who know neurologists know that patients can still have significant disability despite neurologists claiming the nerves have recovered.\n\nBut I am not asking anyone to justify their choice to get vaccinated or not, I shared this simply as a part of informed consent. I missed that bit. \n\nIt does not change the fact that the study does not discuss where she was in recovery of GBS when she got Pfizer. Or how well that was treated. \n\nThere can be flare ups with worsening of symptoms during the 1-2 years in average recovery and we do not know if that would or would not have occurred regardless of the vaccine being administered. The fact that thousands of CIDP and GBS patients have been receiving Pfizer and Moderna for 10 months now, one case is not enough for me to consider this information worth noting.\n\nWe do know that Covid-19 has a massive risk to those who have GBS. That cannot be discounted alongside any risks considered through vaccination.", "Special Double Monthly Discussion thanks to Alexee7: DOWN THERE and GBS This one's a biggie and we owe a huge thanks to /r/Alexee7 for opening up this discussion!\n\nHow has GBS affected you...down there?\n\nTampons, sex, it is all fair game - how has GBS had an affect on your bits and bobs? Any advice for making things better if you have noticed issues? All right, well I will kick this thread off with some SPICY chat - GBS has made me VERY sensitive down there! Well, all over. I hate being tickled, too. But it is definitely ummm noticeable. Sometimes it is great, sometimes I get OVER stimulated during sex and straight up need to stop. Foreplay definitely needs to be done a certain way - without buildup, pleasure transmits as pain to my brain because it is just an overload of sensation.", "Could this be Guillain-Barr\u00e9? Decided to come here for answers because my doctor has blown this off, but I am concerned. I have a viral infection that I think has cleared, or is cleaning except for a persistent cough and extraordinary fatigue. I have also felt weak, like I cannot walk right. \n\nEarlier this week (four days ago, 11/9) I noticed my right lower leg (ankle, calf) and my right pinky and ring fingers were numb. Not totally numb, just desensitized. The next morning, the symptoms went away. That night, they came back and have since stayed (11/10). On the third day, 11/11, i woke up and Immediately felt my forearm was still numb, and so was lower right leg (inner shin, outer ankle, calf). This progresses to my whole right arm. Right arm felt stiff, almost swollen, slow. Kind of like right after pins and needles or right before, when you cannot move very well. On 11/12, I continued to feel numbness in the same areas throughout the day, but this sometimes felt on/off. On 11/13 (today) it is gotten worse and I can feel pins and needles in my right forearm, and back of my leg. My whole leg felt numb for a while. Now my motor function in my right hand seems very slowed down. I am not typing very quickly, for instance. \n\nCould this be GBS? It seems plausible. As far as I know the only really significant diagnostic tool is a lumbar puncture (it is not as bad as it sounds, I had one). They look for some specific elevated protein level. There are different types of GBS which I did not know about until later so the progression can be different. When I was in the hospital my medical team kept chasing red herrings of other symptoms. Luckily I had enough GBS symptoms that they started me on the treatment pretty early. And apparently that is very key. The quicker you start treatment the quicker you recover which sounds kind of obvious but I went down super quick\u2026 slightly tingly feet and 12 hours later I could not lift my legs of the bed let alone walk. 3 days after treatment I was able to lift my legs again. I was told this was very accelerated on both ends. Anecdotal I know so take with a grain of salt.  \n\nIn my opinion any increasing numbness is worthy of concern especially after any sort of viral infection. I would recommend getting another doctors opinion, especially a neurologist if you can. \n\nGood luck!! I would strongly suggest visiting an urgent care facility at the very least, if not an emergency room. What you are describing is similar to how my symptoms progressed. I do not mean to scare you, but I was on a ventilator within a week of noticing that the thumb on my right hand felt a little weird.\n\nTips for when you go in: Mention GBS by name early in the conversation, do not wait for them to come around to it. I was on my third urgent care visit before anyone came up with GBS as a possible diagnosis. Advocate for yourself \u2014 insist on tests, or insist that they document in your chart that they declined to run the tests. I believe GBS can only diagnosed with a lumbar puncture, so they may offer that in an attempt to get you to back down. If they do, you say yes. If they do not, request it. No one wants a friggin spinal tap for fun. Be polite in this process. Medical staff are crazy overworked right now. You may be scared, but do your best to remain calm and rational. I agree with the others that you should see a medical doctor, but I do not think it is GBS.\n\nThe characteristic symptom of GBS is bilateral (both sides) acute flaccid paresis. The problem with the cerebrospinal fluid tests is the sensitivity is quite poor, particularly early on in the illness (and for the non-demylinating variant). This leads medical doctors to mistakenly discount the GBS diagnosis when all other symptoms (and differential diagnosis) still suggest GBS.\n\n(\n\n(\n\nThe test itself is expensive, invasive and medical staff are not going to request it unless there is strong medical need. Are you speaking from personal experience or is this reply based on research? ", "Hi gbs experiencer here - this sub still active?  Does not really appear to be, I keep hoping it will be.\n\nThat said, how are you? I am good thanks, how is you? I Had GBS 20 years ago - still have some problems with feet re footdrop, so was curious as to how others deal with it etc. Ahh yeah. Good old footdrop; I am really sorry to hear that. Have you experienced any other residual side effects?\n\nMy wife had GBS about 18 months ago and it was a 2 week decline, 2 week recovery, and 8 weeks of intensive PT. However, she never experienced any lingering footdrop. For her, she will sometimes experience what she describes as \"light tingling\" in one or more of her extremeties, usually the left side.\n\nI know that does not answer your question directly, but hopefully this post will draw some ther attention in the sub. I also just enjoy (wrong word?) sharing the experience with others who have been there, as (in my experience) there are so few people who can relate to or understand what you are describing. Sorry to hear about your wife - glad she is making a good recovery. Tingling at 18m does not sound too uncommon - I had that (I still have numb feet) and a slight tremor - but I can function fine, bar the ability to fall over sometimes on uneven ground due to footdrop.\n\nHow old is she if you do not mind me asking?\n\nI found with some people it can seem a competition as to who had the disease worst! Only natural, and I can fall into that trap too!\n\nI had 1 week decline, 4m on ventilator, about 6m wheelchair then 3m sticks - about 15m before walked unaided. But now, most days do not think about it - though, as I said I would like to plan ahead re my footdrop She is 28, to answer your question.\n\nWhen it first presented, they sent her home with 'localized muscle swelling' in her arms and legs -- attributing it to over exertion. We spent a week at home, deteriorating, before we could get our primary to help us get readmitted. I am thankful that it never progressed to her lungs. She is come away from it with a whole different awareness of the state of her body and mind.\n\nAll indicators were that she had a 'mild' experience that presented well. When she got ill, I did a little research and came to the conclusion that the disease is not fully understood, presents inconsistently, and varies tremendously from patient to patient. At which point we agreed we were not going to look it up on the internet, we were taking it day-by-day as it came. \n\nAnd I think that is the key that a lot of people miss -- that at this point, we know how its likely to present and what may happen (put the patient in the ICU), but everybody gets their own experience, and no matter how 'mild' it is, it is still terrifying. When it gets to be like that, it really cannot be a competition. Just compassion and support. You hit the nail on the head. Pardon my French, but it is fucking terrifying.\n\nI was a medical student and sent Home as Drs thought I was a hypochondriac! Following Day crawled back in and a wise Dr had a hunch.\n\nAs a Dr I was asked to talk to some patients and would say to them \u2018it is terrifying and that is ok to feel that! But look at me......\u2019\n\nIt is equally, if not more, terrifying for the families to see it progress. You are right, it is not understood. E.g. why should the immune system stop after a while and allow recovery? No sense at all, but glad it did.\n\nUnsurprisingly I had a course of therapy after which helped a lot  Yeah, we both have biological sciences degrees and research backgrounds and the technical information totally helped ease our minds. The takeaway for me, in the end, was that cases are rare enough and the syndrome is severe enough (data collection takes a back-seat to treatment) that a more complete understanding is limited via a limited data pool. At the moment the disease often appears to be a novelty, even for seasoned medical staff. It is considered  a \u2018zebra\u2019 I.e \u2018if you hear hooves, think horses not zebra\u2019\n\nYes RTCs would be tricky and there would understandably be little investment from drug companies as it is rare.\n\nThat said, what my training did teach me was you do not have to know every disease but to recognise what symptoms may potentially be serious - what did your wife or you notice first?\n\nI went to GP day 2 with numb hands and feet and he noticed no patellar reflexes, asked about history of MS in family, then said I had flu. Day 3 my lips were numb, walking weird and A&amp;E had same findings but made same conclusion..... I find that baffling today but hey ho, it is taught me well to be vigilant for \u2018odd\u2019 symptoms.\n\nOne thing I remember is the fatigue after..... that was so frustrating, but eventually went away. Is your wife experiencing this ? Ever since I was first hospitalized they had me wear special boots that prevent foot drop. So I am not sure how to deal with it after 20 years, but if anyone else out there is stuck in bed with GBS make sure to talk to your physical therapist about getting boots to prevent foot drop like these:\n\n  I hope so - I am in recovery since August 2017 Really late, but I hope this sub is active. I am 6 weeks to the day from when symptoms began. I had tingling in hands and feet and loss of taste, back pain, weakness, and facial droop on right side only. Tingling changed to numbness and climbed up my legs and arms (halfway up calves and halfway up forearms).  I spent 2 days on ventilator, 7 days in ICU, had IVIG and 5 rounds of plasmapheresis. 2 weeks in the acute/neuro floor of hospital, 9 days in acute rehab hospital and am now going to be doing outpatient occupational and physical therapy for 8 weeks.\n\nI met another young man when I was in acute rehab hospital, but he only had weakness, no numbness and tingling and did not have the emotional whiplash that is presented with my GBS. It would be really great to talk to someone who understands what I am going through. Hello - greetings. Yup it is one of the more weird diseases - sounds like you had it bad. Had mine 20 years ago - long stay in icu and then physical rehab. Physically I was well looked after, emotionally - I wasnt mistreated but not a lot of support. It is terrifying, tiring - also fascinating and became a good motivator etc a real mish mash of emotions that were difficult to make sense of.\n\nYou able to talk about how you feel to anyone? Wow sorry super late getting back to this. My mom encouraged me to start seeing a psychologist just to have someone to talk to, and the rehab hospital I went to has a quarterly support group for GBS. It is hard trying to explain every time in PT what it feels like today. The therapist will be like okay how do your feet feel today? And I have to be like.... Uh... The best way I can describe it is there is 100 layers of duct tape on the bottom of my feet and when I stand on them too long then it feels like there are giant rocks on the balls of my feet between the skin and the 100 layers of duct tape! Yes I remember that. I used it say it was odd that I could see my hands as hands, but they felt like I had two big oven gloves on them. Slowly they turned into hands again over the weeks My mom is very excited that I have had a few exchanges with you. The GBS support group in my area is only once per quarter, and after the millionth time of me telling her \"YOU JUST DONT UNDERSTAND\", she is glad I have someone who does now.\n\nI have to go next week to get an additional 5 IVIG infusions (outpatient). In addition to PT and following up with my primary.  Yeh I always thought it was a bit like walking on the moon...very difficult to explain to people.\n\nDo you feel unwell when you have the ivig infusions? The first time I had IVIG I was mostly unconscious, because I was on the ventilator. This time around I just feel really really tired. I had a migraine yesterday, I have not had one of those in probably 12 years. ", "CIDP in child of polio survivor and neurological symptoms in grandchild My grandfather got poliomyelitis during WWI. It mostly affected his legs and feet. Doctors told him that he would never walk again, but boy did he show them. He eventually learned to talk, even eventually without braces, by hyperextending his knees backwards a bit, kind of locking them in place. He also suffered from post-polio syndrome and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nMy mother's diagnosis changed several times over the years, but it is been CIDP for some time now. I was in university when her diagnosis changed from Parkinson's, among others, and spent much of my spare time in the medical library pouring over medical texts, databases, and journals. I remember being convinced that her father's polio (and post-polio syndrome) had something to do with her demyelinating disease. I am fairly convince of her diagnosis, but I think there is also something else going on. I remember reading a lot about a genetic condition that affects the body's ability to create/repair myelin, but I cannot remember what it is called now, and I cannot find any compelling evidence though internet research (without access to academic databases). I think she never had the DNA testing required to diagnosis it (I think because of the overlap in symptoms). Does anyone know what disease/condition/syndrome I am thinking of?\n\nWhen I started having mild neurological symptoms in my 20s, I was diagnosed with benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) and something about \"Martin Gruber.\" I think many of my symptoms were overlooked because I was also being diagnosed with spondylitis, spinal stenosis, and annular disc bulges at the time. My BFS has persisted for more than 5 years (my neurologist told me to expect the symptoms to subside in this time). I have been having trouble swallowing and even difficulty speaking at times (with a strange feeling just above the joint of my right collar bone in my neck). For example, two times this week I was speaking and suddenly could not half way through a sentence. I tried clearing my throat and coughing, but still could barely speak (laryngitis?).  Could these be signs of a degenerative neurological disease? I am trying to decide if it is time to talk to a neurologist again (it is been a decade). \n\nTL;DR: Grandpa had polio and post-polio syndrome, mom has CIDP, I have BFS. Could this all be related? This question is way, way out of my league. If it helps any, I have no history of any of the things you mention. Given everything I have come to learn about GBS and the CIDP variant, neither has any genetically-oriented connection whatsoever. I am also not a doctor but I would say if you have suspicions, why not just go see a neurologist?", "Any advice?

Mild but low so I googled that and I read could be caused by many factors including autoimmune disease anyone else have lung issues or lung scar tissue anything like that after Guillain Barr\u00e8?

Thank you so much. And thank you for letting me know about your breathing problems I hope you are well now and have rid gbs symptoms Yes. I had a medical mystery tour for 2 years of 18 doctors, 170 different tests run multiple times before I was referred to John's Hopkins Neurology. I was quickly diagnosed with CIDP and my prior hospitalization GBS based on test results the other 18 doctors did not understand.  Keep records. I have a binder with all my test results as not every doctor I see has access to electronic records.\n\nAlso, yes I had trouble breathing.  At one point only half my diaphragm worked.  My chest muscles are still weak and spasm easily after 16 years... but I have no trouble breathing,  just cannot twist my torso. Thank you so much for your response has been incredibly good for me to read it and supporting because now I know that I am not the only one and that even though it may take a while that there is hope I will be diagnosed with the right diagnosis I have been keeping a binder since I got diagnosed with GPS2 years ago and will take it with me thank you so much for the advice on that.

Some days she is crying from how unbearable the pain is for her. It literally breaks my heart. \n\nDoes anyone that has/had GBS know anything I could do to help my mom or make her life even just a bit better?

It is undoubtedly rough on both of you, seeing the other go through so much.\n\nI am sort of an old now, and I wish I had been there more for my mom when I was in my early 20s and she was not doing well. That is not a guilt trip, just a longtime regret I am so sorry for you and your mother's trial. Make sure she is taking plenty of L-lysine. It is an amino acid that helps repair the myelin sheath around the nerves. This is not something the average doctor would have told her to take. Lots of ppl report improvements using it. Could you please tell me how to go about getting Lysine. I have GBS and I have zero feeling from my knees down and my hands. It just a terrible thing I am going through. CBD oil will not hurt. The best way to ease the pain is working out (it is hard I know) (perhaps yoga together?). Google \"electric muscle stimulator\" and get one from amazon, it considerably helped me. Let her know that she can make it better, it can get better. Massive B12 shots. 3ml/day. I have your Mom's symptoms. You have to buy it over the Internet. And for walking use vibram five fingers. Feels much better and makeswalking easier. GET COUNSELLING!  Together.  I cannot say this strongly enough!  When someone goes through a life changing event, such as GBS, it effects the whole family. I do not know your family, your dynamics or how you are, but a professional can see things you cannot, and often differently.  Has she seen a physician lately, new meds, suggestions from here, to deal with pain.  To have to re-invent your life is very very hard. Therapy, counselling, peer support can go a long way.  Go to gbs-cidp.org lots of information and support there.  Keep posting, hope we can help. Thank you so much! We have a lot of CBD oil around the house, but I will definitely tell her about the muscle stimulator. I appreciate it a lot.

I got GBS, it stuck me so bad that I went from normal to on life support in two days. They told my husband and sons to say goodbye to me. Then the IVIG finally worked. By that time I was paralyzed from my ears down.  97 days later I was able to walk out of the hospital.

There are going to be days that you do not care that it is not a bad case, you do not feel lucky. Then you will see something or someone that will make you realize how lucky you really are.  The added bonus is that you will get to spend the rest of your life explaining what GBS is. Welcome to the club. Same! Mine only went up to my belly button and they chose not to give me treatment. I am about 18 months out but still struggle with distances, stairs, inclines.  I am so sorry to hear that but you truly are a fighter, it is been a journey and it will stick for the rest of my life. I do believe that my recovery and it not spreading was one of the luckiest things that have happened. I now have a rehearsed explanation what GBS is and how it impacted me. Hope it gets better! What was the cause of yours if you do not mind me asking? Same for yours! An upper respiratory infection - cold or flu!  I think you were misinformed. I know patients who get Immunoglobulin years after the accute incident. It is very expensive. That is why the insurances do not like to pay for it.  This.

They persisted and I had issues like muscle pain and parasthesia in my right leg only when doing repetitive leg lifting (stair master, elliptical). I could function and was fine during this time.\n\nThen in March I had an acute attack, where progressively over about a week I became very weak, lost muscle mass and weight very rapidly. I could not open a bottle and could still walk but very slowly. I had nerve pain in my neck and weird muscle pain that felt like my muscles were detaching from my body or like body parts were dislocating. I lost function to move bowels and urinate. Lost my period two days in. I did not sleep for 5 days because my muscles would violently jerk when I was drifting off. I had heightened reflexes for about 5 days and then absent reflexes after that. Facial weakness where i could barely speak. Prickly burning feeling in my tongue. I did have some respiratory weakness but nothing crazy, a lot of that was anxiety and worried I would die basically.\n\nI wanted to go to the ER but my mom said not to because I had already been several times that month and they are going to think I am nuts. I should have went when I lost bowel function. \n\nI started recovering about 3 weeks post onset. Today my fatigue is almost gone, I can do my hair and makeup in front of the mirror without breaks. Reflexes are normal again. Bowels came back and I would say are at 85% function now. Period is better but still very light which is unusual for me. Strength is better but definitely not 100%. Here is the thing that is concerning me very deeply - I have begun to get liquid in my nose when I drink. That was not an issue during my episode and has been happening about a month and a half but has been very bad this past week. I am waiting on an EMG soon and I am very nervous because this specific type of dysphagia is an ALS symptom (so are the fasciculations). No issues with speech.\n\nDoes this sound like anyone\u2019s story? Does not sound like GBS to me. The recovery time for GBS is much longer. This is not how my experience with GBS was at all and there is no way that I would have recovered without IVIG treatment. Some things mirror some symptoms but I am going to say this sounds like something else. I would also say when you start to lose bodily functions get to the hospital immediately. Your mother is not giving you very good advice , and after years of on and off medical issues I have know that some are hard to diagnose and some require repeat visits. I visited 4 seperate medical practitioners the day I was admitted for guillean barre. If it is autoimmune based there are not simple blood tests to pinpoint the problem. Always , always advocate for yourself and use bigger hospitals, especially ones with universities attached . They have more funding , better doctors and fresh minds. Good luck and I really hope they find the problem. Interesting thanks! Thanks! GBS has a fast onset and it is flaccid paralysis so no muscle twitches AFAIK. (I am not an MD but I did have MFS/GBS.) You are basically a limp noodle for a while, even my eyes were paralyzed. \n\nThere is definitely something going on with you, the loss of bladder and bowel control is concerning. CIDP is a \u201cchronic\u201d form of GBS and the onset is longer. ALS causes muscle twitches, weight loss, trouble swallowing. Do not panic because it is probably not be any of these but DO see a doctor! It could be be some thing simple but you will have to see a doctor to find out. \n\nFeel better and please update us!

I would almost rather die of Covid than contract GBS again. \n\nI would feel better about it if I had better health insurance and was sure I would not be bankrupted by the care required for GBS recovery. Last time I had it I was on my parents' insurance. Because I can work remotely, I was planning on waiting until there was more data on us. But with the new \"no mask\" announcement from the CDC I figure my risk assessment is now basically \"Getting GBS after a vaccination &gt; getting GBS after Covid.\" \n\nI will let you all know how it goes. Just thought I would share in case it helps anyone. Hope all goes well. I think your risk assessment makes perfect sense! Do not miss the vaccine megathread:  I will also comment there afterwards. Thanks! There is no virus in the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines.You should be AOK. \nAlso, there are no recorded instances of GBS re-occurrence with the mRNA Vaccines. This is with close to a billion mRNA doses complete.\n\n\n\nDeath is not better than GBS. You could pay for a few months of COBRA if you are worried about insurance (its expensive but always an option). We all have a pity party story to tell about our GBS, try not to go there as its not a growth or healthy mindset in general. \n\n\n\nGetting COVID19 then possibly GBS is like gambling with a loaded gun. The potential side effects from COVID19 are just as scary as GBS. impotence, mental breaks, stroke, clotting, joint inflammation, chronic fatigue, brain haze, oh yeah...that annoying death thing...\n\n\n\nGet the shot. COVID19 = Virus. GBS Vaccine is not a virus, its a very clever way to teach your immune systems to recognize the corona (the crown structure) on COVID viruses. \n\n\n\nMy vaccine experience (GBS severe case in 2014 still have problems walking with left leg and ankle, recently finally have full use of hands 2019):\n\n\nI had a headache and a sore arm for a few hours after my first shot and a had a minor freakout after I had some tingling, but it dissipated after a few days ( it really stressed me out). After my second shot I had a 20 hour headache and felt terrible for about 1.5 days. \n\n\nYou got this, you are going to be just fine. The relief you will have after you are through the second shot is really a great feeling. Thanks. Really, this helped.", "Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Went Well, Despite GBS (Miller Fisher) In My History I am sharing in case this is helpful to the community.\n\nI was diagnosed Miller Fisher syndrome (a subtype of GBS) as a young child, and have since then fully recovered.  I do not have any notable lingering issues from it.  However, I was reluctant to get the COVID-19 vaccine due to fears of complications from GBS.  After reading the posts on this community, I decided that I would do it.\n\nI received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19 in April.  I had no side effects following the first dose.  After the second dose, I felt fine for about 10 hours before I started to feel slightly under the weather.  I spend the subsequent 24 hours with mild flu-like symptoms including fatigue and aching joints.  I believe my side effects were similar to what the overall population of vaccinated people experienced.  None of my side effects appeared to be out of the ordinary nor related to my GBS history.  After those 24 hours concluded, I was back to feeling 100%.  It is now over a month following my second dose and I have not had any issues.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to those with similar GBS history who are seeking experiential information. congrats, and glad you are feeling well! I have Miller Fisher too, but I am still recovering since a year and a half ago. How long did it take you to recover? I took the first dose and I thought my GBS was coming back ast first for a day, but the next few I just felt crummy. I might wait until I am done breastfeeding for my second dose because my baby acted very fussy for a couple of days after the first dose. I wanted to thank you for sharing because I have spent days trying to find anyone with MFS getting the vaccine. So thank you thank you thank you! I am 20 months out from my Miller Fisher diagnosis. The Pfizer vaccine did not give me any issues other than feeling sick for a day or so. My second dose was in early April.\n\nNow if only my face would get back to normal. So much for that 6 month recovery\u2026 I got diagnosed with GBS 1.5 years ago and have recovered since then, got Pfizer as well last month and no issues. I am sorry that this probably will not be much help to answer your question.  Since I had the syndrome as a young child, I do not have much information about how long it took to 100% recover.  I have medical records suggesting that I was still showing some slow reflexes and muscle weakness about 4 months post-treatment; but, no definitive records on how long the following lingering recovery may have taken.  Also, given my very young age at the time, my recovery cycle might have been different than it would be for an adult.  I hope your recovery continues to progress.  Best wishes with that and the little one :) . Thank you! I too had Miller Fisher variant of GBS when I was 27. I was intubated for three weeks, had an allergic reaction to one of the medications which almost cost me my life on the third day, then was diagnosed with c-diff on top of it all. I am now a mother of two babies under three years old and I have my first Phizer vaccine scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. I am terrified but also hopeful this will all be fine and I can give some antibodies to my children via my breast milk. Although there are no promises in life, your post has calmed some of my anxiety. I plan to post an update. Thank you for your courage and sharing your story. \u2764\ufe0f", "GBS Twice- Vaccines Hi all. I had GBS in 2005 after vaccines, was 2 weeks inpatient, symptoms paused right before ventilator after 4 rounds of IVIG. Rehabbed for a year, learned to walk, talk, eat, and everything else in life. I never was vaccinated again until last year. I got a TDAP and immediately had numbness, muscle weakness and nerve pain. For about two weeks I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness from my toes into my arms and numbness. I took gabapentin for the pain and rested. I have not slept well since and was diagnosed with restless leg. The vaccine is mandated with my employer and my PCM and Nuero are advising against it. I am a healthy 32 year old that likely had COVID Jan 2020, and have been exposed to it in my job, and have had zero issues. I know there is little literature saying GBS was diagnosed after a MRNA vaccine, but I also know in my experience a lot of time if the protein is not present in your spinal chord at the time of the spinal tap, it is not officially diagnosed as GBS. I also know it can take some people a long time to develop symptoms and get a proper diagnosis. Any thoughts? As you all know it is horrifying and I cannot imagine going through it again. It is sounding like almost no one is going to get a medical exemption from the vaccine in the US. Thank you! In 1995, I got a severe case of GBS from a flu vaccine.  I was in ICU for 10 days, in the hospital for weeks, and it took me a year to be almost normal again.  I was about an hour from being put on the ventilator as well, but 4 rounds of plasmapheresis had stopped the progression of symptoms just in time.  I still have some residual neuropathy on and off to this day. My neurologist told me never to get a vaccine again as it might trigger GBS again.  When the Covid vaccines came out, I tried to contact my original neurologist to ask about the vaccines, but he had passed away in 2016.  So I emailed Johns Hopkins neurology department.  They told me to definitely get one of the mRNA vaccines.  They said I was more likely to get GBS again from getting Covid, than if I got the mRNA vaccines.  So I got the Pfizer vaccine.  It did trigger a little bit of neuropathy after the second vaccine, but it was because I got dehydrated.  I recommend to hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!!!  I did go to the ER to check, just in case,  and got a new neurologist.  She prescribed a few weeks of physical therapy and a lot of hydration.  Now I am fine and relieved to have gotten the vaccine.  The J&amp;J vaccine is the one that has the GBS warning associated with it.  I hope this helps relieve your anxieties about it a little bit. \"So I emailed Johns Hopkins neurology department. They told me to definitely get one of the mRNA vaccines. They said I was more likely to get GBS again from getting Covid, than if I got the mRNA vaccines.\"\n\nI was in the exact same boat. \nMany people on this forum cannot wrap their brains around this simple statement. Its so accurate. You left out Not only getting GBS again, but dying, or amputations, and all the other ugliness that COVID has brought us. \n\n\nI made the same choice as you. Pfizer mRNA vaccine for me. I had some tingling, and was tired as hell for about a week after the second shot. I agree!  I do understand people\u2019s hesitation though, as that original GBS experience was pretty miserable!  After getting the Johns Hopkins advice that a person is more likely to get GBS from the virus than from the mRNA vaccine, I happened to see this news article and I made an appointment for my first vaccine that day!    I definitely understand there a real risks from getting covid. I just wonder if since I have had covid and have had over 30 direct patient confirmed covid exposures that I know of (I am a therapist) and have had zero issues, it just feels like I am more likely to get an adverse reaction to the vaccine (every vaccine I have received since GBS I have had a reaction) for me, it seems like a giant risk. I have also been reading that there is a shortage of IVIG, so then if I do get it again, will there be treatment available? I definitely understand.  It is a very personal risk calculation. Some people should not risk it.  I would do whatever my neurologist told me to do, as he/she is well aware of your medical history and risks.  I believe, though, that if you have a legitimate medical excuse, you can get an exemption.  You will just have to test frequently since you cannot get the vaccine. Good luck!  Do what is medically correct for you! Thank you so much. It is not looking like I will get an exemption so I may have to walk away from everything if I feel like its not worth the risk. It is just so helpful to hear all arguments, perspectives and experiences to help make the decision. I wish we all had more time to wait and see. It sounds like we are starting to learn and hopefully be able to predict the more serious reactions to the vaccine so everyone can make a good informed decision and I do not think I have enough info to take the risk yet. But I follow everything that is asked of me as far as masking and testing and behavior socially, I am hoping that will be enough to keep my job. I am so sorry that your job may still be at risk.  I would think that, of all places, a hospital would know that not everyone can get the vaccine.  I am very pro-vax! But not if there is a good likelihood it would harm someone.  Especially if you are good about following all the other protocols.  It would be nice if some research comes out of this pandemic that could predict a person\u2019s likelihood of getting severe effects from either Covid and/or the vaccines.  That may be beyond capability of the current state of technology however.  It would certainly make the decision for people like us easier! I am pretty sure everyone who has had GBS has had quite a bit of hesitation. Myself included. However, with the copious amounts of data showing things are looking fantastic for GBS survivors with the mRNA vaccines not getting the shot puts you at greater risk of re-occurrence if you get COVID. As i  mentioned before all those other terrible side effects including that silly death thing. I got GBS from the Pfizer vaccine. Whatever you do, be on the lookout for symptoms. I am so sorry this happened to you. This is why I am so nervous about getting a vaccine again. I hope you are doing okay I am struggling still and hoping I make a full recovery eventually. I am here from a flu shot. I have had medical exemptions to all of my employer's mandatory vaccines, including covax this year. I have had no issues from my employer receiving these exemptions. My neurologists have written the supporting letters. \n\nHave not had a vaccine since my attack 20 years ago. I have always been under active treatment. \n\nThere is no great general advice on this topic other than perhaps do not do anything until you have talked to your neurologist and get your questions answered. All of our experiences, bodies and in some cases, treatment plans, are unique. I am so sorry to hear that :( I hope you have a full recovery. Do everything PT, speech and occupational therapy say to do. It is really difficult and can be a lonely experience. I wish you well! That is awesome to hear. I have also been given exemptions for everything, but it is not sounding like it is going to happen. I really hope so though. Did it get reported? The guidance is strongly worded that there has been no cases of GBS following MRNA. I would guess there is a lag from info in VAERS being sorted and cataloged. But that Israeli study just came out I saw on JAMA citing cases of GBS after MRNA. I would also guess the initial trials might not have included those with a history of GBS? My neurologist was working on reporting it. I was the third case our area hospital had seen (\\~6.5M population) Are you in the US? Yes Three cases is very high. When I had it I was the second case in 4 years in a major city in the US. 10 years go. Yes, it is. Although with a 70% vaccination rate there are far more people getting covid vaccines than people who ever got flu vaccines. I got mine from Pfizer too. They need to put it on the vaccine injury table. So sorry this happened to you too. That guidance is outdated. I routinely download VAERS data as part of my occupation, and the Moderna and Pfizer products have hundreds of entries for GBS, CIDP and various neuropathies (motor, peripheral) as of last Thursday. How do I access that report? I have an apt with my nuero tomorrow and would love to be able to bring the data. But the site is really hard to figure out. It is not a standard report - it is a data download from VAERS. I download the entire event report for the Covid-19 vaccine, get the text file into Excel, and from there I use pivot tables and filters to get to the neuropathies of the moment. \n\nYour neurologist likely knows. The Peripherial Nerve Society has been monitoring the data here in the US. It is important to note that the basis many physicians turn to discussing GBS and vaccine safety is a paper written by some of the leading GBS specialists across the globe (Lunn, Cornblath, Jacobs, etc.)\n\nHowever, and it is a big however, this paper was published in February 2021, as the products were rolling out. There is been no fresh look since the J&amp;J announcement or a fresh look as we close in on a year of rollout. Okay, thank you that is really helpful. Is there any way to gather this data to bring to the apt? I am so sorry that happened to you. I wish you the best recovery! What are the symptoms I should be looking out for? Pain, numbness, tingling, all of which normally start in both hands or both feet simulatenously. Also, difficulty breathing or drooping of facial muscles.  &lt;If you read about the animals in the trials they developed auto immune disease where they bled out of their nose, brains and other organs. Of course they cant figure it out as all this is one giant experiment with zero liability to manufacturer.&gt;\n\nUgh...here we go.....\n\n\n\nI am sorry apparently everyone you know is sick, suffering,  or dying from GBS or the Vaccine. Most of us here have actually had GBS and do not want it again. Ever.  \n\n\n\nThis information you are posting about the animal testing is completely false and has been debunked into oblivion.  It originates from conspiracy sites, social media, world renown jackass Clive Palmer and so forth. These sources are fan favorites of the anti-vaxx crowd for spreading misinformation, and also for non-scientific illiterates looking to win political points or find some level of self justification. \n\n\n\nThe Vaccination does not completely prevent infection from COVID 19. Its not a cure. The virus has mutated and effectiveness to the new variations dropped slightly.  However, it SIGNIFICANTLY reduces infection and transmission rates, and breakthrough mortality cases. This has been documented very thoroughly and there are hundreds of studies confirming this information. \n\n\n\n\nI work in industry and can tell you the only thing that killed those animals is the sad/cruel and shit process of euthanizing them after the concurrent trials were finished. When clinical trails happen if animals start dying for ANY reason whatsoever everything is halted immediately and will not move forward. Period. Very intense scrutiny starts and the FDA is notified immediately. \n\n\n\nAll of this information is provided and available to the FDA and they are watching VERY actively. When Animals DO die its largely because they (the Pharma Companies) are dosing them with 100x-2000x the amount meant to be used... to find boundaries. This practice (the extreme dosing) did not occur for any of these vaccines as there is no exclusivity. \n\n\nIf you are curious:\nThis shit practice originates from BioTech and Pharma helps them change dosing regimens so they can keep drug exclusivity (only they can make and sell it). Which would mean..... no cheaper generic versions. As it resets the 7-17 year sales exclusivity timer. I am sort of confused as to why people would avoid the COVID vaccine because of a history of guillain barre.  The risk for things like guillain barre as well as other autoimmune and inflammatory complications is far higher with exposure to sarscov2.  \n\nIf the vaccine could cause it, then also too the offending infection you are trying to prevent could also but with a higher risk I imagine.  We are all going to be exposed to sarscov2 at some point.\n\nI had guillainbarre in 2005 and it was rough, but because of the reasons I stated above, I got the vaccine.", "So worried I have GBS &amp; not being listened to I got my flu shot Friday, like I do every year. Starting Monday, I had neck pain, a headache and tingling in my hands. I went to my primary and she was like coincidental bc you sit at a desk all day you are tense, go get a massage. Soo I did and the tingling got worse. As of today (Fri) I still have the tingling in my hands, my legs feel tired but no tingling. The weirdest thing is I feel like I have a buzzing spot in my throat like roof of my mouth, far throat like I can feel it when I swallow. I did a telehealth with primary again and she was like if this was GBS it would have started in your feet for one and two you would be paralyzed by now. I have read multiple reports saying it can take days of tingling beforehand but a lot does say it usually starts in legs/feet. Looking for advice or stories....", "Academic Research : GBS &amp; Facial Paralysis Hi!\n\nI am looking into Guillain-Barre Syndrome and, more specifically, facial paralysis as a result of GBS, for a university final year project. I understand that there are quite a few questions but I would really appreciate any responses!\n\nThank you! This is great! Question: if we had facial paralysis (I had it in January/February) but no longer have it anymore, should we still respond? Thanks! Hi!\n\nYes, that is fine if you had it a few months ago - any experience with facial paralysis is ideal\n\nThank you! Thanks for doing this. I hope you can help provide some answers for people going through this. When I went though my facial paralysis it was very scary and I did not get a lot of answers other than \u201cit will probably clear up with time\u201d I had facial paralysis but it was CIDP, are you looking for GBS only? Great study, great questions. I am still in the middle of facial paralysis, and I am sick of it. 5 years in, but still improving.

Is it possible to make a full recovery if you have not fully recovered within the first year? My brother was diagnosed with GBS 15 months ago. He is still experiencing muscle weakness/paralysis. His neurologists have told him that those who recover fully do so within the first year. I am hoping to hear success stories from those of you who took longer than a year to make a full recovery and help him regain hope. Thank you! I am nearly at 7 years, I am getting closer. A healthy lifestyle helps. Eat well and start working out using some weight. I would suggest starting with any of the 7-minute workouts on youtube, and moving up from there. Start with the kid level programs. It took me until about year 2 to start feeling any strength again. Three years since onset and I would say I am completely recovered now. However, I certainly was not after the first year, foot drop persisted quite a bit and my hands were quite weak. \n\nAgree on the need for exercise. Also a word on what I mean by completely recovered. I think my nerves will be weird for a long time but I can do everything physical I could before and even more. Get a good physiotherapist who knows GBS. I think recovery is very individual. Best of luck to your brother. I think it was mainly the first 2 years that had the most rapid recovery", "My Doc says \u201cHell No!\u201d To me getting a jab. He was very worked up at the idea of me needing a jab for my job. (I work for a DOD contractor with no options for testing.) He wrote a strongly worded letter to my company on my behalf explaining GBS and how requiring someone who has had it in the past is medically irresponsible.  \nThank you Dr. \ud83d\ude4f. I had GBS 18 years ago, a severe case where I was almost completely paralyzed. I have also had both shots of Pfizer and did not feel a thing. In fact, I had forgotten I had gotten jabbed that day until my girlfriend asked if I was feeling any symptoms. \n\nIt is not the same for everybody I suppose... Just like GBS. That is true. It seems to vary so much from person to person. I had Covid in July; VERY sick, but only for 4 days or so. A friend has it now, and has been at death\u2019s door for 2 weeks. Another coworker got jabbed, and then missed 5 days of work...... this is some strange stuff for sure\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. All I know? When my uncle caught COVID (anti-vac), he never got his sense of taste or smell back\u2026 I would rather take a chance and be poked than to catch COVID and have some long lasting or forever issue lol. Especially such a basic and beautiful feature of life as tasting and smelling foods! I had both Pfizer vaccines and if last week the booster.  My neurologist strongly recommended that get the vaccine but only the Pfizer or Moderna.  I had a severe case of GBS (paralyzed, vent, trach and hospitalized for 3 months).  I agree with u/soy__juan, the risk of a relapse beats getting Covid. I have had Covid, for me it was bad; but only 4 days bad. I will take COVID again over GBS all day.  That also might have been a big part of why my Dr was so against me getting jabbed; I am already swimming with antibodies, and no reason to add one more risk into a very unpredictable equation. Yeah I highly doubt this person is telling the truth. I had GBS and my neurologist 100% recommended it. The GBS-CIDP foundation recommends it. Studies show no correlation between the vaccines and reemergence of GBS. I am not sure what you are trying to accomplish with this post. Are you trying to brag about not having to get the vaccine? Are you trying to convince people not to get it? Like what is your end goal? Also I do not believe you when you say your doctor thinks it is \u201cmedically irresponsible\u201d Seriously, what the hell does that even mean. There was a discussion on here some time ago about GBS and the vaccine. If you agree with my post or not, that is no concern of mine, if you are for or against any mandates, that also is no concern of mine. I am just throwing out a first hand account of my experiences thus far with this subject, if you agree or not I really do not care; perhaps someone else reading this might have questions or concerns and may find value in an opposing position.  I am however quite impressed that you know better than I do about what my doctor wrote in his statement to my company. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I assure you, this person, is telling the truth. Why would I lie about that? It Makes zero sense for me to have a motive; I do not care if people get vaxed or not. Some of my family is vaxed, some are not. I know Reddit is just an echo chamber where people come to reaffirm their own opinions and to lash out against anything that might challenge them; but once in a while, listening to an opposing stance or experience might garnish something positive. If this does not fit such a criteria for you, scroll on. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f OP, I am assuming you live in the USA based off of your use of the word jab, and the fact that a mandate for work is an issue still in contention (as opposed to Eastern countries where it is mandatory, for example).  Which region of the states do you live in? I am curious, because where I live on the west coast, every doctor I have spoken to has acknowledged that there is some risk involved in getting a vaccine but has still urged me to get vaccinated, stating that the risk of COVID is a much bigger roll of the dice. I am wondering if regional politics are at play? That is a good catch with the verbiage; I am in the US. I am in Utah, which is a very conservative state overall, but in Salt Lake City- things are quite progressive. So I would imagine that geopolitical ideals play a role. ALSO, and I feel it is important factor that I have already had Covid and recovered from it; so to throw another level of risk into the mix did not make sense with my Dr. (although I do think he would have advised me against it regardless, based solely on how strong his stance is). I do know he also recommends the vaccine to most of his patients, but I know another patient of his that was advised to wait 6 months and check antibodies and THEN get vaxxed once there is a substantial decrease in protection.... no \u201cone shoe fits all\u201d on this for sure. I mean should not you care if people get vaccinated? Especially if you are not getting vaccinated. I just do not understand what you are trying to get from this post. I know SLC well. I lived in UT for the better part of a decade. I get what you mean about no one shoe fitting all. Been definitely feeling like our country is losing sight that there is a grey area in between the black and white stances people take. I also had CoVid and recovered. I had GBS 20 years ago as well. Just got my first dose of Pfizer with zero complications other than a sore arm. The thing that made me decide to get vaccinated was ultimately being able to travel safely again, and also kind of realizing I was actually accepting the greater risk by holding off vaccination, even though in my mind it was completely justified - GBS sucks! It was scary being paralyzed and recovery took years. It was crazy to learn that my risk of getting GBS was actually higher from COVID than the vaccine. Anyway, wish you the best and good luck with your choices. This world is not without risk and it is really all about the risk we feel comfortable accepting. I truly do not care if people get vaccinated or not. That is 100% their choice. I still respect all that vax, I still keep my distance if someone is uncomfortable with close contact. I had Covid in July , my antibodies are abnormally high (I do not know why though, I assume some weird autoimmune thing). The only point of my post is to show there is more than one side to this coin. I have had 2 members of this group message me from the original post asking more questions; I assume they messaged me in private because they did not want to get called out on here, but they also have valid concerns. I do not promote a vaccine, no do I discount it. I do think overall it is a good idea, but i also cannot see why the medical field discounts natural immunity as if it has zero value. (Many other vaccines are not recommended if you have been previously exposed to whatever virus). Everyone needs to weigh their own options. Like I mentioned a couple times before. I have had Covid, so I am relying on natural immunity for the time being. It is wild because your DOCTOR told you this, as has mine, but this sub will downvote and tell, \"I gOt PfIzEr aNd I aM fInE\"\n\nGreat, happy for them but let us listen to our DOCTOR. If you have had your first dose, then I assume you will have the second and be good to go. (A coworker had a bad 1st dose, and refuses to do a 2nd. He will either quit of file religion). If I had the first and had no problems after a week or two, I would trust my body to do the second. If you have also had the real disease, then with a vax on top of it, you are super-immuned ! \ud83d\udc4d. Also, I appreciate the civil discourse; it is abnormal for Reddit\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02. Lol. Yep it is just the Reddit factor \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.... \u2014-Always listen to your doctor!!!! Until YOUR DOCTOR tells you something that I do not agree with \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02\u2014. I take the downvotes with pride on here. \ud83d\udc4d Likewise! I appreciate it also. There is enough bickering on the net. I am also hella jealous about that snow you all are getting in SLC. It is ski season! The ONLY good thing about Utah winters\ud83d\udc4d. Haha, seriously! They just assume we found a crackpot doctor on the internet to sign our waivers. Nerds. lol", "Could this be GBS? Hi there,\nSeveral days ago I started feeling some pins and needles in a few of my fingers (I thought I had gotten glass in them from a broken jar.) I woke up in the middle of the night feeling some pins and needles intermittently throughout my body. It is not specified to any place and it is not constant. I will just randomly feel pins and needles in my foot/thigh/head/stomach/fingers/ etc. Does this sound at all similar to anyone\u2019s early experience? I have an appointment next week with my doctor but am thinking I may need to see her sooner That was not anything like my experience. The pins and needles started in my feet and were constant. You very well could have some kind of nerve condition... though unless it is getting worse or it is debilitating I doubt you need to rush to the doc. I am not a doctor though so I would place little stock in my opinion. I appreciate your reply...Hopefully I can find some answers soon. Myself and everyone else I know whose been diagnosed with gbs had the pins and needles feeling constantly. Go see a neurologist or go to the ER. They have to do a spinal tap. And then get on Immunoglobin or plasma phareses. I had a relapse of GBS yesterday morning. 3 weeks ago i had to go to ER as i lost my ability to speak and completely lost balance, this was a climax on the 5th day, on 7th day i didnt feel a thing and refused plasma as i cant afford a stay in the hospital. If youre getting plasma now you will have to stay in the hospital as during the corona pandemic it is impossible to come in and out. I have finals tomorrow and the relapse fucked me over bad. Talk to your PCP and get directed to a neurologist. Lumbar testing is inevitable, but first they will do an MRI and a Cat scan to make sure its not another issue such as brain cancer or stroke. It is certainly possible although the tingling could be any neurological condition.\nI believe GBS is characterised by pins and needles in the limbs and extremities. Mine began with pins and needles specifically in my feet every morning. Which then gradually got more frequent and spread up my legs.\nIf it progresses fast, seek immediate help.", "Has anyone use stem cell therapy to treat Guillain Barre?

But I do not know if those people had guillain barre. Has anyone gone through this route? Has it been successful? I did a quick search and did not see any peer reviewed papers on stem cell as a treatment for GBS.  In fact, I only found a couple of case studies of stem cell transplant *causing* GBS, but this seems to be a rare complication.\n There is an Australian woman on Instagram (cannot remember her handle) who used stem cell therapy over 10 years after her diagnosis. Prior to her stem cell therapy, she used a medical scooter or a cane to walk. I believe she now does not use either and was able to be pregnant. It looks quite promising. \n\nHowever, when I discussed it with my neurologist, he said that it is still an unpredictable treatment. The stem cells need to form into the right type of cell and they need to know when they stop multiplying or else they turn into tumors. \n\nIf your father was only diagnosed a month ago and is making progress through physical therapy, stem cell therapy may not be necessary. This is a fucking horrible idea until there is real data behind treatment with so many variables involved. Do not part yourself from your money like this. You sold me at Tijuana. Lol right. Thank you all. I felt the same. Just wanted to hear you all\u2019s opinions. I do not think people can call this a scam or it does not work, it is a relatively new treatment, more research needs to be done but looks promising and I am actually going to put thousands of my dollars into to treat my chronic headache condition It is an option. As of now my dad is recovering very well. He is been able to walk with a walker for about half a month now. Depending in his state in a few month we might consider Perusing stem cells as a treatment.", "My Mom Has CIDP - Marie &amp; Louise's Story ", "IVIG experience Hi! My boyfriend was recently diagnosed with CIDP and he is also diabetic so steroids are not the most ideal treatment for him as it increases his blood sugar as a side effect. We are looking into Intravenous Immunoglobulin Therapy but we could not find much information about this in the PH.\n\nMay you share with us your experience with us?\n1. Did it work for you? How long did it take before you felt its positive effects?\n2. Any side effects?\n3. How often did you have the therapy?\n4. How much did it cost?\n\nLooking forward to all your replies!! Thank you! Worked great for me!  First treatment it started working within a day or so. Second treatment I do not remember because I was on a breathing tube, but after 5 days I started regaining functionality in my upper body (lower body took a month). \n\nI do not think I had any side effects. I know a lot of people get headaches but I never got any. \n\nI would have it 1-2x a day for 2 hours. Granted, I had AIDP/Miller-Fisher so it is different. I apologize for not having more info. \n\nEach bag was billed between $10k-and $15k. Granted, I am lucky to have insurance (US). \n\nI hope this helps. I wish you and your boyfriend the best in his recovery and continued health. I am glad it worked for you! And dayum it really is pricey LOL may I ask, do you still go through the treatment up until now? \n\nAnd thank you. It is been really hard, especially for him, because he is now in a counteractive situation. I just want to get him out of that situation asap LOL Lol I completely understand. But thank you!\n\nI have not had treatment since early March of last year. My first round was second week of February, all symptoms went away, and then I relapsed first week of March.  Everything came back with a vengeance. \n\nBut after that second round of treatment I was able to get well enough to move from NCCU to the regular neuro ward then a rehab facility. Now I just try and stay active and eat well. I hope to not need treatment again, but it is honestly not so bad (except for the cost lol). Aw snap. I am glad you are feeling a lot better now. I wish you good health and that it does not come back. Ever. LOL thank you for replying to my thread btw. You have been a great help. \ud83d\ude0a Hey no problem!  It is tough but I am sure your bf will see loads of improvement with treatment!  Best of luck to you both! I have CIDP. I got lucky and never got bad enough that I had to be hospitalized, and the lovely nurses come to my home to do the infusions. Just had my first round of infusions two weeks ago. The headaches were terrible, but 3-32oz bottles of Gatorade daily and Tylenol every 4 hours kept them at bay. I initially was drinking just water, but it did not help. As of yesterday I am starting to feel some improvement!! For me infusions were 2-3 hours daily for 4 days, and will be repeated monthly. The week after infusions was rough too, I was constantly tired, weak, and did not have an appetite. He may not have any noticeable changes after the first round though, so do not feel discouraged if that is the case. As frustrating as it can be, it will get better! Good luck! Also, hydration is literally going to be his best friend... so drink up! I had AIDP/MFS so again it is not an apples to apples comparison but IVIG worked great for me. I very distinctly remember (had a conversation with the nurse about it) that I started noticing a small improvement in symptoms while I was in the middle of the second treatment. I did 5 treatments spaced 24 hours apart. By the end of the 4th treatment I was feeling significantly better. I did have some minor relapse in symptoms for a couple of weeks after the treatments were done, but not bad enough that the doctors felt like I needed more treatments.\n\nThe only real \"trouble\" I had with it was that they left the IV port in my arm for the entire 5 days and I got Phlebitis in my right arm which caused a good amount of discomfort for about a week or two after they took it out once the treatments were complete.\n\nMy health insurance in the US covered the entire cost of my hospital stay and treatments so it is a bit hard for me to say exactly how much it cost since health insurance in the US is weird. It looks like the entire course of 5 treatments was billed to insurance around $60k but the insurance only paid $8 which I think is closer to the actual cost if you are paying out of pocket with no insurance. IVIG is the drug of choice for CIDP. Most people I know get it every 3-4 weeks. It does not work for me, but I wish it did. Side effects are minimal and can be combatted with pre infusion doses of benedryl and otc pain meds. \n\nI have gotten it at the hospital and at home. Easy peasy. IVIG is the way to go. Very helpful. Not exactly pleasant during the infusion, but that is expected for anything. I saw this when first posted but did not want to be the first response as I am currently still in the middle of it. I am also from the CIDP camp with a sub diagnosis of MADSAM.  My treatment started back in early November and the first 'round' was 3 treatments in a 1 week span.  I then got a 2 week break then round 2 was 2 days in a week.  That has been my schedule since then and my next infusion is Monday.  As mentioned hydration is key and personally I had maybe one or two slight head tightness but nothing worth worrying about.\n\n1.  I have thus far not had any noticeable improvements but am still hopeful.  To quote my nurse it is a marathon not a sprint for most people even though you hear about those people who have immediate responses do not go into it with anything other than an open mind.  I had been misdiagnosed for years and it was not until I fired yet another Neurologist and went to my cities expert did I get a diagnosis.  Point being I was fairly well along in my degradation so it is an uphill battle.\n\n2.  personally I have found I am completely worn out, just exhausted.  I described it to someone recently like I have a lead blanket over me at all times.  Since I am hoping for the best I will just deal with it for now because just living with CIDP and continuing to degrade is not an option in my book\n\n3. As described above 1 week on 2 weeks off.  I have to go into my Neurologists office in the city where they have an infusion suite.  For me it is about 5-6 hours each treatment.\n\n4. The dosage you are given is based on your body weight so will be different for everyone but it is not cheap.  I also am US based and have insurance but I am self employed so my cost are quite high from my monthly premium to my annual out of pocket costs.  Again, I made the choice to enter into this so if I come out the other side better but with a huge bill so be it.\n\nBest of luck and wishing the best for a his improvement.  Any other questions feel free to ask. How long did it take you to recover from miller fisher ? Well they thought I had AIDP in early February got IVIG for a week and got better. Relapsed March 1 with full paralysis, breathing tube, neuropathy; the whole nine yards. They put me on super high dosages of IVIG, was in the NCCU for a week, regular neuro ward for a week, then rehab for two weeks. At the end of rehab I could walk, albeit with a walker. I did not have control of my right eye for another month or so, and was not running for three more months.\n\nIt is now almost 11 months to the day since I was admitted the second time, and, from an outside perspective, you cannot tell I ever was sick. I still have neuropathy in my hands and feet, I still get tired super quickly, but I can run and lift again and I can see just as well as I could before all this happened (I was as blind as a bat without contacts before this). \n\nNote, I am technically undiagnosed, as I showed the symptoms of AIDP, Miller-Fisher, and one more (I am blanking right now). But I am lucky because I was in good shape before, I am young (23 at the time now 24) and I had exceptional care and rehab teams. You are all lucky you have insurance in the US! LOL In the Philippines, it is not a common thing and we pretty much only heard of it in our early 20s when we started working, and even then companies we work for are not exactly the most generous in terms of benefits and having a private insurance can be quite pricey for newly grads who earn minimum wage LOL\n\nIVIG really does sound like a dream. I am glad you feel significantly better now. Did you still go through the IVIG treatments after your first treatment? Oh geez. How are you now and how did you battle your CIDP without IVIG? Noice, I will be sure to tell him to stay hydrated if we ever have the opportunity to start his IVIG treatment hahaha thanks for the tip!\n\nHow long have you had your CIDP and how are you now btw? Do you still consistently have your infusions every month? Also, is the 10-15k the total cost of the 4-day treatment? Yes, IVIG sounds like a dream! I have done the steroid infusions too. It was not fun. Made me feel very sick but several days. It was effective, but hard to endure (for me). I am glad you were able to have your IVIG infusions now. Steroids have way too much bad side effects especially on long term usage. My SO has been on it for just a few days and it spikes up his blood sugar to 200+mg/dL and his insulin shots do very little to help bring it down. It is a viscious cycle LOL\n\nHow are you now btw? Do you still have the neuropathic pain? Yes. Some of the damage is long term. I manage well and still do IVIG once a month. Hi! Thank you for taking the time to answer my queries. I really appreciate all the help. CIDP is a tough battle indeed and we take the comfort in knowing that there are available treatments now to manage this situation (thank you, science!). \n\nI could not help but ask about how you were misdiagnosed for years. What was your initial diagnosis before CIDP?\n\nI hope and pray for your speed recovery as well! It sucks that we could not do anything but wait, but as the famous saying goes: \"good things come to those who wait\" so I know it will all be worth it. Praying for more good news for you! Best of luck!! I am glad your managing well now. Thank you very much for your time \ud83d\ude0a I started getting symptoms early November 2019.  This was my first infusion, and I will keep getting them till my neuro says I do not need them anymore. I am hoping I will only need them for six months or so. \n\nAlso, yes. I am pretty sure that is the cost per infusion. It is insane. I just did the one round of 5 treatments and then that was it for me. I just did the one round of 5 treatments and then that was it for me. I am in remission after years of being on low dose prednisone. I have residual nerve pain and there are some things I cannot do anymore, like skating or running, but I am good! I am one of the lucky ones. I still see my Neuro every 6 months so he can assess if I am starting to relapse. This is my first time drug free in over 25 years. I am so happy for you!! Wishing you continuous good health! \ud83d\ude0a Hoping for the best for you!! Best of luckkkk! Thanks! Same to you! I have been fighting CIDP for around six years. I am steadily getting more negatively affected by the disease. I am not diabetic, but that is an issue; both for the neuropathy, and for the medications - namely Prednisone, which I have been trying to taper off of since the beginning. It is a nasty, but necessary drug. A better alternative, which I started on, is Solu-medrol (methylprednisolone) - fewer side effects, I get it as infusion ( maybe that is something he can query his Neurologist about ). The Prednisone has me being monitored for pre-diabetes, but so far I am not diagnosed, just monitored. Everyone responds very differently to the infusions, the steroids and the necessary supplements used to offset some of the side affects of the meds. Obviously his doc will have constant CBC/Full Met Panel blood tests done every six weeks or so (hopefully) and an A1C done every six months or so to keep an eye on his blood and metabolism, etc. changes (at least my doc does).\n\nMy initial infusion Ivig regimen was effective; 1 gm\\\\Kilo every four weeks. My difficulties started when my Prednisone taper got too low. Then it took awhile and a few infusions to get back to mobility, relative of course. I equated it to being on an elevator in a building; CIDP took me down to -2 level. Infusions took me back up to almost the ground level. Prednisone taper too low took me back down to -3 level... etc. You can see where it goes; I never have gone back up to the level from which I declined each time - no idea how far in the basement I am now, but it is down there. My regimen changed a couple years ago to to 2gm\\\\Kilo every three weeks. At first it worked well, but gradually, through more declines, a couple very serious, I am now not getting much benefit from them any longer. My Neuro decided to put me on a CIDP chemo regimen (Cytoxan) in December, one/mo. for 6 months. The hope is to see results following 4 or 5 treatments.\n\nFinally,cost. When I was on private insurance, my one-year, accumulated EOBs were around $1.1 Million. Each three week treatment billed out at around $65K. Insurance pays probably only 1/4 to 1/2 of that to the providers, but without insurance, ouch. Medicaid and Medicare (plus supplements) cover it. It is insanely expensive. There are also alternative treatments, but they are not covered by insurance as far as we know; Chemo/Stem Cell treatments, which around 4 years ago we heard cost around $150K and required around 5 weeks to complete. Compared to $1.1 Million, sounds like a deal, but there you have insurance companies... who understands that ?!?\n\nHopefully that is not too long-winded. I am happy to fill in more. If you are like me, you, and he likely have tons of questions.\n\nOne final thing; find your local/regional GBS/CIDP organization and go to their meetings, plus join the national organization - lots of helpful info. Your local/regional group meeting is a great way to talk to others to get best practices, and just try to get as mush info as possible. I resisted for a few years, then when I finally went to one, d'oh, what was my hesitation all about... wish I would always gone.\n\nGood luck to both of you. I hope he is one that can get to some remission at some point - I never could, but have not given up yet! Hydrate before IVIG... I am always dehydrated and I get the worst headaches after my infusions... they last for days sometimes and I have yet to find any type of medication or remedy to make them go away.", "Elevated csf protein level Hi a few years back I went numb and it got so bad to the point I could not walk, but it eventually went away I am dealing with some new symptoms now but my neurologist recently told me that when they did the spinal tap I had high csf levels or it could be diabetes that caused the elevated protein levels. I was wondering if slightly high csf levels can cause problems So I was diagnosed with GBS after my protein level was super high. Like 300+. So yeah it should be something to worry about. Definitely talk to your neurologist more. Thank you they are acting like it is no big deal Yeah I went to the ER for weakness, they did a spinal tap, and then was immediately hospitalized for IVIG treatment. Demand they do more tests. \n\nYou are really going to have to push hard and be your own advocate. That is what I found out. Check for POEMS syndrome", "Polyneuropathy My symptoms started 3 months ago and am using a walker at 36.  All four limbs are on fire at present and I could swallow gabapentin by the bottle without noticing.  EMG came back last week with neuropathies in all limbs but its 20x worse this week.\n\nThe issue is I have numbness in my bsck all the way up to my head.  I cannot find any instances of people with this who have CIDP or any variants.   Also I still have patellar reflexes even though Im losing others.\n\nAnyone with atypical neuropathic symptoms? Oh yes indeed!  I embarked on the Medical Mystery Tour more than 15 years ago because my symptoms were not 'typical ' for CIDP.  My reflexes have come and gone and come back etc. facial paralysis,  spine issues etc.  I do not know what help I can be to you aside from confirming there are lots of variables. I had a spreadsheet of tests they performed on me, more than 200 different ones.  Had/have a constant elevated temperature, which is not 'typical' but I attributed to the battle of my immune system. I finally got on an IgG regime which finally slowed everything down.  I will answer any questions you have if that helps.  Keep a binder/log of tests, results and symptoms, doctors like data. Thanks for the response.  When did you first get IVIG?  What were your protein levels in your CSF? It is been so long I cannot remember my protein levels, they were moderate though, not severe.  I got IVIG regularly more than a year after hospitalization with nearly complete paralysis.   My left lung and arm worked but my diaphragm, rib muscles etc. did not. I went to over a dozen doctors because I had been in the Peace Corps and they did not believe this was not some weird thing I would brought home.  Long story short the rheumatologist at Georgetown sent me to Hopkins, got a proper diagnosis did IVIG for 4 years, graduated to SCIG and have been doing that for 11 years now. I am stable, not perfect but good enough. Also DO NOT do anything after your lumbar puncture.  They told me I would be fine to drive/ride 7 hours the next day.  It was horrible.   Just lay flat and drink liquids. Yeah - best if you can get it done later in the day, so you can just sleep overnight and avoid standing up.  \n\n\nAt least lay flat for a few hours afterwards, and take caffeine plus pain killers if it is bad.  \n\n\nI had a bad headache for about 5 days, I cannot recall what I did right after the puncture - if I laid down for a while or not. Omg yes! \nThe backs on my thighs, butt cheeks, and lower back are numb. Not the front of my thighs, though. I thought it was from being bedridden but I am now having neuropathy pain there. \nYou are not alone! \nI do not have any answers but I thought I would at least share in your weird pain. I had a 2nd LP 7 days ago and am still waiting for my headache to go away. (I was admitted that same day for the 2nd time. My protein levels were not high enough the first time, even though I could not walk).\nBUT OP, that is not typical, so you probably do not need to worry about that. Wow!  It is so encouraging to hear about your recover.  Congratulations!   Thanks a lot! It is good not to be alone but sorry you are going through it too.  Do you have a diagnosis? Yes, it is GBS.  I am out of the acute stage (hopefully) and in recovery in a nursing home until the end of May. I had a relapse last week, got back Tuesday night. The days leading up to the relapse were weird, as different parts of my body were losing sensation. It felt like I could not empty my bladder, which apparently is due to certain nerve damage, which would also explain the numbness in my lower back, butt, and thighs. Glad it stopped there and did not affect my breathing. I would also suggest going to the ER if your symptoms are getting worse. It sounds like you are just barely able to tolerate it. If it is getting worse, it could be causing nerve damage. They can stop it from progressing but you really should go in asap I was diagnosed with CIDP in September.  I had the strangest sensations, all at the same time - burning in my feet, numbness in my lower legs and thighs, burning skin from waist up to neck and arms and pins and needles sensation in arms, and burning scalp.  I have been on IVIG since October.  I have more strength in my hands and arms, but my legs and ankles are weak.  I have burning in my feet at night, numbness in my legs, and weakness from waist down the legs that makes it hard to stand for much longer than the time it takes to shower. Wow!  I have every one of those symptoms.  This gives me some hope.  Hopefully your recovery goes well.\n\nDid you ever have a hard time opening your eyee in the morning?  When I wake up I cannot feel my legs and need help walking to the bathroom.  And it takes mr 20 minutes to open both eyes at the same time.  The burning numbness and neuropathies seems so text book CIDP but the autonomic involvement seems to be so rare in CIDP. I dont have any issues opening my eyes in the morning, but I did have eye twitching and burning, and occasional blurry vision.\n\nAre you on any treatment?  I hope you get some relief.", "Relapse years later? Hi, I had GBS as a child when 5 years old. Fully recovered at the time, but now 30+ years later I am suffering fatigue symptoms and am worried about either a relapse of GBS or something related like CFS. Has anyone out there had a relapse many years later or similar symptoms? I have had GBS twice. Once when I was 2 years old and once when I was 23. I do not remember anything about the first time I had it, but the second time was a very rapid onset starting with numbness in my feet to full paralysis in 48 hours. If you are worried you should go talk to your doctor. If you are experiencing any symptoms like numbness or paralysis you should go to patient first or the ER. I had it again after four years. I had read if you went three years chances of getting it again were super rare but alas. Now the diagnosis is CIDP. \n\nHope you are well. Keep us posted. Keep breathing and by mindful...\n I am in the hospital now finishing up treatment for my second bout with GBS. Luckily, this time we caught it super early and were able to avoid more severe symptoms, but that is only because we were extremely adamant about testing as soon as paralysis appeared. \nTrust your gut and take care!", "New member. Good evening!  I am new to the community and wanted to introduce myself.  I am still recovering from GBS.  I was admitted the first week of November 2019 and finally came home in February.  I still have no sensation in my toes and my gait is slow but I am walking.  I was on a vent and was paralyzed from the neck down.  I flat lined twice within the first seven days.  After the vent was removed a trach was put in. I stood for the first time after 51 days and took my first step on day 63.  My GBS started 10 days after getting the flu vaccine and am no longer allowed to have any vaccines EVER.  My protection is a face mask and face shield.  I have no issue with either.\n\nI am now called Judy 2.0. \u263a Do not give up you have had a long battle!\nMine was not that long but I remember  rolling over for first time,felt like beached whale.\nAnd the first time on machine  standing was oh sure real\nAnd the first walking was something else.\nKeep up the good work.\nMy gbs was in 2010.\nYes my feet still tingle, and the new covid scares me but I play it safe.\nLike I said do not give up. Thank you.  I keep plugging away.  I am not keen on my family getting vaccines due to my experience of falling down the GBS rabbit hole. Judy 2.0 :)   \nI love your attitude!  Thank you! My experience was very much the same as yours although it occurred in 1983 after getting a flu vaccine. I also had mononucleosis which compromised my immune system. I have not had a flu shot since. After a year of physical,  occupational and speech therapies,  I did recover!!  Have faith that you too can recover 100%!  Good luck my friend! I am retired now,but husband still works,he gets a flu shot,so he does not bring home to me.\nWith covid and wearing mask,hopefully  the flu season will not be that bad. Welcome to you, Judy 2.0!       \n\nYour progress sounds amazing - here is to a continuous recovery!", "Should I see a doctor? I have been having random tingling in my feet for a couple months. My foot will randomly go numb for no reason. Then yesterday while making dinner both my legs felt extremely weak. Almost like I had a hangover (usually when I had a lot to drink my hangovers come with weak legs). At night I kept waking up cause of the discomfort. This morning my legs feel better but still faintly feel that weakness. Now my arms feel like they are weak. This caused me to go on a Google self diagnosis trip and here I am.\n\nDid anyone else have symptoms like this? Should I go see a doctor? Definitely see a doctor.\n\nMy experience was that I went from tingling/numbness in my feet to a ventilator in something like 4 days, so this does not sound like GBS to me. But I do not know if my experience was typical, and even if you do not have GBS, *something* is causing you to have numbness and weakness. You really need to get that checked out, my friend. Sorry you went through that. I am scheduled an appointment today Yes. I ignored the tingling, eventually i lost all feeling in my legs and collapsed one day. Could also be the chronic form, CIDP. I had similar symptoms as you, starting in my legs first. Hope you get a satisfactory answer. I havent heard of that. I will ask my doctor Typically if it is lasting for months like you said, it is not GBS which is a pretty rapid decent from numbness tingling to absolute failure of body functions (like walking) bc your nerves have been eaten by your immune system and the brain does not have a way to get to the message to the muscles anymore on how to move - as that is what your nerves do. Long story short, you should get into a neurologist and document your symptoms- GBS or CIDP (which is basically long term GBS) is hard to diagnose and test for. My case I was diagnosed from symptoms and not the spinal tap they do to check for proteins in the spinal fluid. May I ask when the tingling happened for you? Mine usually happens when I am sitting or laying. I usually feel it in my heel but its starting to be in more areas of my feet. This is helpful thank you You bet, good luck! When i was sitting. I work from home so I thought it was because i was not moving around enough. GBS - Everything goes south pretty rapidly 3-10 days. I wish it started working again with the same speed :( Sounds like some sort of neurological issue or muscle atrophy. Definitely try to see a neurologist so they can run tests to figure out what is going on So frustrating is not it. Wishing you the best my friend! My tingling in my toes started and was completely paralyzed within 1 day. I would most definitely see a neurologist. Good luck.  ", "Had GBS, now having eye issues post-hospitalization. Need advice! Hey guys, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was diagnosed with GBS in October, spent the entire month in ICU, Had seven plasmapharesis treatments, did a few weeks of physical therapy, and was able to regain my walking, facial movements (had total facial bilateral paralysis) but a side effect that has persisted is that my left eye is COMPLETELY blurry and my right eye will kind of phase in and out of being blurry, then back to being clear again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else had issues like this with GBS?

I am also worried that due to my day job as a videographer and editor that it might impact my work exponentially down the road. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if you have had eye issues from having GBS, please let me know the route you took to getting better, or if there is not any hope there.... Would love to hear some info about this online that is not webMD vagueposting.  I am sorry to hear about your eyesight.  While I did not have this issue, I did that a reduction in eyesight/ blurred vision can be an issue.  I wish I could be more help, do you have a neurologist? You could always ask them for further clarify action before you have your eye appointment.\n\nGood luck, I hope it all works out for you! Yeah i did, hence the appointment for the neuro-opthamologist\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is so frustrating!\n\n&amp;#x200B; While I was in the hospital I had trouble focusing on things, and also eyesight being out of focus/blurry. Not to the extent of what you are saying but it was there. It slowly went away while everything else was healing. Hopefully the eye doc has some answers for you and that it can be reversed.

Anyone want to share experiences with this condition, IVIg, steroids, etc.?", "Specific residuals: Foot drop Who is had to deal with this?\n\n( is a potential lingering result from GBS where one or both feet are unable to properly flex upwards during steps - basically, your feet do not move upwards enough while walking and it can lead to all sorts of issues, including chronic pain from improper posture, stance and locomotion.\n\nA visit with a podiatrist or a physiotherapist is a very useful way to assess the more subtle impacts of GBS - many of us compensate for underperforming or bunk nerves by working harder with others and visiting someone who can help assess your movement is a great way to help recover, avoid future pain and work with long-term damage. Just had my first podiatrist visit and it was wonderful. She was able to see issues just from my walking and she identified foot drop - frustrating part is that she did not call it that but she nodded and acted as if she knows what GBS is. She is very smart so we will see - looking forward to some positive changes and less pain from her help!\n\nThe most hilarious question I was asked: do you have numbness, tingling or chronic pain in any extremities?\n\n\"All the time\" was my answer and her assessment changed from that. I think even GBS-aware doctors do not necessarily understand the full impact. From the day 1 I got into ICU they put me those boots to avoid foot drop. Long story short: I was paralyzed from neck to toes nearly one month and two weeks intubated. Two and a half months later I can walk but I suffer a bit of foot drop, enough to not walk properly. I am going to physical therapy twice a week and that helps. I have to go to the physiotherapist every once in a while. I found a brand of flip flops that I can wear. Wearing them for ten years has resulted in damage to my Achilles\u2019 tendon and knees. I do my exercises and that keeps it in line. My foot drop tends to cause me to fall. I will miss steps, going up stairs. So far people I am out with know or walk close enough that I can grab them if I am falling. My kids are making noises that they want me to use a cane.    My feet have been numb for just over ten years. Some days \u201c I am glad I am alive\u201d. Some days \u201c I cannot do this anymore \u201c. What is the flip flop brand? My boyfriend has cipd and has had foot drop for the past 6 years and he misses flip flops so much. The ones I can wear are Cobain bounce. They have a thick sole and wear to my foot shape. Cobain, bounce they are called Yes! I am 4 years out from my GBS onset, and it is been 3 years since I was fitted for leg braces. Making a long story short, it took me about 7-ish months to transition from wheelchair to walker and then to cane. When I was walking with the cane, I had a lot of moments where I was tripping over my feet. Again, making a long story short, my neurologist tested my feet and diagnosed me with bilateral footdrop. \n\nI worked my butt off to get to the point where I can walk safely and pretty okay without leg braces, just barefoot or with grippy socks. I cannot walk yet with just shoes, the heaviness of the shoe makes me walk like godzilla again. I wear leg braces (TurboMeds) on both legs since January 2018, but only when I am outside of the house. I even lived abroad in Austria for 2 of those years with the leg braces, so not too shabby. \n\nI, nor does my primary doctor, see an end or major improvement to my foot drop though. :-\\\\ Recently, though, I have managed to stand on my tip toes if I push down on the kitchen counter and use it for stability! So been practicing that slowly. Never thought of seeing a podiatrist for this issue. My brain just lumps it into the GBS/CIDP category. Now I am wondering why I have not. Very useful information, thank you! Exactly, neither had I, but she is definitely noticed it even without being familiar with the rare syndrome itself. That is some good progress! I hope that it works out. Yes, I am so \"clumsy\" even though it is a mild disability. It is frustrating to me to get teased for it.", "Flu Shot Hi everyone! Since flu season is approaching in the northern hemisphere, I was just wondering if those of you that have suffered from GBS usually get the flu shot? I have had two primary care doctors since I have had it give me conflicting advice about whether or not to get it. My neurologist said no flu shots, all other vaccines are case by case.  I had GBS in 1995 and have never had a flu shot (before or since, actually). As my doctor said, the flu probably is not going to kill me, and it is not worth the risk. I have contacted the CDC about this. Below is their answer:\n\"Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is multi-factorial, and is four times more likely after influenza disease compared with influenza vaccination.  It has occurred after influenza vaccination in the past, and therefore we consider a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome following within 6 weeks of influenza vaccination to be a precaution to further doses of influenza vaccination.  A precaution means that if a patient has no risk factors for influenza disease, it might be wise to withhold a dose of influenza vaccine.\"\n\nIf you strongly suspect that your GBS was triggered by a flu vaccine, then you should not get flu vaccinated. However that changes when you get older than 65, and you are in the risk groups (very young, very old). One neurologist told me the whole thing is a myth. Some time in the 70s there was a bad batch of flu vaccine, and because of that people still think any flu vaccine triggers GBS. My GBS was not triggered by a vaccine, but until I am &gt;65 I am not getting the flu vaccine. After 65 I will reconsider. \n Thanks for the reply! I had to get a tetanus shot about a year ago (I had GBS in 2012) after getting cut by a rusty nail, and the nurse did not tell me until AFTER she injected it that GBS people could be affected by it, so now I am super paranoid about all vaccines. I think I will probably pass on the flu shot again this year. Yeah I think I agree with your doctor. Thanks for the reply! Thanks, this is really helpful! Mine was also not triggered by a vaccine but I think I will continue to pass on the flu shot for now. Not to add to the paranoia, but I go to a support group for GBS patients and like 75% of them got GBS after getting the flu shot in 2016. Personally, I would rather get the flu than have GBS again.  Never had the flu shot, and do not plan to start getting it post-GBS. I am also due for a TD booster shot (tetanus and diphtheria) but passed on that too. My primary care doc, and the doc that took care of me at the inpatient rehab hospital I was in, both gave me the okay to get the TD booster. However, my neuro discouraged it so I am choosing to go without it. I have gotten a flu shot every year, including this year, since I had GBS and never had a relapse with it. I should mention that I did not get GBS after the flue or a vaccine but after an oral infection. My job mandates for everyone to have a flu shot and I honestly have never considered not getting one since no medical provider ever mentioned a risk or problem to me with my history.  Per the CDC, there are several vaccines we should avoid getting:  I got GBS from the flu shot in 2016, and so did 7 other people in my town of around 100,000 people! Where is this support group? I belong to an online forum but a real support group would be excellent therapy. I am in Maryland and it is out of the rehab hospital I went to. You could check online for one IRL, there are a couple others around the greater DC metro area but not realistic for me to get to with work and traffic.  That is so great for you! I am in Indiana and we do not have anything like that.  Best wishes for your recovery! Had the flu and got it ", "I was diagnosed last week I was diagnosed with Guillain Barre last week. Symptoms first started 3 weeks after getting my 2nd Pfizer covid shot. It took another 7 weeks to finally get diagnosed because I stupidly kept going back to my clueless primary care doctor for more tests  instead of just going to the hospital.\n\nGabapentin is the only way I can sleep now due to the pain and shaking. I constantly feel fatigued. Depression is setting in and I had to go on leave from work which put my project and co-workers in a bad spot. Luckily I have enough vacation hours saved up to make it 6 weeks without having to worry about a paycheck.\n\nLuckily my wife has stepped up and is managing our young children while also working, but it is putting a huge strain on her too.\n\nHow did you guys manage the pain, fatigue, and depression that comes along with dealing with GBS?  You just eventually have to come to terms with it and accept it. It will get better once they allow you to start treatment but it is going to be a long ride. For me, the depression was one of the hardest parts of my diagnosis. I constantly felt like a burden to my family because I needed help doing a lot of things, even after a month in rehab. It was really difficult having to ask for help to get in and out of the shower or needing to ask someone else to drive me everywhere. And honestly, even 10 months after my diagnosis, the guilty feeling is still there. I understand 100% the way you are feeling right now. But, it will pass. It might take a while, but you will find your way through this. Relaying a lot on others might not be something you want to do, but it is okay. I tried a gratitude journal (sounds cheesy) but each day I wrote a list of 3-5 things I was grateful for. Tried to eat better and get as good of rest as I could since doing both of those helps stress and therefore helps alleviate pain. In the brief moments (early on in recovery) that I felt decent I made sure to get something done around the house. Even if it is just one thing. Because it helped me know I was doing my best.\n\nEditing to add- please seek therapy if you need it. It is hard to talk to people about this if they have not been through it, but therapists are trained for it. Sounds like you have a loving family so am sure they will go to any extend to help you get better..Trust that God will never give you more than what you cannot bear..Hang in there.. I felt abnormally tired or wonky (physically) for 2 years after. I was probably in the rare case though since no one would believe something was going on (I got this during Marine Corps boot camp... just think about trying to do anything but being unable and trying to convince people you arent \"malingering\"... yep horrible time).\n\nAlso did you get into the state of being overly sensitive or like 0 sensitivity? I fell down a flight of stairs and didnt feel a thing... but at one point lying down felt like someone was kicking my back on contact points. went from 170 to like 110 or something hilarious in weight (lbs). you have to give it time and probably get some phys theraphy... Also when you get the nerve conduction tests... get ready for some not so fun times (also you get tested after and dont get compared to before so you end up wondering, if you were athletic, if you lost something).\n\nJust manage your progress and take it day by day. It will clear up once they start treatment. I have both areas of hypersensitivity and areas of complete numbness. I have also lost weight. \n\nRight now I am taking it day by day, but it sucks. I just hope I can manage to keep my job. Hope you are hanging in there. You are getting some treatment besides the GP right? That stuff takes the edge off but does not treat the GBS.\n\nIf you are in the US, I would consider reporting your condition to VAERS and filing an injury claim with the CICP. My doctor thinks I am on the edge of the recovery phase, so he did not recommend treatment.\n\nI did not know about the claims, I will have to look into it. Careful eating if you are having problems swallowing or feel light headed (due to low oxygen levels). I also got GBS from the Pfizer shot. The amount of time it took for me to get diagnosed was pretty long as well. Even after being diagnosed, I still have medical professionals try to tell me that is not what happened to me. Lots of denial and trying to blame other things. I guess I faked my spinal fluid analysis. It is really distressing and I am sorry you are going through that, but you are not alone.\n\nAs far as VAERS, ( You have access to basically a SQL database with a web based interface, so if you are familiar with SQL then it will make sense. You can submit your own entry somewhere in there too. Anyone can view what you submit (after approval).\n\nCICP, I applied but have not heard back. It is a short form that you have to send in the mail. I sent the form along with something from the hospital mentioning my diagnosis. I assume they will want more. I am gathering that CICP is not as helpful as VICP, and of course covid shots are covered through CICP. I had never heard of either program until last month so who knows how that will go. \n\nDisability is taking forever, and because I said I have anxiety and depression on my intake form, I have to go get a psych evaluation next month which lets me know that process is far from complete. So, if you go the route of applying for disability, beware that mentioning your depression might result in a required psych evaluation. I do not know what to expect out of that.\n\nToday was my last day of the eight weeks of physical therapy I was initially approved for, more sessions have been requested and I should hear back next week about that. \n\nI do not have much advice as I also got blindsided by a disease I have never heard of and I am doing my best to work my way through it too but good luck. In my case, time is the healer. \n\nIt was almost one year ago, I am 99% good, just some light feet pain after dinner. I take pregabalin 75mg before bed. \n\nThe beginning was hard. Been with a ventilator for days, paralyzed from neck to toes, several weeks in a rehab center, PT, OT. But eventually I am almost done. \n\nMost cases get back to normal. On forums you will read mostly people who do not heal completely, but have to bear in mind that the ones that heal will not be on forums going over those memories again. \n\nIn a nutshell: patience, please. It takes time. A lot of it. The hardest part is keeping your mind clear and healthy. Good stuff.  I hope you make a full recovery and stay there! I have had GBS two times (CIDP). The first time much worse. I got quirte low and hopeless. I eventually decided to practice mindfulness - every time I caught myself having a negative thought or my mind spinning to the future, I focused on breathing. I decided if I visualized myself healing that was a better use of my brainpower so I got to the point where I would catch my negative thoughts, take three slow breaths then practice visualizing my nerves growing back. I would see them connecting and then imagine wrapping them to keep them secure. Then I would visualize painting on a protective coat. I know it sounds weird and strange but it got me through being completely paralyzed! I kind of think it helped me to heal too. Man... this depression is fucking me up bad. It is the worst lingering effect. I have had to stop taking gabapentin and the antidepressant because they were causing me to gain weight, so now I am back to hurting/burning. I do not recommend doing it this way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am less than 5 months out of the hospital, and realize I may never been the same as I used to be. At 50, I could bench 230 and full out sprint. At 51, I can use an electric trimmer in one pacth of grass and be in agonizing pain for 2 days. :(\n\nHang in there. 85% of people recover by the end of the first year. Also, ask your doctor if there are other medicines. I am going to tomorrow. I might just have to see a pain clinic to get things dialed in correctly. How advanced did your disease get? Were you on a ventilator and if so for how long? \nI would say that sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll are the best medicine for whatever ails you!! Good luck my friend. Thankfully it never left my legs, so I was not put on a vent or anything like that. I think the thing that diagnostically got the ER doc to admit me for tests was that I had no reflexes in my feet or ankles. I could not dorsiflex either foot, they would just kind of flop down and out if I lifted my leg up. I could stubbornly walk around but more or less the muscles below my knees were not responding no matter how hard I focused. It was absolutely spreading but I got on the IVIG in time, I guess. I do not know. The EMG showed that I have Axonal GBS, they said it did not show signs of demyelination and they had evidence of reinnervation so I suppose I am on the right track.\n\nIt is been three months since I left the hospital. I still have problems below my knees, and my hips hurt, but I am getting better. I cannot tap my left foot all that great but my right one seems to move around ok. I can flex and hold my calf muscle for a few seconds. I feel a lot better in the morning than I do in the evening, and then some days seem like I am regressing a little but that might just be in my head. I cannot walk too far, even with my cane, which is bothering me a lot mentally. I guess I just have to keep trying. I feel for you man. I am still in the hospital getting IVIG and it finally seems to be responding because it has stopped spreading up past my upper legs, hips. It started to affect my hands but that has seemed to stop advancing as well. I am in a considerable amount of pain and they will only give me one dose of dilaudid a day due to their concern for my breathing. I am at my wits end at this point, the pain is almost unbearable. I know the pain in my legs is mostly nerve pain but do you know why the joints hurt so bad? The doctors have not been able to shed much light on that. From reading where you are at it looks like I am looking forward to a struggle but I thank you for all the information you have shared and I wish you well. I was told by my neurologist to try Lyrica over gabapentin. Has anyone tried Lyrica over gabapentin and did it help or hurt vs gabapentin? I have not. Gabapentin is working for me. I never thought I would get better.  But I am two years and change out and about half the days I feel like I did before.  It keeps getting better.  I know it feels like it will never end because the recovery is painfully slow.  I am young and was athletic and at some point just came to terms with walking around the block being the most physically taxing thing I would ever do again.  I can do 20 minute hit workouts now most days after a full day of parenting young children.  Sometimes followed by a long walk.\n\nIt is so hard.  It will get better. ", "Myoclonus and GBS? Is it possible to have mild GBS or for myoclonus/muscle spasms/jerks to be a part of GBS?\n\nI received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and a month later I was in the ER with \u201cmyoclonus. They could not stop it without high doses of Keppra and clonazapam. I would never had anything like it before. I also experienced extreme tiredness and the tingling/prickling feeling of ants crawling up and down my arms and legs. That symptom ignored because I had it once or twice a year or so ago when I started an SSRI or whatever they are called.\n\nIt is now been almost 6 months and my symptoms are persisting. I constantly get the prickles. I am exhausted. Any physical activity brings on the myoclonus even with medication. If I try to stop the medication, I seize about once every 5-10 minutes for anywhere from 10 seconds to 2 minutes at a time.\n\nMy MRI and EEG came back normal so it is not a brain tumor and I am just starting to wonder if I should be pushing to be checked for GBS and to give plasma exchange or that type of thing a shot. Your case does not sound like GBS.\n\nThe myoclonus and autonomic dysfunction are likely brainstem or coritcal (usually epilepsy related) in origin.\n\nIt is possible the J&amp;J vaccination was just a coincidence. Did you have any signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection itself.\n\nThere is a Myoclonus syndrome potentially associated with COVID itself:\n\n(\n\nNonetheless, I suggest to keep seeking answers from your medical practitioners, given your ongoing struggle with the symptoms. (and maybe mention the above study) Thank you! I have seen tons of studies connecting myoclonus with covid but never did have symptoms or test positive. I guess I could have been asymptomatic. I also wonder if covid is related to it if the vaccine would be to. Either which way, it looks like the way to resolve it is similar: with immunotherapy, so maybe that is what I need to be pushing to try. Thanks. Are you a doctor? You seem knowledgeable in this.", "Jenna Jameson ", "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 Summer (GBS) - Evelyn's Story  I did not think I needed to include this here, but Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Summer was just a play on words. Her first symptom occurred in May and she was able to return to school in September, so it ran its course over her summer break. I know that it is a Syndrome and not a Summer, but thank you to whoever thought I needed that reminder on YouTube :P", "I really need your help please! Hi everyone, I (49F) need some suggestions/advice based on your wealth of experiences please.  Encouraging words are also welcome, and honestly really needed right now.  Along with being scared, I am feeling really discouraged with my treatments apparently failing, and the rollercoaster of emotions I have been on from feeling great to feeling horrible again has really done a job on my mental health.\n\nI apologise in advance, but this is going to be a long one.  I have included a TL;DR at the bottom for those who do not want to read the whole thing.  \n\nIn September I noticed that my arms felt weaker.  It started off so small, just noticing that my purse felt a little heavier (it is a heavy tote anyway), and that when doing a little more in the shower (added a body conditioner, so literally just a little more using my arms to rub it all over me) made my arms feel fatigued.  At first I thought that I was just loosing muscle, because I had stopped working a physically strenuous job, and was not working out, so I was not alarmed.\n\nHowever, every day the weakness got slowly, but progressively, worse and worse until I could not raise my hands above my shoulders.  I also began noticing that getting up from a sitting position was becoming difficult, too (I have single floor living, so I was not doing anything like stairs, just flat walking, so maybe that is why I did not notice them right away.).  I went to my PC, and he did a bunch of blood work (all came back normal), and referred me to a neurologist.  While waiting for the neurologist appointment (about 3 weeks away) I continued to worsen.  It felt like I had wrist and ankle weights on that just continued to get heavier and heavier every day.\n\nFour days before my appointment I called the neurologist, and asked to come in sooner, because I had gotten so bad that I was falling (just from getting tripped up, like a toe getting caught on a stair, and not having the strength to catch myself, and not light-headedness, or balance issues), and I was unable to stand on my own from a sitting position, or from falling.  As a matter of fact, I called and asked because I could not stand up from the toilet that day, and had to crawl to a bedroom chair to hoist myself up!  He of course told me to go to the ER.\n\nAt the hospital I had X-rays, a MRI, a Spinal tap, and more blood work, but everything again came back normal.  The only thing showing this was not just in my head was that ONLY ONE of my reflexes worked (my left ankle reflex).  That of course explained why the last few times I had fallen that I landed on my face! \ud83e\udd26 Then I got an EMG, and while I could feel all the sensations, but my body did not respond at all.  I just lay there completely still getting jolted and pricked.  I also never felt any numbness or tingling anywhere on my body.  They did not know what it was, but decided to try treating me with IVIG.  \n\nI had 5 days of IVIG (25 grams a day), and on the morning of the 3rd day (even before treatment), I greeted my doctors by waving hi with my hands above my head!  Of course I was elated, and so we are they!  I went home, and was fine, until 6 weeks later, on Thanksgiving day in fact, I felt the faint weakness starting again.  My heart sunk.  My doctor diagnosed me with CIDP, and I went back to the hospital, where again I got treated with IVIG (this time for 3 days, 25 grams each).   \n\nAgain, I recovered fully after the IVIG treatment, and was set up to be infused every 4 weeks.  This is when it gets interesting/unusual, and in my case devastating.  The first month went great.  I got my IVIG (doc prescribed 2 days of 40 grams each going forward) just as I was feeling the weakness return, and again recovered fully.  However, every month after that my symptoms began returning every 16-18 days, and by the time for my treatment I was back to not being able to stand on my own.  \n\nThe doctor tried upping the IVIG first (40 grams to 50), but when that did not change anything I went to the 50 grams every 3 weeks.  The hope was that since I would be getting IVIG before my symptoms got as bad as they would been getting, that my body had less healing to do, and the IVIG would be able to work longer.  The first two months with the new schedule was great again, and I did not feel symptoms return at all before my next treatment. \n\nUnfortunately, once again, my symptoms returned.  This time just 14 days from my treatment.  It also began taking longer for me to bounce back, and begin to feel my \"strength\" return after IVIG.  In the last 2 treatments (still 2 days of 50 grams each) I have recovered less and less after each treatment, and still start getting weaker again at 14 days.\n\nI normally have a positive attitude about getting sick.  I found it to be a huge wake up call on how in the blink of the eye your whole world can change.  I do not take for granted the things and people that I did before this reality check, and I am super grateful for that, but it is getting harder and harder to be positive with things that were working, not working as well anymore.  I tell myself someone else has it worse, and to be grateful that I am still able to do what I can do, but I feel like this condition/virus keeps getting stronger, like it is building resistance to the IVIG, and I am afraid of how bad it is going to get.  \n\nAs soon as I start feeling weakness I want to stop doing everything that I do not have to do that requires moving my arms much, because it is just a constant reminder of my current state.  I end up watching TV, going on social media, or reading a book.  Nothing productive, and with wanting to stay safe from the pandemic, there is not anything to do but hang out at home anyway.  So that is what I do.  All day, everyday.  Day, after day, after day, and it does not look like it is going to be able to change anytime soon.  \n\nI do not want to live like this, and be a physical burden for my husband (he has to shower me, pick me up from sitting, and even cut up my food for days before my treatments) even though he never complains, and I know he loves me deeply.  I do not know what to do.\n\nThose who get IVIG treatments, how long between treatments do you go, and how many days in a row do you do?  \n\nAnyone else have an autoimmune related condition that is had successful, alternative treatments like Ozone Therapy?\n\nHave any of you had their condition get worse and worse, even though your treatment was technically working to improve your symptoms?  \n\nLastly, does anyone have any suggestions of what to do for the despair, or that helped them lift their mood?  \n\nTl;dr: I was diagnosed with (CIDP-also known as Chronic Guillian Barre Syndrome) that seems to be becoming progressively resistant to IVIG treatment.  Looking for advice on why/how/what might be happening, how others get their IVIG treatments, and how to beat feeling bored, depressed, and sorry for myself.\n\nThank you all for your time, especially those who read the whole thing (god I cannot believe how long it really is!!!), and also in advance for your responses.  I really appreciate it! Honestly, I do not have any real advice. I cannot help you. But I wanted you to know that someone read it and is here. \n\nThe way I cope is, frankly, avoid. Tv, movies, books, videogames, insane amounts of anime. Like. Omg. So much anime. Did not know there even was this much until I got GBS and just had nothing better to do. On days that I actually feel able to get things done, I work myself to exhaustion because I do not know when I will have energy again. Then I spend the next week drained and in more pain than usual. It is not healthy, but it works. Kind Of. I guess if I can offer one nugget of helpfulness, it would be \"do not wallow.\" Acknowledge, address, be aware of, but do not wallow. I spend a lot of time alone and sometimes all I can do is think. It rarely goes anywhere good or helpful. Often ends in tears. \n\nIt sounds like we both got pretty lucky with our husbands though! A good support system is incredibly important. I honestly did not realize how amazing some of the people in my life are. And the husband really stepped up to the plate when all of this mess went fully sideways. Thank you so much for your reply!  It appears we have a lot in common.  It means a lot to know I am not alone in my feelings and fears, and that others can truly relate! Any time! The important thing is to know that you are not alone. hi, i hope you get better soon. have you heard of medical medium ? maybe give his protocol a try! he says to stay away from eggs and diary as if helps feed the pathogens Has your doctor recommended plasma phoresis? That helped my GBS symptoms. IVIG was only somewhat successful for me. I agree that distraction is good advice.

Hi GBS community,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow has your recovery pattern been? Is each day better than the last or do you have days/weeks that you regress?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy experience was 2-3 weeks of progressing weakness, about 6 weeks of plateau, then a fluctuating recovery. Generally 2 weeks where each day improves, then a week where I will seemingly regress to where I was the week before. Then 2 more improving weeks, followed by another slight regression. Overall, I am improving and I am wondering if others have followed a similar pattern...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny input would be appreciated, thank you! Hello.  I am ten years, end of this month actually, since I was paralyzed from my ears down. The only residual I have is \u201cfuzzy\u201d feet. My feet feel like I am wearing shoes that are way too tight. 24/7, all the time, day in day out. 100% consistent.  It has been this way since I walked out of the hospital. So, to answer your question, I can honestly say my recovery has stopped. It went straight up once I started IVIG then reached this point where it is now. Thank you for the reply. Sorry to hear about the fuzzy feet. May I ask, have you gained your strength and stamina back fully? If so, was that in a linear pattern? As a whole my general strength and stamina have deteriorated.  That is because I do not try to improve it. That has nothing to do with my GBS.  Everything to do with being lazy.  Your strength and stamina has a lot to do with your age, severity of GBS and your commitment to recovery.  I think you have to look at it like a fitness program, you will have both, linear progression and plateaus. Unfortunately, you are asking a loaded question. The factors that dictate 'progression' and 'recovery' are extremely varied from person to person as a result of the many subsequent factors (i.e. age, lifestyle, initial severity\\\\treatment, pre-existing conditions, etc). There are a hella lot of folks that progress super quick and very linear, while in contrast, there are folks who remain pretty sedentary for years. Progress with GBS is just like any other thing though - the more you \\*can do\\*, and the more you \\*do\\*, the higher likeliness there is  of improving. Same concept though, just like anything else - we all plateau as well. Give me a sense of where you are in terms of your recovery. This is very interesting. Thank you for the information. I did not mean to ask a loaded question... I have recovered to the point where I can walk significant distances (couple miles on a good day, around a NYC block on a bad day). My worst was limited to 50 feet max. My doctors said that since I had not reached paralysis and my EMG/conduction results were good, they did not want to treat me with IVIG, etc.. I have been in the recovery stage for only 2 months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat truly brings me to the question of recovery progression is that I cannot find any medical descriptions of the process. Most sources describe a timeframe and extent of recovery, but does not really describe the process in detail. I have asked doctors if there is a \"usual\" pattern, but they give vague answers. Maybe I am asking an unanswerable question? 4 years in, I cannot measure day by day, maybe quarter by quarter. Miniscule changes.", "Today marks one year from when I was put on a breathing tube I do not remember much from my time in the hospital, but I remember when that was put in and taken out. \n\nI still cannot believe where I am at today compared to where I was a year ago. I could not walk, I could not talk, and I could not breathe. Now, I am healthy, I am almost done paying off my medical bills, and I have a daughter on the way. \n\nThis past year has been the hardest year of my life, and I got through it. Things do get better. It feels good to be able to say that, does not it!  Daughters are awesome, enjoy her. Thank you my wife and I are excited :) It will be a year for me in May! Similar situation but I ended up needing to be trachea\u2019d because of contracting pneumonia in the ICU. Still doing physical therapy ::/ So sorry :(. I got very lucky. I wish you the best of luck in your recovery!! Congratulations! And if you are not 100% recovered, you will hopefully continue with slow progress over the next year or so. I know the rule of thumb is recovery continues to about 2 years and that matches my personal experience (it is been about 3.5 years). I was definitely walking like an old man for a while and it gradually improved until I suddenly realized it felt completely natural. On rare occasion, I feel like I can notice remaining limitations (like standing still on an escalator and not holding the rail, I feel a little unsteady) but I thrilled with how minor that is. I am so glad you have recovered! *fist bump* Thank you! \ud83d\ude01", "Has anyone spoken to a neurologist or anyone else about getting a Shingles vaccine? My primary care physician recommends I get a shingles vaccination, and she is almost certainly correct in giving that advice out to us olds.\n\nBut I am a bit cautious about the Shingles vaccination for us GBSers\n\nI am doubly covid vaxxed, and will probably get Pfizerized a third time...\n\nHas anyone spoken to a neurologist about the Shingles vaccine and GBS? Or about Shingles itself and GBS? I did and will ask again now that am in old club. 3 months ago he said yes to both. I am in the CIDP camp however and activity being treated with IVIg. That might br the difference? I am leaning towards getting the shot because I guess I would prefer GBS and no shingles to SHINGLES with GBS as a bonus, but it would be interesting to know what a neurologist has to say My Neuro advised no live vaccines; even though my GBS was not caused by a vaccine.  I would check with your neurologist. thanks, I really do need to check in with a neurologist on this, also I was not aware that the shingles vaccine was live virus! I do not believe shingles is a live vaccine.  My Neuro said those are the only ones to avoid.  Let us know what your Neuro says!", "GBS with respiratory failure My father was diagnosed with GBS cranial nerves 5 days ago.  \nIt started with weakness in the tongue, it could not swallow, could not eat solids and it eventually compromised the strength of his Diaphragm and had to be sedated and intubated.\n\nHe is currently on day 4 of been intubated and on day 4 of his first treatment with Immunoglobulin. My father is 57 years old and has never been hospitalized so as you can imagine we are deeply worried about his health and his ability to breath on his own and get ASAP out of the hospital  \n\n\nHow long on average does a person take to breathe on its own after been intubated due to a respiratory failure?  \nI would love to read your anecdotes on how long it took to get rid of your ventilator and how difficult was your process\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe live in Panama, Central America.  \nSo I apologize for my grammar as its not my native language When I was admitted for GBS, the ER Dr, told me being intubated would add at least 1-2 weeks to my hospital time.  Unless we have some medical folks lurking in here though I am guessing you will not get a good solid answer.  Instead you will get feedback from a handful of individuals.  Just keep that in mind. I am so sorry about your father. \n\nWhen I (24/M) was intubated they originally thought I was going to be on it fo over two months. However, I was taken off the breathing tube in 28 hours. \n\nIt really depends on a case-by-case basis. Again, I am so sorry for you and your father\u2019s situation. I wish you all the best of luck. I think it depends on if the treatment stops the GBS\u2019s progression. I was in my mid 50s too when I experienced GBS. It was three days of IVIG before the progression leveled out ( and I stopped getting worse) . Then I needed to grow the myelin sheath back so my nerves could handle the impulses and control my body\u2019s various functions. If the treatment stops the body from damaging itself ( stops eating the myelin sheath off the nerves) then you need to allow the nervous system to re establish itself.  Once it re establishes control over the lungs he can breath on his own. \n\nStay patient. The positive is that GBS can come/ go without leaving long term affects. I know it is hard right now but have faith that it will get better. Stay positive. My best wishes.  Keep us posted on his progress. Thanks for sharing Yeah. I am aware that the recovery times are different for each individual but i was just looking for more informations\nThanks for sharing Hi aware that the recovery times are different for each individual but i was just looking for more informations\nthanks for sharing, I am dad. Wow. Your case was remarkable\nThanks for sharing your story Bad bot. I forgot the important part. Keep strong for them, and good luck. Hey sorry about your father, let me share my story to give you some insight. I believe it is a case by case basis as said before, I was 22 when I started expierence severe gbs symptoms and had to be placed on a vent and had a tracheotomy due to respiratory failure. It takes quite a while to wane off of the vent, it took me around 3 months to do so and I was a young male so my recovery time was definitely impacted by my youth. I was intubated for 5 days.  I already had IVIG prior to being intubated.  I hope your father recovers quickly.  I know it is hard, but try to be patient. I am sorry to hear your dad odd going through this. It is not fun. Be patient and find interesting podcasts. \n\n I was diagnosed with GBS, Miller Fisher variant in my mid thirties, so recovery time will vary. This was my experience getting intubated. \n\nI was intubated for close to 10 days, and has a tracheotomy because the doctors do not like leaving you intubated for longer than 10 days. I could breathe on my own between week 2-3 and finally left ICU. \n\nThe tracheotomy was removed around week 8-9 and had to relearn to eat solid food. I was finally discharged at 12 weeks to continue recovery at home. \n\nThe process of getting rid of the tracheotomy was frustrating for me because I could not talk or eat with it in. I had to prove to the doctors I could safely eat and drink without aspiring before they would take it out.

", "Staying positive Hey everyone, 20 days ago I got diagnosed with Guillainbarre, it all started with a headache and a numbing sensation on the bottom of my feet. At first I was really feeling down having my face, arms and waist down go completely numb. Today I was able to slide my knee up to my chest and have gotten control of my arms and hands enough that I can write this. Just want to say that it is easy to get stuck in the sad thoughts while going through this but you have to stay positive. You have to keep waking up everyday saying Thinking positive and keep working towards that end goal of walking out of the hospital. This is truly and eye opening experience and by no means it is easy but we are strong and we can come back. Hey there. Sorry you are going through this. It sounds like you are already seeing improvement, which is amazing! I know it can be hard to stay positive in this situation...what just happened to you was scary and very disruptive to your life. But things WILL get better :) \n\nPersonally I was very traumatized by the whole experience. I am still recovering mentally, 2 years out (yay anxiety!). But I am happy to say that other than a few tiny \u201cglitches\u201d (like my hands get cold easily), I am 100% recovered. In fact, yesterday I ran my first 5k. So maybe I am even stronger than before? Never thought that could happen when I could not walk 2 years ago. So do not lose hope, you will get out of that hospital soon, and your body will heal. &lt;3 \n\nThere are a few fb groups that have really helped me feel less alone in all of this, might be worth checking out :) \n\nWishing you a speedy and full recovery! Thank you for the kind words, it is stories like these that makes me more motivated to get back to my old self. I am so happy to hear about your progress, gives me hope\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd How are you doing? Day30 I was able to walk about 20 steps with the help of some braces and a walker but it is such an encouraging achievement for my self, everyday little parts of my body come back to life but it is the toughest thing I have ever done. Keep it up! It is really all about the recovery. You sound like you are improving! It is crazy how many improvements happen without you realizing it because you think you cannot do it. For me when PT had me lay on my stomach and move my leg so I can kick my own butt I was too weak to control it pass the knee and it fell and REALLY kicked me in the ass haha. The other day I was doing on exercises on my stomach and tried it out of curiosity and I had complete control. \n\nPoint is, even when you do not think you are improving if you are doing what you are supposed to do to better then progressions will happen. It is a slow process but you got this. Our body is so strong , all we can do is keep pushing for our health. I try to stay positive and today I went out with no wheelchair only a walker and that was such an accomplishment for me. I will keep pushing everyday and soon we will both be able to kick our own butts \ud83d\ude09", "My GBS story In January 2012 I came down with the worst flu I had ever experienced (still true through today).\n\nI was 22 years old, and was just about to start some entry level job.\nThat Monday (day 1 on the job) I recall being so sick and weak that I was recommended to go home and rest.\n\nThe next day the muscles in my legs were trembling and it was extremely difficult to climb the stairs.\n\nStill convinced this was solely a symptom of the flu, I booked a doctor's appointment.\n\nAfter meeting my doctor and explained all my symptoms, he requested I walked around in the hallway, attempt to stand on my tiptoes, and try to balance on my heels.\n  As my doctor was examining all this, he recommended I headed straight to the emergency room to get tests done.\n\nI remember the staff being really nice and accomodating, as they did several tests, monitoring, and my first ever spinal-tap (That was a fun one lol)\n\nDue to process of elimination, I was diagnosed with Guillain Barre Syndrome.\nMy first impression of this was some French War Hero, as I have never heard of such thing before.\n\nThe following day the neurologist did a shock test to measure the responsiveness of my nerves.\nShe stated the damage was not severe and would likely return to normal after a few months or years.\n\nOver time, my legs strengthened again.\nWhat still remains to this day is my numb feet.\nIts a strange sensation, as I am sure many of you are well aware of.\n\nToday as I write this, I am 31 years old, and have tried multiple methods to get the feeling back in my feet.\nI noticed acupuncture and acupressure \"wakes them up\" a bit, although I do not experience long term results...\n\nI am open to hearing any suggestions you may have.\nI would also love to hear your story and connect.\n\nSince being diagnosed with GBS, I have more gratitude in the things I am able to do, such as walk, and be independent. I truly consider myself lucky.\n\n- Kevin\nSF Bay Area /u/asaplofty, I have found an error in your post:\n\n &gt; \u201c~~Its~~  a strange\u201d\n\nI suggest that you, asaplofty, use \u201c~~Its~~  a strange\u201d instead. \u2018Its\u2019 is possessive; \u2018it is\u2019 means \u2018it is\u2019 or \u2018it has\u2019.\n\n ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!) Thanks Bot I really do not know if this can help you but have you been evaluated for IVIG infusions? This is a core treatment for CIDP and it is working on my nerves. But I do not know if it would help in your case and how the many years you have gone with numbness would impact your outcome. Agreed, I have always known IVIG to be standard of care for GBS treatment. Did they send you home without any treatment? I was a teenager when I developed GBS and was hospitalized for a week to receive IVIG treatments. Over the last 5 years or so, nearly 12 years later, I have developed random numbness in patches of my legs that seem to be specific to innervation patterns. It is not as bad as your numb feet, but it is a similar phenomenon. Nothing works for me except time for the sensation to restore.\n\nI second the other poster, have you ever talked with a neurologist about getting IVIG treatments? I am not sure if it is as effective so far after symptom onset but it could be worth a conversation. It is not right to live so long with numbness in your feet when there are medical options available to you. I am nearly 4 years into my recovery from GBS. Total paralysis from the neck down. Went through 2 rounds of IVIG treatment (5 doses each round). I still cannot feel my toes or finger tips, and they said that is normal since they are the farthest from the spinal column. I am hopeful that one day the nerves will heal and I will get feeling  back. I take several vitamins that they say promote nerve health and use Aspercreme with lidocaine on my hands and feet - it helps relieve the neuropathy temporarily. I also wear toe socks (eBay) because there is some pain when the toes touch each other - weird, huh?!? The random shooting pains are the worst. You never know when you get a ping or a cramp. I have found that attitude is everything. I tell myself that if this is as good as it gets, I can live with it. I also feel fortunate to be where I am today compared to where I was almost 4 years ago. Keep the faith my friend! We are close to the same age and you had GBS around the same time I had CIDP! Sorry it happened to you. \n\nI know it will not \"cure\" the problem, but I have found chiropractics helpful to eliminate other problems. I stand on my feet a lot for work. A few years ago, over the course of a few weeks, my feet would be incredibly numb and tingling by the end of the day, it was difficult to walk. Of course, I was super paranoid I was relapsing.  Neuro did not find anything, my nerves were still responding, etc. They actually suggested chiro (?!?!). Turns out, my hips were out of alignment and would put pressure on the nerves when I would stand. A few cracking appointments and strengthening exercises later, I am good.\n\nI am not saying that is what is happening here. Only that I learned chiro helped me make sure everything was in alignment and working properly. I still have occasional numbness and tingling. Also, I still trip with one foot more than the other. But significantly better now that my spine and hips are aligned. I have just accepted that is my normal. I tried different stimulants like peppermint oil, massage, hot then cold repeating until I got bored.  It took time but I can feel most of my feet now.  That being said I still broke one 2 weeks ago and did not feel it.  I considered the numbness a bonus at that point.  \ud83e\udd23 Hey Kevin - very similar story here. I had it when I was 25, back in 1995. Still have residual effects today -- namely my feet -- but over time I largely have been able to tune them out. Right now I am experiencing a swelling sensation in just one foot that emerged a week or so ago. It is almost certainly a residual issue that will temper over time. Does not impact my daily life, but it is always a nagging issue, especially if, say, we are on vacation and walking around a lot. I never received any treatment for GBS... in 1995 things were different, I guess. BTW I am also in the Bay Area. I havent been evaluated for IVIG. I need to look into this! Thanks That Is a great idea! I have never been to a chiropractor, but have a greater need to do so now. Thanks! They sent me home without any treatment. Odd right? Hello my fellow Bay Area friend!", "I was just informed that my out patient physio is only 2 times per week. Is that common? Has anyone worked with a PT at home?  Mine was only once a week, and i was barely using a walker when i left the hospital. It is pretty common, but it is also completely up to your insurance/the PT's scheduling. I did outpatient PT and OT, but not at my home. I had to go to the outpatient facility. But it was twice a week. They provided me with exercises to do at home, and that is what I would do on my \"off\" days.\n\nI was in the hospital and then transferred to a rehab hospital before discharge, and it is pretty jarring going from daily PT/OT to only twice a week, so I understand the concern. If you are not sure or have more questions, I would recommend you reach out to your neurologist or other doctor to have a conversation with them about any concerns or questions. I was in the hospital for a month. The last two weeks, I think I was doing OT and/or PT every day. After I went home I think I did PT twice a week and OT once a week for a while. I regained mobility fairly quickly, though. How bad was your GBS I guess I am not sure compared to others. I was in the ICU and on a ventilator within a few days after developing symptoms. I did have to relearn how to walk, but I was walking mostly unassisted within 6 weeks of my first symptoms. Went to the hospital in August and was back at work half-time by October. That is very inspiring! Thank you In those early days after being released from the hospital, I had twice weekly PT/OT sessions for it seems like...forever. :). I also was in PT after a severe relapse ten years later twice a week for a few months. This was in a gym setting and with the machines, felt like I made quicker progress. \n\nLook into AFOs if you have weak ankles and/or dropfoot.", "Recovering from covid19, pins and needles Hi everyone! I have been lurking for a couple of days trying to figure out what is wrong will the me. I am a 42 year old woman,  American living in Belgium. I came down with suspected coronavirus with my first symptoms on March 11. It was awful, especially the respiratory issues but since I did not need to be hospitalized, no test. Now I am feeling better, but about three days ago started to have a pins and needles feeling in my feet and hands, as well as a cool numb feeling in different parts of my body but mostly my legs... shooting pain as well. I called my doctor and he told me I was probably exhausted from the illness and to take magnesium. Meanwhile I googled my symptoms and...here I am. I have since talked to my doctor a second time and basically because of the current crisis he says to sit tight and not to go the hospital unless I am in respiratory distress. I think he is too focused on the covid19 diagnosis and frankly I am scared something else is going on. Your thoughts? I think I am just going to call the neurology department of my hospital tomorrow but there is no guarantee I can talk to someone. Appointments are generally cancelled because of the virus.... You have already reached out to a medical professional, which is good! Do you have weakness? Finding it difficult to stand or walk? Have you retained your sense of taste? Are the pins and needles in your fingers and toes, or spreading up? Hi there, I read that hospital UZ Brussels will do x-ray lung scan for all patients coming to the hospital despite the reason ( covid or no covid), maybe call them to see if they can help.. Very slight weakness in my legs but I can walk and stand. I have my sense of taste,  just baked some cookies to keep my mind off things! The pins and needles are mainly in my fingers and toes though I feel it from time to time in my lower legs. Sometimes I get pain in the spot where I had the pins and needles or numb feeling, like right now in my ankle and my neck. Thanks, I might call them. I am a registered patient at Saint Luc so I think that is where I would need to go, but I am prepared to do much of my day on the phone tomorrow... Write down EVERY symptom and a timeline. If you notice the numbness or tingling spreading, severe pain along your spine, scream bloody murder until they diagnose you. Write EVERYTHING down. My partner just went through this in February before all the crazy went down. It took 5 trips to the ER and regular GP BEFORE he got diagnosed, even though he knew he had it. it is so rare that the doctors just did not believe it. If the tingles progress up your hands/feet/arm/legs and/or turn into numbness, if you get intense nerve pain, if you are not able to stand up or find yourself falling when you are walking, I would recommend calling again at that point. Definitely monitor the progression of the pins/needles and how far they are progressing up your limbs. Thanks, this is helpful, my biggest worry is that no one will take me seriously. I know something is wrong and I am afraid I will have a hard time convincing the powers that be. So, I have some thoughts and you might not love them.\n\n1. GBS could absolutely be triggered by COVID-19. My own case of GBS was triggered by a severe upper respiratory infection.\n2. Your doctor may or may not have been blowing off your concerns, but either way, the recommendation is a good one. If you have GBS, you will wind up in the hospital when you need to be. If you do not, it is best to stay away from the hospital system. That said, it can be hard to check if you have it without an EMG and/or Lumbar Puncture.\n3. COVID-19 is a much higher fatality rate than GBS, and GBS fatalities look like COVID-19 fatalities with breathing being the main problem.\n\nBottom line, keep tracking your symptoms and follow your doctor's current advice. Watch for weakness or imprecise limb motion. You are safest away from hospitals, until you know for sure you need to be there.\n\nWhichever way it goes, I hope all clears up for you soon and you stay safe and continue towards a healthier state quickly. Thanks everyone for the guidance. I called my doctor again and he referred me to a neurologist, I had a phone consultation and she was lovely. Took all my symptoms, took a lot of notes. For now it is B vitamins and rest, we have another call in a few days and I have an emergency number to call in case which at this point is enough for me. I was so relieved to just talk to someone! Symptoms are still going strong but I do not think they are worse which is already a plus.", "CIDP MEDICATIONS My mom has been diagnosed with CIDP and has been receiving treatments for a few years now. She is been prescribed Gabapentin(neurontin) and Flexeril.\nThese drugs are not on the list of treatments for CIDP, so I wanted to reach out and ask if anyone had any experience with either of the two. The side effects have been pretty bad, so I just want some clarity on whether she should even be on them. I am not a doctor and my no means am I telling you what to do, I am simply telling you my experience. I had GBS and was given a lot of gabepenrin(sp) in the hospital. I was given a prescription and I refilled it a couple of times. However I found it really did not help, reduced the pain maybe 10%. It was not wort it to me. If it reduced the pain even 50% maybe I would have stayed with it longer. I was under the impression that IVIG was the treatment for CIPD Your mom should consult with her doctor or get a second opinion. This is a support subreddit. I took Gabapentin at night for years. It is intolerable to me in the daytime. I get better sleep now with melatonin and magnesium malate. My blood pressure is too low to take flexeril, it makes me faint like a tree falling in the forest. I was on Gammunex and now take Hizentra. that is right from my experience. My dad has CIDP and is getting his IVIG treatment as we speak. Luckily even with COVID we have a nurse that comes over to administer the treatment. It is such a huge help since his immune system could use that supercharge now more than ever.\n\nIVIG has been moderately effective though overall. My dad has had CIDP for over a year now, and sadly it seems like there is not too much that provides relief. Either that or it is painfully, painfully slow. Is your mother taking anything other than Gaba or Flex? those mostly just treat the symptoms. IVIG/Plasmapharesis are the approved treatments long-term. I took Gaba for months and it did almost nothing for my symptoms until i went to a weekly IVIG regimine She receives treatments, and like you said, takes gaba and flex for symptoms. I am concerned with the side effects of the two in comparison to the benefits of taking them considering she is receiving the treatments. I found that i was much better without them and just taking IVIG subcutaneously. I am on Hizentra now and been out of the hospital for a year. I was paralyzed from the chest down and no hand control and i am 99% back to normal with my weekly treatments and no Gaba I was prescribed 3200 mg a day of gabapentin, but it did not seem to have any effect on me at all. I had Guillian Barre when I was 20, recovered, then relapsed about 3 months later. I was treated and had no further issues until about two years ago (at age 36), and now have been diagnosed with cidp. Now I am on weekly subcutaneous ivig (Hizentra).", "Only Confirnmd Cases Here? Is this forum only for people with a confirmed diagnosis of GBS? This community is open to everyone u/Sylvane1a, including the family of friends of people affected by GBS/CIDP. For example, I am technically undiagnosed since my situation is a little weird, but my neurologist and primary physician treat it as GBS. Is there anything wrong with asking advice if you are undiagnosed but have symptoms of a neurological problem (that it is neurological is all but certain, non-neurologist doctors have said so)? I know that is forbidden on some boards like the ALS board, and I can see why and I respect that.\n\nI admit it is tempting to look for clues for what I might have based on what other people with known diagnoses say but I would not look for anyone here to diagnose me. I would mostly look for advice on how to get diagnosed and what people's experiences with diagnosis have been. Feel free to ask questions. You can ask about your symptoms and the timeline of them. Most people will say something along the lines of \u201ctalk to a neurologist and get tested ASAP.\u201d  The biggest thing with GBS/CIDP is being diagnosed and treated early I can tell you now, peoples experiences in this subreddit with diagnosis are all over the place. I do not have GBS, but I feel very welcome here. BTW, thank you, everyone!\n\nI definitely suggest going to a neurologist. GBS is rare, and a neurologist would be able to test for other issues that cause what you are experiencing. Yes, I have seen a neurologist already. He did an EMG test which came out abnormal, and blood tests which I think came out normal. Or maybe inconclusive.\n\nHe did not so anything else except make an appointment to see me again months into the future.\n\nWhat other tests are there? For any kind of neurological problems.\n\nI have heard a diagnosis can take a long time. But I guess I am impatient and want to change neurologists. Things are getting worse. Spinal tap. I got worse after my semi abnormal emg and blood work. I was not officially diagnosed with CIDP until my spinal tap which I recommend you try to get as soon a possible so you can begin a treatment plan if you are diagnosed with something! The sooner you are diagnosed the better and remember to try as hard as you can to remain positive! Although my recovery has been tough at times it has made me a much more patient and positive person appreciating everything good that I have in my life! Regarding spinal taps, is this something any neurologist would do?\n\nNeurologists have subspecialties. Some in sleep medicine, some in vascular, some in the brain, etc. I got it into my head that I need someone who specializes in neuromuscular diseases. I cannot help thinking it save time just to go directly to one of those so I have been calling them. But there is a long wait for them. I have already wasted enough time thinking this thing was orthopedic and going to the wrong kind of doctor. I woke up unable to move one morning, so my wife called an ambulance. My spinal tap was done in the ER by the ER physician shortly after I arrived. It showed elevated protein levels I believe, which is an indicator of GBS. They already suspected GBS based on the symptoms. IVIG treatments started within hours of the diagnosis. I had two rounds of 5 doses, one dose per day for 5 days, no improvement after a couple days, then another dose per day for 5 days. They called mine a severe case. I started to show some improvement after the second round.", "Constantly exhausted Hi everyone!\n\nIn late November I was diagnosed with GBS and hospitalized for five days (where I received IVIG). Besides some loss of fine motor skills and a bit of sensation within my hands, the paralysis never spread to my abdomen. I could not walk, but I was just grateful that I did not need to be intubated. It was scary, and I needed a ton of support from my incredible family and partner, but I had read many stories where the outcome of GBS was much worse. I felt lucky to have a case which was not as severe as others, and I was really determined to get better as quickly as possible.\n\nI am a college student, and the hospitalization and subsequent recovery made it so I could not finish semester. I am managing to pay for school with the help of an academic scholarship (which I nearly lost because of my withdrawal from the semester) and loans. I spent all of December going to PT religiously, recovering, and getting ready for getting back on the academic bandwagon.\n\nWhen I started this semester I needed to still use my cane to get around and I could not drive myself to class, but my very supportive boyfriend helped me get to campus and I took on a full-time course load. I am in an engineering program and the classes can be really tough, but I generally do well because I spend much of my time studying.\n\nAs semester progressed everything gradually became better, except for the fatigue. Everything made me tired, and I had to budget my time to meet the difficult requirements my program places on its students accordingly. I stopped going to PT, I could finally walk without a cane, and I only had enough energy to manage my class/work/homework schedule. I felt that if I went to PT my grades would slip because I would be too tired to do my studies.\n\nRegardless of that, my grades did slip. I have been giving this semester my all, and I cannot seem to manage better than a D/C average, whereas prior to GBS I used to make the dean's list each semester. I am scared I will lose my scholarship (and thus be unable to pay for school) even though I am still giving it my all. I feel the problem is the fatigue I feel each day. I have been managing it with vitamin b supplements and caffeine, but some days I am so tired I need to be driven to and from school/work because I am worried I will get it an accident. I make sure to get plenty of sleep each night, but I feel so tired all of the time.\n\nAfter talking with my therapist about a recent exam I had he recommended I drop this academic semester. I study hard, maybe even harder than before, but I am struggling to keep my head above the water. It seems that even though I can walk again I am plagued by this fatigue which makes it hard to do even the most basic of tasks. A trip to the grocery store after work? No way, I will be too tired to do anything for the rest of the night if I do that.\n\nI am mostly making this post to put my story out there, but also to ask if anyone else has had issues with fatigue even after they regained control of their motor skills. I feel like I need to keep pushing myself, but my body is telling me I am not done healing. I am concerned about my academic future, and I am genuinely pretty sad that I might have to withdraw again when I thought my recovery was going well. I cannot tell you when I stopped feeling fatigue as a daily thing, it was somewhere more then 6 months and less then a year after my release from the hospital.  \n\nIt will be 10 years ago this Christmas, and I still go from feeling good to just wasted as a cliff instead of a general decline, as I did before GBS.\n\nThis is one of those points in life that I am not sure there is a set answer for you.  There are going to upsides and downsides to whatever you move forward with here.  IMO, take advice from those that you care about, make YOUR choice, stick with it, and trying not to let any the regrets get to you.  Sometimes the only way out is through.\n\nIf it matters, from my professional point of view, after the first job (and often not even then), no one really cares much how long it took to get the degree or your grade point average.  It becomes much more of a True/False statement. I have had chronic fatigue ever since I was diagnosed 7 years ago. I think you should take time off school to fully focus on recovery and physical therapy. How long of a break or if you return to academia is ultimately your decision, but please remember that your physical and mental health are number one. GBS is a life-changer so make sure you reassess priorities", "Is having RH negative blood linked to autoimmune disease? ", "I do not have insurance. Advice? Hi there, just need a little financial/experiential advice. I had a recent awful bout of Flu B that turned into pneumonia. I was hospitalized for that, but I happened to be on military insurance (everything was free) when it happened. I separated from the military a few days later (bad timing right), and now I have no income and no insurance. I am set to get a pneumonia checkup with a low income clinic two days from now, and I will mention my symptoms. \n\nWoke up about 4 days ago with horrible nerve pain/tingling down both arms. (No numbness?) I thought I would wait til Friday to mention it, it could be anything. Yesterday my legs started feeling it too, only slightly, so I brushed it off. Today I cannot ignore the electrical/burning pain shooting down my inner thighs when I walk, and the soreness in my outer thighs.\n\nI am highly considering going to the hospital (ER) tonight. I started thinking (symmetrical sudden onset nerve pain? After the Flu? It is getting worse?) it could be Guillain-Barre. \n\nShould I go to the hospital tonight and start running tests? Symptoms have been going on for about 4 days. Or can I wait til Friday to mention it to a much cheaper doctor? Would I stop breathing overnight? I do not have any numbness. I know the internet says \u201cit takes a few weeks to plateau\u201d but. In your experience, can I wait 2 days, or should I take on the hospital bills uninsured? My other concern is that it is too early for the spinal tap to register any high protein levels... and wasting money on one. \n\nIf you read this, thank you so much. I have not gotten much of anything from the internet. It is just a very scary time right now, and I know there are other things it could be, it just came on so fast and aggressive I feel so overwhelmed and alone. I would go to the ER. It can impact your breathing. Especially if you live alone or do not have someone with you. Family member was recently diagnosed, i would say apply for emergency medi cal and run those tests, the earlier you get the diagnosis the better you will be off. Good Luck! My airways closed and I almost died, and I was already in the hospital when it happened. I woke up on a ventilator.. not fun. Do not wait. I have insurance and I am looking at $30k out of pocket. That is the cost of getting sick in the US. Fuck off your medical bills and vote for Bernie. You need to go to the nearest ER and do not worry about insurance. Hospitals all have charity programs and usually Medicaid will cover retroactivity. Your health is more important than money. Please get some tests done and stay strong. I was uninsured when I had surgery that triggered GBS and to this day, I am not financially responsible for a penny of the exams or procedures. ^seriously this Hopefully you already went in.  GBS can kill you, Full Stop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn general, the sooner it is dealt with the better off you are long term.  It has the possibility to happen aggressively as well.  In my personal case with the Miller Fisher variant I went from pins and needles in my arms and feet on a Saturday to unable to get out of a bed by Monday. Medicaid! I did not have insurance either (I had just  turned 26 and taken off my parents\u2019). They will cover everything, including bills 2 months prior to you signing up for it. Talk to your doctor in the hospital and they can expedite the request", "Can you have pure sensory symptoms months before developing classical motor symptoms in CIDP? I (19M) had a strange relapsing-remitting sensory polyneuropathy for 8 months. At month 9, my arms and legs began to accumulate numbness and weakness, and last week, I had a sudden Guillain Barre-like attack where, after I woke up, all four of my limbs were weak, and eventually they became so weak that I could not stand. This lasted for about 18 hours, after which I had regained the ability to walk. But I still have sensory and motor deficits in my arms and legs that fluctuate over time. My limbs feel weak or altered in sensation all the time now, and seem to gradually be getting worse.\n\nMy neurologist does not think it is CIDP because of how fast the attack on my arms and legs progressed and resolved, but also admits that he has no explanation for how the attack happened. He also thinks the transition to having numbness and motor symptoms after 8 months of positive sensory symptoms does not make sense.\n\nWhat do you all with CIDP think? Have you had anything like this?", "Very scared that I might have GBS, please help! So as the title says, I think i might have GBS.\n\nFor lunch today, i intended time have a chicken drumstick, but i accidentally ate it undercooked. Ever since then my legs and feet have had a slight tingling sensation and my breathing has been different. I read you that GBS can come from undercooked chicken.\n\nI thought it was the beginning stages of a panic attack, which eventually lead me into actually having a panic attack, but now the symptoms are still here. I am scared that I will wake up tomorrow and that i will be paralysed and will not be able to breathe.\n\nI am very scared, please help, I do not know what to do. If you are that worried please see a doctor. GBS is not a condition that is easily diagnosed. Significant testing needs to happen. \n\nSee your doctor and, if needed, consult a neurologist. I wish you the best. GBS is caused by an infection. You absolutely do not get it within minutes to hours of eating bad food. You did not get GBS from your chicken, I guarantee. Your symptoms are consistent with anxiety. When I got GBS it was from a nasty flu I got or it was from a tick bite (on one knows for sure) and it took around 2 weeks for it to fully enter my system and attack. It happens very gradually usually. My first symptoms of it did not happen until a week in and I was so tired i that I could not walk or sit up and I slept all day then after that then my numbness kicked in and my breathing was weak. I also could not eat and I would immediately throw up any food I tried to eat and I could not swallow. I kept spitting up any sputum that came up into a bucket because I could not swallow it. Just keep an eye on it and if things get really worrisome please go get a test for it and do not wait as long as I did. GBS does not work quite like that. It is a slow onset that starts unilateral in your body and eventually can affect the respiratory system. Mine started about a few days after an ear infection. It started slowly in my fingers and toes then eventually my motor skills and balance were affected. It took about 5 days in totally before I was unable to move and was in hospital. It did affect my swallowing but it never did my breathing. It also was exhausting and my muscles were incredibly sore. It sort of creeps up from the outside inwards. I would think maybe undercooked chicken would have more of a salmonella poisoning situation . Either way if it continues or get worse go to the doctor. GBS is triggered by the body's immune system attacking the nervous system. It is like a short circuit of the immune system attacking you rather than the virus . I have not heard of raw chicken doing that exactly but I suppose anything is possible. It dies not seem like gbs. Eso right after eating. Usually it follows another infection. It dies present with tingling and shortness of breath. But anxiety can produce the same symptoms with panic too. It would be obviously  worse by now. But if you are anxious you can go to ER or urgicare to be checked. If you are alone can you stay with someone to feel safer. \n\nTry breathing in a plastic or paper bag if the anxiety or tingling. Typically you will hyperventilate and rebreathing will slow down your release iv C02 and block the tingling effect. \n\nHave a line to someone till you know but you should be fine.  Sorry somehow commented on the wrong thing. A glitch in the Matrix just happened. Ear infection for me", "Do not ignore symptoms because you are afraid I have a really bad anxiety disorder and the symptoms just appeared one day about a week or so after a serious respiratory infection. I was in excruciating pain even when swallowing. \nThen a few days after it went away I noticed my hand was weak. I could not put my hair up. I decided to ignore it. Big mistake. \n\nMaybe you are like me and pretend the symptoms do not exist and just ignore your body yelling out for help. I have a huge fear of hospitals and not being able to leave them because my mom had 2 back surgeries 2nd one botched. I also was in a psych ward as a teen 3 times, so seeing the firemen is a trigger fOr me.  My mmmwas in the hospital for half of my 7th grade year, so I developed this fear of being trapped in the hospital. And she was so drugged up. It was a traumatic experience.\n\nSorry to go off there, but please do not ignore serious symptoms. They will not go away, they will only get worse. I woke up one day and I could not walk up the 3 stairs to our back door. I was crying and my mom got annoyed because nothing was helping. \n\nThe day I went to the hospital for the final time I was sitting on the living room couch. It would take me rocking back and forth to get the right momentum to get up ( and I would be sweating by the time I \u201cgot up\u201d). \nI have only told my husband and my mom what happened next. \n\nI had to pee extremely bad but I was afraid I would get stuck on the toilet ( right then I should have known to call 911). \nI did not want to just go so in my darkest moment I had to use a cup. \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude29 because I literally was losing all functionality. \n\nAfter that I rocked back and forth and managed to stand. I thought I must be getting better because I could walk around the house. \nNot even close. I walked ( not even close to how I normally walk, I could not lift my thighs too high so I was taking literal baby steps) to my room and lost balance and grabbed the only thing I could see. My poor little guinea pig\u2019s cage. Do not worry I did not pull her down. \n\nNow I would literally fallen and could not get up. ( THAT IS LITERALLY WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH MY MIND. THAT COMMERCIAL \u201cI have fallen and I cannot get up!\u201d) it is not funny at all. It is terrifying. But that is what was literally going through my head. \nI still refused to call 911. I had no idea my life was on the line. \nI called my mom who called my little bro. He is like 6 inches taller than me so we were sure he would be able to get me up. No go. And that plan was not well thought out anyway. I would just continue to ignore my symptoms until something horrible happened. I have heard gbs can mess with your heart. I have long qt syndrome from a medication interaction so I could have died at home. \n\nI know I am not the only one with hospital and doctor anxiety, so I want to help others like me avoid getting help at the last minute. That sounds terrifying. It is so scary to watch all you strength just disappear. I am glad you were able to beat your fears and get to the hospital. Thank you for sharing, I hope you are coping ok now :) Hope you are doing better now!!\n\nI also suffer from anxiety and that is exactly what the doctors and my family thought GBS was at first. I had numbness/tingling in my hands and feet and I had to concentrate to walk at first. I decided to go to the doctor and have my husband drive. I was going to bring my baby in with me but I could not lift her car seat. The doctor had me do a walking test and I could do it, but I had to really try hard. He diagnosed me with depression and told me to take a vacation sans kids. Well I should have insisted something was wrong, because I knew in my gut that I was not ok. But the truth is that I was TERRIFIED and I wanted to believe the doctor telling me I was fine. So I went home and got worse and worse. My mom thought I had the flu and told me that this Illness had really taken my spirit... basically told me to get a grip lol. I wanted to go to the hospital but both my husband and mom thought I just needed rest (not blaming them, it is what the doctor said). But I continued to get worse. Finally went to the hospital when I almost could not walk and could not lift a glass of water :/ i knew I had to go there, by heart was beating out of my chest and I was so scared. I will try to always follow my gut in the future, and insist on a second opinion when I know something is not right with me or a loved one. Thank you and yes I did beat fears. It is scary to have all your strength disappear in such a short amount of time. The first time I could not get off the couch I started crying and called 911. The EMTs were snotty and asking why I was crying ! I am like because I cannot get up. It was literally 2 days before I went for the final time. The doctor just had me walk around the nurse\u2019s station and gave me robaxin. The second time I called 911 the EMTs had to carry me out on something. It was not a regular stretcher. They acted like I just wanted painkillers or something but after I was admitted the nurses and doctors were very nice. Thank you, I hope you are better as well! I understand having a doctor think it is in your head. I did a walking test too and when I was sent home I just decided it would go away ( the weakness) and that I was making a big deal out of nothing. I totally understand where you are coming from. The anxiety I had made me ignore my symptoms as they got worse. I am glad you got the help you needed and I hope you are back to 100% now. I am back to being how I was before. I did have to use a walker for awhile which I hated because people would stare at me. I was in my twenties so that also made me feel uncomfortable using a walker. But now I know if you need to use one to get around use it. And I know never to ignore dangerous symptoms again. I cannot believe your doctor was just like mine when I first went in and basically told me I was fine. Thank you for this open and honest account! I hope others see this and are helped!\n\nTo Americans: public ERs are mandated to treat life threatening conditions, regardless of whether you can pay or not. Please seek help if you suspect you have GBS, as your condition can deteriorate and threaten your heart, lungs, etc. Many hospitals have associated programs to help mitigate or fully pay costs for those who cannot, and there are programs out there to help.\n\n Unfortunately with going to the ER with gbs can be quite an ordeal. I have read other accounts of people being sent home like me. Yeah it can definitely be a problem. My advice is look for a hospital with a strong neurology department, as they are more knowledgeable about GBS and CIDP.", "Looking for advice Hey everyone 28/f here. I was diagnosed a month ago, but have been showing symptoms for a few months. I am very stubborn and did my best to ignore them/blame other causes. It was mostly contained in my legs but I also have a lot of numbness in my torso area. I finally went to the hospital and was diagnosed and had 3 ivig treatments before relocating to a rehab to work on my walking. I have been home for almost a week and a half now, but the numbness in my legs is getting worse and I am starting to feel numbness in my arms. Is this normal after ivig? Should I go back to the hospital? Has anyone experienced this before? Any advice would be amazing. I feel like I am completely stumbling around in the dark here. Thanks in advance! It can be frustrating...I was diagnosed in May with GB with the same sysmptoms went home and it occured again. Needed Plasma Exchange and then diagnosed with CIDP. The chronic version of GB. I am on monthly infusions of IVIG at home and am almost completely back to normal. Get ahold of your Neuro and see what he/she thinks. Thank you so much! I do not currently have one as I left California to move back home to Oklahoma to be with family to help aid me, but I do have some family who work with neuros so I will have them see what they think is best. I was diagnosed with GBS in March 2013 and I needed 10 rounds of IVIG. The standard is 5 rounds, but if you have a variant or are not responsive after the initial five rounds then they add another five. It seems to me like 3 rounds was not sufficient for you. Can you try to go back to inpatient for further treatment? I was wondering why they only gave me 3. I am heading back in tonight to see if they want to give me more treatments. I definitely think it is needed. Thank you for sharing! My whole family and I are still trying to figure all this out and it is been a very difficult ride. You are welcome. Definitely tell them that you are not improving and the numbness is the same or worse. I am not sure why they only gave you three rounds except maybe they are not too familiar with this condition. Were you seen by neurologists? There is also an alternative treatment for GBS called plasma pharesis. I did not receive that and it is not usually combined with IVIG, but it can help some people. Feel free to dm me if you would like to. Stay strong. I was diagnosed 5 months ago.  The worst 2 weeks of the entire ordeal for me was the 2 weeks **AFTER** the IVIG. Things get worse before they get better unfortunately.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just posted about my experience so far with GBS, it touches on a few points from your post if you want to check it out!\n\n ( \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll the best", "Is there any supplement to rebuild the Myelin sheath and reverse effects of GBS? How is everyone doing? I was wanting to know if anyone can recommend any supplement or remedy to rebuild the destroyed sheath caused by GBS? Or anything that can be of use to bring me back to normal state again? \n\nThank you! From what I have read it sounds like cholesterol and vitamin B-12 are both important building blocks for myelin Omega 3s, 6s, and 9s are the best to rebuild your myelin sheath. Any sort of fatty acid. \n\nIt is not about GBS, but the book \u201cThe Talent Code\u201d by Daniel Coyle gives a good overview how fatty acids contribute to myelin sheath growth and help with \u201cmuscle memory.\u201d\n\nI hope that helps and I wish you the best of luck on your recovery! Im actually shocked to see someone post about this.  I have CIDP(Chronic Inflammatory Demylienating Polyneuropathy). Its the chronic form of GBS. While GBS is an acute disease, CIDP is a lifelong disease. Im constantly in and out of physical therapy. I have relatively no feeling in my hands and legs yet muscle memory has worked for me. I recieve 100 grams of of octagam, which is a plasma infusion also known as IVIG every other Tuesday. If my neurologist finds that it is ineffective, next step is plasmapheresis, which in a sense is a form of dialysis, and if worst comes to worst, then I start Rituxin. Rituxan is essentially a form of chemo, which i am trying to stay far away from. Im not allowed to get vaccinations, and I know that at some point this disease is going to be the death of me, and I am okay with that. You are lucky that it did not progress past GBS. I have so many days where I am completely indisposed, unable to get out of bed. Regardless of the fact, I still live every day as positively as I can and refuse to complain because that shit gets you nowhere. Hey StaceFace, I too suffer from CIDP if you want to talk about it go ahead send me a DM! This goes for everyone on this subreddit, if its about ur illness, depression or anything else my DMs are always open!!! I am very sorry to hear it progressed to CIDP. I hope things turn out for the better for you. I am just trying to find means in bettering the condition I am in, not complaining. I am still having a lot of trouble with my legs and I try to stay as positive as I can too. Sending you lots of love for a healthy you! You seem to have a good doctor, hope you dont mind me sending you DM to know more about the doc who could help with my mom's GBS condition. Rituxan saved me from my CIDP. I had a strictly motor variant, a rapidly relapsing variant, and a treatment refractory variant all in one. Rituximab is not anywhere near a chemotherapy, it is usually given along with a chemo drug. No side effects for me and most people. I was not responding to IVIG anymore, steroids did not work, and plasmapheresis did not work either. I was unable to walk or stand for more than 3 seconds. After months of failed treatments (IVIGS, PLEX, Steroids), they finally decided to pull the trigger on Rituximab. About two months after the first infusion I started noticing results. IVIG was working again, and my immune system was calming down. And after probably a couple more months, I was back to my usual self. I still get IVIG every 3 weeks, and Rituximab every 6 months. I know our cases are different, but you should definitely look into it. The sooner it starts the better. Hope you find a good treatment. Rituximab is not commonly used for CIDP, but there is been many studies published recently in its use for a lot of autoimmune diseases, and how it is surprisingly effective. Lion's Mane mushroom is know to increase nerve growth factor and encourage myelination. This post goes in depth on the subject and explains the best way to get the benefits from the mushroom, which is by alcohol extraction. There is a TLDR at the bottom. Oriveda seems like the best brand to get and they are on Amazon. I have not taken this specific product myself but I thought I would share what I know.\n\n This is excellent information to hear! Thank you for relaying your own experience as it has answered some questions I had about it.\n\nAlso, anyone who wants to DM me,  can. Q", "Sister recently diagnosed with GBS My big sister (26) was diagnosed with GBS last week and is currently still in the hospital. For those of you who have had GBS (or who currently have it) what do you wish people had done for you? What are things that people did to help (or just in general) that you liked/did not like? I know my sister has a long road ahead of her and I would like to support her in any way I can. I have been giving her lots of massages and helping her stretch which she really enjoys but would also like to know what other people liked. Just show up and be there. Let her know she does not have to entertain you. Bring a favorite blanket or one that is more comfortable than the hospital ones. Maybe some food she enjoys, or like an iced latte or something \"normal\".\n\nAnything normal is really good. On a practical level, I appreciated having lip balm, warm socks and my phone charged regularly. But just being there is really helpful, especially when it comes to talking with medical staff and being your sister's advocate.\n\nThe following suggestions may not apply to your sister because my case was fairly severe, but here goes.\n\nFor a while, I could not open my eyes or speak. Having family and friends talk to me, tell me stories or just have a conversation around me was comforting. I got my Dad to read the paper and my Mom recount her favourite soap opera. \n\nFortunately, I could use my phone and had it turned on to accessibility mode for the blind. That helped me keep some level of independence as I learned to text while blind and listen to podcasts and audiobooks. Home cooked meal if the doctors allow it. Hospital food gets old real quick Agreed.  I really enjoyed just having people being present, carrying on full conversations amongst themselves or whoever else was in the room.  It did not feel awkward at all.  \n\nEven though I was not able to join the conversation, it brought social comforts to know familiar voices and faces were there.  It was actually more tiring if they tried to converse with me. Going to repeat the others here. The biggest thing for me was having people visit me. \n\nI can add a suggestion for do not do. A friend dropped a book off to me as I sat in the hospital wondering how things were going with two month old son.  Do not give this book. :) I occasionally still rib my friend over that choice of his. I know exactly what you mean. I wore myself out the first couple of days I was off the ventilator because I was trying to engage with family coming to visit. My grandma eventually told me \"you do not need to entertain us, just relax\" and that was SO helpful. I felt like everyone was there to see ME so I HAD to engage, being released from that \"obligation\" made it a lot easier for me. Home cooked food is definitely a good one! My mom has a friend who has cooked  my sister dinner and brought food a couple times. Thank you! I have brought her her favorite pillow and blanket from home as well as a few other goodies :) I am in college so sometimes I just stop by and do homework in her room. Luckily she can talk for now. But this way if she wants to talk she can and if not she does not have to worry about making sure I have something to do. Fortunately (or unfortunately depending on who you are) my sister has the opposite problem, she cannot close her eyes by herself so we have to constantly flush her eyes out with eye drops. Her and I have the same glasses prescription, it is very minor (so she never got it filled) but can make a big difference, so I went and bought her glasses and have been letting her borrow mine until hers are made.\nAlso my mom and I have been guard dogs when it comes to the medical staff. Most of them are good but occasionally the nurses need a reminder to be more gentle. I really enjoy that book but I could see how it might not be someone is first choice when they are in the hospital. That is eerily similar. \nI had the Miller Fisher variant that completely paralysed my face. Initially I could not open my eyes, but later I could not close my eyes, so I have some sympathy for your sister. \nIf she would (or your family) like to ask questions or commiserate, pm me. I am a year or from the event but still recovering. A weighted blanket feels great", "Undiagnosed. Have symptoms similar to GBS 6 years ago. still have symptoms. 6 years ago i had a very bad episode, where symptoms were very similar to an episode of GBS. basically a few month period where I could barely walk, numbness in hands and feet, hard to swallow, blurry vision, incredible fatigue and weakness, etc etc. I was basically tossed around doctors with no result until one treated me for chronic lyme disease. (which i found out was basically bs.) My symtpoms recovered. however ever since Ive struggled with numbness, weakness, and fatigue. sometimes, i get bad episodes over the course of a few weeks. its just and issue ive never been able to get to the bottom of. I need to probably see a nuerologist, endo, ect, but has anyone had experience similar to this/ advice? thanks. Sounds like CIDP. Could still be Lyme disease but they have tests. See a neurologist ASAP is my recommendation. any idea what it means ti have cidp like this long term? its effects on health? especially when it is alot of the time in remission? CIDP is AIDP but chronic. It can be managed well with regular IVIG treatments, which usually take around 2 hours 3x-4x a month. \n\nThat being said, it could just be GBS or AIDP and you are having a relapse. I am not a doctor so do not take my word as law.\n\nYou definitely need to see a neurologist ASAP. You need a spinal tap, blood tests, ECG, everything tested. Right now it could just be tingling/numbness/exhaustion but can quickly turn to paralysis. I appreciate your help. It is tough, because these mini relapses tend to get better, and I am not sure if going to treatment when I am well will do anything. But since I am in a rough place I will get checked out for sure. It seems people with cidp will eventually end up paralysed if not treated. Is what I am experiencing not really a thing for cidp patients? Honestly I do not know :/. I am technically undiagnosed but my neurologist treats it like AIDP/Miller Fisher so that is my area of experience. I only know what is it is like with the acute version not chronic. \n\nI am sorry for not being more help :/", "Do Not Get Vaccinated if You Have This Syndrome, Says Dr.Fauci.  I feel like I am damned if I do, damned if I do not. \n\nI had GBS 20 years ago and have fully recovered. My GBS was not triggered from a vaccine and lasted around 6 months. I really want to get this vaccine, so I feel a bit disheartened. \n\nWhat is the consensus? Do you plan on opting out of the vaccine? I have not spoken with a doctor about it. My wife has CIDP. We have been told that it is not likely she will be able to get the vaccine until more information is known. Our plan is to make she everyone around her is vaccinated. It really sucks because she has to go into the hospital to get her IVIG treatments (thanks Medicare!) rather than have home infusions which exposes her to a high risk environment. I work in a high school, so I feel that constantly puts me at risk. I also do not trust everyone around me to get vaccinated, so I feel that I will never be protected. I do not want to be isolated and have to wear a mask for eternity. I think being vaccinated seem like less of a risk than having Covid. It is frustrating. I just wanted to thank you for posting this.  It is been on my mind a lot lately.  It is good to know what the experts recommend. I could be wrong, but: If I get the vaccine: it could trigger a reaction again. If I do not get the vaccine: I could get the COVID and that could trigger a reaction, so I would have GBS and COVID at the same time. That is exactly how I feel about the situation. Can they deny the vaccine to me, even if I am willing to risk it? No, they cannot. You will be at your own risk. I would only take it if I knew the hospital has the resources to treat me, as I had a severe reaction and needed ICU for one month. If you plan on getting the vaccine but do not absolutely need to get it right away I would recommend waiting.\n\nHospital ICUs have been struggling with the influx of Covid patients which makes it harder to treat the people who end up needing the ICU for non-Covid reasons. Pay attention to your local hospitals and whether their ICUs are at max capacity. If they are it is probably a good idea to hold off on getting the vaccine for a bit if you can. The last thing you want to have happen is to get the vaccine and end up developing GBS but not be able to receive treatment because the ICU is full. ICUs are currently going through this right now throughout the US. Make sure you will be able to receive the appropriate treatment and attention and will not be adding to the chaos unnecessarily.\n\nAlso, Covid patients have required ventilators. Both times I had GBS I required a ventilator. If I did not have one available I would most certainly die. I do not want to put myself in a situation where I get GBS and then there are not enough ventilators to go around. Early in the pandemic ventilators were on short supply because the majority were being used... I do not know if this is the case now but it is something that should be considered.\n\nI will not be getting the vaccine. I have had GBS twice in my life and am not willing to risk it. For some people it may be necessary due to their line of work and the amount of exposure they have to other people. They either have a high risk for contracting Covid and then developing GBS or they can get the vaccine that can potentially cause GBS. Hard decision.\n\nHope everyone stays safe and healthy out there. If you have questions about whether or not you should get the vaccine, you should speak with your neurologist. They know you, your symptoms, you medical history the best and will be able to guide you in making the best decision for yourself. If anyone wants to view the clip where he talks about GBS, it is about 10 minutes in. I am not entirely sure if he is just referring to people who contracted it directly from the flu / flu shot. For context, he answered this after the interviewer asked him five questions at the same time. I am hesitant to say this is definitive since the documentation for the COVID vaccine as far as I am aware has no warnings to people who had GBS. From what I understand GBS people were discluded from the first trial but not the consequent trials. I am guessing there is probably just not enough data yet on our subpop to tell us much.\n\n We are in a really tough situation. Our best bet is going to watch on the sidelines for another year or so wearing masks and treating everyone like kryptonite. \n\nThe chance of GBS reoccurrence is roughly 3%. The chance of COVID killing you is roughly 2%. The chances of contracting COVID currently depend on localized infection rates and is going to be very hard to quantify. It was 1 in 40 people who were actively contagious about  2 weeks ago, that will not last forever, but it also is not going away anytime soon. \n\nThis is like a bizarre game of roulette, where we are not only at the mercy of %s with the vaccine, we are at the mercy of a huge portion of the population who think all of this is 'fake' or whatever. \n\nI really do not want to spend another 6 years rehabbing to where I can function again. Next fall I will decide whether the data we get is worth rolling the dice and taking the vaccine. I am however leaning to the 'yes' camp as of today. On December 15th the  GBS/CIDP Foundation posted ( saying there is been no link between COVID and GBS and no link observed in the vaccine. \n\nPart of the statement states \u201cCOVID vaccine is nothing like flu vaccine. COVID does not cause GBS in any significant number if at all and there is no reason to suspect the vaccine would cause it.\u201d\n\nThe foundation also states the following as a reminder to us: \u201cThe COVID-19 situation changes daily and we will continue to share updates that are vetted by the experts in GBS. In addition, we are in regular contact with the FDA representing the patient voice in the top-level decision-making. We understand that there are many opinions creating confusion so please consider the source of your information before drawing conclusions.  As always, all decisions should be made with your personal physician based on your own health.\u201d\n\nWhen you have an opportunity to get the vaccine look to the foundation, the FDA, and most importantly your doctor to help guide your decision. GBS/CIDP varies widely from person to person and so does how we acquired it, one person may be advised not to, while another is not. I have an appointment in January with a neurologist specifically about this as my GP does not know, till someone tells me there is no chance of my GBS being reactivated from a Covid vaccine, I am not getting it. It took me several years of physio and a ridiculous amount of money (even with universal healthcare) to learn how to walk and function again after being diagnosed. I would rather move to the middle of nowhere and not get it than get it with the chance of reactivating that hell. That is what I was thinking too. Then could have covid pneumonia plus GBS breathing problems? No thank you. \n\nI was hospitalized for pneumonia last year, and ended up catching the flu from my hospital stay (was not vaccinated because of GBS)... so now I want to get all the vaccines (flu, pneumonia &amp; covid)!!! That is a very good point about the ICUs. Hopefully we will start to see the numbers start to fall as soon as enough people are vaccinated... but I guess that could be several months away.\n\nHow did you get GBS the second time if you do not mind me asking? I would love to see some research about if people who have recurrences are triggered by the same thing or not. It gives me a lot of anxiety to think about a relapse. This is my take.  Talk to your Dr, make the call you feel right with after their input.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are not enough of us to sample and test for an interaction anytime soon here.  Get info, make your best choice, and move on with how fate shakes out. This is my take as well.  That said, I upvoted every response here because there are no wrong opinions here.  There have already been multiple cases of GBS triggered from covid (the virus, not the vaccine).  The vaccine has not shown a link yet, but these are rare events and the number of vaccines are far less than the number of covid cases so far.\n\nAnother thing to remember is that there are multiple vaccines using a variety of different techniques.  Personally, I think I will get the vaccine when it is offered. Note, there is a shorter clip from the News 12 Youtube account:\n\n(\n\nWhile you correctly note that there is not enough data, the likelihood is that there never will be enough data for a conclusive answer, given how rare GBS is. thanks for posting this, and while this is not unexpected, it sure is depressing Agreed. I will feel a lot safer when the numbers fall even if Covid is not completely gone. My main concern is getting GBS and not receiving the appropriate care because the hospitals are overwhelmed.\n\nAnd sure, I do not mind at all, I had an upper respiratory virus the week prior and that is what the doctors think triggered it. The first one was also after an upper respiratory virus. I think that kind of research would be very valuable for sure. Have you had it multiple times?", "Discussion Topic: Managing effects One big goal of this subreddit is to collect experiences - GBS varies so widely and is rare enough that it can be hard for people to know if what they are experiencing is normal or even part of GBS.\n\nEach month, we will put up a new topic to help spark discussion and create a future repository of experiences.\n\nThis month's topic is existing effects and how to manage them. How have you felt lately? What effects have robotics have on your body? How have they helped change your outlook? Background: I was diagnosed with severe GBS/Miller Fisher syndrome in 2018, resulting in facial and body paralysis. It took 10 weeks to get the tracheotomy and feeding tube out, and for me to start walking again. \n\nToday: I would consider myself 80-90% recovered. I can walk independently. My face is slowest to recover and I cannot close my mouth yet which affects my ability to enunciate (no radio jobs for me) or eat politely. My sense of touch is still off, but all I all, I am really lucky. \n\nOutlook: I appreciate food and water so much more. Being denied the basic pleasures of eating and drinking lest I aspirate was annoying at best, but it also messed with my sense of time when I no longer had meals to punctuate my day. Also, pur\u00e9ed spaghetti was tasty but thickened water- bleurgh!\n\nUnintended benefit of GBS is I have stopped biting my nails due to jaw weakness and muted sense of touch. I have also  returned to my pre-pregnancy weight because I am more selective in my food choices due to my weaker facial muscles (that affects my ability to chew and swallow). \n\nBottom line, some days are better than others. I have to remind myself how much I have come and what I have achieved to keep myself from focusing on what I do not have. \n I had full facial paralysis, loss of ability to stand or walk and my hands were not paralyzed, but were stone dead numb. I luckily caught it extremely early and seven plasmapharesis treatments later, a month in the hospital and two weeks learning to stand and walk again in rehab and my side effects now, seven months later are the following:  \n\n\nI still walk with a cane, and slowly, at that.\n\nMy nose is still numb to the tuoch but I have luckily regained most of my facial movement. \n\nMy eyes are damaged from becoming dry so frequently when my face was paralyzed but I am told that should take care of itself. I use Systane artificial tears \\*multiple\\* times daily to try and keep them lubricated.\n\nWorst part is I have ongoing neuropathy that is beyond brutal. Feet feel like a combination of being on fire, like someone has taken a cheese grater to the tops and bottoms, and like I am randomly stabbed in my legs, tips of my toes and arch of my foot by razor sharp needles. I also cannot do things like throw a leg up on the bed now because if I hit a nerve on the front of my shin, it will totally kick my ass with a wave of pain the likes of which I could not previously imagine. My neuro said the nerve stuff was good because it meant my peripheral nerves were regenerating but it is a SLOW process and if I am not militant on taking my gabapentin and tramadol, I will be miserable within 20 minutes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I am not sure if this is the facial paralysis or what but things have tasted different for me ever since I recovered, too.  Anyone have that issue?  \n\n\nThanks for reading and let us know what your side effects are post-GBS! I have the exact same thing. I am giving myself B 12 shots every day, and that helps more than anything. The aspirations were terrible. I remember coughing for weeks before I got diagnosed. When I am under stress my lungs still hurt. Does your face also hurt now that it is healing? I got GBS/MFS 4 years ago as a 49/male. You must be younger, since you refer to pregnancy weight. I feel for you. When you lose your face as a man - who cares, but as a woman it must be horrible. Keep your chin up! Thanks for your kind words!\n\nFortunately, nerve pain left around week 6, so it is only muted sensations that I have to deal with. But I am currently doing a lot of speech therapy so my face muscles hurt from that. \n\nYou are right in that I am younger; in my thirties. \n\nHow is your recovery coming along? Does your face still hurt after 4 years? Yes, the face still hurts. I can trace the nerves on my face by the sensation. Mobility on my left face side is ok, but on the right side I am behind. I can speak almost normal, but when I eat it is always messy. :) My lips do not do what they are supposed to. Your recovery will be much quicker than mine, because you are so young. The worst aspect of my condition ist that it changed my personality. I do not care about many things the way I did before. And at the moment I cannot exercise. I cannot explain why, I just cannot.  You will be fine. But try to get B12 shots daily. I got mine from a website. That is the one medication that helps. You cannot overdose it. Ping me any time you are struggling. It sucks, but it is not cancer. :) Background: I probably had the AMAN version of GBS in 2016 (first symptoms -&gt; total paralysis &amp; ICU in about 36hrs). I spent a month in ICU + 5 months in the hospital for rehab.\n\nToday: I am pretty much as recovered as I am ever going to be. I can walk indepently, although both my legs are a lot weaker than it used to be (cannot squat &amp; get up), the left one being the weaker one. My fingers work pretty well, but I cannot bend my thumbs. My left shoulder's out of order, and the shoulder muscles have pretty much atrophied into oblivion, so I cannot lift my left arm. However, I have recovered better than I ever imagined I would be able to. Currently I am on early retirement because of disability (I am 37), and life's good. IMO the most annoying and restricting thing GBS \"gave\" me is fatigue. I am extremely tired after a short walk / being somewhere noisy / in cold temperatures / when it is hot / when I strain my brain too much (which is not much at all). Currently I am trying to battle against the fatigue by slowly increasing the strain to my brain. Do you guys have fatigue as well? If you do, how do you cope with that? Sorry for the late reply, but you may be interested in the new discussion topic: GBS and pregnancy! The internet has so little info on this, so your experience - pre or post or during - would be really helpful!\n\nAlso, hang in there, it does improve. I am 30 years out and it is way better than it was 20 or 10 years ago. It is a very slow process. How are you doing now? Even two months can be huge progress seven months out! I hope you are doing well! Do not give up on improvement. I had GBS 30 years ago and I am still seeing improvement. Take things slow and steady and gradually rebuild. Fuck extreme temperatures though, I agree :p Still have peripheral neuropathy. Hypersensitivity in feet. Get tired real easy. If I do not take gabapentin every time I am supposed to the nerve pain in my legs and feet is beyond brutal. Still have tachycardia from it too but I keep it under control with metropolol. Still do not feel super strong but things ARE way easier than they were. That is awesome to hear - progress is great! It will keep getting better, it is just a long slog.", "Can I have another episode? This summer I got GBS, which turned out in not moving from neck to toes and one month in the ICU because of the demyelination (if that word exists). \n\nMy concern is if that could happen again. If I could have my body paralyzed again. If anyone went through it more than once. \n\nThanks in advance. Hi, I am sorry to hear about you experience. I hope you are doing much better now and are well on your way to your \"new normal\"!\n\nThis was a major concern I had after being hospitalized. I would definitely recommend that you speak with your neurologist about your concerns, because they will be able to give you better information than me. I have had IVIG 2x since leaving the hospital (and am fighting with my insurance for a 3rd round of it currently) because of weakness/tingling, but personally I have never experienced a relapse as severe as the first episode.\n\nMy neuro told be that getting GBS again would be like \"winning the lotto twice\". It could happen, but not very likely.\n\nI can tell you that one of the most helpful things in getting over this worry/anxiety, besides discussing it with my neurologist, was actually going to a counselor who specializes in traumatic medical events. My neuro suggested it to me and I thought it would be a waste of my time and the counselors time, because in my mind it was not really \"traumatic\". However, going to counseling helped me realize that it was absolutely a traumatic event, and helped me work through the anxiety I had and other feelings I was not really able to deal with because I was focused on getting better. I know that is not everyone is thing, and some folks have had poor experiences with counseling/therapy, but I really cannot recommend it enough. Hi, I hope you are on the mend.  I just wanted to tell you I have had 4 major episodes and many smaller episodes over the last 15 years. I have been diagnosed with CIDP for over 12 years. I would say I am an extreme case though.  I met the ventilator 3 times and learned to walk twice.  Keep your head up, you can get through. Thank you for this comment. I have similarly tried brushing off my &gt;3weeks in the hospital early this fall (paralyzed from the neck down + feeding tube during peak of covid) as \u201cnot a big deal\u201d - but this reminded me that...dude it was very traumatic! I think it is been easier for me to pretend/try to forget what happened to me than truly process it. \n\nFor OP: +1 to this comment. Thought my bout of GBS was very recent (sept/oct), I have fully recovered and doctors said that chances of recurrence are slim to none. I hope this provides some reassurance! Everyone is different but my neurologist says that fluctuations in symptoms afterwards are almost always a given but you are as likely to need hospitalisation as you were to get it in the first place. \n\nI left hospital just over 5 years ago. I reached my most recent peak of fitness about 2 years ago and have declined a little and stabilised since then.       \n\nI am very, very lucky as my bouts of pain are infrequent. But my feet are still numbish and I cannot run at all. It is so strange how differently it affects us all. I suffered with quite bad anxiety prior to my GBS (I was on anti-anxiety medication) but have come out the other side with that particular issue resolved for the time being.       \n\nBut - I did see a therapist anyway and I also highly recommend doing so.", "My Story of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome and a Cry for Help Hey there. This past year, I had what was the start of the worst experience I have ever experienced in my 26 years of life. One day, I started experiencing nausea and vomiting. I had what I thought was food poisoning. It became clear that this was not the case. The vomiting continued for three weeks. I was unable to eat or drink anything without vomiting. I also was unable to work. During this three week period, I had six emergency room visits, four visits with PCP or specialist, two CT scans, ultrasound, upper GI series, and an EGD. Doctors were unable to determine the cause of my vomiting and nausea. The vomiting eventually stopped and I started to recover.\n\nTowards the end of my stomach issues, I started experiencing a tingling feeling in my feet and legs. That tingling quickly turned to a sharp pins and needles pain. I then started experiencing weakness and I was having trouble balancing and walking. From there, I could not walk without my knees buckling. I started to experience a severe pain in my legs and feet. The pain was worse at night and I was having a difficult time sleeping. I soon lost the ability to walk and had to use a wheelchair. I started feeling the tingling in my hands and arms. Not long after that, my abdomen felt numb. Eventually, it was determined that I have Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), which is a disorder in which your body's immune system attacks your nerves and leads to paralysis.\n\nIt is not the most pleasant thing in the word. What is worst is it is really rare (fewer than 20,000 cases a year) and I have not had the fortune of being in an area where there are tons of experts. In fact, by the time I was diagnosed properly, it was said by the amazing neurologist that I finally found that I was just a couple of days away from the paralysis caused by GBS spreading into my diaphragm. I would not have been able to breathe and would be put on a ventilator. Something that unfortunately happens to many GBS patients.\n\nFast forward to present day and nearly a year since having IVIG treatment for GBS. I am now able to walk after being in intensive inpatient rehab for 3 weeks and having outpatient physical therapy 3 times a week for several months. The numbness and tingling has moved down my body and is now below my knees (GBS works from the toes up and as you recover, it works it is way down the body).\n\nHers my cry for help: I am in pain. I am in constant pain and discomfort. I take Gabapentin for nerve pain 4 times a day and it does not seem like enough. My feet are so sensitive that I can step on a crumb and it literally feels like I have stepped on several shards of broken glass. My toes are so sensitive that it hurts to even put tennis shoes on. I cannot go out and be out long without my legs feeling fatigued. I cannot squat or bend too low without severe pain. It has been rough and I do not know what to do. I am now living near Atlanta and I am hoping to find a neurologist that has extensive knowledge of GBS and can help me out. I do not know where to go from here. If anyone can help, I would appreciate it. 10 yrs + since I was toasted by GBS. I have permanent damage to my feet. From about the middle of my feet to my toes still has that \u201ctingling \u201c feeling.  Things I have learned. I got off Gabapentin. I went off of it to see feel the difference when I was on or off it. Not much difference at all, and it gave me crazy stupid dreams and wrecked my sleep so I quit it. Over the ten years I tried lots of stuff, pot, vitamins different prescriptions. Some helped for a while, some did not. The one thing that I swear by is a brand of flip flops called Cobain. They have one with a very thick cushion sole. It will wear to your walking balance level. I also cannot stand wearing shoes. You learn to adjust. I still have days when I am pissed off, days when I am glad to be alive.  Days when I would give fives years of my life not to feel pain first thing in the morning and last thing at night. But you go on. You will be explaining what GBS is forever. I cannot make your pain go away. Maybe knowing it does get less over the long run helps. Hang in there. I had GBS 20 years ago. I was only 20-years old. I was completely paralyzed for six months, but it never caused breathing issues. Luckily, I never ended up in ICU on a ventilator, \n\nI have absolutely no issues now. I walk 10 miles a day! \n\nI had both IVIG treatment (it failed, and my GBS relapsed) and Plasmapheresis. I had drop foot and had to wear a brace for probably 10 months. I have absolutely no residual issues. It was an incredibly hard and depressing time. I remember getting frustrated with my family and friends, my physical therapist, and the doctors and nurses. Especially, since the doctors could not tell me anything concrete about what to expect. All I can say is that it is possible to fully recover because I lived through it. Continue being patient with your body. I am 28 and was diagnosed in the fall of 2018. Nerves take a long time to heal. I am still recovering. It sounds like your doing everything you can\u2014such as reaching out to doctors and continuing to communicate your issues.\n\nFrom my own experience, outside of taking medication, here is what helps me: getting good sleep, eating healthy, and managing stress. When I can do all three of these things I truly feel my best. When they are all out of synch my nerve issues are at their worst. \n\nKeep reaching out for support and congrats and coming so far already. What others have said ITT yes you will tell your friends and people you meet for the rest of your life about GBS. One doctor told me to write a book. It really does get better, for what that is worth. Aside from terrible coordination and loosing things that are in my pockets GBS is not that bad to live with. Ultimately you will be a stronger person because of it :) I also found gabapentin did not make a huge difference, but for me GBS effected my autonomic nervous system, which was apparently a big cause of the pain - betablockers helped a lot because they helped the dysautonomia. Some other things that have helped are compression socks, Aleve (works way better than Advil, Tylenol, etc. and is the only thing I have ever used it for), heat packs, and magnesium supplements. Once I was healthy enough, I discovered that if I exercised at least every 3ish days, the pain was a lot more manageable (endorphins maybe?). \n\nIt is been 5 years since I got GBS - I still have chronic pain, but it is a lot more manageable than it used to be. It is a lot of trial and error. You got this! Have you tried naproxen? I took that along with gabapentin. \n\nAlso marijuana is worth a shot if you have not considered that. Thanks for the taking the time to put these words down, it is so we will written. And I hope you find some approaches you can work on. I I cannot offer input regarding the pain, my bout was 17 years ago and there was far less around to help at the time.\n\nBut I hear you with being remote from experts. This is niche enough that even identifying it as a possible diagnosis can take a while.\n\nLike others have said, time helps. It did for me. And I know that hearing that can seem unhelpful because we cannot make time go any faster. But you can do this.", "GBS and side effects in Canada Canada is quite forthcoming with weekly updates on everything, including GBS.  To date, they have had 48 cases of GBS that coincided with the vaccine.  They even break it down by vaccine type with AstraZeneca having the highest rate of .91 cases per 100,000 vaccines.  Strangely they say that this is higher than expected in the population, but I typically hear 1 or 2 cases per 100,000 in the general population.\n\nOf course there is no break down for those that have had GBS in the past, since we are rarities anyway.\n &gt;Strangely they say that this is higher than expected in the population, but I typically hear 1 or 2 cases per 100,000 in the general population.\n\nThe two numbers are not directly comparable without knowing the incidence interval. To compare, you need figures quoted with time units, eg. per 100,000 person-years.\n\nAcute autoimmune syndromes typically appear around 10-15 days after the vaccine dose (or infection), which coincides with B-cell germinal centre activity. The mechanism is likely B-cell cocapture of self-foreign antigens. It is known for example, that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has high binding affinity for certain gangliosides (and the same is true of other infectious diseases that are associated with GBS).\n\nIn epidemiological studies, when comparing to baseline levels they often restrict it to 6 weeks after the dose - but this interval may actually be too long, unless there are problems with prompt diagnosis and reporting, which can be a limitation of retrospective medical record based studies. (Which is a problem in real life - I personally know of GBS cases in Australia that were incorrectly diagnosed within a 6 week period). Found the doctor.  ;). Thanks for the great explanation! If possible seek out the mRNA vaccines. They have 0 reported cases. 1 in 200k was the norm a few years back. It does appear the AZ and J&amp;J pose a higher risk for people.. \n\n\n\nHowever, side effects vs medicine in general these vaccines are doing much better than others for different illnesses. Hi, I would just like to add that I was diagnosed with GBS as a result of the Pfizer vaccine. I am not in Canada, but I do not know if that really matters.\n\nI have been paying attention to the CDC's ( reporting, and as of the most recent report dated 7/16, there are 463 cases, 363 are from Pfizer or Moderna. It is happening with mRNA vaccines. Keep in mind that is an unofficial report. yea i was about to say, no way there are 0 cases. You are right on the statistics. Yes. People seem to be under the impression sometimes that VAERS is causal data, when it is actually suspected links. ", "GB and flu shots Hello, I just had a flu shot done and I am a little nervous. I had GB when I was 5 years old, I am 28 now  with only sensory loss (pain, heat, cold etc).\n\nSince I was young I never realised what to avoid medically as someone who has had GB in the past. I wanted to know your thoughts on getting flu shots or other vaccines after having GB. I bieleve I had one flu shot 8-9 years ago and was fine. Do not know if each flu shot is rolling the dice. I just saw my neuro 3 weeks ago and she said hard no on the flu shot. She said I should encourage anyone around me to get it because, in her words, \"herd immunity is a thing\", but it is unnecessarily risky for former GBS patients. My job does free flu shots and one of the questions is if you have had GBS in the past 6 months, but my neuro said I am better off skipping it.\n\nAll other vaccines are case-by-case. She said if I needed a tetanus shot, that is a no brainer, but anything else I should run past her first. No from my neuro as well. My Neuro said go for it.  I am on my 8th year of getting the flu shot this year, 9 years ago was my GBS fun.  I get a Doctor's sign off every year before I get it though.  Only thing that has ever happened for me is one of the nurses bitched me out for getting it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGet a primary care doctor, and follow their advice on these things, if it is an option, is my advice.  If did not have a Doctor to see regularly I would probably avoid the flu shots. Questionary I have seen in the past at my office just asked if you had ever had GBS.  When I queried the tech what happens if I say yes, she said they refuse to do the shot. Thank you for the replies. Seems like I should have skipped the flu shots until I have my doc confirm. I will keep this thread updated on my health incase anyone else stumbles across this. I attended the GBS/CIDP symposium in San Diego last year that featured the world's top neurologists in the world that specialize in GBS/CIDP and other diseases/syndromes like it and they all said that flu vaccines are not a threat to anyone that has had GBS in the past. Can you get GBS from a vaccine? Yes, but it is extremely rare. They pretty much said you have the same chance of getting GBS again as you did before. They all said to go ahead and get the shot if you want it. The latest research says that vaccines are safe post-GBS.  (\n\nI had GBS 30 years ago and avoided all vaccines on Doctors' orders until a few years ago.  It takes a long time to do research like this since it is hard to find enough of us (post-GBS) to do a meaningful study.  :) The 2016 flu shot in particular causes a lot of people to have GBS. The support group I go to is 75% folks who got GBS after getting the flu shot in 2016. Interesting - have you seen research making that connection? I got GBS in 2016 following a flu vaccine.\n\n( suggests some people do seem to get it from the vaccine though it is very rare (less than for the general population) and they do not note any particular spikes. I have not found any research. My neurologist said that normally she gets 1 GBS patient/month, so 12 per year. She said in 2016 she had 45 patients, mostly in the fall. The neurologist at the rehab hospital said the same thing, large spike in GBS patients in late 2016 stemming from the flu shot.\n\nGBS is rare, period. In my support group, I am the only person (of about 7) who did not get GBS following a vaccine/flu shot. Interesting. I also got it in the fall. I think the source of the original GBS is also factored in. Mine came after a flu shot, so my doctors have always told me to avoid them. I make sure my husband gets one, however, to help protect me from infection. Back in the 70s, there was a big spike in GBS from the swine flu vaccine, but that vaccine was pulled after GBS cases spiked.\n\n\n\nIf you believe a vaccine was linked to your GBS, there is a compensation fund you can appeal to.\n\n Right, I would read about the 1976 vaccine and was curious to know if there had been confirmation of another spike.\n\nThe vaccine injury program is really helpful. I try to tell people about it whenever it is relevant. I believe I was told medical professionals are barred from telling patients about it though I am not sure exactly why. The latest spike in cases I recall reading about was the Zika virus (not vaccine) causing GBS. I think that was about a decade ago, now.", "Severe health anxiety freaking out over this right now. Please help :/ ", "My GBS Journey  Inspiring story for sure! As a recovering GBS patient, I can certainly relate to your journey.

Thank you so much, what did you experience in the hospital? Wish you only health \u263a\ufe0f I was totally paralyzed from the neck down, in the ICU for a month, advanced care for a month, nursing home for a month, then vigorous physical, occupational, speech, and recreational rehab for many more months.

Like you, I maintained a positive attitude and all the doctors said it played a huge part in my recovery. I am grateful to be where I am today and hopeful that I will get the feeling back in the extremities. I am in my 4th year of recovery. I continue to exercise daily and feel confident I will get stronger going forward. What a great video. Congratulations to how you fought GBS. Wow I am so sorry that you have not recovered fully, my feet are still only 50% which is heartbreaking to me since I cannot do almost all excersize activities that would improve my mental and physical health.

It works everything with little stress on the joints or feet. I really enjoy it. Look into vitamins for nerve health. I take several, do not know if they are helping, but I do t think they are hurting. It takes a long time for nerves to regenerate or heal, so be patient. And keep smiling. Life is good! It never occurred to me that TikTok would serve a good purpose as a tool for physical therapy. Congratulations on your recovery! You are an inspiration, stay strong and keep up the good vibes! My older bro was in a similar situation in February of last year. Thank you! I wish you and your family only health and happiness I appreciate that, hope this is another unforgettable year for you full of laughter and lots of dancing. Stay strong and continue pushing yourself while you are relearning your bodies capabilities. Your strength and perseverance is inspiring many, and you are gaining new skills that will lead you towards your passion. Thank you for those words! I am a psychology student and hope to expand and work in the niche of psychological trauma from medical care. Hospitals can not continue to neglect paitents who are unable to care for themselves. The video is nice but I am still severely traumatized from the whole ordeal and struggling to cope each day I bet! I can only imagine how hard it is on you, especially since it happened during the worst possible time when the world was getting shut down. Your experiences have made you stronger, and if you were able to get in that field, you will be able to better support those dealing with similar challenges since you have gone through those experiences. Yes I believe that I would not be the person I am today if it were not for what I have been though, in the end the scars will be heal and I will be left with only the wisdom. I was very innocent and trusted people I should not have. This has also made me realize that alot of people are bad people who only care about what they get out of a situation. Sadly 2 of those people are my step mother and biological sister. I believe your friends are the family you choose and alot of my friends acted more like family than my real family. Truer words were never spoken, once you realize that certain people arent on the same page with you then you should not surround yourself with them. It is sad when its your family bringing in the toxicity but you should definitely be okay with eliminating those people from your life despite the blood relationship. No need to have that in your life, but you are growing and understanding that as life goes on. You are too bright and too special to have any negativity during these times. So encouraging to see you walking and living your life after all of that!  Thank you for sharing! You have an amazing story to share. Currently in a rehab facility and watching this video just motivated me even more. Congrats on his recovery! So glad to hear! You are so strong for fighting this horrible disease. It is a long process, I am still not fully recovered in my feet.", "CIDP/ vaccine injury Is there anyone who has pursued compensation through the US vaccine injury fund?  If yes, please let me know. No. As of right now the covid-19 vaccine is exempt from the fund so I have not applied. Yes. However, it was nearly two decades ago at this point for a flu shot. There are time limitations.\n\nTo WSBs point, if you are pursuing a claim for covax injury, that unfortunately has an even more difficult journey through the CICP. Yes I did. Tdap caused me to incur gbs/cidp. Google gbs attorney - there are a few online. Government pays all attorney fees win or lose.

Especially if you are experiencing rapid weight loss and serious fatigue and sweating issues.  I got extremely lucky when getting an MRI to look for abnormalities in my nerves, doctors found a lesion on my 3rd rib.  A biopsy found plasma cells.\n\nI received radiation therapy for 5 weeks to kill the cytoma. I am slowly on the mend but it will take years of physical and occupational therapy to fully recover.\n\nI actually did not receive the diagnosis until this week from the doctors at Mayo Clinic.  The doctors locally suspected POEMs but I was missing key symptoms like pain. So they could not really pull the trigger on it.  The doctors at Mayo Clinic diagnosed it right away. The hematologist said the key blood factors in my biopsy was a dead giveaway for it. Further tests including a bone marrow biopsy showed no widespread myeloma.\n\nSo please, if you are experiencing the symptoms of POEMs syndrome, get yourself checked today. Is this something my Neuro would explore or a different specialty?  Unfortunately upon reading about this I check every known box and feel the need to see this through.  I see him next on the 24th.  Pain level has been really bad recently and I am not one to complain. A bone marrow biopsy will be the best way to find it. Make sure they sedate you. I did not and it was one of the worst pain I have experienced of my life.\n\nI got lucky when they spotted it on an MRI. That may not be the case for you. I hope you are doing ok. Kind of a rare condition. This is something people with pernicious anemia worry about a lot. I am looking into it now just to be sure. \n\nHow\u2019 are you doing with this? Are you going through chemo? I hope things start lookin up for you. So far I am improving but it is VERY slow. The radiation treatments seem to have done the trick. I will know for sure when I get my CT scan next month. We have to wait for the irritation from the treatments heals. \n\nThe neurologist from Mayo was very nice and helpful. It seems the rarer the disease the more excited they get. He asked me to concentrate on getting my fingers straight. They are claw shaped except for my thumbs. I have also gained 5 lbs back since radiation ended. Before this whole thing started I was a heavy 300 lbs.  My last radiation session I weighed 206. Not a diet I recommend. With physical and occupational therapy I should be able to return to my welding job in a year or two. They told me that all I have to do is call when I am ready. I was there for 14 years before I was forced to quit.\n\nAll in all things are looking up. It is just going to take time, and I am not a patient person. 5 lbs is 2.27 kg I am really glad your employer was so understanding. Shit. Hats off to you, dude. I hope your feeling totally like yourself again soon. Wow. My dad passed away last year from sepsis in part related to his CIDP, but now I am thinking it was POEMs. He had the weight loss, pain, a lot of sweating and was also short on breath a lot. I never even came across this disease as a possibility. Apparently neither did the doctors I am so so sorry you lost your father.  I nearly lost my father to sepsis before he was ever diagnosed with CIDP.  All of it is so so awful.", "Alcohol I have been battling gbs since about April, diagnosed in August. I had a bad case to the point I pretty much had to learn to walk again. I am about 90% back to normal. My question is can I consume alcohol at this point?

But if you are genuinely 90% better, it will be ok. Drink up my friend For me 1 drink = 3. I am pretty sure it is the meds. I have been bad enough on 3-4 drinks I thought we needed a wheelbarrow to get home. Pass yourself and add water. Yes, in moderation. Just be extra cautious when you get up to walk. When I had my first drink months after GBS, the one drink really hit when I got up to go get something. It was not awful, but had to be extra cautious, with a hand at the wall.", "Diet to manage CIDP? Hello everyone..I was just wondering if anyone has tried out the Autoimmune Paleo diet or The Wahl Protocol Diet in an effort to manage CIDP? I am awaiting my first round of IVIG in a few weeks time but also started following the Autoimmune Paleo diet seriously in the last 3 weeks. I have noticed my numbness and tingling is much better and there is some strength returning to my legs - I can run for about 2-3km (earlier i could not even run 100m) and can also lengthen my stride, run a little faster etc. Small improvements but definitely there.\n\nAlso another question - was anyone administered an ANA test and did that come out with a borderline positive? Mine did 1:160 homogenous. My ANA is always negative, and I cannot handle the amount of cooking on those protocol diets, so no. I have tried elimination diets and besides corn, nothing really makes a difference for me. Thanks for the response. Maybe its just a diet placebo effect on me then :) I am very skeptical of these \"Autoimmune\" diets which are promoted to cure or help with autoimmune disorders, they all seem to be a bit of baseless con to sell or promote something. If you are interested in home therapy for IVIG, message me, I can help. It is worth looking into critically if you are getting results. There is no risk in eating healthy and some extra exercise.\nNutrition is drowning with opinion and ego by people who have never read a research paper. It is very important to look at facts not just authority figures when there are no answers yet.\nHumans are animals and nutritional science should treat us as such, but we seem to be separate from them.\nCritical analysis of research with the scientific method is what we need. Much of current nutritional guidelines are derived from questionnaires and speculation. Most attempts at debate end in displays of ego and name calling.\nI do not think it is Hocus-Pocus that a diet largely made of inflammation causing food over a long period could lead to diseases. I would be interest in you results.", "GBS and Covid Hi all, just a question as I was not able to find any specific info in my research. Are those who had GBS due to Covid being advised to get the Covid vaccine? I know that in general, a past history of GBS is not a contraindication to Covid vaccination, but I was not sure if that also applied to those who had GBS from the Covid virus itself. Thanks! Hi, I do not think we will see any advice on this for quite some time.  The numbers of people in this situation are just too few and too recent to figure out the best option, let alone publish research on it.  We do not even know what the risk is of people getting covid a second time. While there may not be any additional risk to vaccinate patients whose GBS was triggered by campylobacter jejuni or influenza (etc.), I would recommend avoiding it for those who developed GBS after SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe most likely causative mechanism is ( of a self-antigen-foreign-antigen complex and if that foreign antigen happened to be the spike protein (and the binding of spike proteins to gangliosides is well documented), then there is significant risk of exacerbation. If that foreign antigen was in fact another SARS-CoV-2 protein, then the vaccine will actually help due to reducing future infection risk, but until doctors actually test for such things, we will not know. The CDC published information regarding this very subject. They say that it is safe for former GBS patients to receive the vaccine, however, I am going to wait for more data before I consider taking the vaccine. My doctors and neurologists all told me I could never receive another vaccine of any kind, so I am proceeding very cautiosly.  I have a \"wait and see\" plan at this point. I sure do not want to go through GBS again, but I do not want Covid either. Did you or your person get GBS from covid? I think mine is Covid related. &gt;Karma\n\nHi, I saw that the CDC said that it is safe for former GBS patients to receive the vaccine but there is no mention if it is safe if the patient had GBS from Covid itself. Would receiving an mRNA vaccine containing a spike protein of Covid cause GBS again since it is a vaccine for the virus that triggered the response in the first place? Wow thank you, this makes a lot of sense! Hi, so I had Covid back in March 2020 (very mild case, but terrible sciatica-like nerve pain during my illness). I recovered completely but then 4 weeks later developed tongue fasciculations and  a buzzing sensation in my leg. Had a bunch of tests done and came back positive for antiganglioside antibodies. While I did not have typical GBS (no limb weakness), my neurologist informed me that I could have experienced a GBS-like-variant since autoantibodies were present. I still have the neuropathy in my leg but the fasciculations went away after a month.\n\nI am a healthcare worker and want to get the vaccine... but am def worried about re-exacerbation. I never tested positive for Covid antibodies (but had a + PCR when I had to virus, lost sense of taste and smell, and my husband came back + as well... so I definitely had it...). Not sure if getting the vaccine outweighs the risk of reinfection in my case....", "CIDP Sufferers Just wondering how many CIDP sufferers are on here? Currently fighting of a relapse on 60mg of Prednisolone, which is taking longer than I would like to take effect. This will be my 4th near - relapse, occurring roughly every 7 - 9 months.\n\nThis was a time when I thought \"It is burnt out! It is gone!\". Then I relapsed, I have been told after 10 years it \"mainly goes away\". 5 years in, I will believe it when I see buster.\n\nUp until December I worked out twice a week and practiced BJJ twice a week (though I will say I definitely creak and click more than my friends), then got laryngitis, a week later and symptoms started.

My main thing is symptoms keep returning once IVIG treatment wears off. So now I just go monthly for treatment until spring and will get weened off with the hopes no symptoms return.\n\nI hope you find relief, I know this is so exhausting, stay strong. I have never gone the IVIG route. Though it may be on the cards in the future. This will be my 5th year after diagnosis with returning symptoms. It can get to be all consuming. I do not mind the IVIG because I feel REALLY good like the first 3 weeks of it (not \u201cback to old self\u201d good but very improved). \n\nI am not even a year out though. Five years?! Hopefully you get some feedback on this post or somewhere. It is so hard to connect with others. Let us know if you do! Good luck and stay strong.  Hmm, tell us more about the length of time the symptoms took to manifest Started noticing something was odd Xmas on 2012. Fully diagnosis by May 2013. By which time I was walking with a Zimmerframe. Could not feel my feet in the morning, grip anything with my hands and could not lift my arms above my head. I had exact same symptoms but was diagnosed with GBS instead two months ago. When you have a relapse do you get the same symptoms? I do not have Guillain Barre, but I was recently diagnosed with CIDP. The last five months have been hell.\n\nI have reached an apathetic state regarding this.\n\nHow did you manage to get your life back on track after the initial diagnosis and subsequent relapses? I use to be very steroid responsive. Whether that is still the case remains to be seen. I feel like I am still slowly recovering from my last relapse.\n\nOne of the hardest things for me was not being diagnosed and Dr Google was absolutely awful. Truthfully it still hits me hard, and if I have a relapse or come close to relapse it becomes all consuming (internally). Physically my stamina just dropped. Like a stone, and it took the longest time to recover despite being what I would consider fit before being ill.\n\nI was and am still relatively active with a young family. Mentally I was and can still be angry. I know there is no point in my being so but I cannot let it go. Physically, I have started documenting how a feel physically on a daily basis. Only a few lines unless it warrants more. I will endeavour to keep this up especially over this drop in medication over the coming weeks/months. \n\nInitially \"life back on track\" was a slow process. I could not walk. Feeding myself was a struggle. Buttons etc were a complete no go. 6 months at high dose steroids brought me back around, and very, very slowly I started to recover. \n\nThen, I could walk again, and felt ok, so (probably before I was ready) I went back to work full time and have been in work ever since. \n\nI am an absolute bastard for routine. Work was one of them. I needed that normality. \n\nI suppose my thinking was, life is not waiting for me. I need to catch up with it. It will take a while, I will have down days, but I will get there. You will to. Sadly it just takes time. One day (when you are recovered/ing you will feel normal, push it and the next day or 2 you will have a nudge reminding you that it has not gone away and you need to rest up. I hate these days, but have learned to accept them.\n\nPM me if you ever want to catch up. Wow. Your experience is a lot worse than mine has been. That really sucks that you were unable to even feed yourself or button your shirts.\n\nThank you for responding. I will have to take you up on your offer since my family (especially my parents) is not very supportive emotionally to me.

So this is my first post on this site so please forgive me if I do something wrong. A little background: my husband was diagnosed with GBS on January 10th(two days after we got married btw) and we have been in the hospital since then. He can only move his head at this time, but he is now breathing on his own and eating and talking again. \nEarlier he said \"oh that is why it is 7 of the clock\" when I asked him what he was talking about he said that every night since Saturday his foot just starts hurting. It starts around the arch and then slowly moves up to the ankle then knee. Our question is has anyone experienced that pain that comes back every night? We have tried repositioning, pain pills, massaging and nothing seems to help. Any insights would be appreciated I had a lot of pain early on. But I tried looking at it as a good thing. I would say to myself \u201cat least I can feel something now\u201d to try and stay positive. The nerves are so raw and damaged after a GBS episode, but with time and healing it can get better. I think a lot of us experience this, just hang in there, nerves take a long time to heal. I was under a tent from my neck down because nothing could touch me it was so painful. GBS is a (insert bad word) and behaves differently in a lot of people.  Glad he is improving.\nCongratulations on getting married.  While everyone is talking covid you will be explaining what GBS is.  Recovery can be long, hang in there. My mom was diagnosed 15 years ago and I remember her panicking when evening would approach as the pain would slowly creep in and get intense as if her body is on fire. It improved after two months. All that the doctors advised was to unfortunately power through it. I am afraid the doctors do not really have a solution for this issue. While I was in the hospital with GBS (January-March 2019), I experienced an extremely similar sensation in my right foot/lower leg every night. My doctor approved the smallest dose of an evening injection of Dilaudid at the source of the pain, which would last about three hours (just enough to get me through the nights). They never understood why I experienced the pain, but it only occurred at night in bed, similar to what your husband said.", "Muscle atrophy in legs and arms years after axonal GBS (11 years ago, now I am 25 years old male), despite I have full movility thankfully.

I went to the ER 3 times over several days of gradual worsening and they never diagnosed it or even recognized how serious it was becoming. My internist was shocked when I finally got in to see him. Good Luck! Try to see a neurologist! My GP was not very helpful, but at least when I kept calling him he gave me a referral. How did your case go?  What was treatment?  Mine is mild so far, I can still take care of self.  I only first week though.

I didnt even know what GBS was at this time but I knew something was not right.\n\nUntil I was admitted to the hospital and saw a neurologist, none of the 4-5 doctors I had seen before had any idea what was going on and it was just a big guessing game for them.\n\nIf its serious and you think you have GBS, I would recommend being very persistent and not waiting X months to see a neurologist as an out-patient.

Hi all\n\nHad covid c. 21 January it was mild but then I developed GBS and had 5 days of IVIG. GBS was bilateral in all limbs and face. Peaked at around 12 days and now in recovery phase, fortunately. \n\nQuestion: my understanding is that IVIG \u2018flushes out\u2019 the autoantibodies attacking my nerves. On the basis that it is \u2018getting rid of\u2019 antibodies, will that affect my natural immunity to covid?\n\nAlso, on basis that IVIG reduces immune response to vaccines, how long should I wait after IVIG before getting COVID vaccine?\n\nThanks for thoughts. Wow, great question, and I have no idea.  This is a terrific followup question for your doctor.  You may also ask for an antibody test just to check if you have maintained any immunity.\n\nEdit:  also, it would be great if you let us know what you hear. Doc suggested waiting a little before taking the vaccine. I did not get an opinion on the immunity point though. What an interesting question. Congratulations on getting through the worst of it. You got a double whammy with Covid and GBS geez. Had Covid and GBS Nov 2021 and in physical therapy now. My Neurologist told me not to get the vaccine and I was good for 3 to 4 months when I saw him last week. I didnt ask your specific question however.... I had a couple of IG treatments starting in last fall that I had mild Covid symptoms after. I bet the Covid antibodies are starting to show up in the supply. Got vaccinated anyway, I am in health care and people cough in my eyes. Last I heard it was recommended for people that had / have GBS to not get the vaccine.  That may have changed though as we continue to get more info on the vaccines and covid in general.  Definitely a question to have a real discussion with your doctor / specialists about. My dad was diagnosed with GBS on November and is currently recovering after plasma treatments. I spoke to my dads neurologist about the vaccine. He told us that having one case of GBS did not make my dad immunocompromised so he should get the vaccine as soon as it is available. Not sure if I should get a second opinion. Hiya. It is not the GBS but rather then immunoglobulin treatment I had that prompts the question. That treatment does affect vaccine efficacy for a period of time after administration. I have been told to wait for a while (and I have had covid so hopefully that means I am immune for while ). That is interesting - thanks for replying! My neurologist has also said best wait for now, though no guidance on how long. Did you have immunoglobulin therapy? Yes 5 days 1 bag per The ACIP and CDC does not include history of GBS as a contraindication or precaution to COVID-19 vaccination. Good to know.  Like I said, that was the last I had heard (which was a few months ago).  It was directly from Dr. Fauci as well.  Looking around now though, ( on that now that more time has passed and data is available. IVIG is a temporary therapy that works to reduce inflammation by saturating Fc receptors and complement with nonspecific antibodies. It does not \"flush out\" the self reactive antibodies per se, but competitively inhibits them.\n\nIVIG therapy will inhibit immunity in the short term for this reason, but will not inhibit long term immunity since the memory B-cell population is maintained.\n\nAutoimmune syndromes can often be maintained by feedback loops caused by the autoantibodies binding to self-proteins, effectively switching on a feedback loop that leads to further production of those antibodies, in which case maintaining IVIG therapy for a sufficient period of time can sometimes break that feedback loop and lead to remission.\n\nGenerally speaking I would suggest waiting at least one month after finishing the IVIG therapy before receiving a vaccine (eg Influenza vaccine).\n\nHowever if your GBS was triggered by SARS-CoV-2 I would strongly recommend against the vaccine against this virus, unless you can explicitly rule out that the mechanism that induced GBS was ( of a self-antigen bound to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Thank you for the reply. Now I have to confirm with the hospital to make sure his treatment was the plasma and not IVIG. The one thing I am certain of is that I have no means of determining whether or not my GBS was triggered by B-cell cocapture! Can I ask your background (to help me weigh your advice)? My neurologist recommends that I get vaccinated against covid in the future. I am a scientist, not a medical practitioner.\n\nAny advice should be weighed against any contesting scientific evidence, not merely opinion. Such as if someone provides an theoretical model of how SARS-CoV-2 can trigger the *B-cell autoimmunity* that leads to GBS? Or a study that finds that vaccinating patients who had their onset of GBS within a few weeks of a SARS-CoV-2 infection poses no additional risk.\n\n(Note that if  IVIG treatment is effective, it means that B-cell activity is central to the disease - so focusing primarily on T-cells will not suffice.)\n\nSecondly, we already know it is unlikely to be due to molecular mimicry due to a lack of mimic epitopes of sufficient length in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (there was a discussion in this subreddit on this research a little while back).\n\nThis question about explaining the specific mechanism is worth asking your neurologist. You may also ask for serological testing, to determine if you even need further vaccination in the first place.", "Diagnosed 6/10.

I was hoping some folks with CIDP could tell me about their own experiences with symptoms and progression. \n\nI went from having the best workouts of my life over a month ago to now barely being able to walk and am using a cane. Started out with extreme weakness/fatigue and numbness in my feet which is now a constant sensation like when you go from freezing cold weather into a warm home all over my legs, arms, and sometimes my face goes numb too. My timeline has looked like this \n\n-first week a fatigue and foot numbness \n-second week tingling numbness spreads and noticeable difference in balance when walking and weakness\n-third week some ice pick headaches, twitches, and muscle spasms with significant decline in walking and arm mobility\n-fourth week less spams and twitches, but persistent numbness and need to walk with a cane. intense fatigue and weakness. arms substantially weaker.\n\nI have gotten an MRI as my doctor thought it may be MS, but it came up clear and my numbness is not exclusive to one side. My PCP mentioned that, although very rare, it could possibly be CIPD since my symptoms are too mild and slow for guillain barre. I am seeing a neurologist in two weeks but in the meantime wanted to see if my experiences sounded similar to those who have had CIDP. I especially want to know if any facial numbness was/are experienced along with any twitches or spasms. \n\nAlso if anyone experienced these symptoms after getting botox injections or flu shot. Those both happened about 1 1/2 months ago although they could be totally unrelated. Hey Sapphic - Honestly your progression sounds a bit like mine - which started a little over a year ago - GBS is a quick onset and relatively quick recovery, CIDP covers everything else - so you will often read about people slowly diagnosed with CIDP later in life over a period of years or decades because the onset is so slow that it is misdiagnosed. There is a category in between called SIDP - Subacute (rather than chronic) - there are definitions of the two syndromes that are based on the speed of which the symptoms appear and peak, though more often than not, it is still a lifelong issue.\n\nAll that said, my particular experience was this - I started with numbness in my toes and then my fingers and the sensation crawled up my legs and down my arms over a period of weeks, I did a nerve conduction test (they run current through your nerves and see if there are noticeable delays, and then a lumbar puncture to test for elevated CSF proteins - both of these and my symptoms led to a diagnosis of SIDP/CIDP within 6 weeks of onset which was relatively quick, however due to my circumstances (in my 30s, not wheelchair-bound) I was offered high dose steroids as the first course of treatment. I did this dilligently for about 2 months but only got worse, I started to experience numbness on my nose and ears. My neurologist hypothesized i might have a sensory-dominant variant of CIDP/SIDP that was not responding so I was finally put on IVIG; in the US it took forever for my insurance to approve my use of IVIG but when I finally got on it - I finally saw my symptoms retreat. It took about 6 months but I recovered up to about 90%, I have come to accept that I will never be fully myself again but I am thankful for the uncertainty of worrying will I be worse tomorrow? So if you think you may have this - please urge your neurologist to book you in for the tests to confirm - Nerve conduction, Lumbar Puncture and/or nerve sample test. I would push for IVIG if you are given the option, but that is just me - 50% respond to one or the other. I have had CIDP for 20+ years.\n\nIn short, I would not wait two weeks to be seen. Go to the ER. \n\nIn the scheme of things, two weeks to doc, two weeks to test, two weeks to see doc again, maybe treatment ....and this all takes place around the holidays.  You will not get treatment till mid January on the best of schedule.\n\nThat is just too much time to give whatever's cooking time to cook. Thank you! This is super helpful to hear and great advice! Good point! I think I will! I called in October and cannot get in til January 31. 3 months. Tried calling 8 other offices yesterday to get in earlier to no avail. Whatever it is, my symptoms keep getting worse and worse. I hope it is not irreversible by the time it gets done.", "Understanding everyone is different but I am curious how long it took for the majority of your skin sensations to come back. I have gotten some back and I am 1 week from completing IVIG and my upper body is pretty good but below the waste is pretty numb still  Whole body skin sensation came back in a few weeks after treatments, but till this day I still cannot feel out of the tip top of my fingers and I had GBS Miller Fisher in 2016. Hope for your speedy recovery!", "What does GBS feel like? Please help. I have CIDP and I think I may be having an adverse effect to dose 1 of Moderna. My symptoms are severe and they are affecting far more of my body than CIDP. Can you share anything concrete about what the onset of GBS felt like? What did you experience? Why do you mean by your symptoms are severe? \nMy onset symptoms were severe headaches and numbness around my lips which spread to all over the face (extremely severe to the point where I could not open/ close my eyelids). \nAre you able to seek medical attention right away? I have already been to the hospital twice but both times it was because I was trying to rule other things out. Went on Wed fearing I had a blood clot, and Fri my doc sent me for an MRI of my spine but long story short I was not able to get it. Seeing my doctor again Monday.\n\nMy CIDP neuropathy has had a predictable pattern around how it appears in my feet, legs, hands, arms, face, upper back. Over the last couple of weeks I have had escalating sudden numbness and tingling to a far more severe level and it is not like my pattern. It is happening from the waist down through the whole lower half of my body, and also in patches randomly on my lower legs, as well as more intensely in my face and arms. Previously with CIDP my feet or hands would become weak or fall asleep, but in the recent couple weeks I cannot sit, stand, or lay down without developing so much numbness that I cannot remain in that position. It got much worse over this past week and I repeatedly had to stop working because I was not able to. \n\nThe thing is I had a full nerve workup before the Moderna shot and my nerve conduction was great, after a long course of IVIG, I was going into remission. My first onset was numbness in my feet and my dominant hand. I thought I would just had a long day at work. The next day it was both feet and both hands. Day 3 I could barely walk, day 4 I was in ICU, day 5 on a ventilator. What led you go to the ICU? What was the breaking point for you? Not the guy you asked but I could not walk. I should have gone sooner I welcome hearing your experience. When you could not walk\u2014 what did that actually feel like? Was it because your legs were too numb? Did you feel like you did not have motor control, or that you were too weak to do it? My experience before the hospital was painless; I just had numb toes and my legs just did not work right. Going down the stairs in front of my house to go to the hospital I ended up falling. I did not lose my balance: my legs just did not know to keep me up. It was a bizarre and difficult to explain sensation.\n\nEventually I lost all feeling in my legs and most of my arms until after recovering. I woke up and hands felt numb like I would been out in the cold. Later, in uni, nearly passed out when standing up. Next day numbness worse and walking slower like I was tired. Day 3 fell over when got out of bed. Day 4 could only walk by crawling - diagnosed gbs. Day 6 could not pee. Day 8 admitted to icu and incubated When you could not walk, was it because you were too weak, because you were numb, because you did not have a motor response to trying to walk? Thank you for sharing with me. It was weakness - bizarre sensation. The whole thing was utterly bizarre This is really complicated. Honestly, I think you would need to find a neurologist who specializes in adult neuromuscular disease in order to be able to sort this out. GBS has numerous variants with different presentations, so does CIDP, and there are disorders that mimic these. So I feel like it is sadly just impossible to say what it is you might have from over the internet. \n\nA piece of advice my neurologist gave me is to resist the urge to self-diagnose and to try to figure this all out for yourself. Or on the internet. A person can drive themselves up the wall and in the end it is not very helpful. It can easily be counter-productive to the impulse that exists because it is trying to calm you and make you feel better about how you are doing.\n\nMy advice is, if you do not already have a neurologist you think is amazing and on top of everything, to schedule as many appointments with as many relevant neurologists as you can, as time, budget, and insurance allow. You can always cancel other appointments when you find a good one and start getting traction. Because this is complex and it sounds like you need someone who will take the time and attention to get to the bottom of this. Sometimes requires a lot of leg work and patience to find someone like that, I am sorry to say. Ask around in your area like on Facebook pages for recommendations and people who have had stuff like this. You might find a good local lead sooner than through Reddit.\n\nI would also advise that diagnosis is sort of a secondary concern right now. Also because the treatment is similar in a lot of cases. If you feel you are getting worse you should be deciding whether or not to go to the ER. That should be motivated with the knowledge of what they would be doing for you. \n\nThe physician who first sees you will not know what to do with you. They will refer to either the neurologist on call or your own neurologist if you have one. So if your neurologist already has a strategy for treating you, they will probably just stick to that. If it is wait and see until X, they might just send you home if X has not happened. Decision points are going to basically be to run some more tests to rule things out, give you treatment like IVIG, put you on observation (ICU) for potential respirator, put you on a respirator, or just send you home if none of those things sound like good ideas to the neurologist.\n\nI would consider the trip to the ER if you feel you need treatment or life saving support. Trouble breathing? Go immediately. If you are losing the ability to live independently (e.g. losing arm or leg function in a serious way)? Go immediately. If it is just vague pins and needles stuff that comes and goes, vague numbness that comes and goes and is not clearly getting better or worse... it is a hard call. If it is clearly getting worse, I would consider going and pounding the table for treatment. \n\nGBS progresses for about 6 weeks, reaches a nadir, and then regresses. CIDP typically just progresses. So I am not sure about a wait and see approach on the part of physicians if you have already been diagnosed with CIDP. If vaccine caused a flare-up of that, maybe you just need treatment for that to stop the progression. I am not saying that is what I think is going on. I am saying if you go and decide to pound the table, I have to imagine your previous medical history should give you some traction to getting help if you decide you get to the point where you need it.\n\nIt is smart to be aggressive about this and weigh your options. I will be thinking of you and hoping for the best. I am not a medical doctor and these are just my opinions. I hope something in my two cents is helpful though. Good luck!!! Also could not walk. I went to the ER early on day 4, they sent me home. That night I woke up in pain from head to toe, like nothing I have ever felt before. When my husband got up to put his shoes on, he sat on the end of the bed and accidentally sat on my foot. It felt like he would hit it with a sledgehammer. Went back to the ER and I do not remember much about that night, but sometime the next day I was having a hard time breathing. They put me in a medically induced coma and I was on a ventilator for I think 3-5 days.\n\nMy timeline is fuzzy on a lot of this stuff. I was in the hospital for about a month, and days obviously run together. But I think I have a good handle on those first 4-5 days. Thank you I really appreciate this. I have an excellent neurologist, I was diagnosed with CIDP in 2019, I know the cause, and I have been in treatment since. Through IVIG I recovered from 90% loss of nerve conduction to my feet to 5%. I was just cleared to go on holiday from IVIG. I also have another doctor who is a specialist in rare chronic autoimmune disorders and both of these doctors have helped me manage my conditions successfully. \n\nI am not posting looking for a diagnosis. As I have CIDP I have been trying to understand for a long time what people with GBS go through and how that can differ from the chronic form. I current have my neurologist engaged in my care, I scheduled with him right away when this got acute and I am on methylprednisolone while we investigate what is happening. \n\nI have been through 10 years of chronic illness treatment for various disorders, so the one new factor here for me is a possible vaccine reaction. My neurologist absolutely wanted me to get the vaccine and my other specialist did not, because I had so much chronic inflammation she was concerned I would get really sick. The vaccine adverse event reporting site encourages people to report whether or not there is a clear connection so I am going to report. The timing and the acuteness of my recent numbness and tingling is intense. I literally just got the full work up - skin biopsy, EMG, blood work - before Moderna so we have a baseline that I was recovering substantially.\n\nI appreciate the time and care you took in writing this. I struggle with asking people about their experiences a lot because I am not trying to use those to diagnose myself. In this case I am trying to learn how other people experience illness and recognize if there are things I am missing that I should be talking about to my doctors. I did not even think to bring up vaccine timing and will not see my doctor till Monday. I also have so many symptoms all the time I forget things and it helps to hear from others. Broadly of course I want to better understand the spectrum of CIDP /GBS experiences. \n\nThank you!!! What a nightmare you went through, I am so sorry. Did you have other experiences with feeling pressure that was unbearable like when he accidentally sat on your foot? Was that pain across your body something you have ever figured out how to describe or do you just \u201cknow it when you feel it\u201d? Did you also have fatigue, like a feeling of being exhausted or tired, or did you feel weak in your legs or body regardless of how mentally alert you felt? Yes tired - I slept a lot that week.\n\nSo I am curious - why all the questions? \ud83d\ude42 Was it like, one moment you seemed like you were walking okay and then they sort of fell out from under you? Did you have anything like this happen with your hands - like ability to grip and hold onto things, carry things, do fine motor tasks? I could not stand to be touched for a few weeks. I remember lying in the hospital bed and complaining that there was something under the blanket. It felt like I was lying on a pile of that coarse fill rock they use for landscaping. There was nothing there of course, just a sheet and a mattress. I felt worse for my parents, they wanted to hug me and kiss me and hold my hand, but I could not stand it. Kind of, yes. Somehow I felt like something was wrong early in the morning and called off work. And then I asked my wife to take me to the hospital when she got home. In between that time I did not get up a lot, I just laid in bed. \n\nI quickly lost the ability to move my arms and hands while I was at the hospital. However, it was over the span of many  hours but not minutes.\n\nAs funny as it sounds I do not have a clear memory of how fast things went. I was not in a good emotional state. Not a doctor. The faster you get IVIG the faster you get it to stop progressing. When GBS struck me, it was sudden. I was sick a week prior, felt better for 1 day, then the next day, my legs began collapsing out from under me. It happened a few times the first day, a lot more the second, went to the ER, they sucked and released me, even though by that point my hands began to become numb and stopped working. The next morning, my sister took me to a hospital close to her an hour from me, and by the time I got there, my breathing became labored. Fortunately I was seen right away and diagnosed within the hour, but then I became completely paralyzed and needed to be intubated. \n\nI do not recall actually feeling any pain; just completely lost all feeling and it moved quickly from my feet all the way up. I had the most severe case; the IVIG treatment did not work because it was not diagnosed fast enough; fortunately the plasmapheresis treatment did. I was in the hospital for 1 month and inpatient rehab for another month. Honestly, I do not recall any pain prior; was just sick the week before; it was just, suddenly my legs collapsed, then it kept happening more, then quickly moved up my body. \n\nI have not yet gotten the vaccine, I am reading what others go through first since it is all so new. I also caught COVID last month and fortunately it was not severe, except for losing my senses of taste and smell, which have been coming back more and more after a month. I am also under the impression, and I could be wrong, that the other variations are more likely to need recurring treatments? I have recovered completely besides numb toes and chronic fatigue syndrome. I got sick in August of 2018. \n\nI am sure I am supposed to be seeing a neurologist or some specialist, but I am not. I followed up with physiatrist for a year but since I have my strength back no longer need to see them. As you said, these symptoms are bizarre. I have understood from learning from people here that GBS has a rapid onset and it seems common that people are hospitalized. I am both trying to learn more about GBS overall and trying to be on  the lookout at my own symptoms. I had a really slow initial escalation with CIDP, but I have also had severe issues through environmental exposures. It helps me to learn more about what you and others have been through &lt;3 I have been on IVIG since 2019 and just stopped 4 weeks ago on a planned break under medical care. Neurologist told me based on half-life I still am under IVIG effects. But this is making me question if now was the time to pause. I can relate to that. I appreciate you sharing with me. And I am sorry you went through so much. &lt;333 Wow. I really relate to this and think this may be a factor in my CIDP. I am so sorry. How was your recovery from hospitalization? How are you doing lately? This happened in August 2014. My recovery was pretty rapid; I was in good health and 34 years old at the time. I also had the benefit of living near an excellent hospital, was diagnosed and treatment started within those first few days. I have no doubt that if this had happened in the town where I grew up, I would have died.\n\nThese days I do not really have any remaining issues except that I get cramps in my calves and feet more often than I used to, mostly when waking up or going to bed. And there is a specific spot along my cheek/jaw that is weirdly sensitive to pressure. Otherwise you would never know that I had to relearn how to walk a few years ago.\n\nAbout the pain \u2014 apparently it is not typical to experience pain with Guillain-Barre? According to one of the doctors I remember talking to, anyway. I have never been in a position to try to describe it, but I will think about that. I had a lot of conversations with a lot of medical professionals about getting the Covid vaccine after having had Gullain-Barre. All of them were of the opinion that the benefit outweighs the risk, and I did get it. I had the standard side effects that most people report \u2014 kind of felt like I would been hit by a truck after the second dose but back to normal 24 hours later. I have been advised not to get the flu vaccine or any other \u201clive virus\u201d vaccines. GBS and CIDP are different I see -- sorry for misunderstanding! I think what you are saying makes a lot of sense. Good luck! I am amazed and so glad you were able to recover so well that you even feel it is not needed for you right now to be in active care. That is the dream!! Your experience sounds terrifying. Were you scared when you got COVID  or was it mild enough that you were not that worried? I am so glad you were able to get fast treatment. &lt;3 I am glad you were by that hospital. \n\nI have injured both of my legs at the same time so I have gone through the PT of rebuilding all my muscles, but did the relearning how to walk feel like that? Or like a deeper brain-body retraining? \n\nThank you for sharing and again i am so glad you are okay. Heard the same thing from my neurologist\u2014 his neuropathy patients who got COVID are doing terrible, and he felt the vaccine was the waaaaaay smaller risk. That is why I am learning from people who have had GBS, thank you. Thanks so much &lt;3 The learning how to walk part was one of the most frustrating things for me. I was like, \u201cI know how to do this, I have been doing it since I was literally a year old, why will not my stupid body do it?\u201d The disconnect between what my brain wanted and what my body was capable of was really challenging. A lot of PT was just building back muscle, but I also often found myself thinking about things that I used to do automatically.\n\nBefore I got sick, I used to frequently give my husband these big cheesy winks. The first time I tried to do it in the hospital I kind of just smashed both of my eyelids shut. For a few months after, I had to really concentrate on just one eyelid, close, open. It was a lot of little things like that. As an able-bodied person, when you walk, you just *walk*, you do not have to focus on shifting your weight from your heel to your toe or where your other foot is. I spent a few months paying really close attention to what my body was doing. Sounds tough - hope you are keeping your chin up I have not heard of a CIDP patient being diagnosed with GBS simultaneously. CIDP is chronic, GBS is acute (episodic). However, if you have already been diagnosed with CIDP it would indicate your having a relapse/flare up/or disease progression. CIDP is either (1) relapse-remission or (2) constant. But we have to remember that CIDP in general is progressive. So you may just be having a momentary flare up or you are noticing the further progression of the disease. It is most important to share all of this with your neuro and to report any adverse effects to the Moderna vaccine ( Thank you for sharing this, it is so relatable. I can imagine the challenge of not being able to do those everyday things most people take for granted, whether it is walking or winking. I appreciate you telling me so much about your experience &lt;3 I am so glad you were able to make it through. Thank you!! Thank you!! I have been working on my VAERS report. I will be talking to my neuro more on Monday. I appreciate your reply! Different guy here.      \n\nMine was pins and needles and extreme weakness. Thank you. Did you find the pins and needles started and escalated randomly or did anything change based on what you did or did not do? When did you know something was seriously wrong? I do not understand why you would pause active treatment and then run out and poke the angry tiger with a vaccine of all things.\n\nIMO, you are in trouble, and you should not delay getting treatment. You probably do not have GBS but the early days of a severe relapse. I am happy to share. After it first happened I really wanted to put it behind me so I did not talk about it much or at all. I am realizing years later that it was kind of emotionally traumatizing and I never really dealt with that.\n\nI would never heard if CIDP, so I appreciate having had the opportunity to talk with you and learn a bit about your condition also. I will check in with you tomorrow, I hope the symptoms you are having after your vaccine start to improve. You are welcome. Keep us updated if you find anything out, hope you get feeling better soon. The pins and needles (and minor numbness) rose up my feet and legs very slowly. I realised it was serious by looking online. Rising bi-lateral numbness is pretty much only caused by GBS. I got a little nervous the first 48 hours of Covid when I was feverish, but fortunately that was the worst of it, which was not bad at all. I slept a lot for a week. It took a month to get my senses of taste and smell back, it is not 100% but getting there. I also have CIDP and received the Moderna vaccine.  After my first shot, it really exacerbated by CIDP symptoms for about 3 days - burning skin that felt like bees were constantly stinging me, joint pain, eye ache (just around the left eye), extreme fatigue, muscle spasms, and lower back pain.  Unfortunately, I think you may just be experiencing an exacerbation of your symptoms.\n\nI had my second shot on Friday.   So far it hasnt been as bad as the first shot.  I have soreness in the arm where I got the shot, fatigue, burning skin (not bad like the first shot), and some stiffness in my wrists and hands.\n\nIn my experience CIDP symptoms often appear initially in the feet.  It then moves up to the legs, lower back, arms and hands, and occasionally the head.  I can experience tingling and burning in my feet, muscle spasms in the feet and legs, numbness in my thighs, knees, and even from my hips down, burning sensation in my arms, sides, and scalp, blurry vision, and urinary issues.  These can rotate on different days or happen in the same day at different times or at the same time.  There is no predicting how CIDP will act on any given day.  For me, once I figured this out, I stopped stressing every time something happened because I now know it is part of the routine.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you would like.  Wishing the very best for you! I paused treatment because my nerve conduction studies showed that I went from 80-90% loss of conduction below the knees to within 5%, and my symptoms were dramatically improved. My neurologist wanted me to take a holiday and I still have IVIG in my system, the holiday is very recent. 95% of his CIDP patients who reach the stage of recovery I am on do not need IVIG anymore. I may be one of the few who relapses. He also was strongly encouraging me to get the vaccine because his neuropathy patients with COVID were doing very badly. \n\nI have autoimmune issues with diet and environment and so this whole episode has been very complex, but I am on the way to the doctor again right now. I had no response to the vaccine aside from the sore arm for the first 2 weeks and I was not thinking about the timing of replication and why people tend to get sick on the 2nd dose. My next dose is scheduled for Mon and I have a lot of questions.\n\nAs of today my symptoms have calmed down extremely which may have been diet and /or the Medrol dose pack he put me on this past week. Thank you, I started turning the tide over the weekend and I am on the way to my doctor now. Thank you for your insight. I am glad you are on the road to recovery. Thank you, that was so helpful. I am still riding the stress train because my symptoms are highly impacted by diet and environment, but while they are in an overall pattern, they are not in a specific enough pattern to rely on. It is extremely hard to plan meals and I just do not know any given day what I will react to. \n\nI am glad you did not get worse after your second dose. I am wondering if you could describe what kind of sensations and feelings you get in your head from the neck up that you consider part of CIDP. I have so many disorders it helps me to hear about what others experience, thank you. I felt really tired and worn out, to the point i would have to log off work and go take a nap. I felt like i just could not focus on anything, i was so exhausted. Also my legs and feet were totally numb. I knew something was wrong but did not know what, and because of COVID i was afraid to go to a hospital. I collapsed in my shower one day and was rushed to the hospital, admitted to the ER and began the immunoglobin treatment.\nEdit to add, my feet and leg numbness went away after i began the immunoglobulin treatment, but i needed pain medication because my legs started to really hurt (felt like i had been running for hours, like a throbbing type of pain). It has gotten better in the 6 months since i was diagnosed but i do still need pain medication for it. Please keep an eye on yourself.  I would hate to see all that progress you have made get erased. I get burning sensations on my scalp.  Sometimes it hurts to wash my hair; the water hitting my head just makes me want to scream or cry.  I also get nerve pain on the side of may face.  When it first started happening, I thought I just had a toothache.  But I eventually learned that I have cranial nerve involvement that causes the facial pain as well as blurry vision. Thank you. It was downright terrifying to go back to a state of feeling like my body was just a threatening force that could take me down any time. I am doing better, and will be watching carefully with my doctors. Thank you for sharing with me. That must have been so hard to go through &lt;3 Thank you, what test or other data revealed cranial nerve involvement? I did not know that was associated with blurry vision. I was 8 when I got it. Pretty much the same. I could not walk and go down the stairs. I used to fall down after walking for a few metres. I could not sit down on the floor. If I sat, I could not get up. I was unable to write anything. Initially, when I told this to parents they thought I was having some kind of weakness and did not consult doctor immediately. But, soon after they could see my physical strength deteriorating. When we consulted doctor, clearly he understood that I was having GBS and started IVIG. I took physiotherapy for 6 months and for 3 more years I continued my strength gaining exercises. I had relearn how to write. Even to the present day I have shivers iny hands and my right (it attacked right side of my body) leg toes are folded inside. I still cannot write neatly or clearly. That is crazy to me. I am so pleased to have recovered 90%. I cannot imagine having GBS at 8 and I am surprised your doctor knew what it was! Yes, I am just fortunate to get an early and right diagnosis.", "I have been out of the hospital 2 months. Any tips from those that struggle with physical endurance/stamina? I am 26 years old. I have been out of the hospital for about 2 months. I can walk/stand unassisted now, but I have like no endurance. If I do attempt to go to the store (or something where I am trying to walk around for more than 20-30 minutes) I am beyond fatigued by the end. My walking slows, my knees start to give, and I will get horrible nerve pain from the hip down. I cannot do anything the rest of the day if I go somewhere because I am just so drained after a short trip. \nI am not released to go back to work yet, but I want to be ready for when that happens. I walk a lot at this job, but I love what I do and do not want to switch fields (although I know it may be a possible reality, but I do not want to give up just yet). \n\nI want to build endurance, but my doctor says not too push myself because it risks (more) nerve damage. \n\nAny tips, advice, or shared experiences from anyone is appreciated.  Hi! Congrats on making it through the rough part and getting home!\n\nDo you have access to a gym with a pool? I did a lot of endurance building in the pool at my mom's house this past summer. I would walk in the water or kick on a boogie board and whenever I would get too tired I could float on a floatie or sit on the steps until I was good to go again.  Sorry to hear you are going through that. I went through rehab, first at a day facility where I spent basically the whole day and then two sessions of PT per week at an office closer to my home. It took a while but I built up my strength. What seemed to work best for me was exposure- recover. So I would walk and then hang out there/rest (initially for quite a bit) where I was before going back. With each time the rest became less and less and I got stronger. Felt like an eternity so I definitely get the frustration. I think one thing that helped me was doing things before I was \"fully ready\" and just accepting that not doing things perfectly or as efficiently as I used to is totally OK.  Hope you recover well and quickly! Thank you that is a great idea! Thank you that is helpful. Yes I think one of the hardest parts is the mental acceptance of everything. I will have to try this though, thank you.  I am about 17 months past my onset at this point, and I think it is great that you are able to walk\\\\stand unassisted - I was not. I actually still walk with a cane and tbh, I have this ridiculous fear of falling despite my strength having returned. In any case, endurance and fatigue seem to be a constant with GBS. I struggled with the same things you mention, but it gets better. I go to PT twice a week and I used to have to rest between exercises or even a short walker-assisted walk. Today, I pretty much can run through the entire hour and a half session (granted I am usually beat at the end). I am also a little older than you (44) so it is likely you will recover much more quickly. I think PT is going to be something that will help you to the shortest path here, I know it is been a literal life saver for me. Good luck. Thank you very much and I am happy for your progress. Good luck to you too! Daily B12 shots are my magic bullet. It helps me a lot. Without it I am a train wreck. I am 53 and I also have a prescription for weekly Testosterone shots. They are not hard to get. It is basically doping, but anything is better than fatigue. You have to take .2 ml shots daily for them to work. It even helps with the pain, because of the endorphins from being able to move.  I will try b12. I cannot do anything hormonal as I am prone to uterine fibroids and breast/cervical cancer run in my family. But that is awesome you have found something that works! Thanks for the advice and I hope you continue to do well.  Congrats on making it home \ud83d\ude01!  I would suggest checking out if your insurance provides physical therapy in order to build up muscle and endurance. \n\nI have PT 3 times a week, I was in the hospital for a month before they were able to diagnose me, and then I spent the next 2 years in nursing homes re-learning how to use my limbs and walk.  Do you have IVIG treatments? I know they provide me with the endurance to keep moving!  \n\nIt is so great that you are out there walking and trying to get back to life! Cheers!!\n\n Yes I am having to do IVIG every 3 weeks now (smaller doses than I was given in the hospital) for at least the next 6 months. They are currently trying to figure out if I have the chronic version of this\u2014 CIDP. It improves my walking tremendously, just still working on the strength/endurance. \n\nThanks for the support!", "Questions about recovery I am 36 and was recently diagnosed with GBS. I am thankful to have what has been deemed a mild case as I can mostly walk but cannot run or balance well. I underwent 5 days of ivig and have been out of the hospital for just over a week. I was wondering what recovery is supposed to feel like. I started my GBS journey with two distinct sensations in my feet and hands. One was pins and needles and the second is numbness that feels like my feet and legs are wrapped in gauze. I have lost the pins and needles feeling and now just have the gauze feeling with some shooting pains. I am wondering what to expect feelings wise from the recovery process. Thanks! Speaking to my experience. I am ten years out and from my toes to the middle of my feet still feel like \u201c gauze\u201d. I describe it as wearing socks that are too tight or shoes too small. I had a very severe case, paralyzed from ears down. 197 days in the hospital. It is annoying, I do stumble sometimes. Sometimes I have to remind myself that it could be worse.  Hang in there. You will get tired of explaining what GBS is. You are young enough to make a full recovery. It will just fade away. It is such a weird feeling. Sometimes I imagine the sound of crunching filling fabric when I move my feet. Thanks for the encouragement and I am glad you made such a good recovery after so many days in the hospital. So you do not really notice the healing then? It just sorta happens over time? Because I am feeling different shooting pains and burns and aches. I am only about five and a half months out from my IVIG and I am still not fully recovered. I have most feeling back in my legs, but I still have bad days. Most of my pain is gone except for my hands and feet. Everybody heals differently. It is all still so uncertain. burning aches that are transient are good; it will mitigate eventually. I experienced that in my feet at 19. it was nerve pain that eventually went away. I am 5 years from my last episode.  First was 2009, treated with plasmaphoresis and a relapse that same year treated with IVIG.  I had a third episode in 2015, when they changed me from GBS to CIDP, that was caught soon enough that a few IVIG treatments and I was good.\n\nSo first off, you have decreased feeling, im sure in your legs and maybe in your arms a bit too.  As the myelin sheathes heal, which is very slow and will take probably several years to complete, you get those pins and needles feeling.  With them damaged, you only get part of the nerve signal, hence the gauze feeling.  \n\nSo most likely, most of this will go away, but you will probably never get to where you were before, as the nerve endings will not completely heal.  That said, its not so bad.  Seeing as you made a quick recovery and it does not seem you got that bad (no plasmaphoresis required and just a few IVIG treatments) so you should be back to an almost-the-same state within a few years.  Pins and needles for me took about 6 months for all 3, gauze feeling was about 3 years the first 2 episodes and about a year for the 3rd.\n\nHope that helps.  Good luck and remember, the worst is behind you now with this. Given that your case is \"mild\" (added quotation marks because I am sure that you have not felt it that way) and recently diagnosed, I would say give it time. A week is a really short time given what you are body's been through. Wishing you all the best in your recovery!\n\nI was 34 when diagnosed (in 2016), spent a month in ICU &amp; a total of 147 days in hospital. Initially I was  totally paralyzed, lungs included. Have not fully recovered, but can walk and talk and life's good. Agreed! Same experience here. Also, you really cannot notice the healing in a short time frame. How about marking down your feelings, pains and what you can do like on a weekly basis? That way you will be able to see progress after some time has passed\n\n. Hello! Speaking from my experience a little over 2 years since my diagnose, it takes some time to start feeling normal again. I still get pains occasionally behind my knee for instance and I do not feel it when my legs fall asleep if I am on the toilet too long lol. But 1 year after I was mostly \"normal\" again. I was 18 when I was diagnosed though, so being older than me it might take more time to get back to your \"normal\". Again, it just takes time and it is different for everyone. Also, as another said, you will definitely get tired of explaining what GBS is.  I wish you luck for a speedy recovery! Thank you so much!", "Long term post-GBS issues It has been almost three and a half years since I last had GBS. I had a relatively quicker recovery, having detected it within just a couple of hours of the onset of tingling and limb weakness, which in retrospect was simply due to prior experience (I had GBS for the first time when I was 7). Despite being back on my feet within three months, I have noticed certain issues that have lingered on, such as muscle cramping, reduction in overall strength and a slight hand tremor. I did contact my neurologist regarding these, and he brushed them off as being quite normal.\nI would love to hear if anyone on here has had similar experiences, or if this is something to be concerned about. Something I have learned recently is that adjusting for residual weakness can cause other pain unrelated to the nerve damage - for example, changing how you walk could cause leg or foot pain from the strain of using muscles in different ways or in non-ideal movements. It might help to see a podiatrist or physiotherapist to see if your movement itself has changed and is causing the pain (which is a lot easier to treat, as well!). I had GBS in 1995 -- so this is year 26 for me. Still have foot pain and numbness, some hand tremors, and never got 100% fine muscle control back (like in my lips and toes). Pretty much resigned to things at this point. I had GBS in 2002 and my fingers have never stopped tingling since then. This is my biggest fear. Has it at least calmed down a bit? Whoa. I was dx with GBS a year after being dx with EDS. I thought i was an anomaly. 2 rare diseases in 1 person within 2 years. So now I am thinking...there is got to be a link, right?", "I was diagnosed with GBS in January and am still in the recovery process. I was hospitalized for almost 2 months after being diagnosed with GBS. When I was at my worst I could not even feed myself. I underwent IVIG treatments which did not do much to help me so I then went through plasmapheresis treatment. Approximately a month of my hospitalization was spent in a rehabilitation hospital.\n\nCurrently I am still going through physical therapy and hand therapy twice a week. For the most part I am getting around with the use of a walker and a wheelchair when my legs are too tired. I just started using a cane little by little during PT. I start doing aquatic therapy on the 1st of June which I am looking forward to. My hands are showing drastic improvement and I have started using a pencil with an adapter to learn to write again.\n\nMy doctors are not sure what caused my GBS but they think it was either COVID or pneumonia. It sucks being out of work but I am lucky to have a great support system in my Mother and the rest of my family.\n\nI am curious to hear your stories or any advice anyone might have. I had suspected GBS back in August 2020 and unfortunately despite 3 visits to A&amp;E/ER the never carried out any tests and kept sending me away - Thankfully my case of GBS was classed as mild according to the neurologist who thankfully took me on at a different hospital who confirmed it was highly likely GBS.\n\nFor me at my worst there were breathing, swallowing and mobility issues. At one point I was unable to walk more than 20m.... yet they still think I did not need treating?\n\nI think the plateau phase for me ended in November/December - everyone is experience with this is different and recovery can be aided by IVIG or plasmapheresis.\n\nAt this moment in time I am able to work full time l, walk up to 8 miles and can physically do everything I want.\n\nThe residuals I am dealing with are pain in my ankles (believe this is quite common from what I read) and uncomfortable tingling sensations in my face, and at times other parts of my body,which is due to hypersensitivity of the nerves.... hopefully due to them repairing.\n\nI also suffered with the most horrendous fatigue which is nowhere near as bad as what is was - with this I found the more I did the better it got.\n\nYou are still early in your recovery and from what you are saying your body sounds like it responding well to treatment which is great!\n\nKeep pushing with the rehab but dont over do it, and follow the guidance of your PTs.\n\nGBS is a horrible illness that pulls our world from underneath us within days - try to be positive though as it does get better and your body will heal.\n\nOne of the biggest battles that is not always talked about is the anxiety side of the illness in which we have to go through.\n\nKeep strong, keep pushing, you will get better! 8 miles is 12.87 km I had never even heard of GBS until I was diagnosed with it. It was hard not being able to even move at first. I felt sorry for myself for a day or two and immediately pushed those emotions to the side and put on a positive attitude to prepare for a long fight.\n\nYou are right about the anxiety. That is something the doctors did not really prepare me for. I was a very busy and social person and completely independent and this has taken a toll on my mental health. I started seeing a therapist and it has helped tremendously. I just wish the hospital would have prepared me for it better. I dont think many of us had heard of GBS before we were affected by it!\n\nDont be afraid to speak up and ask for help from your medical team and family..... somedays all you need is an ear to listen.\n\nYou will need support both physically and mentally as you recover.... I truly believe both of these elements of recovery, and each receiving the right level of support, are key.\n\nThis group, and others on the internet, have helped me tremendously. Even if I am not contributing to the topic there is relevant information that I can relate to and would help put my mind at ease. You sound like you are not too old, so you have a very decent chance to make a full recovery. If your rehab costs you a lot of money, I would probably think about ending it. Whenever your nerves heal movement and sensory function will come back anyways. Physical therapy adds nothing to the equation. I do not see a neurologist (had it about 6 years ago), because there is nothing he can do, and I never saw a physical therapist. If you are young, everything will come back in time. I do recommend ( shoes where your feet can your toes naturally and help with the balance. I could throw away my walking stick away once I put those on. Secondly I gave myself for a long time massive B12 shots. They are expensive in the US, but if you can buy it from Asia. If you know someone who travels to Asia you will get it cheap. You cannot overdose on B12, and to me it helped me a lot. Maybe it is a placebo, but it helped me to not be so lethargic. I used 3ml a day intramuscular with great success. It really kept me moving. Its over the counter in Asia or Dubai, so it is cheapest if you know someone who travels to those areas of the world. Fun fact: They use it as a performance enhancing drug in cock fights. :) Completely agree with you around how vitamins can support the body heal - alpha lipoic acid is one I would suggest doing a bit of research on.\n\nHowever, in regards to that physical therapy adds nothing to the equation - I think your very wrong.\n\nPhysical therapy is key in helping not only sustain muscle strength, but also mobility while the body heals. It is also key in helping those neural pathways re-establish and 'learn' what to do again within the affected parts the body \n\nStimulation of the nerves, via PT, I really must stress is key to helping physically recovery.\n\nAlso as the body heals it will develop compensatory strategies where stronger muscles groups support weaker ones - to have a close as a full recovery as possible these will need to be unpicked by a PT to ensure the body is working as it should.... this also ties in with longevity/full recovery and someone developing seperate issues due to mechanical issue stemming from compensatory movements.", "Curious if this is common. I have been out of hospital for 7 days and I had been making tiny progress each day. I woke up this morning and I am absolutely exhausted... even after a good nights sleep. Is it part of the healing process?  Yep It was for me.  I also found that even now 10 years after, I get exhausted easier and differently then I did before GBS. Apart from the constant exhaustion, I rapidly lost weight despite being bedridden for months. I do believe that it is a part of the healing process, but I am willing to be corrected if I am wrong. Wow.. I am still loosing weight too even though I am eating everything I can. Makes sense that it is part of the healing This did not happen to me unfortunately, i gained about 5 :( This happened to me, too. I used to be able to work my shift and then do some chores around the house easily. Now i barely have the energy for it. I almost always feel like i got no sleep the night before. I lost 22 lbs in 14 days so I would be happy to gain some back Yea, I lost weight as well. 6 months out of the hospital, and no matter how much sleep I get, I am tired. Oh yeah be prepared. You are going to have good days and bad days. I am two years from my 1.5 month hospital stay and i get absolutely WIPED if i push myself too much. Sometimes it will just be after a regular work day and WHAM I feel dead.\n\nI have seen a lot of people talking about weight loss. I lost about 40ish lbs when I was in the hospital. It was a combination of 1) muscle atrophy from being completely paralyzed for about 2 weeks 2) lack of appetite so i did not eat and 3) my body burning way more calories than usual trying to repair itself.\n\nyou need to realize that with guillain barre your body is going to constantly try and repair the myelin sheathing around your nerves. So, for example, when i was in the hospital i was told my body was burning around 4000-5000 calories a day, or almost 2x what it should be. fatigue is one of the main parts of all this.\n\nanyways, congrats for being out of the hospital! it is a slow process but soon enough you will be moving well and feeling great! I have lost a ton of weight as well. I could not figure out why because I was barely moving and consuming a lot of calories. The hospital almost cancelled my  release when, on the day before, I could not move/walk when I had been making serious progress for the previous couple weeks in PT/OT. Doctors had no idea. \n\nAs it turns out I think I was pushing myself too much and my muscles totally stopped working. A few days at home and I was doing \"fine\" again. (with a walker, haha). I miss that part. I am gaining weight now.", "Just tested positive for Covid, and was diagnosed with GBS one year ago\u2026 how many of you had Covid and were okay?   I made it through the initial variant NOT the current D (covid 2.0) OK (before the vaccine existed).  I had full body joint inflammation and lock up which was painful (could not bend anything), and a known side affect.\n\nNo GBS re-occurrence issues at all. \n\nFully Vaccinated with the mRNA Pfizer as soon as it was available. All is well. Going for a Moderna booster in a few weeks.", "Office chair recommendations? I have CIDP and regularly experience numbness and tingling in my feet and legs, among other symptoms. I am in search of a chair for my home office that will not be as aggravating to my damaged nerves. I am currently using a kneeling chair, although not properly most of the time. I bought it last year because it allows me to easily switch positions, but I am thinking that it is adding to my numbness. It seems to be great for proper posture, but not ideal for neuropathy. Open to any and all suggestions, but due to space constraints, I would love a folding chair that can then be stored under my desk.", "So I kept a souvenir recently. Not my usual brand but still nice to have around to remind me what I am paying for... CIDP crew / GBS included as well. ", "Pirenzepine for peripheral neuropathy? Hello everyone! There is a new post in the neuropathy reddit community on pirenzepine for peripheral neuropathy but I do not know how to link it...\n\nI was wondering if any of you had tried taking it for a few months and if you noticed any improvements. I tried discussing this medication with my neurologist but she has refused to prescribe it to me. Wondering if i should try another doctor. Thank you! Link to reddit post I am referring to:  I am not seeing any mention of pirenzepine in that article? It is not mentioned in the article but if you google perenzepine neuropathy there are many that come up. \n\nResearch on mice shows it works best as a topical treatment and that they are currently testing on humans. There are also testimonials saying that taking perenzepine orally improved their neuropathy. \n\nIt is essentially a medication to treat gastrointestinal conditions such as ulcers and other digestive issues. Since GBS is so closely linked to gastro issues, I wondered if anyone had taken it. \n\nIt seems relatively safe with few side effects... it does not go through the blood brain barrier so it cannot cause neurological damage. Since new research indicates that the digestive system is the second brain and gut health is imperative for neurological health, I thought this may be interesting. That is very interesting! I hope you hear feedback. I know doctors where I live (Texas) are hesitant to prescribe if it is not FDA approved for what you have diagnosed. My doc said he might try some newly researched/experimental medicine with me, but I would have to enter a drug trial (I think that is what it was called?). So maybe finding one that will put in you something like that will help. Or find the manufacturer and look for trials that way.", "A 17 year old boy with GBS. I had my first symptoms late December last year, it started with numbness in my feet and began escalating to weakness in both legs. After a couple of weeks it started affecting my school and generally my daily life and then I went to see a doctor. I was not diagnosed until mid-February with GBS but doctors were not sure which type and if it was acute or chronic. \n\nStarted to feel weakness in my arms, fingers and my grip, I had 5 sets of IVIG which I felt a little better for a week until it started worsen again. After several weeks the doctors decided I should have plasmapheresis, I am now done with all the five sessions after two weeks and they told me to wait and see. I can still walk a few steps, cannot move my toes or control my feet, cannot fully extend fingers and can barely hold a cup of water with one hand. I can move myself it is just I am super weak in the places I mentioned.\n\nWould really appreciate some feedback and excuse my English. \n\nI think I have had my first symptoms 4 months ago, it is killing me mentally. Did the doctors perform a spinal tap for you? Do they have you doing physical or occupational therapy?\n\nSorry you are going through this, I know how rough it is. That must be extremely difficult, I have a brother dealing with GBS as well. He has had a few of those IV treatments, but he has seemed to worsen after a week or two. Its hard on the family not being able to do much, but I know what you are going through is soo much worse. What do you think is the best way your family can support you, besides being there and the words of encouragement? I was 17 when I was diagnosed with GBS. I was advised to repeat the school year etc ... I was devastated but I made it. I am in my 30\u2019s now and I am doing well. I know it is tough but maybe this gives you hope. I hope things pick up for you! As someone who is gone thru GBS twice the only thing you can do is be there for your brother as much as you can. My sis spent and entire month by my side in the ICU and I can never repay her for that. The comfort of having family there when you need them is everything. Yes they did, I have been doing exercises myself but will start the physical therapy once we are sure it will not get worse. Just be there for him, I spent a week alone and two weeks with a family member, the two weeks period was much easier and we actually had fun. I am sure your brother is in safe hands. Sorry you had to go through this and I am glad you are well and happy, how long did it take until you felt yourself again? You are very young. You will recover completely. I certainly hope so, thanks :) I was 16 when I was diagnosed, I was completely paralyzed for 6 months. I have only just recovered last January this year. I had many complications and had three sets of the 5 day treatment, the first two sets were at the beginning but after a slight improvement for a couple weeks I started getting worse again. I had my last treatment while I had a NG tube for food. It is extremely hard mentally, not being able to do things for yourself and all other accepts hurts a lot , it completely destroyed me for a while. My partner, family, this Reddit group, and watching another patient with GBS recover helped me immensely. If you ever need someone to talk to about your experiences or anything else I would be happy to talk. I hope you start feeling better soon. What are the chances of recovering completely? It is really hard to find joy with thinking how active and healthy I was before this incident. I do not know how long it will take until I feel like myself again. Thank you and I hope you are doing well. I am no expert but from what I heard it will mostly happen that one recovers completely, especially at young age but it takes time. The problem is its a variable disease so not everyone will experience the same timeline That is a tough question. Physically, probably a year. I had to learn to walk again, which was a rather weird experience. I do not have a lot of long-term damage like others, mostly just mild neuropathy in my feet. I was very active in sports prior and did feel like it decreased my game but it also challenged me to become a better player, relearning fundamentals and ironing out kinks from years of playing, or so I told myself ;) Academically, I went against the advice and did not repeat the school year because I did not want to go to school without my friends. That impacted my GPA and I did not get the spot at university I was shooting for. Needless to say, psychologically the recovery took a bit longer. Initially, I had this overall gratitude just to be alive. I was just thankful to still be here. That definitely helped me through the PT and the misery of learning to walk again and a lot of other things. This immense gratitude was not infallible, however. The small things got to me again and again and I definitely had moments of despair and great frustrations. I met a girl during rehab that had a lot of longterm damage (paralysis on half her face, impaired motor function in her hands to name a few) and not to sound crude but she liked to wallow in self-pity. I was not judging her at all but that was kind of a wake up call for me. Sure, I did not ask for this but I was where I was and things could certainly have been worse. So I just focused on looking ahead. I think that was when I psychologically started feeling like myself again. Who is to say I would have gotten the spot at the university if I had not gotten sick? So I just focused on what to do next instead and worked with what I had. I regrouped and got my BA, then MS and then my doctorate. I love my job and my family. Life went on and I like to think I am making the most of it. I try not to dwell on what could have been, which became easier and easier with time and I am very happy where I am now. I believe it did change me but I think that is ok. It does not define you. It sucks but you are so much more than this happening to you. I truly believe that and wish you nothing but the best! I was also 17 when I was diagnosed with GBS...feels like forever ago since it was in 1997. I had plasmapheresis treatments first, then IVIG so I do not know if that made a difference. I made what I call a full recovery after about a year. I did not complete much \u2018professional\u2019 physiotherapy at the time...long story for a different sub there, but did a lot of exercises on my own.  I hope your recovery goes smoothly. Do not lose hope because I believe your attitude and inner strength carries you through a lot of recovery. Hang in there.", "GBS and the COVID vaccine I live in NY and work in healthcare. I went to get the vaccine today, told the nurse about my prior case of GBS (~2 years ago, a few weeks after getting flu shot). They called over a doctor who, even after we discussed the cdc guidance on GBS and covid/vaccines, told me to hold off on getting the vaccine and to consult my neurologist before I get the vaccine, and even suggested I wait til a larger sample size receives it to see if people who have had GBS before receive the vaccine with no issue. Thought I would share my experience in case someone else is unsure about getting the vaccine - it is prob best to consult a neuro but I would love to hear if anyone who had GBS in the past got the vaccine already, and how you are feeling? Thank you! The Cdc's website recommends it for people with GBS. And if everyone waits for everyone else there will never be any more data... The CDC guidance saying the vaccine should be available to GBS patients is pretty compelling to me. There have been several studies on GBS prevalence following covid-19 and following the covid-19 vaccine and there is no statistically significant difference noted in the literature, from what I have seen recently.\n\nI do not blame the doctor, they tend to err on the side of caution. For me personally, I will take the risk of getting the vaccine when it is available to me. My doctors are pretty supportive of me making my own choices, but they know I am a researcher and the risk of recent vaccines to GBS patients is overblown at best. I had GBS from a flu shot 24 years ago.  My doctor said to hold off as well, mainly because if the Covid vaccine caused me to get GBS again, I would need the same resources as Covid patients.  So the wait was mainly because of ICU space in the event of relapse rather than waiting for more data. &gt; The CDC guidance saying the vaccine should be available to GBS patients is pretty compelling to me. There have been several studies on GBS prevalence following covid-19 and following the covid-19 vaccine and there is no statistically significant difference noted in the literature, from what I have seen recently.\n\nOh, well, it seemed like a wish and a prayer to me, speculation at best\n\nWhat does prevalence of GBS following COVID-19 have to do with prevalence of GBS following COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nAnd then\n\n+ What is the rate of GBS in society?\n+ How many people were tested?\n\nso\n\n+ How many people with a history of GBS were tested in the vaccine safety studies?\n\nand\n\n+ Did they even allow people with a history of GBS to participate in the vaccine studies?\n\nSo what can really be concluded about prevalence of GBS following COVID-19 vaccine for people with a prior history of GBS?\n\n----\n\nI think the CDC recommendation as explained by the CDC was bullshit, but I am eager to get the vaccine thanks, this has been my personal strategy, wait until the local surge is over, get the vaccine at that point (after alerting my docs) This sounds like a very strange stance for someone who is not even your doctor (if I read your comment correctly).  Definitely talk with your own doctor about your decision, but once you have made that decision, it sounds like this is a cautionary tale that we may have to push and be our own advocates. I got an extremely bad case of GBS 3 weeks after the flu vaccine so my neurologist recommended that I not get the flu vaccine in the future.\n\nHowever, I asked him his thoughts on me getting one of the COVID-19 vaccines and he recommended it (a week or two before the CDC guidelines came out). For one, the ones that have been approved are very different from the flu vaccines. And COVID-19 itself is clearly very dangerous. And the general guideline seems to be, unless there is clear evidence a specific person might have a bad reaction to a vaccine, they should not be discouraged from taking it.\n\nI cannot wait until a COVID-19 vaccine is available to me. Ok, I got GBS/CIDP from an H1N1 shot in \u201809. It is all scienc-y, the way that swine flu triggers autoimmune nervous system disease especially for people with prior autoimmune diseases. The important thing to remember is: COVID spike protein does not do that. The shot from Pfizer and Moderna gives your body instructions on how to make antibodies against spike proteins. So, it cannot set off your GBS the way swine flu did (I got a shot with \u201cattenuated \u201c virus that might not have been dead enough).\nI lined up all my epi-pens, got the Pfizer shots, and have nothing to report except the sore arm the first night. COVID will kill me like a bug so I am glad I got the shot. My GP was adamant that I do not get any covid vaccines yet - HOWEVER I live in Western Australia where we do not have community transmission. For ME the vaccine risk is higher than the covid risk, but that is only because I am living in a place that does not have covid. My moms doc said she would not recommend the covid vaccine at this time for my mom who is 72. Because of her previous diagnoses of GB. Anyone else hear the same? Oh, I would get a second opinion on this. Remember we can also get GBS from catching a virus itself, including Covid.  Add to that, at 72 your Mom is in a very high risk group for covid. Yeah, we may just wait for some time. I really wanted her to have it so I could have peace of mind. But now I am hesitant. She did say at this time. I am assuming because they dont know enough yet.", "My younger sister was diagnosed in 2018 Oct 29 in the morning she had trouble walking, by night she could barely breath. She was intubated but she was big for her age (15 at that time, already taller than me) and the anesthesia was not enough. She was awake during it and remembers it vividly.\nShe spent about a month in the ICU, a couple weeks at the ITU, some days in general medicine, and then she was moved to a different hospital a couple of towns over. She was finally released in late February 2019. She turned 16 in March. That is also when our school year begins, she attempted to attend on a wheelchair but felt uncomfortable and was not able to complete the term.\nI think she developed PTSD to some degree, because she struggles with falling asleep and staying asleep; she claims that she is often confused when she wakes up thinking she will be alone in a hospital room; and sometimes she wakes up and tries to stand, which still is a little hard although her physical recovery has been successful so far, and is reminded of the situation she is in; certain noises or words make her go really still and/or angry. \nShe has not discussed any of this with the people from mental health because she believes they cannot help her.\nSo she explodes from time to time, with anger and frustration, and lashes out at me or our little brother, and sometimes even our parents.\nWhat can I do to alleviate her psychological needs? How did you all get over the hopelessness?  What helped you the most during recovery? Maybe ask her to attend a family counselling session.  It would not hurt anybody to all talk to someone. Ask her to do it for the family. She may not believe it will help her, tell her it will help everyone else. She is at the toughest age without going through when she has. She may feel like she is being singled out by suggesting she seek help. A sixteen year old girl could feel a number of things. Could even be hard to differentiate between puberty and GBS.  Get family counselling even if she does not participate.  It is going to take all of you to help her.  I hope for the best for your family. I cannot imagine going through this as a teenager. I think that is the primary focus here. She is still a kid! But she is trying to handle something that is simply bigger than anything she is ever dealt with. I worked with struggling teens for about 2-3 years and the key was letting them be kids, doing activities that are fun for that age, and making sure they felt validated and listened to. \n\nSo maybe (1) finding something new she likes to do or something she used to do, but not something that will remind her of her new limitations. That was very frustrating for me when returning home, I hated realizing what I could not do. So make it something where you both can sit. (An old craft, games, movie night/go to the movies, sleepover style girls night, etc.)\n\n(2) Just continue being there. Listen without solutions or judgment and just let her know you are there for her no matter what. She will have crabby days just like anyone else. But what helped me more than anything was the constant support from my family. \n\nAnd (3)... just give it time. I am a little over a year into my diagnosis and now feel pretty accepting of things and it does not feel like the center of my life anymore. \n\nGood luck and tell your sister about this community! It helped me a lot talking to others online about it. Thank you so much for such a thoughtful response! I hope your recovery has gone well. Thank you so much, I had not seen it from that point of view! I am reluctant to offer advice, outside of saying that whatever helped \\*me\\* might not help \\*her\\*, however take what I am about to say with a grain of salt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the  good news - Your sister is very very young. Statistically, the odds are very much in  her favor for making a full and\\\\or shorter recovery as a result. This is important, because most GBS patients are a bit older, and as a result, less 'resilient'. Personally, I can attest and empathize with those feelings you describe - it is life-altering and rough to say the least. There are support groups on FB (which I did not like) that she might explore to find people her age. Finding a therapist that she vibes with is another idea, although I get how she might have some negative connotations about this.  Lastly, to repeat what I said initially - Be wary of advice here - Everyone has different situations, and recovers differently. I do not remember having difficulty sleeping, but I do remember being in a constant state of anxiety, particularly whenever I was left alone at my house (which it rarely happened) but but the thing is that I was not anxious about not being able to do something on my own, rather I felt anxious about my parents and brother never coming back, I do not know why I felt that way. From what you say your sister was interned a long time in a hospital, and she is still dealing with that feeling of abandonment. It is just an idea, but have you or any other member of your family considered sleeping in the same room as her to reassure her? \n\nRegarding her bad mood, she is a teenager and teenagers have mod swings, but also take into account the huge feeling of frustration she must be going through. I mean she is young but she had a life plan, or at least certain expectations of what was going to happen with her life, she also had friends and now well she is doing her best to recover, but it is hard to convey how you feel when you realize that the world did not stop for you, everything and everyone kept going forward, while you were left behind. Thank you for the perspective! Thank you. I sleep in the top bunk and she sleeps in the bottom, I have asked her to wake me up if she is having trouble but she never does. She was visited every single day at the hospital, but not at night. She had this feeling she would not make it through the night and she still gets that feeling sometimes. My pleasure. I happen to know a person who is a pseudo-famous celebrity that not only did I become friends with but also went through this situation. There is a big age gap, but I would be happy to put you or your sister in touch. This person probably saved my mental health and well being on more than a few occasions and I attribute a lot to him. Pm me if that is something you want to explore. Definitely changed my life. Maybe if she could see you from her bed. Your welcome good luck. I am so sorry for both what your sister and you are going through.\n\nI am 24 (23 when I was in the hospital), so not as young as your sister, but know what it is like. It is tough. REALLY tough getting back to \"normal.\" For months I could not sleep through the night. I would wake up 4-5 times a night because I was so used to nurses waking me up to either give me blood thinner shots in my stomach or drain my bladder (thankfully I do not need either now) that my body just got used to it.\n\nI still wake up disoriented, but it is gotten better. I used to get extremely emotional, like I would be laughing histerically one minute, crying the next, then about to explode the next. My emotions are still a little wild (I did develop PTSD from my time in the hospital, according to my psychologist), so I have been taking SSRIs for about two months and they have helped. Also time has helped the most\n\nHonestly, the best thing you can do is be patient with her. It is going to take time, a lot of time. She is going to have a lot of highs, but even more lows. The best thing you can do is be patient, ask her what she needs (but do not be pushy), and give her time. Consider telling her about this group. I have talked to a few people who have had GBS, both young and old, and it helps considerably. It is hard for you to feel like people understand what you are going through, when they just do not. Having people who went through the same thing helps, at least it has for me.\n\nI wish you and your sister all the best. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you or her want to talk. Thank you, I guess I just need her to open up more at therapy", "Does Guillain barre cAuse neuropathy and ataxia Does Guillain Barre cause ataxia along with neuropathy? Yes. I lost everything waist down. Including bowel and bladder. I gained those back. 4 years later I have severe neuropathy in legs and feet. Foot drop and partial paralysis still.  No ankle reflexes. Walk with AFOs and a cane. On high dose Lyrica and still smoke weed daily because the neuropathy is so bad I thought it comes than goes, so are you saying you can have after effects too? Mine just didnt go all the way. I got bowel and bladder back. Learned how to walk again. They say after 2 years u plateau Does it spread like wildfire? Mine started with tripping over nothing at work. 24 hours later I fell in my bathroom but still did not think anything of it. I thought exhaustion from working night shift and staying up. I woke up the next morning and couldnt stand. Fell multiple times. It felt like my legs and feet were asleep. Went to hospital while I was being evaluated I slowly lost reflexes in my legs. Wow! That is truly terrible! I had numbness when I was 19 and I could not walk, had areflexia, fell when I closed my eyes, and other symptoms it went away and came back a few years later but now I have really bad neuropathy where it is affecting my internal organs. I just not to long learned my csf levels were slightly elevated. They tried to blame it on diabetes. But I do not think diabetic neuropathy disappears after a few years and comes back. Plus my a1c has been good. I do not know if slightly elevated csf levels can cause these symptoms That is a good question about the csf. Have they done nerve testing? Neuropathy is awful. I am sorry you are having to deal with it Yes I have I had an emg done and autonomic test. They could spot peripheral neuropathy, but found my sweating was abnormal in an autonomic test. They say I have small fiber neuropathy Interesting Neuropathy and ataxia seem to be some of the more common symptoms. I had full paralysis below the neck. First, it was a little tingling in my feet, then all over by the next morning. Within 3 days ataxia started and I was urged to go straight to the ER. Within 2 days, I could not breathe on my own. One month in the ICU, 2 months in rehab (learning to live as a paraplegic at least as a near-term measure). I was discharged in a wheelchair, got to initial walking 6 weeks later, and continued to improve from there.\n\nI have very little residual issues (trivial neuropathy and possibly very minor reduced strength and coordination in my feet) but it is not uncommon for people to not recover 100% (though most people do not get it as bad as I did). Being otherwise healthy and especially young correlates with better outcomes. I have severe neuropathy from the waist down and in my hands. Ataxia is worse when I am due for more IVIG (I go once a month). It has been two years since my initial diagnosis. I would not say these symptoms are uncommon, but it does seem to vary in severity and duration for everyone. Actually kind of good to hear that I am not alone in the pain. Moved away from California to Australia and the lack of medical weed has changed my life for the worse. It is ridiculous. Yeah im not in a legal state     The amount of pills i have been on that are extremely addictive still did not compare to the effects of weed. I was able to progress in my physical therapy and my endurance went up because of weed. I now have osteonecrosis in my foot from injuring bone from walking poorly. I have surgery this month to remove bone. The pain of it is also redick I hear you. I legit cannot work right now, whereas back in California the CBD let me function every day :( And if I use a CBD strain grown by someone I know, I could be ddported....but asking my doctor about it could also lead to me being deported.\n\nAnd they wonder why people drink so much in Australia, a land with tons of physical labor. Maybe we are all in pain! Yes and yet alcohol abuse is somehow better than using cannabis It is such a weird perspective! Truth", "Do I have GBS? I took the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine about a week ago. Ever since I had weird tinglings in my feet and toes and now also in my lower legs. When I google this the first thing that shows up is GBS. However, I do not feel any less strenght in my muscles. Could I have a mild version or is it something else? Gbs started \u201cshutting down\u201d muscles progressively, the tingling was the first sign. Next day, muscle did not respond. Keep an eye out for this. \n\nWeakness was not really a thing for me, muscles just stopped working one by one. \n\nBest of lucks, I hope you do not have it. How long did the tingling take place untill your first muscle shut down? It was around a day of tingling before shutting down.\n\nIf a muscle stops responding seek help asap. Okay, thank you for your replies. I go to my general praticitioner tomorrow to get tested. This is something you should speak to a doctor about. This is a support group. I go to the doctor tomorrow. I am just trying to inform myself on other peoples early symptons. Same here OP and let us keep in touch. I took the J&amp;J a little under a week ago as well. Ever since then, I have had the same feeling and I can best describe it as just feeling these very light shocks, some say it is pins and needles. What keeps me optimistic is that they say that side effects from the vaccine typically show up within 72 hours and that time has passed. Yes that seems about the same. Let us keep in touch indeed. We might not even have gbs but it definitely did something to our nerve system. I am keeping your name in mind, we can literally use this thread as each other's daily updates lol. Yes, let'sdo that! I will give my first update tomorrow. Reply to me or let me know, I will give it along with you. Anecdotal instance here, I had no tingling and woke up with mild pain in my right calf, that turned into weakness in my right leg, and then the same happened to my left leg. pain transitioning to weakness. Took maybe 10-12 days to get to the worst of it.  So while tingling is definitely cause for concern i would be much more concerned with pain and strength Okay, thank you for your reply. It is good for me to hear these experiences. Okay, as promised my daily update. I woke up dizzy after just 4 hours of sleep. But probably because I was tired felt barely any more tingling today (but still some). I went to my general praticitioner. She tested my reflexes which were fine. My strenght also seemed fine according to her. But the left side of my body clearly had a different sensibility than the right. She expects it to go away, however it could be very early symptons of gbs so if some of my muscles actually  become weaker in strenght I have to come back so she can make an appointment for the neurologist. I also bought magnesium and vitamine b12. It might help. How did you do today? I was actually okay most of today and not much happened to me. Hope you got my DM, apparently our symptoms are very common and might not be directly related to GBS. I am doing this all day by day but today, the symptoms were not bad at all. I did not feel the pins and needles thing and actually went for a run as well. Did some lifting an hour ago although I do think I have become weaker at it than before I took my shot so taking note of that.\n\nAppreciate you giving the daily update, let us keep going with this. Ah that is good to hear. I received no dm though.Let us update again tomorrow. Okay, Update 2. I got some tinglings when I went to bed last night but barely any today after I got up. Still have less sensibility in my left leg and arm which feel very light which make it seem as if I waggle but I seem to still walk straight. I also feel a bit of pressure on my face/left eye. Yet I was much calmer than yesterday. I am slowly accepting the situation and do not feel that panicked anymore. How did you do? So I woke up this morning and stretched while I was in bed. Next thing I know, I feel a sharp pain on my right left and it was a very nasty cramp. You know that feeling when you stretch and it feels like you pulled something, that is what I felt. Luckily just laying there and slowly straightening out my leg did wonders but now I do have a nasty cramp. Did not feel good.\n\nI have not had one of these in years!\n\nTingling has seem to go away though. Okay cramp is a quite normal side effect from what I heard. However, it could also be a bad sign. The tingling seems to fade away quite equally with the both of us. Let us hope we are slowly recovering instead of reaching some kind off next phase. I am hoping for the same here too. How can a cramp be a bad sign? Now I think of it, it was very bad muscle pain that I heard from people with gbs. I think cramp also occurs but is a more common side effect anyway. When it turns numb you should worry. Noted. Hope you checked out the other subs I told you about Yes I did. It brought some comfort knowing there were people with similar symptons who recovered after a few weeks without it being anymore serious. Well I had a cramp today and I am just more paranoid lol I know how you feel. I panicked at almost every new thing my body has done this week. I am nervous every morning if my leg still works. Let us update again tomorrow. For sure! Update day 3: Last night when I went to bed I had some tinglings as usual. I woke up fine. Not much tinglings during the day. Not much difference with yesterday except I felt a small pain in my left leg a few times and also starting to feel more burning besides the tingling. I went to the gym which confirmed my strenght is still fine but the left side of my body clearly has a more numb feeling, and I think it is reaching my face aswell. Got pretty worried again and I think I am going to make an effort to somehow see a neurologist as soon as possible. How did you do? Another cramp or nothing bad happened? Not much of a cramp today and so far, the tinglings or \"pins and needles\" have gone away. Well either they have gone away or I just notice them a lot less than I used to. About to go to the gym again in a few so that will say a bit about it all. I want to keep doing this for at least 4 weeks from our shot so we know what is going on. Nothing today but it can come back with ease. Ah good to hear! I hope this will continue for you. Update me on the gym. And yes, let us do this for about 4 weeks. So bad news actually, just went to workout and shit is not normal. Did chest flys and felt pain in my chest. Then I went to do some running for a while and felt a bit of slight pain on left side of my body.... ah that is bad. Let us keep updating every exercise aswell. Update 4: Last night when I went to bed I got some pretty heavy tingling in one of my balls but also my left leg. When I woke up it was clear that the left side of my body which feels more numb clearly has more muscle pain than the other side after yesterdays workout.  The rest of the day I had not much problems. So I went to my new general pratictioner that lives in the same area to show my symptons got slightly worse. In contrary to the other one she said she had cases like this before. She told me I just  have to wait and stress less so I feel less tinglings and needles. Yet it also felt like se did not take me entirely seriously and thought it was mainly my stress. She even asked me why I took the vaccine this late. I feel like they will not send me to a specialist unless Inalready lose strenght or one of my limbs paralyses. So if nothing improves in a week I will contact a neurologist myself and just pay for it myself. Meanwhile I will take lots of vitamin b12 and try to be less obsessed with all of this. Sorry for the long text. How did you do today? Glad you replied actually, so I have been seeing some side effects as well here. I have thankfully put them in a notepad whenever I notice them too. Today I woke up and the left side of my face was a little bit sore. I later on felt somewhat of a stinging pain on the left side of my body. Where it hit me was when I was laying down and then I felt a sting in my left buttcheek and it crawled up to my body, felt something tickling on the inside. Fine for now though.\n\nYou can PM me this but what part of the US are you in if you are in the US. I wonder if I may run into issues because I have yet to see a doctor about any of this. Ah that seems similar to me. I am from The Netherlands. Where are you from? USA, the southeast specifically. Update 4: I did not have that much tingling in my body last night when I went to bed. Today I was pretty okay except some random stings of little pain in my body but it was not that hard. I went bouldering with a friend. Strenght on both sides of my body was good and I completely forot the feeling of weakness on the left side for a moment. I got drunk in the night amd now have a constant tingling in my left hand but not much weird feelings in the rest of my body. Let us see how my body reacts tomorrow. Might was a stupid thing to do. How did you do? No fucking way, I got drunk too, lol we are quite alike. I heard there are riots going on in The Netherlands around this vaxx pass stuff. I did not really feel any symptoms for today but too soon to come to a conclusion. Meant to respond sooner but just been bogged down with so much stuff. I want to give this 4 weeks before I do anything else. Yes there were riots. Eventhough there is some uselrssdestruction I am quite happy with these uprisings. As I am definitely not taking asecond shot I think I will be among the officialy not fully vaxxed group within a few months. Which makes me regret taling it even more. Anyway, update 5: I drank alcohol again saturday which I think was still a bit in my system today,so I did not feel much entire weekend. It feels like the numbness on the left side of my body has gotten less but it could come back. I already feel a bit more tingling again now I to to bed without alcohol. I noticed abit of pressure on my chest todat when I laughed and shortly got a bibrating feeling in ky left ear. I hope it has not anything to do with allof this. Also my heart pumped a bit harder when I woke up yesterday, but was probably the alcohol. How did you do today? I can relate and yeah man this stuff is getting crazy, the booster mandates might come soon. Today was decent for me but then again, I just stayed in and everything. I have not gone out yet or anything like that over the weekend. So far it is normal but again, I want to do this for 4 weeks before I claim anything. I hear even GBS takes 2 to 4 weeks to develop. Update 6: Clearly had a different feeling on the left side of my body again. Also felt a pressure on my face. But felt better after a workout in the gym. I am now pretty convinced it is not gbs. But probably paresthesia, hypo-esthesia or some other form of neuropathy. I found this forum on a website called vestibular.org where more people share these symptons. Some recovering and some still having the same symptoms months later. I hope I will feel less stressed tomorrow. How did you do? Do not discount anything, remember, GBS takes at least a couple of weeks to really show itself in a serious way. I have not had anything recently but then again, too soon to tell. I think it could very well be the calm before the storm here. Update 7: Last night I had quite a set-back. Went to bed all calm but woke up 4 hours later with restless legs and was barely able to go back to sleep after that. Which resulted in me being quite nervous the entire day. However it feels like the feeling in my left part of body is el wly recovering , or I am just getting used to it. Also feel pressure on my ears. I am pretty dissapointed. I hope it will not happen again tonight and tomorrow will be better. Are you still doing okay? So I felt slight pain on the right side of my chest but other than that, nothing much other than fatigue. My left left was somewhat sore too. It is been two weeks for me since I got vaxxed, I want to wait 2 more weeks. Update 8: Last night I slept better because I made sure my body was more calmed down when I went to bed. I still have restless legs whenever I sit down or lie down though. Also felt a heavy pressure behind my nose or in my head again untill I took a run today. I think the left side of my body still feels different but I think I just got used to that. The other symptoms are more annoying anyway. I am really starting to lose hope that this is just something that will go away after a few weeks. It is almost three weeks now and things just got worse. I hope you are still doing okay? Update 8 from me too:\n\nNo dude, me too. I woke up and felt soreness in my jaw, especially as I took my first bite of food. Later on, friend convinced me to experiment with CBD gummies and I took 3x the daily recommended usage on the bag. Ended up feeling that pressure or tingling on my nose, like something was making it vibrate.\n\nLet us keep updating each other.", "Anyone else have this symptom of GBS? Hello, new to this sub, although I was diagnosed with GBS almost 15 years ago when I was 11.\n\nI have read a bunch of people's stories and symptoms, but none have mentioned the most promenent and memorable part of my symptoms.\n\nFor me, I remember feeling super uncomfortable sitting or bending my body in any way. Laying down was fine, and standing up was okay, but I remember crying on the way to the doctors office and then the ER because I had to lay down in the fetal position and bending my body was so painful. The spinal tap was the most painful experience of my life from the combination of the needle and the position it required me to be in.\n\nDid anyone else experience this? It started happening prior to losing any major function and was the last symptom to linger. I remember getting out of the ICU (where I had a catheter) and going to the regular floor where I was terrified to use the bathroom because of how much it hurt to sit. After I went into lung failure I started feeling the pain of lying in any position, so much so that the delirium caused me to hallucinate that the doctors had done something weird to my body, and it carried on like that until half way through physio recovery when I had more fat and muscle, it still hurts to sit for to long. I am 7 months after the onset, feel free to ask me any other questions I have never heard of it. Your nerves in your back must be seriously affected.", "My mother in law has GBS- could use some advice. If this kind of post is not allowed just let me know. \n\nMy mother in law was admitted to the hospital august 18th with what we would later find out is Guillain Barre. It paralyzed her breathing muscles and she got put on a ventilator. She got pneumonia, a yeast infection in her lungs, went septic and went into kidney failure. She got put on a continual dialysis, recovered from her kidneys and they successfully treated the infections but she still had trouble breathing and had to get a trach. They moved her to a long term acute care facility where they told us she is \u201cno longer a candidate\u201d for GBS treatments because they are not working. They were letting her breathe on her own during the day then turning the vent back on at night and she was doing well with that. Yet today, they tell us that they did a nerve test and discovered that the nerve damage is so severe that \u201cthere is only a 20% chance she will ever come off the ventilator\u201d\n\nI am just confused because she was breathing on her own during the day so we all thought it was a good sign. And I am the kind of person who just needs these things to be told to me bluntly and I have no idea what her never coming off the ventilator would mean. Can you live like that for a prolonged amount of time? Also she is like fully there. Nods to your questions, winks, tries to smile, etc. \n\nBasically I am just wondering if anybody else has been in a similar situation. What might it mean if she cannot ever come off a ventilator? Will she never be able to talk again? Never be able to leave the hospital? I know nobody on Reddit can tell me for sure. I just feel helpless and lost and this is all I could think to do. My suggestion would be to request a family meeting with her case workers. Your mother in laws social worker should be able to organize this with family and her healthcare providers present.\n\nI also want to say I am so sorry you are going through this difficult time. Sending support \ud83d\udc95 I was paralyzed and intubated by GBS in August 2018. I was not diagnosed at the first shitty hospital, who then released me. The second one fortunately diagnosed me right away but by the time I got there my breathing was labored. The first treatment they do is IVIG, it did not work for me because it was so far advanced by that time. Next, they did plasmapheresis, which did work. Ugh, I had also gotten a UTI because my bladder was too full, which for me were nightmares, but according to everyone else, were delusions from the bladder being too full for too long. So sorry that she is getting no relief. If she did not receive plasmapheresis treatment, she needs it. Once I had that treatment, I started to get better, however, I needed inpatient physical rehab. I was in hospital for about a month, and inpatient rehab for another month, where I had to relearn how to do EVERYTHING from change a channel with a remote to walking and rebuilding my muscles. I was in Moss Rehab, highly recommend. I also had speech therapy mostly to prepare me to get rid of the trache, and occupational therapy. As soon as I was able to take a few steps without aid, they released me and I did therapies for 4 more months, at home and outpatient. See what and where her insurance will cover rehabs, and try to set that up for her. Thank God my sisters were on top of everything and made sure I got what I needed, researched the shit out of GBS, and contacted GBS-CIDP.org, the international site that has lots of info and support. I have regained all of my independence and movement I had before, no more trache, just a lot more fatigue and a lot less energy, and occasional aches, pains and numbness. Best of luck. Thank you for your reply! I am so glad you were able to recover. She did get IVIG and plasmapheresis and the doctors said she was not responding to either. She kind of had bad luck with getting a diagnosis for a while, too. Not in the same way you did but she is type 1 diabetic so when the GBS started by causing her feet to go numb and her to have frequent falls, they just assumed it was diabetic neuropathy and sent her on her way. Sucks to think how different the situation may be if they would caught it sooner. Oh I am sorry to hear it took a while for diagnosis on top confusing it with diabetic neuropathy. It is scary how many hospitals are not aware of GBS symptoms. Definitely check out GBS-CIDP.org if you have not already. I hope that your MIL gets better. I will, thank you!!", "Gabapentin side effects? Two weeks ago my mom was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with GBS (The doctor mentioned that it was a specific variant, but did not say which one-- She can still breathe on her own and can feel sensation everywhere when touched, but lacks any ability to move below her neck and no reflex responses).\n\nWe have been noticing that shortly after she receives her gabapentin, she will get really zoned out and usually forget where she is and how she got there. At first I thought she was stroking out or maybe asleep with her eyes open. It is always super upsetting for her when she wakes up disoriented in the night. \n\nThe only thing they are giving her right now that I think could be causing her disorientation is the gabapentin. She asked to skip her dose this afternoon and she was the most lucid/talkative she is been since she went into the hospital.\n\n Anyone have experience with weird gapapentin side effects like this?? What is her dosage? It can make you drowsy. That being said, I was taking 300mg doses and did not feel anything like that. I had horrible side effects from it, personally. Shaking, the pain did not stop, zoned out. I switched to Lyrica and when my insurance stopped covering that Nortriptyline. I really really liked the Lyrica. I agree lower doses usually do not have those affects but they maxed me out for awhile 1200mg 3 times a day and that in combination with pain meds was a really uncomfortable combination so they scaled back and changed some meds. Your mom may start to tolerate the medication more sometimes it takes sometime to adjust. Her body is already going through a lot so it could be just the combination of things. It was always the pain meds that made me go bonkers. I hated being on oxy I take 900mg 3x/day. When it kicks in, I have trouble focusing and sometimes I get confused with what I am doing also.\n\nCould you ask her doctor if it is interacting with other meds? It is also possible that the stress of everything going on with her/being hospitalized could be contributing to that. Please encourage her to be frank with her doctors about her side effects. They cannot adjust or come up with a solution if they are not aware of what is going on.", "The CDC website used to explicitly tell GBS sufferers not to take vaccines. Now, I can find almost no guidance from the CDC on their site. Can you find any? I feel like the CDC has scrubbed their website of GBS information probably due to not wanting to give anti-vaxxers any support.\n\nBut while I used to find clear explicit advice that folks with a GBS history should not be vaccinated, and this used to be on every vaccine information page, now the only information is how rare GBS is, how the diseases are worse than GBS, so get vaccinated, but it explicitly does not deal with us poor SOBs.\n\nGBS is so fucked up, because no one has heard of it, people do not believe it, if they have heard of it, well there is much victim blaming, \"it was not a vaccine, you ate a bad chicken\"\n\nAnd even now in this pandemic, doctors and reporters do not wish to discuss it, because of how anti-vaxxers will use it.\n\nAnd even I do not want to believe it. My GBS was 20 years ago. Goddamned do I want to get a covid vaccine.\n\nAnyway, can you find a clear statement from the CDC on their website regarding vaccines and GBS sufferers? The CDC has become a political football over Covid information so things disappearing is sadly unsurprising to me.  \n\nThere will also be a desire by a lot of folks to avoid talking about negative edge cases related to getting people to take the vaccine.  \n\nOn the counterside if GBS becomes an out for the vaccine I fully expect a huge increase in the number people who talk about having had GBS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is one of those situations where we are going to be in a hard place for a while.  Finding a good Dr who you feel comfortable taking advice from would be my strongest suggestion.  I am also of the opinion, that the Dr is there to help you make the choice, not to make it for you, or leave you in a vacuum to do it yourself. This is a risk based scenario by percentages. \n\nIf you get sick your chances of dying are roughly 2%. Much higher if you have existing conditions. \n\nYour chances of a re-occurrence of GBS are 3% one time chance with the vaccine. However...Its 3% every time you get sick with COVID-19. \n\nYour chances of contracting COVID-19 (depending on your location) are as high as 15% constantly now. \n\nI am going to wait until late summer and look at some data, but the vaccine seems to be the best gamble. Until then I am wearing mask and practicing proper safety measure. Generally, I agree, which is why I said I want to get vaccinated, but I think it is highly variable for people dependent on their own health and other matters, which is why I want guidance from the CDC I can point my personal physician to\n\n&gt; Your chances of contracting COVID-19 (depending on your location) are as high as 15% constantly now.\n\nAnd many predict will continue at some low number, for decades as Herd Immunity via vaccine or general infection of the population will still not eliminate covid, but will eventually just become part of the annual infections people get.  2 - 5 years down the road, children may be vaccinated against it, but it will still be there for us non-children.\n\nBut having had GBS, I certainly do not want to be vaccinated while there is a surge going on, so my hope is to get my doctors informed and then with them determine a date when the local resources have rebounded enough to deal with my issues Another point made elsewhere is to wait until ICU / emergency waits are low when you get vaccinated, so if you do have a bad case of GBS you are likely to get prompt attention. This is what I got from the CDC VIS email a few years ago:\u201cGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is multi-factorial, and is four times more likely after influenza disease compared with influenza vaccination.  It has occurred after influenza vaccination in the past, and therefore we consider a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome following within 6 weeks of influenza vaccination to be a precaution to further doses of influenza vaccination.  A precaution means that if a patient has no risk factors for influenza disease, it might be wise to withhold a dose of influenza vaccine.\u201c and make sure your neurologist is not about to go on vacation... I believe there has been an update from the CDC/ Dr Fauci GBS and getting the vaccine.January 21.   \n\n", "Starting IVIG Gamunex My wife was just diagnosed with CIDP and starting Gamunex-C through IVIG. Can anyone share their experiences with this? Should she expect serious side effects? Side effects are very rare at least serious ones anyway.  Before they start the infusion she will be given 1 Benadryl and 2 Tylonal.  Headaches can be common and can be almost fully avoided if she stays super hydrated.  The Benadryl is for the rare instance of an allergic reaction. Immunoglobulin is a blood by product that is derived from in some cases up to 15K donors so no one batch is exactly the same.\n\nGeneral routine would be 2 infusions in a week and then again 3 weeks later for however long is necessary.  They will check her blood pressure every 30 minutes as this is being pumped into you it can raise your blood pressure.  Provided she does not have any issues there they will increase to rate of the infusion over time.  It is hard to take a nap when they blood pressure cuff running every 30 minutes. \n\nTime is probably the biggest issue.  The volume of IG she will be receiving is based on body weight so a simple calculation.  I see so really big folks and they must spend 8 hours to complete.  I start at 7:30a and am usually out the door by noon or 1.  Either way you are hooked up to a pump tied to a chair for a while so bring a book, laptop, snacks, etc...  to pass the time.  Otherwise you will be stuck watching basic cable filled with ads for medicare and pharmaceuticals.  I have had UberEat's delivered before, nobody cared. LOL\n\nPersonally I like to schedule at least 1 day between infusions, say Mon / Wed as I find the only real side effect is being tired afterward and it is much worse for me when I get them back to back.  Also rare but some people experience nausea but that is an easy fix since they can just hook up a bag of IV Zofran, that stuff is magic!\n\nThe fine print: Infusion suites treat all kinds of conditions so do not presume the people around you have CIDP.  In fact at least where I go nobody talks about anything related to what they have.  After a while you can kind of figure it out what they have based on what is in the bag.  Also, if handed the TV remote avoid anything Political or religious or anything that could start bickering.  Not everyone shares the same value system and these days people can be crazy.\n\nI think that is everything after almost 2 years of this...  That reminds me, not a single person on the planet can tell you how many treatments you need.  For some it can be pretty quick and for others not so much. I take it too. Thoreau nails all the details. I would only add that hydrating the day before helps me a lot with the headaches. Go easy on the coffee and salt, heavy on the water and fruits. \n\nI have been taking Gamunex for many years. I feel it is a solid product. Worst case scenario is if you end up like me and get aseptic meningitis twice. \n\nIF the side effects are bad, she can always swap to subq which is a weekly process instead of monthly but feels easier on the body. Also I am not sure how common this is, but after IVIG I had false positives for West Nile virus, Lyme disease, and hepatitis C because those tests check for antibodies (and I guess some donors had some of those antibodies). So if your wife gets blood tests and has some weird results do not flip out right away (I flipped out but calmed after talking with my doctor). Just something that happened to me that I have not heard mentioned. \n\nBest of luck to you both Excellent point.  Whenever any of my Docs ask for blood work I do it at the very last moment before my next infusion as I have also had false positive for weird stuff.  Just the stuff you learn along the way. Yes their are situations where and infusion pump just is not right for that patient. SubQ is the same Ig but on a drip rather than a pump, greatly increasing time of treatment but far lessening potential issues like headache and BP rise.  \n\nAnd since we went there sometimes IVIg is not right for some and alternate treatments are available.\n\nGive your wife /u/AW5542 a huge from all of us.  This can royally suck but her attitude about it and your being supportive can make worlds of difference.  And no shame in seeing someone in the Phych world to process the unknown to her. \n\nOtherwise, we will be here! Thanks. She works from home and will be able to receive treatment at home. She sits at desk and works on the computer and talks on the phone and video chat. Will she be able to work while receiving treatment? Yes.  I was never a fan of at home treatment since Covid as I really do not want anyone in my home that I do not know where else they have been and it is not like they show up with a neg covid test every-time they show up.  I prefer a hospital setting since all the control systems are in place.  My infusion place is at a major hospital so if anything goes wrong I am already there and that helps with my anxiety.  They also have private rooms if I need to be on a call and kind of hide the medical stuff out of frame.\n\nAt the same time my clients have become extremely understanding of the fact that I am dealing with something that they do not understand but they respect that I am still working  and cut me more slack than maybe I need.  But when I do need it it is understood and I do not abuse it. I do not bother explaining myself to these people as if I just let them think the worst I am given the most leeway. It is none of their business and they always think I am getting Chemo because it is something they can understand / wrap their head around. \n\nEveryone is different however these infusions become about as extreme as waiting on a delayed flight.  It is mostly just waiting. So yes she will actually want to work during infusions but may need some rest afterward.  That part may be hardest on you or any close loved one as you want to 'help' but their is nothing you can do. \n\nI remember all of the uncertainty that you two are going through but it for the most part goes away pretty quickly, especially when your body starts to respond to treatment.  For me it was not overnight but a gradual, \"oh hey this is actually working\" kind of thing. That provides a better outlook overall and you look forward to the next treatment oddly enough. \n\nHope this helps. May I ask how your wife was diagnosed, what tests did she have that determined it was CIDP? Honestly, I cannot think of anything negative that happened with the IVIG. I have CIDP, and the route to diagnosis was no picnic.  I had so many blood tests to rule out other causes - vitamin D, B6, B12, EBV, CMV, cancer, a bunch of other autoimmune diseases, and the list goes on.  I also had several MRIs (showed inflamed nerve roots with no impingement), nerve/emg tests that showed demyelination, and a spinal tap that showed elevated protein in the cerebral spinal fluid (csf). I have CIDP, and I started out on Gammagard S/D.  I had an initial loading dose for 5 days in a row.  After that it is was 1/wk.  Definitely have your wife drink plenty of water before, during, and after her infusion to prevent headaches.  I got headaches each week at night and into the next day for the first month.  Doc then gave me pre-meds to take - iv fluid pre and post-infusion, benedryl, and tylenol.  After about 7 months I started to get poor vein access and fluid overload that caused my bp to rise and not down come easily.\n\nI am now on Hizentra - subcutaneous infusion.  It gives a little more flexibility not requiring a nurse to come to my house and the time is shorter 2 hours v. 4-5 hours through IV.  The only side effect I have is some swelling at the needle site locations. So all your blood tests for those other things were negative, and no blood test is diagnostic for CIDP? They have to do all of these test to prove to insurance that there could be no other medical explanation.  Some of the blood tests were for autoimmune antibodies. Certain ones are known for GBS and CIDP.  The one I have is for sensory and motor demyelination.  This also showed up in my nerve/muscle tests. Why am I being downvoted for asking a question? (I am not accusing you, New2Narcolepsy.)\n\nIt is a simply a *question*, folks. It has a *question mark* at the end. I am not telling anyone what their experience is or what to do.\n\nI wanted to know if there is a blood test which definitively or strongly indicates CIDP so I can see if it is one of the blood tests I was given. If there is, and I was not given it, then my doctors have not ruled out CIDP. This information would be extremely useful to me. Thanks.  Good actually. She had a 4 day loading period with pretty much no side effects from the Gamunex (knock on wood for the future). Before every treatment she receives IV fluids to hydrate. She takes Benadryl each day which made her pretty tired. She was able to work from home with no issues.\n\nA few days after the last treatment she developed a minor headache, but nothing crazy and went away with Advil. \n\nWe do treatment at home. Treatment takes 4-6 hours.\n\nNow she will have 2 days of treatment every 3 weeks for 18 months. Treatment is going well so far. She had a 4 day loading period 2 weeks ago with pretty much no side effects from the Gamunex (knock on wood for the future). Before every treatment she receives IV fluids to hydrate. She takes Benadryl each day which made her pretty tired. She was able to work from home with no issues. Luckily we only had to pay $55 for all of this so far.\n\nA few days after the last treatment she developed a minor headache, but nothing crazy and went away with Advil.\n\nWe do treatment at home. Treatment takes 4-6 hours.\n\nNow she will have 2 days of treatment every 3 weeks for 18 months. I did not down vote you, and I do not see where you were.  You asked good questions, and I did not/do not mind answering them.  Here are the antibodies that are typically associated with CIDP along with other diagnostic tests:  ( Hope it helps! My computer's security software will not open that link but I saved the link and will try it elsewhere. Some computers are more persnickety than others. Thanks. No, I think it was one of the mods who downvoted me. One of them does not like me. I think she only wants people with a confirmed GBS or CIDP diagnosis posting in this subreddit. Do a search in Google for AME publishing CIDP.  The article will pop up as diagnostics insights into CIDP.  In the article you will see the chart of all of the autoantibodies.", ". I think lifes getting better. Thank you guys.", "Looking for some guidance background:   29M.  have had all vaccines my entire life, seasonal flu, tetanus, etc.  both pfizer covid doses in April.  still got covid &amp; pneumonia end of august.  fully recovered from that.  got flu shot on Tuesday afternoon.  \n\n\nFriday 1am my arm falls asleep (pins &amp; needles)  I move it around a bunch and it gets like 90% better.  but it is been at that 10% all day (noon on Friday now) and my other arm is starting to feel that way.  Researching online (never a good idea) has me worried it might be GBS starting.  What was the timeline like for those that developed it?  How quickly did things progress?  thank you in advance for the info a day. anything with legs? Its probably is not gbs. Your symptoms and the timing (too soon) do not suggest GBS.\n\nThe normal timeline of symptoms coincides with B-cell activity in the lymph, which is typically 10-18 days after exposure to the triggering antigen. Typical initial symptoms are severe fatigue, difficulty swallowing followed by severe (and persistent) weakness/paralysis in the extremities (typically lower legs) in 1-2 days. Also note that some patients do not experience a \"pins &amp; needles\" feeling at all, as there is a motor axonal-only variant. some off and on pins/needles feeling in left foot this afternoon Everyones GBS experience is unique but often  similar expression.  Those similarities and differences is what throws people off and their bias or pattern matching gets in the way. \n\nIf I posted my GBS experience many would suggest it is not GBS but it was. Not saying to ignore posts merely suggesting that Reddit posts can sometimes be worse than googling side effects.\n\n\nMy advise is to go to a neurologist that has direct experience with GBS as a precaution. Depending on where you live John Hopkins in Baltimore was one of the few places that could cut through the muck and give a clearer origin and path for what I had. \n\nNot that it is relevant but I had AMAN GBS which expresses itself quite differently than more common forms of GBS How are your reflexes? That is one of the first things they checked when I got it. If your reflexes are not reacting, you might be getting GBS.  It usually (but not always) will progress pretty fast, within a few days. Any time you are losing sensation and/or experiencing new sensations in a limb you must seek medical help. It is just really important to get help as soon as possible because no matter what it is, it is generally a sign of something. We are here for you if you have more questions or need support. My case of GBS came on quickly. I felt the pins and needles two days after receiving the Prevnar 13 vaccine. Day 5 I was paralyzed from the chin down. A spinal tap indicated GBS. A spinal tap is one way of determining a GBS case. I hope you dont have GBS, but if you do, keep a positive attitude - that is what got me through it all. Best of luck! Hello, I am kind of in the same boat as you\u2026 got my vaccine on Tuesday (12th October) and just feeling tingly ever since in the left arm and leg. How are you doing now almost a week later? You dont wait with neurological issues, period. sorry I do not check here often.  Not GBS.  tingles continued off and on, headaches got bad.  had a brain MRI last week with thankfully not much to note... seeing a neuro this week. Hello,\n\nNo problem at all! Thank you for the response. I have been getting terrible headaches starting in the late evening up until I go to bed. My tingles have also never completely gone away and come and go as well but have almost been consistent in my left leg. I just finished seeing a neurologist for 5 days straight, and got several EMG tests done. A little bit of a slow reaction was found in my left leg and right hand, but the doctor said it was nothing alarming and should resolve itself in about 3-6 months. He also stated that there could be a small chance that the vaccine caused nerve damage, but because I am still able to walk and do activities normally that there is no worry about it being GBS (also not exhibiting any other hallmark symptoms). He is ordering me an MRI so I will be getting that done soon as well.\n\nI think you and me both are at about 4 weeks post vaccination, and from what I have read the average GBS patient reaches their peak weakness from onset of symptoms at around 3 weeks. More and more I am thinking its not GBS, maybe CIDP? (but of course I cannot say anything for sure as I am not a doctor...) or maybe just some weird nerve stuff that will go away very soon. I hope you will start seeing some improvements soon, and that your neurologist appointments go well. after multiple neurologist appt's and MRI's, the rough conclusion is tingles were a one-off thing, but possibly caused by Chiari malformation.  also the likely cause of my back-of-the-head headaches, but not front.  front ones the doc thinks could be some long term effects of having COVID.", "Medical exception experience Has anyone successfully navigated getting a medical exemption from their employer related to Guillain-Barre syndrome?\n\nI understand due to sensitivities that one might not want to share their information publicly so feel free to DM me.\n\nAs a point of clarification everyone in my home is vaccinated but given the severity of my Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and a heart attack last year there are numbers of reasons why I am requesting a medical exemption. I had the Miller Fisher variant of GBS (suspected to be brought on by the HPV vaccine) and was intubated for three weeks. My PCP signed off on an exemption form but my employer (I work for a health system) denied me exemption. They suggested I receive either the Phizer or Moderna vaccine and advised against the J&amp;J due to my history of GBS. I received my second dose of the phizer vaccine about five weeks ago. To be honest, as terrified as I was to be vaccinated for the first time since having GBS almost ten years ago\u2026.. I am very relieved to be fully vaccinated against Covid especially since I have heard that having Covid itself has brought on cases of GBS. \nI am not a medical professional but this is my story, not sure if any of this helps you with your decision making but best wishes. It is recommended by the CDC that people with Guillan-Barre get the vaccine. When vaccinations first became available many of the GPS medical advisors suggested avoiding the vaccination similar to the way many GBS survivors are discouraged from getting flu shots. Because many of these people did a 180 without explanation as to why they shifted their opinion I am a little bit skeptical of what changed in that month period of time. With a sample size of one I can say I am okay. To me it appears the symptoms of COVID-19 are worse than GBS. Do what you feel is right, but you will have difficulty with a medical exemption, I suspect. Why do you not trust medical professionals? \n\nThey have a massive amount of data to show it is safe for GBS patients now including myself. Thanks for your OPINION. I was looking for help and not a lecture. I spend a whole lot of time looking at the data in the US and abroad so I am familiar with the data. The reason why I am asking in this sub is because I was hoping for help moving the ball forward for my case. The assumption (perhaps wrongly) was that given most of what this group has experienced we would have evolved beyond tribalism, questioning others decision or political ideology. \n\nIf you have a possible answer to my original question then I am all ears Sorry about your situation. Just a clarifying question: if you had a heart attack would not you want to get the vaccine? I thought people who contract COVID have a higher risk of cardiovascular problems. Fuck the CDC. The Pfizer vaccine gave me GBS. Your body gave you GBS The CDc only cares about doing what is good for the greater public, not people on an individual level. Brought on by the covid vaccination...  So sorry, after my last 7 months being a living hell I do not give a shit what the CDC recommends. Look at vaers. There are many reported cases of GBS following moderna, Pfizer and JJ. Highest with Pfizer last I looked. My nuero said absolutely no to the vaccine for me (had GBS 20 years ago) and she said she is been treating many people post vaccine for multiple neuropathy\u2019s and is reporting to vaers often. I would talk to your doctor and do a lot of research to see if it makes sense to take the risk. I got an exemption written by my nuero, waiting to see if it gets approved by my employer. Which is an odd feeling since my employer is not a dr. As someone who was told ten years ago to not get vaccinated to avoid the possibility of getting GBS again I can understand your fears/concerns. I also have liver issues and had some heart problems with a recent pregnancy. For me, what changed my mind was a combo of my exemption request being denied by the panel of doctors at the hospital I work for, the International GBS Foundations recommendation to receive the vaccine, and finding multiple posts on this group from GBS survivors who had already received theirs and not had a recurring case of GBS. It was still not a light decision for me but again I am so glad I got mine. I do believe all people who can safely be vaccinated should be vaccinated. With that being said, I do not know the entirety of your medical situation so to offer some help in navigating the process may I suggest the following if you have not already: I would start by meeting with your PCP and all specialists you currently see for your health issues. Get all their opinions. If at that point you  find/feel that it is in your best interest to avoid the vaccine and one of them suggests you do not receive it then have them complete your employer\u2019s vaccination exemption form. At that point it really is up to the employer to accept or deny it. If they deny it then it really comes down to a personal choice of wether to get it and keep your job or refuse it and find another place of employment that does not require the vaccine. I hope you navigate the best possible choice for you. Also, sending a thank you to everyone who has been vaccinated including your family. Of importance to what you said is this: VAERS is a database. There is a very low bar set (with good reason) for reporting POTENTIAL adverse events associated with vaccines to VAERS and anyone can report these events (patients, providers, manufacturers, and 3rd parties). But, correlation does not equal causation. VAERS is only a tool that allows researchers/manufacturers to attempt to identify any significant trends involving specific vaccines. So, please, take information found on VAERS with care. A lot of the reported events have nothing to do with receiving the vaccines. The best places to look for potential adverse effects are the Vaccine Information Statements as well as CDC recommendations/guidelines. And, of course, always consult with your care providers for advice on the best course of action for your specific health situation. When I was in the hospital for GBS. The doctors and the infectious disease doctors recommended to take the covid vaccine. I took the J&amp;J because that is what was offered. My rehab floor was two floors above the covid floor. With what they were seeing down there, they strongly recommended it. It sounds like the risk of getting COVID would be much worse for you. \n\nI had a severe case of GBS, Miller-Fisher, along with Hashimoto's approx 10 years ago. I had a mild reaction to the first Pfizer shot (muscle aches for a day) and no reaction to the second dose. I did not add this in my original post because it was not relevant to GBS. Since I got so many comments about a number of things on related to my request. I will tell you that my father died within days of getting the covid vaccination. He was in very good health and died a day later after going to visit a doctor who gave him a clean bill of health. I just recently contacted his physician to ask if his name was put in the VAERS database. The answer was no and it was a responsibility of the medical examiner. That actually is not true but I am not going to lecture a physician on his legal responsibility. So now I have to put his death into the VAERS database.\n\nI was going to stop reading this thread because  I was sort of bummed me out that I was getting downvoted (which is silly that I care at all) for just raising the question of raising the possibility of getting an exemption.\n\nAnd one last thing. I have a name of 17 people that died within days of getting the vaccination. So you might consider that coincidence, but the reality is that there are people who die after getting the vaccination. But does not mean people should not get the vaccination but it is definitely a vector that is not being shared with the public. I have received medical exemptions from my employer for their required vaccines. My neurologists have written the letters. I have CIDP. PM if you would like to.  They received a TON of data worldwide. That is how science works. It was significantly longer than a month as well before they changed the guidance.  I waited until the CDC said it was safe for for people who have had GBS. They also said mRNA only. I was extremely nervous, but actually getting COVID had the same risk of GBS re-occurrence. Not to mention all the horrible side effects including death. I sent you a PM. Thanks in advance I am taking risk of complications from covid, they mentioned heart issues. \n\n30% of what? 200% of what? Those percentages are meaningless without more context.\n\nEdit: Nvm, I reread what you said. That makes sense. \nThe risk of complications / death from COVID seems worse than getting GBS again. Plus there is the benefit of reducing the spread to others and putting less strain on the healthcare system.  If he did not take it he would not have gotten GBS   He already had it, it just did not present itself yet. When he gets better he will still have GBS he just will not have symptoms. My point is no one needs this experimental nonsense. Already know numerous people in my circle who died from it and others who got GBS. Where as they were all healthy individuals till they took the jabbaroni. Oh, you are one of those. I am not interested in debating fairy tales.  I am in the same boat as the OP. I had GBS about 15 years ago. 2 weeks in ICU, 6 months in a wheelchair, about 10 months of enough medications to kill a herd of horses, and about 1.5 years before I felt good again. All this at the ripe old age of 30. I work in defense, and am REQUIRED by my employer to get jabbed. The doctors that treated me told me not to ever get any vaccines again. I have had none since, not even a tetanus shot. I have been incredibly healthy since then as well. I did catch COVID at the end of July, it sucked for a solid week, but not nearly as bad as GBS. So now I am facing a termination of a very high paying job which I like, if I decide to refuse the jab. I am naturally immuned already, and am not afraid of the Ronies. My plan is to have a nuero or just an MD write a strong letter to my employer and hope for the best. Worst case; I do get a jab, but will have a paper trail of my reasonable objections along the way. Sorry to hear about your dad. I lost mine too early as well years ago. I hope the best for you in your mourning \ud83d\ude4f. The CDC is also recommending children get vaxxed. Other western countries are not even considering this madness. Follow the money; this is not about health. One thing I learned from how much time I spent I a hospital with GBS; it is always about money. I have not been to a hospital since having GBS, (except ER visits for stitches and broken bones). Our system is as corrupt as one can be. The only thing the CDC has done for me; it made some Pharma Stonks go up... other than that, it is an absolute worthless entity. I read one study on GBS and vaccines. They gave the subjects 2 hours to have a GBS reaction. If they had not shown symptoms of GBS in that 2 hour time frame, it was not the vaccine that caused it if it occurred later. That study showed the vaccine 100% safe. We believe in $cience after all\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. I would take COVID 1000x again before a GBS relapse. My COVID was bad, my GBS almost ended me... The other countries lagged behind us for adults, too. Seek help. A suggestion for you - your employer has a procedure for medical exemptions - or should.  I would read that first before asking your neurologist to pen a letter.  There may be a form to submit, or the exemption request has to answer specific questions. As of yesterday; they are claiming no exemptions \u201cat this time\u201d. I cannot see how they would have legal backing for not accepting medical exemptions, especially for something as controversial as GBS and vaccines AND that i have naturally acquired antibodies. I like my job, and like the people I work for, but am scared shitless of a GBS relapse. \ud83d\ude2c Short answer is under federal law (in the US), employers must have a process for medical (and religious) exemptions for vaccine mandates. They are not required to grant them, but there must be a process in place. 2 hours seems really low. Are you certain it was not 2 days? Its usually around 2-8 days from the initial virus for GBS to show symptoms. Nope. It was two hours . It made no sense to me at all; although they did get the end result they wanted.\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. If I can find that particular \u201cstudy\u201d, I will post a link. \ud83d\udc4d  I am in industry. I have to say it would be hard to have a 2 hour timeline for anything unless its for an allergic reaction. The studies are months long, are run in an extremely ethical manner with tons of documentation and oversight from 3 different parties.  There is no way Pfizer, Moderna, AZ or J&amp;J ran clinical trials like that....well because, for one..that is not how things are done. These studies are completely blind.  I would be interested to see the source if you find it. I hate to rain on your day but I would probably suggest vetting the source more thoroughly.  My feeling is its probably a fabricated article. I agree that is not how things should be done; it is exactly the reason that this particular study stood out so much in my mind. 2 hours and the medication has not even coursed through most of your body. If you work in that industry, I am curious if you are familiar with, and what your thoughts are on the Israeli study of 680k people that focuses on reinfections and breakthroughs; it seems like there is some interesting stuff there \ud83d\ude4f. I know my brother now has this condition after his Pfizer shot and they will not exempt him from a second one. He has lost function in half his face and his strength on one side of the body is less than the other side. Good luck trying to find a way.", "Another update I am done letting gbs control my life. It is been a month and a half since my diagnosis. I was in the hospital for a half a month receiving treatment and in rehab another month, I got home yesterday. I feel stronger but it is a long road to a full recovery. I am done letting it change who I am. Without a positive mindset I will not recover. Im starting extremely aggressive physical therapy this weekend. Im ready to get this over with and move on with my life. Thank you guys for all the support.", "What were your Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome symptoms and how were you diagnosed? Hi. I know this is not the place to seek medical diagnosis but I am just wondering if anyone has experience with GBS. Nov 15 early morning, I woke up with the worst itch in my legs and arms. Eventually I ended up with huge hives all over my body. Went to the ER and was administered with IV antihistamines and steroids and was sent home with prescription meds. By nightfall I noticed red blotches starting to appear in my arms. After an hour it has spread like wildfire all over my arms and legs. What is weird is they are not itchy and they do not appear like hives/welts, more like red blotches scattered all over my limbs. What worried me most is I started having tingling  in my hands and feet as if I am being poked with pins. Then the tingling started to go up my calves and my upper arm. I also felt stiff and my muscles were kind of tight. It went to a point my hands and feet felt a little numb as if I am wearing thick gloves when I touch something. I tried to ignore them as I did not think I needed urgent care (no difficulty breathing, paralysis etc).  \n\nJust to note also I received the following vaccines in the past month: \nAstraZeneca 1st shot - Oct 11 \nAnti rabies immunoglobulin- Nov 7 \nAnti rabies series shots - Nov 7, 10, 14 \nI also had diarrhea about a week ago but I suspected it was just common food poisoning.  \n\nCan this be possibly GBS? Does it usually warrant a visit to the ER?  \nAny shared experience would be very much appreciated. Thank you. Honestly I would go back to the ER and get checked out. I do not know if red blotches and marks are a symptom of GBS, but I would still be concerned, especially paired with the numbness and stiff muscles.\n\nI was originally admitted to the hospital after I went to the ER with bilateral facial paralysis. They did an lumbar puncture in the ER, my protein count was sky high, then I was admitted and treated with IVIG for a week. I left and for about 3 weeks I was fine.\n\nAfter 3 weeks I started not feeling great and went to the doctor. Had abnormal blood tests, specifically with my liver and kidneys, so I went to a hematologist. Like two days later I was so lethargic I could barely move. My mom and wife had to essentially carry me to the hospital. Was put on a breathing tube within 24 hours. Paralysis from the neck down. In NCCU for a week, regular neuro ward for another week, then inpatient rehab center for a few weeks after that re-learning how to see, walk, and function.\n\nIn terms of diagnosis, they first diagnosed me with Bell's Palsy, then AIDP, then Miller Fisher, now they just do not know what to call it because I showed conflicting symptoms.\n\nIf I were you, though, I would go back and see if they can run some blood tests. Better to do it now before things worsen. Hopefully this is temporary and you go back to normal soon. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you stay healthy. Could it be reactions from all the rabies shots? I do know most common cause of GBS is food poisoning. Might mention that when you talk to doctor.\n\n **( \n \n &gt;Campylobacter jejuni () is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in Europe and in the United States. The vast majority of cases occur as isolated events, not as part of recognized outbreaks. Active surveillance through the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) indicates that about 20 cases are diagnosed each year for each 100,000 people in the US, while many more cases are undiagnosed or unreported; the CDC estimates a total of 1. 5 million infections every year.\n \n^(( | )( | )( | )( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5) Desktop version of /u/Emotional_Beautiful8's link: &lt;\n\n --- \n\n ^(( ^(Beep Boop.

Treatment: 5 course IVIg with other medication for muscle and nerve pain.", "Covid and GBS/CIDP What experiences have you had with covid and GBS/CIDP/etc? How have vaccines gone? Have you had covid and how did it affect you?\n\nRemember, one key goal of this sub is to collect useful experiences because our condition has such little study and even anecdotal evidence could help, so please be as accurate and detailed as possible! I was diagnosed with GBS beginning of January and my Covid test results were negative. My doctors think it was pneumonia that caused it but they are not entirely sure. A few weeks prior to my hospitalization my roommate tested positive for Covid so I had to quarantine no matter what. We both got pretty sick and had similar symptoms. Cough, chills, sore throat, vomiting, fatigue, loss of taste, and headache. So while I believe I did have Covid my tests were negative and we cannot be %100 sure. I have yet to get the Covid vaccination as my doctor recommended against it the last time we met but said she would reach out to some neurologist colleagues of hers and she would let me know our next appointment if she thinks it is safe for me to go ahead. I am curious to see what others have been told and weather or not they have been vaccinated for Covid yet.\n\nAlso OP are you really Leslie Knope?  Ron Swanson is one of my favorite characters. I idolize him. I would eat breakfast foods with you. People who do not like breakfast food are idiots. ", "FDA expected to announce new warning on Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine related to GBS  Just came to post this. The New York Times has a story as well:  Did you get one of the vaccines? I had J&amp;J and had GBS over 10 years ago. I will probably opt for Moderna or Pfizer in the future if there is booster shots but still the statistical odds of getting GBS are still pretty low with the J&amp;J. I think everyone should take this article with a grain of salt. According to the ( GBS is estimated to affect about 1 person in 100,000 each year, or about **0.001% of people**. The article says there have been 100 reports of GBS out of 12.8 million doses, or **0.000781% of people**.\n\nThis is a significantly lower rate than the overall average of reported cases. I personally got Pfizer, but I do not think this should dissuade people from getting the vaccine if they have not already.\n\nAnd, of course, consult your neurologist/physician before any sort of vaccination.\n\nThank you u/mr3305 for the article! I definitely agree.  I got the Pfizer vaccine and have had no issues.  Thanks for helping put this in perspective. Eh. I think you would have a different perspective if you are here because of a vaccine gone wrong. I was diagnosed with GBS (specifically Miller Fisher syndrome) after getting the flu vaccine in 2019.\n\nBefore that, I was diagnosed with autoimmune hemolytic anemia after getting the MMR vaccine.\n\nI have had two autoimmune disease caused by vaccinations, and yet I still get them under the guidance of my neurologist as I would rather deal with the possibility of relapse or another autoimmune disease than have it on my conscience that I may be directly responsible for the sickness and/or death of another person.\n\nAs I said in my comment, please always consult your neurologist/physician.\n\nAnd, also, please do not assume you know my perspective or my medical history. If you want to shill for vaccines, this is not the forum for it. I did not read the article did they say the GBS occurrences are higher than normal rates per capita? Last time i checked they were not. COVID risks are way worse than GBS risks regardless. There haven' been any GBS incidents reported with the mRNA Vaccines.\n\n\nI went with the mRNA shot as suggested by the CDC earlier this year.  Pfizer 2 doses, everything went just fine.  Since I had my last shot in June I have had 4 friends who have died because they were sucked into believing propaganda and think the vaccines are a scam. I miss all of them (they were not stupid people) and all but one had an advanced degree in STEM disciplines.  \n\n\nBeing locked in the house for a year and keeping propaganda news and single sources of like minded radio on is freakishly unhealthy for people mentally and they did not even realize it.  The worst thing is without friends and peers to balance your thoughts or challenge you with conversation is it does not take much to go down rabbit holes. \n\n\n\nMy plan was to wait an extra 6 months. I only waited 2 before I dove in because of the health risks related to COVID (including that pesky death thing).\nDo not die get your shot. Please refrain from name-calling. If you have a problem with how the subreddit is operated then please submit a suggestion to mod mail. I think the article said the odds were about 3-5x higher for J&amp;J, mostly in older men. Still 3-5x higher of normal is still such a tiny percentage, the risk is relatively low. I definitely recommend everyone get their shots. Yeah, I totally agree. Get the one of the mRNA as suggested by earlier CDC guidance if its an option. Just a problem with your particular post today.  I think it is inappropriate.  I will be happy to explain more fully why in an email. I had GBS in 1995, unrelated. I had the Pfizer Covid vaccine with no real complications. No chance that I am going to take the risk to get this vaccine. The possible adverse reactions are too numerous for me to risk it for a virus where I have a 99.5% chance of recovery. I would rather take my chances of getting the virus than purposely give my immune system a reason to overreact. I had gbs 13 years ago, I got the moderna vaccine and had no issues at all.  2nd shot made my tired.  \n\nI also been living in a terrified bubble lol.   Decided to travel this summer because I feel safe enough to travel but it is been a paranoid 18 months. Same. At least with the virus u can take measures like getting vit d, zinc, stay healthy etc. Hey I am visiting this subreddit cause I found out the whole J&amp;J stuff and I do have a few of the symptoms I am going to my local clinic Wednesday to get it checked out I am probably overreacting but I want to know its like to have GBS I was for sure going to get it but wanted to wait to  see how other CIDP and gbs people did. Mental health won out and I went asap when I was allowed. No regrets. Eleven months at home was terrible. I wanted to go back to work in person. They are not numerous though, the risk of an adverse reaction to the vaccine is a lot lot lower than your risk of getting severely affected by covid. If you compare the adverse reaction numbers that are occurring to the amount that normally occur in a population then you can see quite clearly. What symptoms do you have? Shortness of breath, tingling on my face and hands but not all the time and I am sore in a few places on my lungs Again probably overreacting but just want to know Every year about 20,000 people in the US are diagnosis Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. There have been 13,000,000 people given the J&amp;J vaccine. That is roughly 5% of the population. 5% of 20,000 is 1,000 people. That means any given year about 1,000 people out of 13,000,000 people would have gotten it anyway.\n\nIt is therefore no surprise that they have come up with 100 cases. The naturally occurring number should be ten times that for the 13,000,000 people.\n\nI think it is a real stretch to then say all of these cases are a result of the vaccine. My bf is in the same boat. We both got j&amp;j and my bf has an auto inflammatory skin condition and he is super freaked out about this news. He is had back issues prior to the vaccine two weeks ago and he keeps getting intermittent pins and needles feelings in his legs and arms but it is not constant. His Dr was like well we will just keep an eye on the symptoms which is making him panic more. I hope all works out for you!! Bruh I just got off the phone with my doctor 30 minutes ago said the same thing he thinks it is because of stress cause I had a panic attack last Thursday now I have to watch for symptoms for like 3 weeks Vit D/Zinc does jack shit for polyneuropathy, but if that is a risk you are willing to take... I would rather just get one of the two other vaccines that are approved than risk getting GBS again. I was private messaging here on reddit with someone who got GBS from the J&amp;J vaccine. I wonder what the incidence of GBS from COVID is in that age group? It would not surprise me if it was the same or higher. The singer Christopher Cross got GBS after a bad bout of COVID. I would definitely go the mRNA vaccine route now that this information is known COVID can cause GBS too along with many other complications like permanent heart and lung damage among other things. I would go the mRNA vaccine route given this new information unless you plan to bunker down for another year or two to avoid COVID. I am happy that everyone who wants to get the vaccine can get one. I am not going to get it and I am going to live my life. The best thing everyone can do is get in better shape because the people who are overweight are having the most problems with Covid. The singer Christopher Cross got GBS after catching COVID. The risks from COVID go far beyond simply surviving it. Whenever I hear some unvaccinated person say they are going to \u201clive their life\u201d I always think their risk calculation is questionable at best. Not saying there is any easy choice here for those of us who have already had GBS. The article says there are 3-6k cases of GBS in the US every year. The fact that GBS happened within 6 weeks of the vaccine does strongly suggest a causal link. I am more concerned about blood clots, myocarditis, neurological issues, and other problems that people have been reporting. I also know 3 people who are having health problems since they received the vaccine...and it is been months. I could not care less what you think about my risk calculations. Many adverse events have occurred because of the vaccines and everyone needs to decide what is best for them. Life is not without risk. I agree, it is not an easy choice for us! I would argue that you are not properly accounting for the risks of getting COVID and are focused disproportionately on the risks of getting the vaccine. Were they under 50 do you know? It is incredibly rare, hence the sub being very small for those who have been positively diagnosed. The chances are immensely stacked against you developing GBS, but keep an eye out and good luck. In their 40\u2019s. Thanks man will do I was talking about Corona not GBS vit d and zinc are not going to help. What does then? You will be downvoted to the South Pole for writing about \\*any\\* apprehension about these vaccines here.\n\nI for one, think it is perfectly ok to be concerned about any product you want to stick in your body. \n\nI am not ok with the people that feel the overwhelming desire to come on here and purposely attempt to invalidate your genuinely felt opinions on the matter. Thanks for your response. I agree completely.  I was on a call (called the coffee chat or something) sponsored by the   \nGBS/CIDP foundation.  There were 19 of us on the call.  2 were new GBS   \npatients that developed within 2 weeks of the Pfizer Covid vaccine both convinced that the vaccine was the cause.    \nThere was one other person on the call (previous GBS) that had an adverse reaction to the   \nModerna vaccine that required hospitalization.   \nAt the end of the day follow the advice of your provider and make the choice that you feel is best for you. Same. Why chance it when 1.) the survival rate is extremely high and 2.) those of us who have gotten GBS in the past no damn well it is not a joke so why chance getting GBS or other side effects from the vaccine. \n\nThe best way to combat covid is to literally not be obese as something like 70% of covid related deaths have been obese people. Family member currently in the hospital with GBS as a result of the J&amp;J vaccine\u2026I know that it is statistically uncommon, but makes you wonder if the true percentage is higher How long did it take after getting the shot before the symptoms started?

He is too bad even for physical therapy\u2026 Has he started IVIG or plasmapheresis? He did, but neither led to improvement. Devastating because what can you do at this point?? How is he doing now? Unfortunately, no change. At this point we are not sure if he will ever get better", "New diagnosis, feedback Hey everyone, glad to see a community here. \n\nSo I fracture my spine back in May which has been a PIta but I am working through it. On Thursday this week, I noticed my feet were \u201cfunny\u201d and over the course of two hours I lost the ability to move my toes. Well with the spinal injury I had been told over and over to go the ER if anything like that happened\n\nHandful of hours later, I cannot move my toes or ankles at all and they are admitted me from the er into the hospital\n\n16 hours after my initial symptoms at home I have a likely diagnosis. I am on my first IVIG treatment 36 hours after my first symptom. \n\n\nAs I read through the comments I am just trying to get a realistic expectation on what to expect. We figured it out early but all the stories here seem to be saying it is going to get significantly worse before it turns around.\n\nAt this point, I can life my knees up off the bed maybe 1/2\u201d but it seems to have stopped there(for now)\n\nI am in a good mood and am ready to fight this. Any thoughts or tips are appreciated It sounds like you have a great team of doctors that were on the lookout for GBS.  From my knowledge that as soon as they start treatment and you respond then it should not progress any further. Of course the doctor should be answering any questions you have.  Stay strong, good luck! The good news is that is it was diagnosed and treated fairly quickly. Recovery is harder to gauge, depending on your age. I have seen teens get back to walking within a few weeks but older patients will take longer. Keep fighting but remember to be kind to yourself. You got this. :) Your story sounds similar to mine. 48 hours after my first symptoms, I was in the hospital on IVIG treatment.   It was somewhere between the second and third of 5 IVIG treatments before things stopped getting worse.  It was about 2-3 months of rehab before I was clear enough of symptoms to not have nagging worries in my head everyday.  To this day 9ish years later I still do not fatigue how I did before, and face tiny panic attacks if a limb goes to pins and needles from bad positioning. \n\nIn my personal case, I was at my best as the IVIG was being given to me as well. As an example, during my third treatment I was suddenly able to text with my phone quite easily.  I woke the next morning with almost all of the same hand and arm control problems from the day before though.  It was a lot of 2 steps forward and 1-2 steps back in the first two weeks.  Roll with it and keep fighting. \n\nIf this subreddit shows anything though, it shows that the details in every case are not the same.  I, though honestly I think it is safe say We, wish you luck. I am taking daily B12 shots, much more than typically prescribed. If you have trouble walking I recommend Vibram 5 Fingers. Good luck! For me, once I do IVIG it stops progressing. But we are all different. Stay positive. I know it might sound strange but I did a lot of visualizing while recovering: I would imagine growing back my myelin sheath,  it helped me hold on to a calm, positive space in the middle of something I would never encountered before...", "Brain Fog I has GB when I was a toddler and have gratefully largely recovered from it. I am 28 now and for the past 6 years I have had this brain fog. It is this muddy feeling and it feels like it limits your mental capability from day to day.

You been to a doctor about it? Does not sound like a GBS thing to me, since it only affects your peripheral nervous system, not your brain.

It is happened several times this year.", "Discussion Topic: Recovery tactics What did you do for recovery? Any specific exercises you found useful? Any dietary changes which helped? What was the hardest part of recovery and how did you cope? For me the hardest part was my stamina. I feel like I do not even belong her with how easy I had it compared to others. Within a few weeks you would not have been able to tell I was ever paralyzed like I was. I had an amazing recovery but my stamina took a while to recover. \n\nFor me it was just getting back into things that increased my endurance. Anyone with info on miller fisher recovery I would love to hear about your experience also. seems to be a very small community In my case I was not able to properly follow a physical therapy in a neurological center, due to distance. My second option was going to a public rehabilitation center for several conditions, perhaps there I would have undergone better therapies, however several doctors advised my family not to take me there, because they reasoned that I would be exposed to people in much worse conditions than me, since I was already severely depressed, such environment would possibly worsen my depression. \n\nThe third option, and the one I took, was instructions from a traumatologist who indicated me certain exercises I had to do two or three times a day. Nothing too strenuous, mostly trying to walk every day (avoiding using any kind of help) and a few floor exercises. I really was not able to see any kind of improvement for weeks until my family was able to locate a swimming pool where, on advice from the traumatologist, I was able to do exercises inside the water on a daily basis. That is when I was able to perceive a difference.\n\nPlease note, when I started physical therapy I was mostly moved around in a wheelchair and barely could stand up with a walker. Getting to the point of walking mostly without help took about a year, walking with confidence, specially going down stairs took much longer. \n\nThe hardest part was feeling that at any point it would be back, specially because at the onset there was this burning sensation in my thighs, that felt similar to the burn you feel after exercising. So, when I did physical therapy, sometimes I would feel this burning sensation, and I was not sure it was because it was normal due to the exercises I was doing or it was because I was about to have another bout. \n\nLosing years of my life has not been kind to me on a professional level. When I had it, I was just graduating from college, and believe me employers do not like seeing gaps after graduation, more than once I was downright denied employment because of it. This is another difficulty that a person going through it will face. \n\nI hope that you or the person close to you that is going through this will get physically and psychologically better. Keto/Carnivore Diet definitely helped me recover faster. The exercises that really helped me out in the begging were stretching and swimming. The most difficult part for me was staying patient once I saw improvement. Once I was able to start walking and becoming independent it was frustrating not being able to do all of the activities that I wanted. It was also embarrassing when I met new people and they did not understand why I moved slower or did not really want to do any sports/physical activities. I have now made a full recovery and the biggest issue for me at this stage is more fatigue after any physical activity - it just takes me longer to recover. I am currently a little over 4 months into MFS recovery.  I still cannot close/blink my eyes, but I am starting to get some of my facial movement back.  It is been about three weeks since the double vision went away.  Where are you in your recovery? I was diagnosed on 12/9 but I was 36 weeks pregnant so my symptoms were not immediately recognized as MFS. I have been released from occupational therapy and have almost all of my hand dexterity back. I am still in physical therapy but I no longer need a walker and rarely use my cane. Mostly now I am just working on stamina and balance. \n\nMy left side of my face has made very little progress. My left eye does not close completely and my vision is pretty significantly impaired in that eye. I am starting to get very small movement in my left eyebrow, still not able to smile. \n\nI have been referred to an opthalmologist to determine whether the vision changes are permanent and a rheumatologist to consult about the affect on the immune system. I am going to another neurologist for a second opinion and I am taking gabapenton and a high dose of steroids. I still have pretty significant all over pain. I was told most people are ~95% recovered after about 6 months so I have always had that timeframe in mind. Have you had any electrode therapy on your face? No, my neurologist mentioned it but it did not seem worth it to me. Have you? Yes I have it twice a week in speech therapy and I feel like it is the only reason I have made the tiny progress I have with the facial paralysis. &gt;What did you do for recovery?\n\nAfter I got released from hospital, I hit the gym everyday. I did strength training. Of course, the instructor increased the number and tenacity of the exercises very gradually. Going to gym helped a lot. Really. This is the single most important factor in my recovery. And I cannot stress this enough.\n\nI took two multivitamins prescribed by my neurologist.\n\n&gt;Any specific exercises you found useful?\n\nEvery exercise is important. But specifically **alternate hip touch** made me feel better in the first days of recovery. **Plank** helps, too. **Leg raise (front, back and side)** is also helpful. It is very important to hit the gym every day and do the full set/sets as advised by your trainer regularly. Cannot stress enough on regularity and doing the full sets.\n\n&gt;Any dietary changes which helped?\n\nI increased protein and vitamin intake (natural and no supplements) significantly and cut down carbohydrate radically. I also take a small serving of dry fruits every morning after breakfast (5-6 raisins, 5-6 cashew nuts, 2 walnuts, 2 dates, 4 almonds). This helps with my energy level.\n\n&gt;What was the hardest part of recovery and how did you cope?\n\nHardest part was the fear of relapse, i.e. this happening again. I read a lot of research paper. (I am a Physics major undergrad and took Biology in High School). And my type of G-B was diagnosed as AMAN. The chance of relapse was very low (5%) according to multiple research papers. This helped. I delved deep into spirituality. That helped significantly.\n\nAnd I felt very dreary and was feeling like I was dying rather than recovering on the first 3-4 days after I was released from hospital.\n\nIt might look like I was diagnosed a lot ago, but I was diagnosed on third week of January, 2020. And was released 13-14 days later. I was in ICU for 10-11 days and in general ward afterwards. I did not have to cope with respiratory failure, but the doctor put me in ventilation as a precautionary measure. It was also easy to aspirate fluids from inside me.\n\nThe most painful part was the ventilation tube and the pain that came after removing it. The feeding tube is painless but it was removed after 3 days after I was brought out of ventilation. Those three days were extremely painful. Every moment of them.\n\nThe kind treatment from doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and other hospital staff was really instrumental in my mental well being.\n\nI am 20M, in college, studying Physics and Computer Science. what is the way to know if you have GBS or not? i have numbness and latnernating pain, burning, numbing and cold on all limbs, started 2 weekas ago\n\nwhat were the twoo multivitamins you took?

I wanted to know if tremors were a sign of GBS. Every time I look up symptoms it does not state that, but for the last few days my body has been vibrating. Started off as just my feet a few days back,, now that is stopped and I am pretty sure it is my upper or middle body right now.. should I be concerned about that? Thank you. Be careful about worrying about a relapse, stress is a trigger. I am 12 years post and have been left with quite a bit of residual effects and tremors being one of them. My advice to you is to learn your new normal, track your symptoms and the triggers that cause them and/or make them worse. Do your best to not overly stress or get overly emotional. Take care of yourself and rest when your body needs it, ie when sick and/or experiencing increased residual effects. You are right and thank you for the advice. I have been stressing a ton lately. A complete shift from last year. Part of that may be cause I actually got sick this year compared to last year.\n\nEither way I have been trying to chill, but sometimes idk if I am having numbness or shaking because of anxiety or because of GBS and that scares me.", "What questions should we be asking of our neurologists regarding ANY vaccine?

IE, should I just go to Walgreens and get them all done at once, or?\n+ My GBS was X years ago, what has changed in our knowledge of GBS (esp wrt vaccines) should I be aware of?\n\n+ After vaccination, how when might I expect a GBS reaction to take place, and what might be early indications of that\n+ Who should I call if I fear a recurrence?\n\n----\n\nWhat would you ask?  \nWhat are your concerns? The problem is doctors do not know the answers to these questions and will either say they do not know, or make up answers that are not science-based. I have never gotten a straight answer, even from those regarded as experts in their respective state.\n\nA key question would be to ask them to describe the specific mechanism GBS caused by infection and how could this lead to increased risk of recurrence if exposed to the infection or a vaccine containing the same antigens?\n\nIn my experience, most medical practitioners cannot explain why a variety of infectious are all associated with GBS and hence do not understand why certain infections and vaccines can lead to cases or recurrence.\n\nYou can tell they do not know what they are talking about if they just cite generalised immune system activation (cytokines etc), or generalised bystander activation, or cite autoreactive T-cells, despite the fact that there is no evidence of autoreactive T-cell receptors associated with GBS\\* and infections have nothing do to with the failure of T-cell negative selection in the thumus hence an autoreactive T-cell based mechanism would occur at any time and have any obvious association with infection.\\*(yet - there is one ongoing study in Switzerland which should settle the matter.)\n\nSome medical practitioners often parrot nonsense about \"molecular mimicry\" without understanding that molecular mimicry is not a mechanism (but merely a mechanistic constraint) and ( not autoimmunity. Most only have a very superficial understanding of B-cell mechanisms and what can go wrong.\n\nThere is a distinct lack of studies focusing on recurrence following vaccines, in fact there are only two which studied incidence, both were retrospective medical record studies. One study in California found a lack of vaccine associated cases, but only had statistical power to rule out an incidence of less than 1/100 doses. Most recurrence cases were associated with infections and can occur decades after the initial case. (\n\nA more recent study found the Pfizer vaccine resulted in 1 excess case in about 500-600 cases.(\n\nOther cases have been reported after the Moderna vaccine as well as COVID itself. Clearly the common link is the spike protein itself. (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote that this year alone has seen strong evidence of the J&amp;J, AZ and ( vaccines associated with \\*excess\\* GBS cases. Note that I said excess cases, since vaccines can both cause and prevent GBS cases since the underlying symptomatic infection itself can lead to GBS cases and vaccines lower the risk of symptomatic infections. In cases such as Influenza where exposure risk varies from year to year means the relative risk varies and is also why self-controlled case series studies can suffer from biases unless they have very long followup periods. Other known triggers cited by the (US) CDC are ( (\n\nSome doctors will try to claim that each trigger is somehow unique and cases from one trigger will not lead to increased risk from other triggers - but that claim is not science based. Recurrent GBS cases are often linked with different triggers. (\n\nAll of these triggers do have something in common. They are all related to infectious pathogens that contain surface or secreted proteins that bind to sialic acid containing glycolipids or glycoproteins - and the known autoantibodies associated with GBS (such as gangliosides and siglecs) all contain sialic acid residues. This suggests the underlying mechanism is B-cell cocapture (of foreign antigen bound to self antigen containing a sialic acid residue, as demonstrated here: (\n\nThe risk of recurrence depends on the rate of B-cell capture by the specific autoreactive memory B-cells. Which in turn depends on where those B-cells happen to reside and the availability of the foreign antigens and self-co-antigens being presented by (mostly) dendritic cells, as well as T-cells which are sensitive to the foreign antigen. Thank you for this. I had GBS in 1996 and had not seen some of these studies. Your answer is very thorough and I appreciate it! I weigh the issue of vaccines with the chances of the disease - my GBS happened after a case of bronchitis. Got covid vaxxed and boosted with no problems! Well thank you, you are obviously better informed than I, but I am not sure how I turn your comment into a list of questions I can provide my doctor to chat with the neurologist about\n\nI am also not quite certain how that translates into a list in our wiki to provide to others to ask their doctors about\n\n----\n\nI am not actually hiring the doctor, I just want to get some knowledge about his expertise and get her advice on which vaccines to take or avoid, and what to do should GBS recur Thank you for all of the information. \"The problem is doctors do not know the answers to these questions and will either say they do not know, or make up answers that are not science-based.\"Sadly this is the case with Guillan barre. The experts are not quite sure how EXACTLY it happens.\n\nThe questions should be put in a way that minimizes them doing guesswork and that is pretty hard. I suggest you see more than one neurologist and compare their answers to get an idea. (and read the studies they might refer to) At the end of the day you will be the one who will be rolling the dice.\n\n\"What new procedure, treatment, drug is new, on the way?\" would be my addition to the questions you might ask. I am coming back to let you know how dismayed I am by your answer, which I fear poisoned this thread by\n\n+ requiring perfection from your doctors\n+ in unhelpful to the majority of GBS patients who\n  + have little ability to even ask these questions, much less understand the answers\n  + have little ability or time to read these studies and understand them, esp., because citing one study or even two provides a very partial picture\n + ***have almost no ability to cycle through multiple doctors asking them these questions each time since they are limited by referrals, insurance, etc.***\n\nNow maybe what you intend to say is that for most GBS sufferers, it is just fucking hopeless and you advise just giving up.\n\nBecause that is what I get from your message.\n\nIf that is not what you would tell an acquaintance worried about their mother who has GBS, to either\n + give the fuck up\n + read a week of papers\n\nThen maybe you can rethink, take pity on us, and give us a simple set of questions. Hi, I apoligise for derailing your thread, I was just sharing my (jaded) perspective based on my experience and frustrations. \n\nI did propose a question to add to your existing set of questions:\n\nDescribe the specific mechanism GBS caused by infection and how could this lead to increased risk of recurrence if exposed to the infection or  a vaccine containing the same antigens? \n\nAnd follow up questions if the stated mechanism does not seem to explain why GBS seems to be associated with a variety of different infections and recurrence likewise is often triggered by a different infection. (for example 'molecular mimicry' only applies to Campylobacter Jejuni associated cases and cannot explain other cases of GBS)\n\nAsk them what their knowledge is based on - how many peer reviewed *primary* research studies have they read on your illness (GBS or CIDP or MFS) in the last few years?\n\nI would also ask:\n\nWhat is the risk of additional long-term disability if there is a recurrence?\n\nCould the vaccine trigger \"mild\" worsening of symptoms, such as autonomic symptoms or persistent chronic fatigue that might not be considered a recurrence of GBS, but is nonetheless debilitating?\n\nWhat is the risk of recurrence due to the underlying infection itself and what is the (individualised risk) of being infected given one's specific day to day life? (The risk for a healthcare worker who works in a hospital is very different to someone who is housebound).\n\nWhat are the legal consequences and avenues for compensation for long term disability/loss of quality of life? For example, if an employer mandates vaccination, are they liable for long-term disability? \n\nAsk about whether your medical insurance or income insurance will exclude you due to a \"preexisting condition\"? (and leave you with large bills if you are hospitalised or unable to work for a long period of time.)\n\nMost importantly, will the medical practitioner support me to pursue such legal action or negotiation with employers or disability providers or income insurance if there is a recurrence?\n\nKeep in mind that I am not assuming all readers will be residents of the USA (or Canada) - each country has different systems.", "Is this curable? I am currently hospitalized with Guillain Barre. My IVIG gave me aseptic meningitis and I am now recovering from that and on plasmapheresis and plasma transfusions.  I keep getting mixed answers from doctors, staff, and the internet so here is my question:\n\nIs this syndrome curable - as in able to be treated fully and no longer in my body/able to come back?\n\nIf not, is it possible to relapse?  Is GBS something I need to be concerned about when it comes to activities for the rest of my life (I am a phlebotomist, full time student, and a pretty active person). I can only comment as I had it as a child. Adult recovery will be a little different. \nIt is been 32 years since I was hospitalised.\nIt took a few years before I was back to 100% but I have lived the majority of that time normally. \n\nThe syndrome is curable. \nThe changes of relapse are extremely low. \nEveryone is recovery differ\u2019s as it impacts everyone slightly differently. \n\nGood luck on your journey. It is not technically \u201ccurable\u201d. But treatable. I am 5 month in, and cannot believe I am walking and doing almost everything I was before. It is tough early on. I never thought I would be where I am or that I could make a full recovery. But I am. And you will to. The worry is the hard part. Calm your mind as best you can. You will be just fine! Almost all GBS patients make a full recovery. I got diagnosed in October 2020. I was told there is no cure for this, it can be treated with the IVIG and physical therapy  to where you appear and feel recovered ( i think i reached this stage 2 months ago and went back to work) but i have read numerous stories of people getting it again, especially older people. I still have lingering effects of it, my legs get very tired and sore when walking a long distance, like around a zoo or mall. That did not happen to me until GBS. I also have to be very careful in the shower as i have fallen before because my legs turned numb all of a sudden. Just do not stop your physical therapy when you are released from the hospital. It helped me tremendously. I wish you a speedy recovery \u2764\n\nI am editing to add i was hospitalized for a week and then transferred to a rehab hospital for 12 days. I did physical therapy for 5 weeks when i got out, a physical therapist came to my home. I also had several weeks of occuputional therapy as well. Do you have any walking assistance such as a cane or walker?  Sorry if that is too much to ask No cure. Just management. You will learn a lot about it as you progress through your recovery. This subreddit can be a big help to you, I think. Not too much to ask at all! I did use a walker for at most about 2 weeks,  it was not that my legs were weak necessarily but I just could not feel them at all. Ok thank you :) I bought a walker and a cane for whenever I get out of the hospital because I am so unsteady on my feet.  My gait is completely messed up and I am having to learn how to walk again. \n\nIt feels like all the doctors are telling me to think positive and that miracles can happen but I am more of a realist and just want to be prepared. I was diagnosed a little over a year ago. 5 rounds I if, ventilator for a week, and another week icu. They do not know what triggered it for me. I have been told that it is not \"curable\" but you manage it. I have also been told that relapse is really really rare. But it is also rare in women and the young. (I am both). I am 18 months out from my DX and 15 months being released from the hospital.  I no longer have feeling in my feet and nerve pain in my left leg from the knee down.  I was told by both my Neurologist and Internist that the relapse rate is about 3%.  I look at it as I have a 97% chance of never relapsing and I am good with those odds.\n\nBest of luck with your recovery!  \ud83d\ude0a Thank you.  If it is not managed (if I stop doing the physical therapy or whatever else is needed) will the paralysis come back?  Or will it just stay dormant and I have the effects from the peak of things to deal with? I got GBS in Aug 2018. I was completely paralyzed, intubated, and was in hospital for 1 month, inpatient rehab for another month at Moss Rehab, then a few more months of outpatient physical therapy. As long as you are determined and do all of the therapies as you recover, you eventually will be able to walk without a cane or walker. By January 2019 I was back to normal; My residual effects are numb toes and chronic fatigue syndrome. Once you have completed your therapy, the paralysis will not return if you stop doing therapy. Hang in there, it is tough while recovering, but stay focused and you will be fine. Good luck! Well think of it this way, you will absolutely get past this and back to normal. Why it takes people a bit more time than others, that is one of the many unanswered questions that this syndrome has, why does it effect people so differently. I feel like doctors would be doing a disservice to patients if they did not encourage them to be positive about getting better, as being anxious or depressed about the thought of being sick or out of work for a long period of time can really take a toll on people and our mental health is very important to take care of, too. I can say for me personally in our physical therapy group all but one person had GBS as a very recent onset. There was only one person that had been in the rehab clinic longer than a few weeks (out of around 15 people). 25 y/o female here too! I am so sorry you are going through this and your doctors/ nurses cannot really give you a solid answer to your question. \nI went through almost the same thing, everyone avoided actually answering my concerns, and when I broke down after going on google, they basically told me to just stop googling and focus on getting better. I truly think this disease hits each patient so differently so they cannot give a definitive answer at the beginning of treatments. When my second round of IVIG started doing its thing and I was regaining my ability to talk, the doctors finally did say that this was curable and I was going to be able to \u201cgo back into society\u201d whatever that means.  \nIn my case I did not get aseptic meningitis from the IVIG, but i am about 90% recovered. I work full time again half from home and half at the office. I have slowly started exercising again, and my tastebuds are creeping it is way back. I just walked about 40 min around my town by myself just this weekend! I \nalso wanted to add that my doctor said the chances of my relapsing is very low but there is a very very small chance. Hi, I know it is tough to get straight answers.  Some doctors think they they are being helpful by not giving something that may not be accurate.\n\nThe better way to think of this is not 'cure' like cancer but 'recovery' like a sport injury.  The 'injury' is the time when the damage to your nerves happens, but that event does not last long. \n The rest of the time is helping your body recover from that damage.  With the treatments they have today, most people 'recover' from GBS, and many recover fully.  Since you are young and active, though are good signs for recovering fully.  Your doctors can give an estimate of how long and how likely recovery can take, but these tend to be just probabilities.  Doing physio and listening to your doctors is the best way to maximise those odds. \n\nThe main way that GBS is *not* like a sport injury, is that some small percentage of people get a reoccurrence of the nerve damage itself.  From my understanding, this is rare, but again, your doctors can help answer this. Thank you. This makes so much sense and will help my view on things so much. Thank you so much for responding.  It is good to hear that there is someone else who went through something so similar.  I cannot wait to \u201cgo back into society\u201d and get out and about.  Of course I say that as I am waiting for my morning labs to get drawn but IT WILL HAPPEN! No problem at all, I feel you! It is really just a wave of so many emotions is not it? I truly had never been really sick in my life, so not being able to do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted took a huge toll on my mental health too. \nI do not want to scare you, but I thought I would mention my menstrual cycle too bc I have not seen many people mention it here. I have not gotten mine back and I think I have skipped about 2 cycles now. It may be due to the weight loss I experienced during treatment, or it may be the IVIG kind of shocking my system. Just thought it might be something to keep in mind as well. \nDms are always open if you have any questions or just want a fellow ex-patient to talk to! Haha good luck on another day, sending you well wishes \ud83d\udc95 Happy to help.  I know it is a scary time.  Everyone is case is different, but I was also young and healthy when I had it, and I recovered fully.  I am still a little clumsy, but my friends tell me I was clumsy before the GBS too. ;). I was in a wheelchair for about 2 months, and it took me about 6 or 7 months of physio and recovery to feel confident walking reasonable distances unaided.  Since then, I have even run a couple of marathons, mostly to prove to myself I could. No. Once the paralysis is gone, relapse is highly unlikely. Since you have GBS, as opposed to CIDP (somewhat like a chronic GBS), you will only be getting a few plasmapheresis rounds now. The attack does not usually last more than 2 weeks. Once you are done with that, you will do physical therapy until you get back to normal. At that stage you will be back to normal and hopefully will not need anything. I am 20M, 10 months in and I still cannot walk independently but my case is super rare. Most are recovered by 6 months or far less. If you ever want to talk feel free to send me a message. Every case presents differently. That said, only a very small number of people do have recurrences, but that is not due to any lack of treatment, therapy, etc. My neurologist always told me the chance of getting it again was the same as getting it the first time -- very very small. Not sure if that is the same advice given today, though. I had my sole bout with GBS 25 years ago and never had any of the treatments like plasmapheresis that are common now. You have a 95% odds of getting back to normal or close to it- you are young and your body will come back it just takes time.  Reoccurrence is extremely rare- I had a reoccurrence 25 years on from my first time( I was a senior in high school).  Anyway, while I have more residuals- like numb toes, some nerve damage in my legs- I am mostly normal even after a reoccurrence.  In between I totally lived my life.  You just need to give your body time to heal, and take rehab seriously, and you will probably need more rest/ particularly in the first year. Your nerves will repair themselves- it just takes a while.", "New here - glad to find this Hello everyone - my doctor is working towards a possible CIDP diagnosis for me. I have had a slow onset and now the symptoms are weakness in legs and hands, tingling and numbness. The nerve conduction study shows mild demylination - 2 diff doctors did it to make sure. \n\nThe doctor mentioned its treated with Ivig. I wanted to check if its possible for the disease to just burn out for a few treatments and go into remission for long time? \n\nJust looking for something positive as this is all very new and scary for me. Hi there and welcome!\n\nI went into remission with CIDP about 10 years ago, and it has not come back. In that time I have found that it is very personal, and it almost appears that no two cases are the same, especially when it comes to symptoms and responding to treatments.\n\nPersonally I was on IVIG for about 7 months after steroids had no effect in halting the progression. IVIG courses worked and I was making great improvement. \n\nI ended the treatment against doctor's advice and was left with symptoms and mobility issues that I learned to live with, with difficulty at first. Some positive news though is that as you mentioned, the disease pretty much did \u201cdie out\u201d on it is own after about 5 years. I am able-bodied and have not been back for a CIDP-related health appointment for over a decade now.\n\nThere is no doubt weird things happen with my body, and I do often get reminders of neurological damage, such as always having cold feet, and the fact I have poor grip. However, I have been able to continue with a normal life, I am physically strong as a weight-lifter and full-time working manual labourer.\nThat said you could talk to other people who have had a totally different recovery.\n\nThe good news is that generally, the earlier you get diagnosed and start treatment, the better your chances are at reversing it and regaining mobility. \n\nI am not sure If just a \u201cfew\u201d treatments will cut it \u2013 it depends on how much the demyelination progressed and how your body reacts to the drug. Thanks for your kind words and sharing your experience. Seems like I can only hope for the best here. I also love lifting weights and running, was in the best shape of my life until 3 weeks ago when I realized i was unable to run! You sound kind of like me! I was diagnosed with GBS at first, and then CIDP. I was on IVIG for around 8 months and steroids for close to a year. IVIG stopped doing anything around month 4 or so. After a year with my neurologist (who diagnosed me with CIDP), I decided to stop the treatment. Went to a different neurologist who got me off steroids, even though they thought that I had CIDP anyways. Have not been to a neurologist in 3 years (everything started 4 years ago). Good to hear that (perhaps) I did not make the wrong choice! My onset was really slow and took awhile for Drs to believe when I said something was wrong. Finally had a neurologist who worked as a team with me to figure out out. After I was diagnosed, my Dr wanted me to do ivig, but insurance denied and said I have to do more conservative methods. Even though I am allergic/ have adverse reactions to steroids, I did them for a month to please insurance so they would approve ivig. \n\nI was so incredibly lucky my Dr ordered an at home nurse to come once a month instead of going to a center. My treatments were for three days, once a month. By about a year, I was mostly back to full mobility. I had a medi port put in my chest about 5 months in because none of the nurses could easily find a vein with all the scar tissue from previous blood work and ivs. I had it removed a month or two after he felt like I was done with ivig\n\nLast month was my sixth year in remission! Woot! I still have residual limb issues. Mostly with strength and temperature. Some numbness. \n\nIt is scary. I am sorry you are experiencing this. Looking back now, I do not remember much of the details. But I do know how relieved I was to finally have an answer for what was happening. Focus on that. And that overcoming this is possible!! Thanks for responding and really really glad to know you are in remission and hope it stays that way forever! When you said the onset was slow - how slow was it exactly? Because I read that you can hope for complete remission only if you have somewhat of a sub acute onset. \n\nFor me - i remember that my left leg used to feel just a bit weaker while running last year on and off. I was totally normal for most of this year, ran a half marathon distance in August end. In September I started noticing my running was getting slower and October I just could not run at all, started to feel uncoordinated while walking, the numbness and tingling kicked in, hands got weak as well. The doctor did the physical examination and sent me home but I went to another doctor for the emg and voila slowed conduction speed in the mid 40s and prolonged distal latency. I can still run for a bit and walk/do other things normally. The numbness and tingling has been replaced by weird burning and dull pain at different points in my arms and legs which comes and goes. Now waiting for my next appointment and hoping to get the treatment started.", "Looking for some input from you all ", "One year ago today was the start of GBS: progress report. I was about to write a different post, and then I realized that today is the one-year anniversary of the onset of my wife's GBS. This is my first post here.\n\nHers was a rapid onset. She had some soreness and weakness one evening. She thought it was because of the extra work she was doing over the few days prior. The following morning her legs were much weaker, and she was starting to feel it in her hands and arms. I took her to the E.R. where she got to see every single E.R. doctor on duty at the time. I remember them giving her the reflex test, the one where they hit your kneecap, and she did not flinch although she said she certainly felt it.\n\nThey could not figure out what was causing this, and so they admitted her to the hospital.\n\nThe following morning she got a visit from the neurologist. She said, \"I think you have GBS, and it is a rapid onset. Let us start treatment now.\"\n\nWhen I saw her that morning she was paralyzed from her shoulders all the way down. She could still feel everything; she just could not move.\n\nShe had an IVIg infusion for five days, and she stayed in the neurology department for a week.\n\nThe next week they moved her to the therapy department where she stayed for three more weeks.\n\nShe never had to be put on a ventilator though she did say that there was a feeling of pressure on her chest. She did not lose any abilities in her head or face. She got Bell's palsy while she was there, but that cleared up a week or so later.\n\nShe came home in a wheelchair which she used for a few months, then she had to use a walker for another few months. Now she gets around using a hiking pole.\n\nIt is been exactly one year now, and she is slowly getting back to normal. \n\nShe has almost all her strength back. She still has low endurance and walks slowly, like a penguin (do not tell her I said that). She is still going to physical therapy twice a week and occupational therapy once a week. We walk our dogs about one and a half miles in the morning and another mile and a half in the evening. She gets the slow dog and I get the fast one so it works out.\n\nShe is doing a lot of knitting; it keeps her hands and fingers busy.\n\nYesterday she said that one of her thumbs feels normal again. She said that before now it felt like there was a piece of tape or dried glue on her thumb so that there was always a thin layer of something between her thumb and whatever she was touching. The other thumb is still weird and so are her fingers.\n\nThe hardest part is that recovery feels like it is taking such a long time, almost like it is not happening at all. Thankfully, the therapists are there every few days to remind us that she just did something that she was not able to do before.\n\nThe reason I am posting is because I myself frequently browse this group in in order to get an idea what we can look forward to as my wife recovers. After a year, I think I finally have something to contribute.\n\nOne more thing. My wife was recently featured in a local magazine article about her GBS and recovery.\n\n ( You are to be commended for your dedication to your wife's recovery.   I  remember my husband going through that rapid learning curve while I was in the hospital trying to move and breathe.

Going to be looking to posts like this to get a better picture of what lies ahead for us.", "Elevated Heart Rate Before GBS set in, I had a normal resting heart rate around 60.  I was previously healthy and exercised.  Ever since GBS my heart rate has been elevated by 20-30 beats per minute.  It has been 11 weeks now.  It is very uncomfortable.  Sometimes I get heart pounding sensations after eating, or with minimal exertion.  Also, my heart rate is consistently higher standing (15-20 beats) versus sitting.  For anyone who had heart rate issues/tachycardia during GBS, does it get better with time?  Did your heart rate ever reset to normal? I never had pulse issues but my bp has been terribly low since GBS. I had severe tachycardia (over 200bpm for hours which was exhausting) during the peak week of my GBS experience. During recovery, it returned to normal. I had elevated heart rate for about six months after diagnosis, it started when I was in the hospital. I took medication for it to keep my heart rate and eventually it resolved itself. Now, about 18 years later, my resting heart rate is low to normal. It gets a little high with exercise but nothing alarming. Thanks I think it can impact both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system which could cause either a low or high heart rate. I am dealing with it now. I am also having trouble with my balance, some neuropathy in my feet and light sensitivity", "My story with gbs and path of recovery ", "Looking for similar experiences Hello all! I am about 2 months into recovery from GBS. I have had some interesting experiences with cold water and music and am wondering if any of you all can relate or have any insight. Up until about week 6, ice cold water helped my body come alive, even in full paralysis. I just felt like if I could get into a pool of cold water, I would be able to swim amd move. Unfortunately I wasnt able to do that because I was stuck in a hospital bed, but I would have ice packs and have someone pour ice water on my head. Music did the same thing for me. Something up beat or high energy really helped my body come alive. Has anyone else felt this? I have had full feeling the whole time but water and music just did something extra for me. Interesting!

I was eventually walking unassisted at 5 months and slowly continued recovery from there to the point where I am running at a decent pace (would be better except I am not making enough time for regular exercise).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thankfully never had fatigue and, in fact, I am strategically giving up a little sleep as part of my similar attitude of \"make the most of your life\". This is meant to be relatively short-term, though, just until I can complete a personal project of mine. Once I have got this project completed, I will get to a more-sustainable sleep and exercise schedule as well as volunteering to help people through through GBS and their families. This is very simar to MY GBS. Two things that work for me: Vibram five fingers shoes help the balance, and daily 3ml B12 shots help more than anything. Daily 3ml, nothing less! Wow... what an amazing recovery you have made.  I cannot imagine, amongst other survivors, to have stayed at the hospital that long.  Thank you for sharing.\n\nFor running, do you get any tingling sensations afterwards? I have read a few things about B12.  May I ask, what happens if you do and do not take the shot?  What experiences do you get? Thanks. I sometimes forget that some people have faster recoveries because I met someone who spent much more time in the hospital and had a much longer rehab.\n\nI guess my feet get tired after a run but it is not that noticeable. Early into walking, they would get tired after about 15 minutes like I had done a very long hike or race. That time grew slowly over time and I think it is indistinguishable from pre-GBS now.\n\nMy feet still have some neuropathy but it is very minor. It only rarely matters like yesterday when a local train kept accelerating and decelerating rapidly when approaching my stop. It threw me off a little since I was walking inside the train when it happened. But I was not the only one who was visibly jolted and I did not fall (never did in my recovery though it was something I feared early on). This is another place I have heard of recovery variation. I know someone who says they cannot bike due to balance issues but that recovered a little earlier for me than running. Sorry, my phone was broken. If you take your shots regularly, it improves the responsiveness of my muscles. If I run out of B12, I hurtmore, and I move way less. So, it helps against the pain and the sedentary life style.", "Plasmapheresis I have GBS and plasmapheresis was recommended.  I am having trouble finding a provider that can start quickly outpatient.  Anyone know any providers in the Arizona area that may have good availability? Also, is it generally easier to get an IVIG appointment?  I was given the option of IVIG, but I told doc I would prefer plasmapheresis.  But those plasma doctors are scheduling appointments far out. Why prefer plasmapherisis over ivig or scig? It seems to have less side effects.  Although both seem relatively safe. I know that individual responses vary a great deal, yet I have had great luck with SCIG. No side effects, compared to IVIG. No recurrence of anything more than the mildest symptoms. I like that I can infuse on my own schedule. It is like a weekly ritual that I plan ahead for\u2014dinner, infusion and a movie.  It is way better than going to an infusion center or requiring a home nurse visit for 4 days in a row, That sounds pretty good.  How quick were you able to start treatment?  I am looking to start ASAP, but because I was not hospitalized, I keep encountering problems with doctor availability for outpatient treatment. I was on IVIG for the first couple years after hospitalization, starting with an infusion clinic and then transitioning to in home nurse care for IVIG. Switching to subcutaneous was relatively simple, but it took about a month to setup with insurance and pharmacy and then I needed another full IVIG infusion as a kind of loading dose. SCIG started the week immediately following. \n\nIt is a little bit of work to set up all the kit to run an infusion, so you need to be methodical and organized, as well as comfortable with needles. It is a good solution for someone who has manageable CIDP symptoms, dexterity, and grip strength", "Any online support groups? I have been struggling mentally bc I have not recovered completely (attack happened 1 year 9 months ago) and wanted to try support groups. Never been in one. Do not know what they do tbh. But seen some suggestions online and thought I might give it a try. There are no support groups in saudi arabia and there might be the time conflict however I will just see if there is an online support group available. And if I can attend I want to try it. Thank you (\n\nThey have great information, and online support along with experts in the field. Good luck! There are quite a few FB groups, just do a search for GBS survivors or support. I had GBS MFS and because I am a guy around 30 years old I was ignored at my first and last GBS CIDP meeting. It is much for older people who want to sit around a table and do nothing.\n\nSure they raise good money but those support groups are terrible. I felt worse off after going because I felt like I couldnt even get support from those that have had it. I felt the same way too.   \nThere are FB groups that I do belong to, but have been avoiding them because everyone is bickering about vaccines, especially the covid shot.", "Sad/scary GBS hospital response in the news  What a terrible, terrible story. That poor guy. Watching that......it all came flooding back to me, and I just cannot believe they did that to him. I hope he is better, and that he has a hell of a legal claim against all the pieces of shit involved. Wow. I certainly did not go through anything that extreme, but I was subjected to a misdiagnosis and tons of tests for the wrong diagnosis: kidney stones even though it was clear to almost everyone the problem was neurological Unfortunately it does not surprise me. My husband was in the ER completely paralyzed in all of his limbs; when all of the standard tests (blood, CT, MRI, etc) were showing nothing abnormal, the ER doctor told me that my husband (who has **NO** history of mental illness) needed a psychiatric evaluation. \n\n\nI informed the doctor that, no, we *would not* be getting a psych eval, and that I wanted my husband admitted to the hospital immediately for further testing and I wanted him to be seen by the neurologist.  \n\n\nSome doctors are either stupid or lazy (or both), and it is just easier to write off a patient w/difficult or confusing symptoms as a \u201cpsych case\u201d. I hope this man gets justice. Having had a severe gastroenteritis that preceded mine, I went to my GP (that saw me for the infection) to figure out why it seemed like all my internal systems were beginning to fail (hands and arms felt funny, vision was getting weird, and there was a LOT of whole-body pain). Long story short, I was diagnosed as having a **panic attack**, given some *Gatorade*, and told to go home and relax. 2 hours later I was in the ER, having lost the ability to walk. 2 hours after that, I was admitted to the first of two hospitals that I would be living in for the next 9 days. Took about 7 doctors before one finally thought GBS, and he was good enough that he knew immediately to diagnose it as Miller Fisher Syndrome, given my reversed presentation.   \n\nAnyway, I remember very little from my nightmare, but I **do** remember the abject fear and sadness from feeling like something was VERY wrong, but no one was going to believe me :(. Watching that guy\u2019s video made me feel so sad. I really hope he is on the road to a full recovery. I had similar symptoms, but they arose over about two months, two months of excruciating pain between 1am and 5am.\n\nMy GP kept looking at me, male, 37 and would not budge from kidney stones, even long after ultrasounds and x-rays showed nothing.\n\nA new doctor in the practice literally pulled me aside in a hallway and gave me a referral to a neurologist, at about that point, I could walk, but slowly and all my extremities were numb.  But things rapidly progressed after that.\n\nI saw the neurologist the next morning barely able to walk, he gave me a diagnosis and a name for a syndrome that I could \"alta vista\"\n\nI was admitted in a wheelchair that afternoon, was paralyzed for several days while getting IVIG treatments and was released five days later.\n\nI think I have recovered mostly, but I like to blame my laziness at exercise on gbs. Damn.  It was scary enough with full support of family and hospital.  It still took a week to diagnose, but at least they believed me... My boyfriend had something similar happen to him, I do not know the whole story as it happened before we met and he does not like to talk about it. He went to the ER for some symptom (I cannot remember what now) and they tested him for drugs (all came back negative, he is never used drugs) and they discharged him. He went back the next day or so with much worse symptoms and only then were doctors like \"oh shit!\" They told me it was due to a uti. I am a 34f and they told me I would have to have a stroke before they would take me seriously. I could barely stand or walk. They sent me home. The next day I could not move at all and was in excruciating pain. Went to a different er and they immediately knew what was up.", "Regaining balance five months into recovery ", "A cheap tool to help with stretching out muscles: a foam roller  Nerve damage can affect gait and movement (foot drop is a common example), which can lead to pain as our body compensates to augment where we are weak. A foam roller is a simple, cheap (under $10!) tool which can help you stretch out muscles and reduce inflammation.\n\n Nice.  and I like this as a trend for this sub.  Does anyone else have good physio tips that they picked up?  For me, once I was able to walk again, my physiotherapist actually prescribed walking barefoot on the beech.  The soft sand provides less stability than other surfaces and forces you to work  the smaller muscles in the leg and foot that do not get used as often.  The sound and smell of the ocean was a nice peaceful bonus.  :) That is an awesome tip! I am going to give that a try.\n\nWe used to have a lovely lady making videos about her GBS recovery and tricks she did but she has not posted in a while.

I have been dealing with both anxiety and depression for a long time now, even before when I was diagnosed with gbs, so being in this situation is really hard. I constantly fight with pain and regret. My parents and siblings arent actually that much help. I know they also get tired, but shoving words like \"oh so do you eant to walk like a r*tard your whole life?\" in my face isnt going to help either. I dont want this. Why me? Its not fair its not fair its not fair its not fair, why me? Its been 3 years already and I am still not me, im still not out of that horrible place full of suffering and death. I can still feel the rotten breath coming from the hole in my throat, even now that the hole has already closed. I still panic whenever I hear beeping. I am afraid. I am so afraid and I feel so alone. Everyone says that they understand but they do not, they never will hopefully.\nI feel empty. I feel so useless. But still i dont have the strength to move on. Because I am tired. And im tired because I cant move on. What is wrong with me? \nI dont find motivation in anything.\nI just want to die. Hey there. Breathe. We see you. You were diagnosed with gbs 3 years ago and are still having symptoms? Or you are still being affected by what you went through? Your family do not sound supportive at all. It is good you are reaching out in other places. Not symptoms, but memories and im still in physical recovery. Thanks for posting this and I am sorry you are going through this. My son is 10 and has been battling this for less than a year and it is a daily struggle with anxiety and the disease. But I can point to people like you who he can look up to and see that he will be ok. You are an example to many without even knowing it. Do not give up because those immediately around you do not understand or do not care. You are an inspiration - keep it up!! Thank you so much, i wish you and your son the best of luck Of course - and to you as well. Us Texans do not go down easy :). Haha, not from Texas, im from chile. The long country next to argentina Of course - I mistook the flag. My bad It happens a lot, dont worry. Nothing is wrong with you. This is normal and this illness is something that is always with you and will always be with you. Accept it and embrace it and find ways to push past it. None of this is easy, but know one thing: That you are not alone. Have you talked with a therapist? Someone you can vent to and help you get through this. GBS is very tough to go through mentally and physically. I cannot offer you much advice, but I am very sorry you are going through this.\n\nI hope you find help whether that is a therapist or other family members who might house you or even a religious figure in your community Hey there, been where you have been, several times. Long story but, I have been on a ventilator 3 times because of GBS. Thought all was lost but... it gets better. It will take time.  Nearly 15 years later I still suffer from symptoms but hey press forward.  I finished college, got married and even climbed an active volcano.  My mantra is \u201c Why you slowing , keeping going.\u201d  Do not get me wrong I have my bad days but they are few and far in between.  You will survive and you can thrive. Much love to ya! I feel ya.... Some days, it gets so bad that the only thing keeping me going is the knowledge that life insurance will not pay out for a suicide. That is it. That is the one thing. Not my family, not my pets, not my friends, not my car. The knowledge that the only thing it would do is dig an even deeper financial hole and be even more of a burden. So I guess technically my family? But not their feelings. Their feelings can suck it. They are not the ones in constant pain that will be with them until the day they die. They are not the ones who have nightmares about waking up paralyzed and unable to breathe. They are not the ones who spent months in the hospital unable to communicate that they were in so much pain they wanted to just die and get it over with because they were trapped in their own completely immobile bodies. They are not the ones who do not even recognize the person they have become. But I will not be the one to pile even more debt on top of the tens of thousands of dollars that we still owe the hospital. Not without a way to offset it somehow. \n\nSo.... I can relate to the depression. And the anger. You are not alone. And sometimes that is the most important part. Breathing sessions are a must for me. We hear you. Stay positive. It is not easy.

What are they like? One big goal of this subreddit is to collect experiences - GBS varies so widely and is rare enough that it can be hard for people to know if what they are experiencing is normal or even part of GBS.\n\nEach month, we will put up a new topic to help spark discussion and create a future repository of experiences.\n\nThis month's topic is residuals. Many people experience after-effects and these can vary wildly. What long term effects has it had on you and how do you manage them? I found ( blog piece detailing a lot of effects similar to mine.

My feet are hyper-sensitive, and because they do not communicate with my brain very well, I do not have a very good sense of balance. Easiest was to describe it is it feels like I have a roll of quarters taped to the bottom of my toes.  Shortly after I got out of the hospital I put on a pair of my husbands flips flops to walk. They had memory foam soles. They are a god-send!!! I have found a company that manufactures women's flip flops with a thick soft foam sole. It is all I can wear. But because I have to wear flip flops, every once in a while I have to go to physio to get work done on my knees. The therapists said it is because I walk funny.

I am 18 months out and my symptoms are limited to below my knees. \n\nWhat has your experience been like while flying post diagnosis? Mostly curious for those who are actively experiencing symptoms like fasciculations and nerve pain/neuropathy. But, any advice would welcome! I am 6 months out and have flown 4 times. I have neuropathy but no pain. Flying was ok (it was buisness class) but lots of walking gave me very bad blisters since my ankles still bend in. I would recommend very comfy shoes. No increase in neuropathy or anything, I did need to walk a few times. My flights are 4 hours. Also the peanuts are a bitch to open with reduced hand strength I am still mostly paralyzed below the knees, so no walking for me. That is a relief to hear that flying has gone ok for you. Luckily my upper body is back 100%. Took a while for the hands though. I only had a medium case. I do not have much feeling in my feet but my strength is coming back slowly but surely. Honestly the biggest pain is my vaccine status. I got GBS from the COVID vaccine (AstraZeneca) so I cannot get a second shot. Many places do not recognize exemption letters from out of province doctors so I had to keep a updated PCR test on hand all the time I noticed my symptoms get worse as weather gets colder. Is there any chance the plane was chilly? My feet basically became completely numb and it scared the crap out of me, but it got better once I warmed them up with blankets and fuzzy socks. I am so sorry you are experiencing this. I have not been on a plane since my diagnosis\u2026 \n\nMy feet are always completely numb and cold weather always intensifies the pain. I am paralyzed from my shins down. I have to wear long thick socks 24/7 to keep them warm. Oh, wow. I really feel for you. I had to wait to get (mRNA) vaccinated due to the IVIG treatment I had and it was stressful without travel and testing restrictions in place. \n\nI always had people roll their eyes at me when I said I was not vaccinated because of my health because they probably thought I was some half wit antivaxxer. Flying itself is not the problem, but sitting still in one place for many hours does aggravate symptoms. I think that is the part I can handle well.

I wish you a speedy recovery. You would think I have other worries but men going to be men. The one thing I missed the most when I was hospitalized was water. I was intubated and on tube feed so I could eat or drink. I remember thinking all I wanted to do was drink a bottle of water. More than anything. I was fantacizing about it. In my case, I have not been able to recover muscle mass in my calves and forearms /wrist area which makes me feel embarrassed to use short pants for example.

She was diagnosed when she was 4, apparently it was triggered by a virus she caught when she was young. She has never really recovered, she is had feeding tubes, pic lines, scopes, surgeries, etc. When she was in high school she was the healthiest she is ever been. Never in hospital or anything, working and living life. Then around 15 months ago things got bad. Her body doesnt really become paralyzed (except her skin when she was diagnosed) but her stomach is what becomes paralyzed, she cant eat or drink, it will come back up. On top of that shes diabetic. She was in hospital for about 8 months. She is always suffering but trust me her family, and doctors have found no answer to her problem. Shes slowly getting better but usually after a bit of decent days she will have a set back. Im 16 and I have been trying my hardest to be a loving supportive boyfriend. We have been together for a year and 3 months. I love her so much, it just pains me to see her like this. All the drugs she is on, the permanent frown on her face, her shortness pf conversation. She is unfortunately burnt out, and has been for about a year. When she is in agony from the stomach cramps ill rub her lower back, or just babble on and tell her about my day, distract her. I love this girl so much and she is so so strong. I can not imagine the suffering she goes through on a daily basis. \nAnyway I was surprised when I saw this on Reddit, but Im really glad it is here. Thank you I feel for you and her. Do not give up. I found that daily B12 shots help me more than anything. But her symptoms are way out of the ordinary. She might have more than one thing.

If something seems like what I have been going through is for sure *not* CIDP I would like that advice as well. I do not know what is wrong and trying to be the most prepared before I add to my never ending medical debt. \n\nI am a 30F.  I have been mostly healthy my whole life. I suffer from a \u201cNOS Sleep disorder\u201d since I was 16 (aka something is wrong, but I do not check enough boxes to fit into one. I have horrible sleep paralysis, insomnia, and excessive daytime sleepiness/lethargy.  \nThey were thinking Narcolpsy, but I dont have Cataplexy and did not hit REM enough times during my sleep study. My neurologist at the time told me I was \u201cnormal enough\u201d he did not feel the need to pursue a diagnosis that could potentially limit my ability to drive and scared 16 yr old me into not wanting to pursue a name to my issue. // At 24 i started having symptoms of Gastroparesis (where my stomach want emptying properly), but when I had the function test done my stomach emptied exactly 3% to well to be diagnosed. My luck.  Like many with GP after about 2 years it almost totally went away and I do suffer from cyclic vomiting disorder but I do not think that is connected to anything?. /// At 28 I was in my final year at graduate school (stressful sure, but really enjoyed what I was doing and was not overly stressed) and began to have what I thought was carpel tunnel. Went to the orthopedist and it was not carpel tunnel.  He made a joke about \u201ccommitting me\u201d when I tried to describe that my hands felt like an old fuzzy TV. Static-y.  (Numb, but I could tell where they are in space, electric pain....I thought it was a good description) anyways he just said it was not \u201cortho related\u201d and sent me on my way. After that appointment, the numbness and pins-&amp;-needles in both hands slowly started going up my arms till it hit just above my elbows. I could not tell temperatures, my dexterity was gone, and the electric type pain was awful. Then my feet started going numb. That was really scary.  I was falling over and just in pain all over. The lethargy was awful. I am on a stimulant for my sleep disorder and I could not overcome the lethargy even taking a double dose of my stimulant!!!  My primary care doctor ordered an MRI and that came back normal except for a few white Matter lesions, but not enough to indicate MS.  My doctor had my back though and he knew something was up that was beyond his scope so he helped me get into an autoimmune clinic in FL. It took over two months for the appointment and my primary hated the pain I was in, so he did some research and put me on a pretty rigorous steroid treatment for 13 days.  It really helped. By the time I saw the specialist (who was the clinic\u2019s MS doctor and she basically only did MS)  I was about 60% better.  The specialist was less than kind. She reviewed my MRI and said the same thing, not enough for a diagnosis and I did not have all the Classic MS symptoms. (My main ones were the peripheral numbness, pain, and lethargy which could be explained away by my not-defined sleep disorder).  She ordered an MRI of my cervical vertebrae, which came back normal. She ordered about 5 more tests, but then I lost my insurance and could not afford the tests. When I called about 6 months later to explain that and get new scripts for the tests after I got new insurance I was basically told \u201cif it was not important to get the tests done when she ordered them last time then it must not impact me very much\u201d. Which was a big slap in my face./// Despite that, my primary care doctor has been great. He is the one that posed the possibility of CIDP to me. It seems to fit a lot of my symptoms.  While I have almost fully recovered from my episode in 2018 (it lasted for about 6 months at it worst, and got better over another following 6). Where I am now, 2 years out, is I still have numbness in my right pinky and ring finger.  I never fully regained my dexterity in either hand and drop things a lot more\u2014&amp; I cannot tell temperature with my hands very well. I also have pain that will come if I use my hands too much or if I get sick and it will last for about for about 2 weeks in both hands, but then it will go away.  My feet I do not notice as many issues with them, they are mostly on the numb side but they do not have pain. /// my primary care doctor wants me to find a specialist to get formally diagnosed, but I do not even know where to start. My experience with adult neurologists has been really bad and everyone is so specialized now that if you do not fit exactly what they know then they want to pass you off.  Any advice on how your road to a CIDP diagnosis went would be great (tests to ask for, specialties to look for in a doctor)....I may not have CIDP, but I hate living in fear that what happened in 2018 will happen again and I do not have a game plan for it. Thank you much for getting to this point in my novel. I appreciate any advice or support! I have had CIDP for 11 years now. I have never encountered anyone diagnosed as CIDP who had white matter legions. In my experience, it sounds like you may have relapsing-remitting MS. Typically all or most of your symptoms will remit after a period and sometime in the future, you will have a relapse. I would get an appointment with a functional neurologist  specializing in MS. Let them see if they can make sense of it. I have 6 WML and have been told that is \u201cnormal\u201d by an MS specialist.  How is was described to me was, \u2018you can take 100 people off the street and give them an MRI and at least half will have 1-6 White Matter lesions and have no issues, it does not impair their life. Just because I am having issues and there are lesions does not mean they are the cause.\u201d Trust me, I was scratching my head (and really angry) because I had waited for so long for that appointment and to be told \u201cyeah there is lesions on your brain, but not enough to diagnose you\u201d is really frustrating. So until I get 3 more, I am in that \u201cyou are just crazy\u201d zone. Everyone I know CIDP was really a dx of exclusion. They provisionally dx'd me until after I had 6 monthly IVIG treatments. Based on my improvement, they gave me the diagnosis. It is tough and it just happened that I saw a doctor that had seen it before. So many doctors have absolutely no clue what it is. Your best bet imo is to go to a Center of Excellence.  The GBS-CIDP.org website can really help. Just know you are NOT crazy. You know something is wrong. Dont give up until you get answers no matter how many doctors you have to see. It took me 3 years and over 20 specialists. I was bed bound by the time I was dx but now I have moderate damage to my feet but I am able to walk unassisted. There is hope!! **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 There are 3 tests to diagnose CIDP.  First an EMG of your legs / arms to test nerve conductivity. Second a lumbar puncture to check a certain protien level. Third, a sural nerve biopsy. \n\nI am not a doctor so can only give you advice but depending on where you live you may need to travel to find a higher level of physician. These are rare issues and most doctors have no idea what CIDP is. I was in the ER recently for an allergic reaction and told them what meds I was on as well as IVIg for my CIDP and they had no idea what that was and I had to explain it to them...\n\nGood luck and I hope you find a solution soon.", "Covid vaccine reactions? (Pfizer shot #2: hives &amp; neuropathy) I had a relatively mild case of GBS in Feb 2019, though it was unusual in that it started in my hands and descended, rather than ascending from my feet. I recovered very quickly compared to most, I think, and I feel very lucky for that. I have only had some lingering weird sensations in my legs.\n\nSo, I had no reluctance in getting the covid vaccine, nor did my primary care provider. \n\nI had shot #1 (Pfizer) with no issues. A few weeks ago, I had shot #2. Three days after, I had full body very itchy hives that took 2.5 days to subside. My GBS residual effects (neuropathy in my legs) became much worse after the hives subsided though solved with an increase in the medication I take for it. My PCP thinks the reaction is likely due to my immune system getting activated as a result of the vaccine but I have no real idea.\n\nOf course, it could also be something completely unrelated.\n\nAnyone else experience anything similar? I have struggled to find an explanation for what happened and if I should have any concerns. I had GBS symptoms after the Pfizer vaccine. However, I was not seen by anyone for more than 3 months and only had minor symptoms by then. All tests came out normal, but I am now terrified of having the second one as it was the scariest thing I have ever experienced. I am six days out from my first pfizer vaccine, and my neuropathy in my feet and legs was hightened the last couple days. I seem to be going back to my normal today, though not 100% yet. Threw my anxiety through the roof, which arguably it already is. I also did an intense bike ride a few days ago and wonder if my fatigue has more to do with that then the GBS residuals (I had GBS 15 years ago). I have reached out to my doctor and am waiting for response. My Pfizer #2 came with a 12 hour headache, and I felt like I had a bad cold for about 24 hours following that. Everything is great. No other side effects at all.  Get the second shot. I was paralysed in my arms and I had difficulty walking due to shooting pains, burning sensations, bone pain, inflammation, numbness, pins &amp; needles in my whole body after the first one and have only just begun recovering from that now 4 months later... I just do not think it is worth the risk. I also had a relatively mild GBS case. Could walk throughout, but tingling started in hands, then both feet, then ascending up all limbs along with weakness that was worst in the legs, but eventually hit arms and jaw. Once symptoms hit my torso, there was pretty bad nausea and green stool for weeks. That was Feb to Mar 2021. Given how immunity works, I decided to roll the dice and get my shot recently even though still in early recovery.\n\nFirst shot (Pfizer) was worse. Anxiety and nausea returned really badly. Tingling and burning started back up. But after 2-3 days, I fell back into my previous recovery trajectory. Went and got the second shot last week. Flu like (and no GBS) symptoms the day after the shot. Went away after 24 hours. And so far that is been it for me. My GBS has flared a little in the last 2 days or so, but so far nothing I cannot contribute to life stress and not doing my exercises. When I relax and focus I do not think I have evidence my condition has actually gotten worse.\n\nThat is not to discredit your experience at all! I am sure you are going through what you think you are. That is just to share my experience with you and others. I think everyone is just really different. Immune systems are different and do different things kind of as a rule. I think the explanations so far make sense. I would try to be patient and vigilant over the next few days to see how things develop. Thinking and hoping the immune response will just calm down and all the things you felt lately will just go away. Good luck! Please get checked out by your neurologist. Do not rely on your PCP for this. They have absolutely no idea. I would hate to see a flare or relapse start cooking untreated and what you describe sounds \"relapsy\" to me. Funny you post this but I cannot explain my recent issues outside of my second round of Pfizer.   I am about 6 weeks out from my second shot, maybe more but I took both shots in my right / dominant arm as I read somewhere that it was advised at the more you use said arm the less issues.  I am experiencing rapid degeneration in my hands but I am back at the Infusion place on Monday and suspect that will help\n\nImportant side note: I have CIDP and am 1.5sh yrs into IVIg of a every 3 weeks 2 doses.\nImportant side note2: I specifically got vaccinated and the Pfizer variant on the advice of my Neuro and Primary.\n\nMy legs are a mess but never had to many issues with my hands but this has taken ~30 minutes to type. Hello all, if you have any side effects following the Pfizer vaccine please take a chance to report those adverse events ( We are small group, but because of that it makes it even more important that the data is shared to them. Thank you! It is hard to get checked out by Neurologists when there is a 3 to 6 month waiting list to see them. \n\nI have experienced so many failures and outright stupidity from the healthcare that I have lost trust completely. Yep. It is part of the grind. It is constant work by the patient. It never stops. Should not be that way.", "Covid positive one year after gbs Has anyone got covid that had passed gbs how did you do and do you have any advice..asking for my sister I had GBS 3 years ago, worst-case-scenario with intubation and complete paralysis. I had Covid this past April, not an extreme case; was feverish for a couple days, slept a lot for a week, and lost my sense of taste and smell for about a month. It hits people differently so all you can do is listen to your body and rest. I got the Pfizer vax in August, my doctor said that was a better option for those with GBS due to how it is made, had a sore arm for a day and was fine. Thankyou for sharing her test comes back tomorrow so were not sure yet but i was really worried because of her gbs being an autoimmune disease that possibly she might not survive it especially im her sister and when igot it i almost died and am now a long hauler for a year and a half \u2026ik that is always a possibility but i was especially worried for her thankyou for sharing. Prayers that you and your sister both feel better! Thankyou very much prayers for you also since you are so kind god bless 7 years GBS, got COVID November 20. No issues. My partner got covid last summer and came down with GBS about two months later. It came on quick and hard. He could not walk for a while. My advice is figure out how to get her rested for a long time, encourage her, when she can, to take walks and slowly push herself. He is just now getting back to normal a full year afterward. It is a bitch and I am sorry she is going through this. Nobody deserves to suffer the way GBS people do.", "Family History of GBS ", "Symptoms chat. So, as I have posted, *maybe* my CIDP diagnosis was wrong, but since I have \"enjoyed\" a year of treatment for it (IVIG, plasmapheresis), I still feel qualified to post here. One of my symptoms is difficulty swallowing with coughing/choking. I had an esophagram, and it showed, as I understand it, that the sequencing swallowing muscles were not, well, sequencing. . The episodes/fits of coughing happen whether I am eating/drinking or not. With my balance/gait issues, if I start coughing, I have to stop walking lest I fall down. Anybody else get this? Yes, ever since I had pneumonia, I have had swallowing issues, which is frankly terrifying. What sort of doctor do you see for this?

This is definitely a question for a doctor.\n\nI am in the \"general population\" group (Group C in my state) even though I had GBS a little more than 3 years ago. I got my shot yesterday in New York. When I saw a neurologist the other day, he said without any prompting that my GBS history counts as a qualifying medical condition here. At the vaccine clinic I did have to show proof of the condition (I had a printout of my chart from the doctor's online portal). The person who signed me in did not know what GBS was, but all I had to say was it is a neurologic condition, and after that there were no questions asked. I also had a childhood case of GBS and am nearly 2 decades out. I am 8 days past my first Pfizer vaccine. I decided to get the vaccine because my original GBS case was not a post-vaccine response, the GBS rates following vaccination are not above background levels (so these vaccines do not appear to be more likely to induce or trigger gbs), and the GBS-CIPD society has done a lot of expert interviews with gbs researchers that support GBS patients getting the vaccine if their doctor's do not have specific concerns. I was eligible due to pregnancy, though, not GBS.\n\nEdit: Misread the question. So far being a GBS survivor does not seem to put anyone at higher risk of covid-19 complications.

We recently moved into our new house which has stairs and I am going through this awful exhaustion, especially the times I carry my very heavy 1 year old.

I have been experiencing increasingly distressing symptoms for just under 3 years now. I have seen multiple doctors none of whom have been able to diagnose the issue. I have an upcoming appointment with a neurologist (finally!), but honestly, I am beginning to get very concerned about this and would be extremely grateful for some advice. Does this sound like a neurological condition to you guys? Does this sound like CIDP? Or something even worse like ALS? Sorry for length!\n\nDetails: 25 years old, male, Caucasian, 6 foot tall, 75kg weight, asthmatic with no current medications except inhaler. \n\nI began having trouble with my health in April 2016 while I was taking an abnormally high dose of topical Minoxidil, applied to my face. During the month I spent taking the drug, I noticed unflattering changes to my soft tissue. My skin and muscles became doughy and I was concerned that I was looking prematurely aged. Simultaneously, I experienced numbness and apparent muscle weakness in my lower bowel, affecting my ability to pass stools. Needless to say, when I noticed these side effects, I stopped Minoxidil immediately. However, despite prompt action my soft tissue did not recover and I still have altered soft tissue and abnormal bowel sensations now, almost five years since taking the drug.\n\nFor the next two years, I noticed no other symptoms, although, on reflection, I may have had muscle fasciculations, but in August 2018 I lost the ability to burp. I had just completed a long-distance run when I had the sudden sensation of weakness, floppiness and numbness in my oesophagus, accompanied by a need to burp up gas but an inability to activate the muscles needed to do so. At this time, I also began experiencing abnormal yawning, hiccupping and microburping (although the yawn is only a kind of partial yawn and does not use all the normal yawn muscles) hundreds of times a day, which I have read is suggestive of nerve damage. I developed and still suffer from severe acid reflux.\n\nMy symptoms remained static for the next few months until in November 2018 I had a bad bicycling accident. This resulted in me fracturing both my elbows and my right wrist, as well as getting whiplash on my neck, though slight pain. Recovery from this was for the first few months uneventful, however about three months after my initial injury I began getting pain, tingling and numbness, along with weakness in my arms. These attacks were sporadic, but did not seem to result in permanent weakness.\n\nHowever, I did notice that I seemed to be clumsier than usual and to be dropping things more often. This problem still afflicts me. I additionally began having severe muscle spasms in my jaw. To give some sense of the power of these spasms, it felt as though my jaw was being wrenched out of its socket, although thankfully I suffered only a few of these and have had a small amount only since.\n\nFinally, I began suffering from another round of symptoms in June 2019. The first symptom I developed during this period was swallowing trouble. Shortly before graduation, I lost the ability to swallow normally in a manner that recalled my sudden inability to burp a year earlier, with, firstly, extreme difficulty initiating the swallow reflex, and secondly, when I did eventually manage to begin swallowing, the actual movement itself was spastic with several muscles appearing either not to activate properly or to be uncoordinated.\n\nIn the days after this I experienced pain and clicking around my Adam\u2019s Apple area, as though nerves or muscles were getting trapped and I had a strange tingling sensation and the perception of a loss of mass underneath my tongue. A muscle between my chin and my Adam\u2019s Apple disappeared during this time and I have not had feeling or tension in it since.\n\nIn the weeks that followed these sudden swallowing difficulties, I saw several doctors. One suspected that it could be an infection, however the antibiotics he gave me failed to help. No visible abnormalities with my throat were noted (and at a later date I undertook a nasoscopy which confirmed this), suggesting that it is a neurological or muscular issue. No more treatment was offered. I was unable to eat more than yoghurt and water for this period, but in the months that followed my swallowing slightly improved.\n\nUnfortunately, the muscles that I believe I lost when my swallowing first worsened have not returned and my swallowing, though functional, remains impaired. To the extent that it is improved it feels as though this is because other muscles have atrophied and are \u2018filling in\u2019. I have since had a neck MRI which showed no abnormalities, ruling out a bone issue.\n\nSwallowing was not the only problem I developed during this time, as I also began suffering from muscle twitches, usually between 20 and 30 or so a day, beginning in my abs, where the twitches were especially violent and afflicted me while lying down at night, but which have over the past two years spread all over my body, including my face, arms, hands, neck and buttocks.\n\nMost worryingly, they have been accompanied by progressive muscle weakness and spasticity, as well as what seem to be altered reflexes.\n\nOther than my swallowing difficulties, it is difficult for me to say which muscles first started showing abnormalities. The first changes I believe I noticed were in my core, which started showing what for me was unusual weakness about a year ago \u2013 I was unable to do even very light core exercises without my core shaking uncontrollably and on occasion have difficulty sitting up and standing up straight \u2013 and my face, where I noticed twitching under my eyelids which expanded to my nose, lips, cheek and chin and weakened smile muscles.\n\nAlthough, I am afraid, I cannot be specific on the timeline, I have more recently developed shoulder weakness, which often shake when I put my weight on them while lying on my side. My right shoulder was described by a physiotherapist I have recently begun seeing in a bid to improve my strength as uncommonly weak.\n\nIn the past year I have also noticed progressive weakness in my arms, particularly my elbows and muscles appear to have disappeared at my elbow making day to day tasks such as elements of cooking such as whisking and cutting food, as well as press-ups, very difficult. My wrists appear weakened too, as are my legs and knees.\n\nIn the past few months I have noticed increased difficulty going up and especially down stairs, with impaired balance. I have also experienced weakness in my lower back and have noticed reduced coordination in my fingers.\n\nThese functional changes have been accompanied by visible changes to the muscles and the limbs. On my arms, a muscle has disappeared around my elbow, leaving an indentation; on my knees, I have observed similar changes, areas of muscle apparently wasting away and leaving dents; on my forearms there are also new indentations and disproportionate muscles; on my calfs, the muscles have what to me are abnormal bulges and dents; and on my hands, the muscle between my thumb and index finger feels mushy and there is a new dent.\n\nThe final symptom I wish to raise is that, since perhaps a year ago, I have been suffering from abnormal reflexes. Essentially, my reflexes are on the one hand delayed and on the other hand exaggerated. For example, if I brush a wall, my body will, often, spastically twitch away from it as a reflex, but this will happen later than usual and the movement is more dramatic. Another example is when our family dog nudges my stomach. In this case, I will get a violent twinge in my back about a second or two after the impact.\n\nThis is not a full list of every symptom I have suffered since I first started feeling abnormal three years ago (for example, I also have common numbness, tingling and feelings of water trickling under my skin), but I think I have covered the most important.\n\nI would be extremely grateful for any information or advice you can offer. Thank you. Sorry to hear you are going through all this :-( hopefully the neurologist can help.  \n\n\nI do not have symptoms any where as sever as yours, and have not been diagnosed with anything, but my neurologist said that a \"very mild form of GBS is possible\".   \n\n\nBut based on my experience, he will want a spinal tap to check the protein levels in your spinal fluid, and he will also run other tests. The spinal tap can cause headaches that last for multiple days - I knew headaches were possible, but did not know they could last for days.  \n\n\nI have been having on and off symptoms for a few years that include tingling, muscle pain and more. Plus, I get a general feeling of being sick - like a moderate cold, but with no symptoms other than feeling kind of crappy.   \n\n\nDo you ever get anything like that - a general feeling of sickness? Hi! I am so sorry for everything that has happened to you I know how frustrating it can get especially not being sure what you have. I can only speak on my own experience with CIDP but hopefully it offers some helpful information for you. \n\nWhen I started noticing my symptoms I was 20 years old, about 138 pounds, 5\u20197 and I am female. \n\nI noticed my symptoms heavily beginning April of 2020 but I was feeling a bit clumsier than usual a few weeks before that and I did not give it much thought. in April however I noticed extreme weakness in my legs. I could not lift or roll my ankles or wiggle my toes and my legs felt too heavy to run. I told my family what was happening but I got the sense that they all felt I was overreacting and brushed it off. \n\nFinally one day I woke up and I could definitely tell my walking was very bad so I went to the hospital and had a cat scan, MRIs, and so many blood tests done. This did not lead to any help as everything came back relatively normal and I still did not have answers. I went to a neurologist and at first he said I had bilateral foot drop as a result of crossing my legs and hurting some nerves in my knee. He did not put me on any medication and told me in about a month things should be better. \n\nIn that month I lost even more ability to walk and move my feet, I did not realize right away but I had weakness in my bowel and struggled with passing stools as well, and I felt a bit of weakness in my face but mainly my symptoms were all in my legs.\n\nI realized I was only getting worse so I went back to my neurologist and had more blood tests, a nerve conduction study (they poked several needles into my legs to test my reflexes), and a spinal tap. Ultimately the spinal tap was what officially diagnosed me with CIDP and started on medication on June 8th 2020. \n\nBy the time I started my medication I was extremely weak I could not lift my legs basically at all to walk, I had started to use a wheel chair to go to the dr and any place I needed to go. \n\nI started taking prednisone and eventually my dr also put me on IVIG treatments. In September he reduced my prednisone dose and added mycophenolate. In November I stopped the IVIG because my whole life I have suffered from migraines but the IVIG was giving me extreme migraines that were absolutely unbearable. As of right now I am still on prednisone and mycophenolate. I have regained a lot of movement in my legs thankfully although my recovery has felt difficult at times. My walking is much better and it feels easier to lift my feet. My right leg has always been behind on progress so I have recovered my quickly from my left leg. In my face I still do not have the ability to lift my eyebrows but I can move everything else pretty well for the most part. My bowel weakness went away almost immediately when I started with the prednisone. I have an appointment next week to discuss my progress with my neurologist so he might start to taper me off medication if he feels I have made significant progress.\n\nThrough this whole process I did lose significant muscle mass which I have nor yet recovered. I am 21 now and weigh about 124 pounds which is the skinniest I have ever been. With the medication I sometimes feel nauseous in the mornings so it feels harder to eat which has also affected my appetite. \n\nFrom this entire experience I gained a lot of positivity as weird as it sounds. I learned to be optimistic and push myself because I knew I was not going to recover if I gave up and let myself feel weaker and weaker. \n\nI would highly recommend being able to get a spinal tap if you think you may have CIDP because that is what ultimately was able to diagnose me officially and finally begin with medication to help! \n\nI hope sharing my experience was helpful and wish you the best of luck! I hope you hear helpful news from your neurologist! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc It is definitely great that you are seeing a neurologist. I have CIDP and it is a peripheral neuropathy disease of eroding the myelin sheath around your peripheral nerves, so where you feel the impact is your hands, arms, feet and legs. It is particularly characterized by tingling starting in the feet because your longest nerves are in your legs and people tend to feel it there first. The esophagus sounds like another problem and I do not have enough relevant experience to offer advice on that, but the key point is, yes you should be seeing a neurologist. I recommend you ask for an EMG, an electrical nerve conduction study. This will help you get more data. Your neurologist may also want to do a skin biopsy. \n\nIf your neurologist does not seem to take these serious and complex issues seriously, please find another neurologist. I would also recommend you crosspost to r/chronicpain and see if anyone there is familiar with your symptoms. Best wishes to you! I cannot agree more on the find a new Neurologist part.  They should be happy to figure it out and help you.  My Neuro texts me just to see how I am doing.  That is the kind of Doc you want.  Took me I think 7 different ones until where I am now. Yes. I have quite bad constipation, so I get stomach pains a lot and general nausea. For the past 5 years I have probably always felt like I am fighting off a cold or a bug too - you know, just a general feeling of being under the weather. So long story short: yes, I can relate. Interesting. I do have and had have a lot of minor pain and tingling in my feet and hands, although I am not sure that that was my first symptom. The burping and then swallowing problems were what I noticed first. But I have since - in the last few years - developed sensations elsewhere. It is annoying. I have done a lot of Googling and my symptoms do not really seem to line up perfectly with anything. Given my age and the speed of progression, I do not think it can be ALS - also, if ALS starts in the mouth area it is usually fast progressing apparently and affects speech, whereas I can talk fine. Connective tissue disorders run in my family so that is on the table but that would not explain the muscle weakness and wasting. Frankly, I am just hopeful that it is not ALS. From my understanding, most other neuro conditions though undoubtedly shite are usually manageable. ALS is not. Did your spinal tap show any abnormalities that steered your neurologist toward his diagnosis of  \"very mild form of GBS is possible\" ? I would second the recommendations for the lumbar puncture and EMG. Those are pretty reliable tests for yielding answers on neurological disease, especially when MRI/CAT does not show anything. \n\nMy only other suggestion in addition to the fine ones already provided is seek care from a neurologist who is experienced in treating these kinds of disorders. I have heard too many examples of patients frustrated with their lack of progress because they are under the care of a neurologist who treats migraines or has never treated a single case of GBS in their career. Yes - elevated protein levels in the the cerebral spinal fluid.  \n\n\nI also had weakness in my legs, but not enough to prevent me from walking.  \n\n\nThe ER doctors did not want to do the spinal tap, but I insisted more or less - there is more to it than that but it is a long story. ER doctors do not want to diagnose anything complicated, I have found. They just stabilize people and send them home, although with follow-up advice. &gt;I would highly recommend being able to get a spinal tap if you think you may have CIDP because that is what ultimately was able to diagnose me officially and finally begin with medication to help!\n\nLess\\_Bridge, did you have an EMG test and did it show anything abnormal?\n\nI wonder why neurologists do not just treat people with IVIG treatments as if they had CIDP and see if there is any improvement. Flexmissile, have your family and friends noticed the progressive changes in your body, the loss of muscle? Did the doctors you have been seeing notice it, did you have a long enough relationship with one of them so that they documented it over time? \n\nThat seems like a telltale symptom that you just cannot ignore, as well as something like twitching would be. This does not sound like CIDP to me, but it is still worth getting tested as the others have suggested. You might be in for a bit of a fight to find a decent doctor who will actually find out what is wrong with you. Yes! I had one done before I had the spinal tap and it showed that I had a lot of weakness in my legs which is why the neurologist decided to move forward with the spinal tap and officially diagnose me with CIDP. Yes. I am afraid both the twitching and the loss of mass have been noted by family members and friends too. Doctors have not noticed since I do not really have a primary GP who I see regularly. I am just thinking that if doctors seem unconvinced that you have actually lost muscle mass you could bring a friend or family member with you to testify at your next appointment. If covid restrictions allow it.\n\nIt is pretty easy to notice atrophied muscle, though. It is not merely like being out of shape  causing muscles to look less defined. With muscle wasting the limb or whatever actually looks shapeless from the disappearance of muscle. I have atrophied muscle in my thigh. There is a dent like you described.  I am frustrated in that not all doctors I have consulted see it (some can; one saw even more than I noticed).\n\nI would say go to a major hospital where there are neurologists who specialize in cases of neuromuscular disease. Neurologists have their specialties. Some deal mostly with strokes or epilepsy or sleep disorders or Alzheimer's. Maybe your GP can help you find the right one. I would not be surprised if the minoxidil triggered your problem. Sometimes a few people are very sensitive to drugs that are harmless to the vast majority. And at high dosage..\n\nMy husband was treated with an antibiotic he had never taken before but that is rather commonly prescribed. He developed a skin problem, red spots all over like the measles. The dermatologist recognized the syndrome and said it could have advanced to the stage of his skin being shed as if from burns, which can be deadly. Fortunately my husband got over it but the skin on parts of his body remains changed, odd-looking, shiny.\n\nThat is not like your problem but my point is that a drug can sometimes cause serious and lasting problems in some people. Hi Sylvane,\nThis is my suspicion too. And in fact I have recently managed to secure a few collagen tests with a doctor to check for connective tissue damage. Minoxidil has been shown to damage collagen in a way that is quite dangerous in in vitro studies and while no humans have yet reported this as a side effect, at least not the level I may have had it, there is a plausible chain of causation for how it could have caused this in me. It is tough. Because my symptoms are partly invisible and a poor fit for any known illness, I am struggling to be taken seriously by doctors. I am often dismissed as a hypochondriac, despite not suffering from anxiety - to the extent that I am anxious, it is a response to my weird symptoms. Funnily enough, I also have weirdly shiny skin since taking Minoxidil, especially on my hands, but all over my body. But of course, the visual effects pale in regard to the muscle problems. \nThanks,\nFlex", "Covid Vaccine Hi all. \n\nI was just wondering, are there any vaccines that are GBS \"safe\"? Because I am up for a county government job that requires proof of vaccination. Alternatively can I ask to be exempt with a doctors note? And if so how would I go about asking my doctor about that?\n\nThank you for any info", "Hey, just joined currently in hospital with GBS (Grade 4) from the AstraZeneca vaccine. They are getting ready to discharge me to home and out patient rehab. Look forward to reading about everyone is experiences  I am so sorry to hear that. Can you explain what grade 4 means ? Bed ridden not on a vent I am wishing you all the best and a full recovery. Keep us posted on your progress. I am 40, was an avid weight lifter and runner. I had facial paralysis at my worst I could not lift my arms or legs. I could not swallow. I can walk with a walker now and do 16-18 stairs. Legs and feet are still pretty numb. I seem to be improving. I think a lot has to do with getting IVIG very promptly. I was still able to walk into the ER. Honestly the worst was the post IVIG headaches after each round I was curled up in the fetal position. I also had wicked hypertension Will do. My daughter has CIDP and used to get the worst IVIG headaches.  Her neurologist switched her to subcutaneous Hizentra and she tolerates it much better.  Sorry to hear about your situation.  Best of luck Hey! If you go to my profile there is my story on there. I am just about 2 years out from my experience. Best advice would be to do all the rehab, do all the exercises, get on meds if you are in pain (I had TERRIBLE pain in my feet so am on Gabapentin still to this day). It is a long process and nobody knows where you will end up on recovery. There is a guy here who is organizing a GBS zoom call for people who have been through it if you are interested I can get you connected. As of right now the first call is to take place next Wednesday. Sorry you are going through this, it does suck but gets a bit better every day. Thanks I would love the connect Ok great! The guy who is organizing the call is u/MrOrange487. I will be on the zoom call as well, and really am looking forward to others who have been through this crap too. That ivig headache was the worse thing I experienced. I remember they had to put me a sleep because of the pain.  \n\nFelt like a literal sledge hammer. Lol \n\nGood luck with your recovery. Yeah they gave me hydro morphine but it just put me to sleep Here I am! So sorry you are dealing with this now. When I was in the hospital with it in 2018, there were FOUR other people on my unit with GBS, but were on totally different timelines. GBS is already so rare and unique, as is each individual experience. I will shoot you a direct message a little bit later on with the details.\n\nThanks for connecting him with us Newgirl!", "Anyone else feeling dread that their GBS will return after getting the Covid Vaccine? I got my first dose of the Moderna Vaccine 3 weeks ago and have my second one coming up. I was already experiencing a lot of anxiety over getting it and now with the new news I am losing my mind a bit. Every time my hand or leg falls asleep I panic haha. I know it is more irrational but I just wanted to see if any other past GBS people could relate. It almost feels like I am just waiting for it to kick in. I had GBS when I was a child, maybe 6 years old so i do not even know what it would be like as an adult but I am a super active outdoor person and hate the idea of losing a year to fighting GBS. All of us. Solidarity in anxiety! But so far I have not seen any reports of relapses... hang in there and do not let your anxiety trick you. Thanks man, I appreciate the reassurance. I basically made this post fishing for it haha. And happy cake day! The odds of getting GBS are one in 100,000 under normal circumstances. Getting it associated with a vaccine is one in 600,000.  Under normal circumstances to get GBS the first time you were in Michigan Stadium, at full capacity, and you picked the the one seat that got GBS.  Now do that again!   Putting the odds in perspective can help alleviate anxiety around getting it again. Oh wow, i did not even notice. I had both Pfizer and had no issues. Seriously. Glad I rolled the dice though I understand this but this assumes you would be exposed to the virus if you do not get the vaccine. Is not this like comparing deliberately rolling one dice now VS taking the risk of rolling 6 dice if I were infected? And as more people are vaccinated the chance of getting infected goes down? Would not I have had a greater chance of exposure prior to mass vaccinations? I do not want to be an anti-vaxer but as someone who had GBS, I am hesitant. I guess it is comforting that it sounds like the chances of GBS returning is not greater than someone getting GBS for the first time. Is that sound? I had Pzifer almost 3-4 months ago and I have had no issues, but it is still a fear of mine. Would not those who had GBS be at higher risk?  \nYour data presumes no prexisting GBS Out of curiosity, are you on active treatment for your GBS?  That is a missing piece of info from the discussion on the vaccines - how many of us are actively being treated for GBS, and how many of us are not. True the odds are in our favor! I thought the odds of GBS coming back a second time are greater than it happening the first time? I may have just made that up but I swear I read it before. (EDIT) what I met is the odds of it coming back are smaller. Sorry. Good to know! Nope. I had GBS as a child around 5 years old and fully recovered. I am 33 now. The anxiety was extremely horrible before my first Pfizer dose (which was at the end of April). I even had a panic attack at the clinic when I got it....luckily the nurse was so nice and helped me with some breathing exercises. And the next week was some of the worst anxiety I have felt in my life, any single thing wrong with my body scared me. I had been spending hours reading and thinking about if it was the right decision, reading Facebook posts in GBS groups, reading medical papers about the mRNA vaccines, scraping the news for any signs of GBS linked to the Pfizer vaccine....and then, after the first week after my first shot, I stopped reading all those things. I went back to my life, because I was feeling fine. By the time I got my second dose I felt this sense of calm, because I knew that even with the anxiety of worrying about relapse (though the chance of this is extremely low!!) I was going to start being able to let go of the anxiety I had felt for the last year and a half...at least a little bit. Now several months out, I am so incredibly happy I got vaccinated. Happy to be able to see my family and friends again. Hope you can find some calm after the anxiety that, I think, many of us have experienced through this process. My 74yo mother, GBS survivor, had her Moderna shots in Feb/March.  All good!  She had consulted with her Neuro extensively as she was very concerned like you.  Particularly since her version was not vaccine triggered, the Doc said the risk of getting the virus wildly outweighed the risk of the vaccine. I had GBS 25 years ago. I was completely paralysed and on a ventalator for six weeks. Ended up getting traeched. I spent close to six months in hospital and rehab. I was very nervous getting vaccinated, but was assured the mRNA vaccine were safe. I had two doses of Pfizer with minimal side effects. I have been double vax'd for over a month and now I am no longer nervous. I had an episode about five years post GBS that my hand was tingling. Turned out to just be carpel tunnel syndrome. I think when you have survived GBS, there is always a worry that it will reoccur, even though I know the likely hood is very low. Exactly.  That is what I am concerned about.  \nWe have some data about the risk of anyone getting GBS from a vaccine, like above.\nBut I have not seen a damn thing about the covid vaccines for those with GBS history.  (except J&amp;J) Thanks for writing this up. You are totally right on just not thinking about it. Good to hear! Happy your grandma is doing well Thanks for writing this up. Oh man I use my hands for a lot and get tingling all the time. It really freaks me out but I have to remind my self... You rock climb multiple times a week, spend all day at a computer, and constantly have your phone to your face... Probably carpal tunnel haha. Sorry I met I have always heard the odds are smaller. So you have an even smaller chance of it coming back then it happening in the first place. You are welcome! Easier said than done, I know... But, if that is the case, why do doctors advise prior GBS patients to not take the influenza vaccine?  \nClearly there is more risk for those who have had it. I have shot 2 tomorrow. I am much more fearful of Covid than I am the vaccine, that is for sure. If you have Guillain-Barr\u00e9, vaccines are a HUGE NO\nI was told from the day I was discharged from the hospital 20 years ago that I could not get any vaccines at all I have had it three times. I am not allowed to do vaccines &amp; I am grown, but my family went super conservative and do not even believe in covid. They came over and lied about being sick, and now I just tested positive for  covid. I am terrified too. Studies on pub med are saying 4-8 weeks following vaccines/illness is peak time. They are also saying to try to manage stressors? Lol There is been a lot more data and research in the past 20 years that revises that stance. I went with Moderna. If it helps, I got GBS and IVIG both in January of this year. I got vaccinated about 90 days out of the hospital. A WHOLE ton of data. My ultra Conservative anti-vax sister and her horde brought covid to my mother's house )I am a live in care giver) and got us both sick. Covid barely effected me, But two days after quarantine, I became paralyzed. I am new to this group and Reddit but I am thankful my husband found this. Ten years ago I was diagnosed with GBS (Miller Fisher variant). In less than 36 hours I went from average day to day life to being fully paralyzed and intubated. On the third day I had an allergic reaction to one of the medications and almost passed away. I also got C-diff on top of it all. I was intubated for three weeks and was hospitalized for about five months. At the time they could not give me an answer as to why this happened to me but told me that I should never get the flu vaccine or it would likely happen again. Later on down the road they believe it was linked to a single dose of the HPV vaccine. \nI am in my thirties now and since recovering from GBS I have avoided voluntary vaccines for myself per the guidance of my healthcare providers. I am not against vaccines as my children have received all their scheduled vaccinations so far.  Recently my workplace has added the Covid vaccine to their mandatory list. After trying to do my own research and getting varying opinions from my PCPs I put in an exemption form but was denied as they said my history of GBS is not a contraindication. That sparked me to dig further and after reading this thread as well as the recommendations of the International GBS foundation, I have decided to get the MRNA vaccine. My appointment is tomorrow afternoon. As a Mom of two kids under the age of three I am terrified for a reoccurrence but I am also excited to hopefully have it go well so that I can have some protection and can provide antibodies via my breast milk to my babies.\nThank you to everyone for your courage and for sharing your stories. I hope that mine will turn out to be a motivational one as I plan to post an update as well. \u2764\ufe0f I hope you are doing well and only continue getting better! Much appreciated. I am doing better. It is hard to hold onto, especially with the depression kicking my ass, and having gotten fat again, but I am better. And I make continuous improvement. Slow, but steady.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFuck. Better. A kick in the nuts is better than a stick in the eye, I suppose. Just desperately trying not to kill myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is the absolute guilt of feeling bad about my situation when I know others have it so much worse. An odd combination of survivor's guilt and unappreciation of things. Shit's hard. facts!!! Been in the bubble since all of this started.. still in a bubble.   I am feeling this too. I am being mandated to get vaccinated now for work so I have consulted with all my doctors. My neurologist says the risk of getting the virus outweighs the risk of a recurrent case of GBS that can also happen from the virus. He recommends mRNA as being safer than Johnson.\n\nMy immunologist does not want any of her patients getting it but she understands people are being forced to now. Says Johnson is safer because she does not yet trust the mRNA vaccines.\n\nI hate this, I just want to know what is safest for me and just getting this crap over with. I had GBS/TM overnight 11 years ago and even though I know it is not likely to happen again I am still facing trauma from it when I am put in a situation that says it *can* happen.\n\nNormal people do not understand what is it is like to lose the ability to walk and they take it for granted every day of their lives. They treat us like anti-vax monsters but in reality we have a very tangible fear that they will never understand. I just want whatever path is safest for me and so I just want to figure out which vaccine is less scary and get it over with. Update: I got my second dose over 50 days ago and I am fine! Was definitely nervous but happy I finally went through with it. I have had to show my vaccine passport thing multiple times this week here in NYC. I did Moderna.", "Single mom in GBS recovery here- any other parents? The involuntary separations from my toddler aged daughter when I have been hospitalized for IVIG and plasmaphresis (9 weeks total) have been absolutely horrific for me. \nI am fortunate to be back home and recovering as of 5/30. I cannot chase her around,  lift her while standing (I slowly use a walker short distances), cook for her, along with many other parenting duties. A family member moved in to help with those duties, and my baby is understandably very confused by all of this. \nAny one else here have dealt with sudden GBS disability while being a parent? Just want to considerate and maybe get some advice/support. Tia &lt;3 Children are super adaptable. As you settle in with what you can and cannot do, your child will accept that is you. A child is not comparing the before you with the now you.  I was a stay home mom when I went to the hospital for a surprise 97 day stay. My sons were just entering high school. I do not think they knew how to turn on the range. Most of my house plants died and they ate a lot of pizza, but they survived.  DO NOT set yourself up to be the \u201cbefore \u201c mom. You are a different person, with different strengths and abilities. Do not be hard on yourself. It will take time, but everything will find its level. I went down Dec 2010 with a 2 month old at home.  I was lucky enough to have my wife around, and grandparents available.\n\nI was only in the hospital for 2-3 weeks.  I did not trust myself to hold the baby without sitting down for the first 2ish months after I was released.  All of the mental concerns were compounded with that hanging over my life.  That said, your primary concern needs to be recovery and understanding any lingering effects that will change things.\n\nI recovered with little in the way of long term effects.  I fatigue in something more like a true/false fashion which was not true before GBS (I will feel just fine on energy levels right up until I crash).  I also feel like I fatigue faster, but I am also in my 40s with a desk job, so I am not sure some of that is not just age and lack of consistent exercise.  Adjusting to this new \"out of nowhere\" exhaustion meant I needed to be ready to set down or sit down our childern (we had a second child a few years later) quickly every and now.\n\nBe good, and never stop.  It will work out to a new normal. I was not a parent during my first episode in 2011. In 2014 I had my first and only kiddo, and have been hospitalized for gbs multiple times during their 7 years, (fyi, this is atypical and not likely anything you will have to endure). It is tough, not going to lie. I feel horrendously guilty. Fortunately I have an incredibly supportive partner who can be there for them when I am out, but we have zero outside help. At the start of the pandemic, I bought my kid and partner each a switch lite on top of the regular switch we have, and I have been able to connect with them by playing minecraft, among us, fortnite, animal crossing... whatever interests they had, I would play along. Also, watching youtube how to draw videos and doing reading books together are things you can do while bed bound. I cannot stress reading to your kids enough!! Anything! We love Catwad, Capt Underpants, Dog Man, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Last Kids on Earth, Hilda. Netflix and chill can be a family thing, too. Snuggle in and take an interest in things they enjoy from your bed. \n\nI have spent a good lot of the last 2 years bed bound. I hate it, but I cannot change it. So I have to be creative in order to help my family thrive. \n\nMake sure to keep your kid in the loop. Let them know what is happening with you, in words they understand. Kids are more intelligent and resilient than we realize. That got some dust in my eye. Oh my. Stupid dust....", "Fuck GBS! I am sorry for the coarse language. My father in 2017 at 71 was diagnosed with GBS after a bad sinus infection.  He was a classic Miller Fisher case.  We first thought it was a stroke but test after test ruled that out. He spent almost 6 months in ICU, acute care, and nursing home/rehab. We renovated his home to have a wheelchair accessible bathroom and bedroom. He finally recovered enough to come home, but he is a shell of a man. Before all this, he was a relatively healthy 71 year old. But now, I am fully convinced GBS has taken years off his life. My daughters went up for the weekend to visit and the text I get tonight is that Granddaddy is looking rough. Trouble getting around. Speech slurred from lack of full control of his tongue. I am not ready for this!  I expected another 10 years more with Dad!  Everyone on his side of the family has lived well into the 90\u2019s. GBS I think has taken that from us. Recovery is just too tough. He is not a spring chicken.  Dear God please let me be over reacting!\n\nI just needed to post this to get it out of my head for a bit. Thanks. It will get better, but it will take time. Daily B12 shots help me. I am really sorry to hear about this. Gbs is just terrible there is no way around it. This is a great community but if you are really struggling with this I would highly recommend seeing a therapist to get some help. There is no shame in it and a professional will be able to help you deal with the situation better. Best wishes for a recovery for your dad. My dad had it three times... it is been terrible, but he has fully recovered every single time. Last time it happened was in March and it was rough. He is still getting stronger every day. Hang in there! Thinking of you and your dad and sending positive vibes! Whoa, how far apart were the attacks? 27 years ago was the first and worst time, then 7 years ago and 4 months ago. It was always right after a bad cold. Thanks, I better watch out not to get Campylobacter jejuni ever again. I am sorry too! I know how u feel. A friend of mine has had GBS for 17 years now. Bed ridden, can only wiggle a toe or two and kind of move his right arm. He is now in ICU with pneumonia and sepsis. Destroying his family. I thought people recovered?!", "One Year Out - GBS Recovery ", "Just diagnosed yesterday, want to know everything about your experiences. Yesterday I was officially diagnosed with GBS. 24 year old male. Started almost 2 weeks ago with my hands and feet tingling, followed by weakness in the legs which then spread to the arms. Woke up yesterday morning, and I could feel my face going numb. Called my doctor and told me to go to the emergency room immediately. Told the receptionist my symptoms, and the admitted me immediately. Did a CAT scan, EKG and MRI to rule out stroke, all were fine. They did a spinal tap, and confirmed the GBS. Thankfully, I am not paralyzed, just EXTREMELY weak with burning hands and feet. My treatment started last night, and they did the second round this morning. I am going to be here for 5 days that I know of. How long did recovery take you, and did you recover entirely? What, if any, were your lingering symptoms? And how long were you in the hospital? Because of COVID, the only people they are letting me see are my parents. I am just very scared right now and any advice or words of comfort would be appreciated. Hey u/straycreature welcome to the sub. I had a VERY similar experience to you.  Like almost exactly the same. This is what I previously posted:\n\n&gt; I was first diagnosed a couple months before my 24th birthday with AIDP, then GBS, then Miller-Fisher, and now I am undiagnosed but they are treating it like GBS. It is been a whirlwind of a few months; I was in the hospital for a week, got IVIG, and was all better. Three weeks later I was admitted to the hospital, placed in the NCCU within 24 hours, on a ventilator soon after, and lost all movement/feeling in my arms and from the waist down. Thankfully, after heavy IVIG treatment I was taken off the ventilator within a couple days, was transferred out of the NCCU within a week, and then moved to a rehab facility after a couple weeks. I had to learn how to walk again and how to control my eyes (as I lost the ability to move my right eye), I lost 40 lbs, and had a lot of other things to deal with. Luckily, my wife and family supported me 24/7. \n\nI also actually had half my face paralyzed and then my entire face, which brought me to the hospital the first time. Like you, they did a CAT scan, EKG and MRI and did not find anything. But then they did the spinal tap and my protein counts were so high it was scary. \n\nDid you get a flu shot before the symptoms started? That is what happened to me and then the symptoms started.\n\nSeriously, it is weird how close your experience was to my. Here is some advice:\n\n* Stay positive; there will be a LOT of low points, but you got to focus on the recovery\n* Take it easy. You really have to be careful about not pushing yourself as you can have a relapse very easily\n* If you start showing symptoms again after your treatment, notify your neurologist/primary care physician IMMEDIATELY. The sooner you treat it the better\n* There is a very good chance it will get worse. If so, make sure you are prepared. Have people you trust know your situation. If you have family or significant others around you, make sure they will advocate on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself\n* Find a therapist immediately. Dude, this is tough shit and it will definitely affect you mentally. At least for me it did. You are going to want to talk to a professional\n* After recovery people will see you as \"100% recovered.\" You are not, and you most likely never will be. You are going to have to stay positive, but also be vocal about when and where you need help\n* Eat lots of Omega-3s, -6s, and -9s, as they help with myelin growth and repair. This will help you in the long run\n\nAgain, I am astounded at your experience and how close it was to mine, down to the smallest symptoms. If you ever want to chat PM me and I am happy to help. I am based in the western US.\n\nI wish you the best of luck and speedy recovery. You got this and you are going to kick it is ass. My onset was pretty similar to yours. I was in the hospital for 5 days for ivig, then went to an inpatient rehab for 30 days. By the time I left I was able to walk about 10 yards. Still felt extremely weak and got tired very fast. It was about 3 months after that I was able to walk almost normal again but still took about another 3 months for my stamina to come all the way back. So probably 6-7 months after my diagnosis id say I was back to about 90% normal. Just be patient with yourself. It may be frustrating at times but you will heal. And everyone is recovery is different but you are young (I was 28 when I got it) so you should bounce back pretty fast and hopefully with no lasting effects. Get on IVIG as soon as possible. There is hope. I have CIDP but I have experienced some periods of more rapid onset symptoms. I just had a skin biopsy and some of my nerves are recovering and even back in normal range. My tingling is much reduced. Working with an expert neurologist who treats CIDP all the time has saved me, so look for expertise as you battle this. \n\nMy CIDP was most likely caused by mold mycotoxins from an apartment infestation. The specific mold I was exposed to for 1.5 years damaged the myelin sheath on nerves. Do you have any information on what caused the onset? Today is my second day of IVIG! And no, I do not. YAYYY I am so glad!! You are very young. I think you will fully recover. My story the same.  Sounds like you got diagnosed pretty quickly the emergency room actually sent me home the first time I came back in because they could not figure out what it was.   Quicker you get the IVIG the better, so it should not get any worse than this right now.  I regained 95% function of facial muscles. 26yo male, diagnosed last fall - When I got treatment (IVIG) my hands and feet were tingling, it gets worse before it gets better but I am fully recovered now and stronger than I was before. Stay positive and take it one day at a time. Keep moving as much as you can even if it means walking up the hall a couple times a day with a walker - do as much as you are able to but listen to your body. You got this \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc Welcome to r/guillainbarre. We are here any time you need support or have questions. Good luck on your road to recovery. Here are a couple helpful links listed below. I also recommend keeping notes on any symptoms you experience from this point on, as it can be helpful for your doctors. \n\n1. ( to GBS/CIDP Foundation international, specifically for those recently diagnosed with GBS. \n\n2. ( to a very in depth scientific explanation of GBS/treatment/prognosis made by the American Academy of Neurology &amp; CDC. I was younger than you, but this was in ancient times before IVIG.  Long, painful process building strength and learning how to walk again.  Talk to physiotherapy when you start to heal and DO EVERYTHING THEY TELL YOU!  It will not be easy, but they know how to rebuild muscle.  It took work and time, but I eventually ran a couple of marathons years afterwards.  I suppose I am still a little clumsy to this day, but my friends tell me I was clumsy before the GB too.  ;) UPDATE: \n\nI was able to walk around my entire floor of the hospital with a walker today. Not only that, I walked up a few stairs with the support of the railing. Going up was easier than going down. I also was able to shower, although I had to sit down the whole time and it was a little strenuous, I did it. Today I feel like my legs are stronger but my arms were pretty weak. Hands and feet are still very tingly and numb at times. Had my third IVIG treatment today, so two more to go! I am trying to stay as positive as I can and move as much as I possibly can, because I feel like when I am still for too long it makes my symptoms more bothersome. That is it for now but I will keep everyone updated! Sounds just like how it started for me.  The most important thing is to keep repeating that you will get better!  Attitude is very important as your docs and nurses knows what medical treatment you need and you need to stay positive to make sure the treatments work.  I feel very fortunate because I did have a complete recovery, with a couple lingering issues.  But it took over year to get back to fully feeling like me.  The longest issues were excessive tiredness and always feeling cold.  \n\nIt is important to remember that recovery is like a saw pointed upward.  There will be ups and downs, but you will continue to move upwards.  Do not let the bad days get you down, as tomorrow will be a better day. I had an onset almost identical to yours. Tingling and numbness for a couple of weeks. Then weakness. Then facial paralysis. Immediate admission to ICU and given IVIG the next day for three days.        \n\nI continued to decline for the next 8 weeks into full paralysis. Had another round of IVIG at the end of the week 8. Stablilised but remained paralysed for the next 4 months (hospitalized for 6 months total). Was in a wheelchair for the following 3 months after leaving hospital.      \n\nThat was just over 5 years ago. I walk 20km a day at this point and work a full week as a teacher. I have been told I will never run again and I do not play guitar as well as I did. I have constant tingling in my feet.       \n\nThere is virtually no pain (and has not been any for more than 4 years) but I am thankful every day that someone does not need to feed me or change my diaper.        \n\nI wish you all the best and look forward to your stories after your recovery. You will be in my thoughts for the next few nights. Be strong - there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Keep moving. And here is the important thing - IF you become paralysed make sure there is someone there to move and stretch your limbs every day. Even to this day, how back to normal are you from before having the illness? I have pain in my feet, legs, and hands. I have chronic fatigue and, compared to before I got GBS, my energy level is much lower. I suffer from panic attacks and anxiety. I cannot feel much temperature from the knees down. I have some retina death in my right eye since they think I had Miller Fisher. But I can run, I can exercise, I can jump, I can breathe, and I can move. If you saw me you would think I was just a healthy person. How have you been able to deal with chronic fatigue? Coffee. Lots of coffee. I also have a toddler so that does not help lol. But honestly sleep. Like if I do not get 7+ hours of sleep a night I cannot function At this point I wonder if coffee would even do anything to me as I have pretty much grown addicted, crash from it fast.", "I am scared. Not yet diagnosed but have a lot of symptoms of GBS, Do I have it? I developed a slight cold about 2 weeks ago, \n\nbeen developing symptoms alot this week, abit tingle in hands and feet, stiff painful neck in the mornings, very slight urine retention when finishing off, strains and pain when standing or sitting too long. Feels like joint pain in elbows and knees, skin feels sensitive around ribs(pain when pressing), tingling only every once in a while, but none of the severe symptoms yet like numb, blinking, can still lift legs. \n\nDoctor checked last Thurs, said sensory/reflex seems fine, But I dont know what to do, if I have it??\n\nAny chance I have something else, doc said GBS is pretty rare, should I wait it out, I am new and have not found a story where people have mild gbs, its always Hospitalization? does anyone ever make a quick recovery?\n\nShould I try get my doctor to give me spinal tap? I also worried to do this as alot of stories here after getting spinal tap they start getting paralysis, does this tap make spine worse?\n\nam I worrying too much that it will make things worse? I also very skinny, dont want to risk anything If you have GBS, you will most definitively know something is wrong. While no one here can diagnose you, seems like you are overthinking and worrying a bit too much. If it develops more to the point where it truly bothers you and is happening frequently, then you should see a neurologist. But if it is something you notice every once in a while and it does not hinder your daily activities, then it is probably nothing serious. A case of GBS will always require hospitalization, but only for a few days while IVIG is infused. I went in after falling and having progressive weakness. Could not even lift my hands above my head or squat down. Got IVIG and started lifting weights again two weeks later. Modern medicine is simply amazing, and you have nothing to worry about. In my opinion.....YES.... you are worrying too much! Is that part of who you are? Get a spinal tap, it is the only definitive test there is. I am not a doctor so just my opinion. There is a point where being aware of your body and what it is doing, goes a little far and becomes hypochondria. See a Dr. Both times I had GBS ( more than once and it is called CIDP) it started at tips of fingers and toes and moved it. Tingling, like when your foot goes to sleep. Once it progresses you know, no doubt. \n\nYour symptoms do not sound like GBS.  I lost use of hands (dropped things) and lost use of feet. No other symptoms just a growing numbness after the tingling and them paralysis. \n\nA spinal tap will not diagnose it. They do a spinal to rule out other things ( like MS).  Both times a spinal told them nothing. I was officially diagnosed when I no longer had reflexes ( note: second time I knew and they believed me but could not treat until they had evidence). They hit my knee and no reaction. Doctor smiled \u2014 we could treat! \n\nRelax. Sleep. Breath. Let your body do what it needs to. If you get worse go back to doctor. \n\nKeep us posted \u2014 wishing you well! I will tell you that when I had it I could not worry about the what I had because I just felt flat out awful. That being said, I did make a fairly quickly recovery (everything is relative) but I honestly think you are  over thinking. I hope you feel better though. Go and see a neurologist. Without the spinal tap it cannot be diagnosed. &gt;it is the only definitive test there is. \n\nThis is false. There is a large percentage of GBS cases which do \\*not\\* show elevated protein through a spinal tap  (which is the indicator). It is weird that you are jumping to such a conclusion IMO. I would consult a physician if I was as seemingly concerned as you are before I consider recovery times. Good luck. It does not sound like GBS to me. The tingling would not be every once in awhile. It would be constant. You would become weaker. I had a \u201cmild\u201d case and got progressively weaker until I could barely walk or use my hands. \n\nI hope you feel better soon! That is what I was told. I was under a lot of serious drugs when they told me that. I do remember the elevated protein though. Change your doctor. GBS is diagnosed via spinal tap (high protein) and EMNG.  I never lost reflexes but could hardly walk and lift arms over my head so not really a mild case. Everyone I have talked to that has had gbs (myself included) knew there was something absolutely wrong, despite multiple doctors telling me/ them otherwise at the beginning. If you have this undeniable feeling then push doctors to test for it. My experience showed me doctors would rather dismiss it then test for it because it is so rare. How are you doing now? I hope you are feeling better!", "Possible GBS? Question on Timeline &amp; Experiences ", "Watering eyes ", "Leg strengthening after hospitalization Hi everyone!  You were all so helpful on my last post.  I got out of the hospital yesterday and am now back home.  My legs are very weak.  My neurologist in the hospital warned me about something called fatigue weakness and said that the harder I push myself the weaker I will be.  \n\nUnfortunately being back home means having to walk to the bathroom, or walk to the kitchen, and yes I am an idiot and even went to target yesterday to grocery shop.  I promise I had someone with me but I realize that I way overdid it.  Does anyone have any advice for how to build up strength and not overdo it with daily tasks?  I have not seen a PT yet since my discharge. I was able to rent a recumbent bike and kept it near my bed. For the first few days I rode it for 5-6mins at a time and had to rest after as I was really tired, slowly built up the duration each day going 10% longer each day. What worked for me was short excersize periods but as often as I felt I was able to in a day. I can see how going grocery shopping might be tough or too much as you would be out walking a fair bit without many chances to sit down and rest. Thank you for your reply.  I think I needed that reminder to sit down and rest.  I will look into getting a recumbent.  I will also remember to take breaks if I am doing grocery shopping or ask someone else to do it for me. No problem - you got this! I was a cyclist before I got sick so maybe I am biased but all the research I looked at pointed to cycling being one of the best rehab activities for GBS.  I was able to recover and even get stronger than I was before so stay positive \ud83d\udc4a I am also a cyclist and the idea of not being able to get on my road bike or mountain bike again is agonizing.  I feel like clipping in and out of the pedals is going to be my doom. For me the physical therapy is what really helped. I know you said you have not started it yet but I think that will make alot of difference. When i was discharged i could barely make it up the stairs to my bedroom because my legs would not work, it was a pretty rough time. I hope you get better every day until you feel back to normal! Yes agreed, starting physio asap is important. I needed to do alot of specific excersize to activate my calve muscles especially (I could not flex my calf for months, it is like my body forgot how to use that muscle) Physical therapy is key. When I was released I still could not go up stairs and was barely walking without walker. I started at home therapy thru Bayada Nurses to do physical therapy exercises, then when I was able to go home, I went to a physical therapy place a couple times a week. I got all my strength and independence back within 6 months total from the time I got sick. I was in hospital 1 month and inpatient rehab another month. I had in-home physical therapy at first and was shown some exercises that I will try to explain. \n\n(My balance was way off, along with massive weakness and muscle fatigue, so I had to do these exercises while holding onto the kitchen sink rim. You may not have to steady yourself, but I am just putting that info out there incase you do.)\n\n- - - -\n\nTippy toes -  Raise your ankles off the ground like you are standing on your tippy toes to look over a crowd. (Feet more centered than a shoulder width stance)\n\nLeg lifts - You will raise your knee towards your chest, like you are doing an exaggerated army march. \n(Feet at shoulder width)\n\n\nSquats - Put your butt to the ground until you are eye-level with the countertop, then stand back up. \n(Feet should be shoulder width apart)\n\n\nSide to side transfer - Stand with both feet together. Step to the left and bring your right leg to stand with your feet together, just shifted to the left of your original center position, then step right back to the center. Step right the next revolution, then back center. Repeat.\n\n- - - -\n\nLater on, this balance board helped quite a bit\n\n\n\nONLY USE IT IN A FALL-SAFE AREA AND ON CARPET! An elliptical machine was key to extending my recovery at home. The squat machine and balance ball board thing at PT is very helpful too.\n\nYou will see what works for you when you get into physical therapy. And do not be above using a shopping scooter when going to stores, it is what they are for.\n\nIf you are having really bad balance issues I would suggest asking to see a specialist for \"AFO's\" (ankle-foot orthotics), they stabilize your foot and help with the weakness and/or foot drop.\n\nYou got this! I recommend just not doing anything at all and playing games and such Listen to your body. The mind/body disconnect is real so go easy on yourself and plan walks so you do not crash while out. I still am not fully recovered (5/19) but can ride a bicycle and that in turn is helping regeneration in my feet. Resistance bands are excellent for a range of exercises and supported squats (holding onto table or chair) were my go to before free standing version. PT/OT were very good for me.  I really gained a lot of strength in 2 months, but I still had balance problems.  I use resistant bands for leg exercises while in bed, lightweight ankle weights during the day (has done wonders for balance), small hand weights while sitting around watching tv, and hand sponge and play-doh like substance for hand exercises.  None of these are overly taxing, so they are doable.\n\nI, too, made the mistake and went to Target to shop.  And I left my cane in the car because I was feeling good that day (okay, and some ego was in the way).  Well, about 20 minutes into it, my legs started getting very heavy and the numb.  There are still good people in the world who noticed I was struggling.  The helped my get to the cash register to check out, and the cashier packed everything in the cart for me.", "Post-booster GBS? Getting alarmed Got my moderna booster two weeks ago. For the last week I have been having some strange sensations in my left leg that have also affected my left arm (got booster in my right shoulder). The sensations oscillate from tingling to pins and needles and perceived weakness, but generally my leg feels off when walking. I also have a ton of anxiety but I feel like this could be something bad. Also the left side of my face occasionally feels weak. I went to a neuro a few days ago and reflexes were normal but it feels like it is getting worse. I have heard that GBS can take two weeks to get bad so I am concerned it is getting worse especially since the sensations have spread from my leg to my arm and face. What should I do?", "Hello everyone, my wife suffered from severe GBS about 10 years ago and we are in desperate need of help/advice. ", "What was your experience like with the COVID Vaccine? Hi!\n\nIt is comforting reading how informed folks seem to be on this forum. Enough so, that I have decided to make this post, as I am needing some points of view. \n\nAs a kid, I had a severe episode of GBS that involved paralysis in my legs and one occasion of pulmonary problems, all of which followed receiving a flu shot. This was back in the 90's and not a lot was known about the link between shots and the syndrome at the time. \n\nI have held off getting a vaccine for COVID, out of fear of recurrence. I even contracted COVID this year, and luckily had a mild case. But I have still postponed getting vaccinated until now - I see the trend in society where I live, and more and more places are enforcing black and white policies about vaccination. Vax card, or no entry. To gyms, to bars, to locations, etc. My place of work is even starting to harden its resolve. The writing is on the wall - be vaxed, or be gone. \n\nI have talked to four different primary care doctors over the course of 6 months about the vax. One said I was making a mountain out of a mole hill (this was before the J&amp;J FDA Warning in July. I wonder if he recanted?), another doctor said I should hold off until there was more data, and one even said that if she were in the same position she would opt out. So I am a little perplexed, as even the experts do not seem to agree. \n\nHave any of you had the same experience? Or even the same concern of recurrence? Did you get vaccinated? What happened? \n\nI would be curious and very interested to hear some of your experience regarding the vaccine. If reddit is good for one thing, it is finding community in the smallest of niches. My wife developed GBS after the J&amp;J. Certainly not anti-vax, but she is still recovering and will not be getting any additional COVID vaccines/boosters. Really traumatic experience for her and the family. I had GBS twenty years ago and have not relapsed. I opted for the Moderna vaccine since it is of the mRNA variety and not egg based. Four months later and I am still feeling fine. My employer, a big university, refused to give me the vaccine most likely because they did not want to be liable so I received it at a grocery store. My PCP did give me a note to get it. I developed GBS in October 2020 and was vaccinated with no issues in April 2021. I got Pfizer and I would not have gotten the J&amp;J because of the warnings and fear of relapse. I was concerned about relapsing but luckily I did not and no one I know personally in the GBS community relapsed due to the vaccine. I totally understand your concerns and hope this helps somewhat! There is a few other posts about this if you want to look through them. There is been few people on here that got GBS after JJ and after mRNA vaccines. My nuero and PCM have both advised against me getting the vaccine, I have no other health conditions and am not immune compromised. I got GBS 15 years ago, a bad case. I have only received a tdap since then and had a rough few weeks of muscle weakness and neurological symptoms and nerve pain after the tdap. My nuero said she has been treating many people with nueropathies and Gbs post vaccines (both JJ and mRNA) and has been reporting to vaers often. It sounds like many with a history of GBs have gotten vaccines and have been OK and some have gotten GBS after the vaccines (there is no proving the vaccine caused it per se like other cases of GBS following vaccines) at least what people have reported on here. You can look at the reports in Vaers as well. I would guess like all other vaccines for us we need to weigh the pros and cons based on our other health factors we might have and consider what our drs that know us recommend. I developed GBS from AstraZeneca. It will be a while before I get a vaccine again. I was paralyzed for a few weeks. Improving now I got GBS in 2019 and was in the hospital for almost two months. Intubated and paralyzed from the neck down. I got both doses of Pfizer when it was available earlier this year. No side effects at all.\n\nHave you spoken to a neurologist instead of primary care doctors? My neurologist whole-heartedly recommended getting the vaccine, as does the ( Also, there has been ( between COVID vaccines and GBS relapse. Amazing. Thank you for responding! Interesting that your employer did not want to be liable. I am assuming they were aware of your history somehow? Thank you! Yes good to be speaking to folks that can understand the hesitation. I am glad you have not had any issues! I am very sorry to hear that. I can imagine how traumatic it might have been for her, having experienced it myself. For what it is worth, something that helped me immensely was taking anti-inflammatory vitamins like grape seed extract and sticking to a very anti-inflammatory diet. I am sorry you guys are going through that. Excellent advice. Thank you for responding and putting so much thought into the comment. I will definitely look into Vaers. I am so sorry to hear that. I can totally understand why you would be reticent to get another vaccine. I was a kid when I had GBS and the recovery was rough. Something that I felt really helped me was swimming as a form of physical therapy. It was very beneficial to help generate muscle and circulation in my legs. I hope your recovery is quick in the big scheme of things. This is comforting to hear. Thank you. I have not spoken to a neurologist, which definitely seems like the obvious thing to do. I have been keeping aprosed the GBS/CIDP Foundation, and watching more data come in. It is just finally time to pull the trigger I suppose. In 1995, I got a severe case of GBS from a flu vaccine.  I was in ICU for 10 days, in the hospital for weeks, and it took me a year to be almost normal again.  I was about an hour from being put on the ventilator, but 4 rounds of plasmapheresis had stopped the progression of symptoms just in time.  I still have some residual neuropathy on and off to this day. My neurologist told me never to get a vaccine again as it might trigger a GBS relapse.  When the Covid vaccines came out, I tried to contact my original neurologist to ask about the vaccines, but he had passed away in 2016.  So I emailed Johns Hopkins neurology department.  They told me to definitely get one of the mRNA vaccines.  They said I was more likely to get GBS again from getting Covid, than if I got the mRNA vaccines.  So I got the Pfizer vaccines in April.  It did trigger a little bit of neuropathy after the second vaccine, but it was because I got dehydrated.  I recommend to hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!!!  I did go to the ER to check, just in case,  and got a new neurologist.  She prescribed a few weeks of physical therapy and a lot of hydration.  She also said to get a booster when it is available to my age group. I am fine now and relieved to have gotten the vaccines. The J&amp;J vaccine is the one that has the GBS warning associated with it.  I definitely understand your hesitation, but I hope this helps relieve your anxieties about it a little bit. It absolutely helps. Thank you for sharing your story. I appreciate the time you probably took to tell it. I got GBS in 2008 so a long time ago now as I was aged 12 (F). Here in the UK you had to be contacted for the vaccine, based on your vulnerability and age. I decided to ask for the Pfizer vaccine on grounds I was more vulnerable to covid having suffered GBS previously. I did my research and concluded that mRNA was reported the least risky for people who had GBS and avoid J&amp;J and AZ. After a quick investigation the doctors approved, I had normal vaccine side effects on my first shot (headaches, brain fog) and on the second shot, absolutely no symptoms and i felt fine. No symptoms to report to date.\n\nEdit: I know everybody\u2019s experience with GBS in terms of trauma and suffering they faced differs.  It was the worst time of my life, but my thought process was that, a relapse was unlikely to severely harm me (I would notice the symptoms instantly, I know what treatment works) where as you never know how your body will react to Covid. I preferred to take my chance with the vaccine than die from an illness where treatment is sketchy and not always successful. Especially knowing my autoimmune system has definitely played up in the past - could it handle covid? Something for people to think about. Thanks so much for the tips and kind words! We are in the process of overhauling our diet, so hopefully that helps her as well. You are welcome. Whatever you chose I wish you well! I tried to get vaccinated earlier on since I am essential personal and immune compromised. I am sure they declined me due to not enough data at the time despite the CDC stating it was OK. All totally valid points. I am glad that you did not have any flair ups from your autoimmune system related to the vaccine though. In my case, I actually contracted Covid from some vaccinated folks. It was only a mild case, although it took about 4 months to fully recover. Everyone is experiences is so subjective and consequential to do many factors and variables. I got GBS after the Pfizer vaccine. My neurologist and primary care physician said no more vaccines of any kind whatsoever for the remainder of my life.\n\nAsk your doctor for a letter to explain to your employer why you should be medically exempt. I got the J&amp;J, wha were some early signs she felt?", "Doctors in Pennsylvania Does anyone have recommendations for further testing after emergency room stay? Doctors did not think it was but further research leads me to believe I have a mild case. Anyone know anyone competent with this illness im PA?", "Can You Still Feel It? Why Can I? So, hey again. This is a weird sort of post, but I get these tiny bouts of terror. Sometimes, although I have been out of the hospital for years now, I still feel the pins and needles in my feet. And hands. I feel them race up and down my bones, and eventually, it does fade. But it still happens.\n\nEvery time I sit too long, or even sometimes without prompting, my legs or feet will just ever so slightly go numb. I am so scared of it. I know the chance of relapse is slim- so slim. *But there is still a chance.*   \n\n\nThe scarier thing is that, on occasion, my legs will \"fall asleep\". I say \"fall asleep\" because I do not have any other way of describing it. From my hip down, I feel as though my leg is on fire. My whole leg tenses, and I can only imagine that that is what being burnt alive feels like. Electricity is shot up and down my nerve endings, and trying to put any weight on that leg feels like Medieval torture. It goes away in anywhere from 2-8 minutes, I would guess. \n\nSo, the question is, what the hell is this? Also, can anyone relate? Been out of the hospital for a year and still feel it pretty strongly. \n\nFrom the knees down feels like I have been punched everywhere. My feet tingle and feel like they have pin pricks. My left arm and hand still have tremors, and I have lost a great deal of my dexterity. \n\nI still have weakness in my legs, and from time to time my hands hurt a ton. I am tired 90% of the time. And I do not expect it to ever be 100% again. \n\nUnfortunately, this is what happens for most people. We are the unlucky/unfortunate to have been dealt our hand. However, it could always be worse (that is what I tell myself). \n\nI have good days and bad days, but this sub provides a great amount of support. I know I am not going to feel great all the time \u2014 hell, I will not feel great 75% of the time. But I have accepted what is happened, and I strive to work within my situation to enjoy life and get better. \n\nI feel for you. I know how you feel. But all I know is I am grateful every day that I can breathe again, that I can walk again, and that I can see again. We are the unlucky few, but it could always be worse. Best of luck to you. Thank you for sharing, man. I am so sorry for what you have been going through, and I hope that you recover as much as you can. I think it is so amazing that you are able to see the positive. I was real bitter for a long time over it, and I still have days where I am.   \n\n\nBest of luck to you, too, man. I kind of like looking at it as the sad backstory to our eventual heroic story arch. I know its childish, but it takes away the harshness of things. Hey it is all good!  Life is good and my wife and I are expecting our first kid so we are excited. \n\nAnd I totally understand. And honestly one of the best things you can do is focus on that bitterness, understand why you feel that way, and then move on. Expressing your feelings is good, because it will just nag at you in the back of your head if you do not. \n\nI love that though!  You have gone through so much, and overcome more than most people do in their lives, and you should be proud of it!  I hope your recovery continues and here is to a great future ahead of you! It is completely relatable. I had this constant sense of dread, that it would come back. Physical rehab did not help with this feeling at all, since basically exercising lead to sore muscles and that soreness was too close to the symptoms of the onset. \n\nI was only able to forget it, albeit not completely, by resuming a normal life, having a job really helps out, you stop worrying about whether or not it will come back and start worrying about your tasks at your workplace.\n\nI cannot feel exactly what you describe anymore. But I would lie to you if I said that this fear of having a new onset is completely gone. Congratulations!! That is absolutely incredible! I hope everything goes well with the pregnancy and your kid is happy and healthy. :))   \n\n\nAgain, thank you! This little convo makes me feel a lot better. It is so nice to hear from people who actually *understand* what I mean when I describe this sort of stuff. Even though it is been so long, every med journal I read talks about the chance of relapse, even years later. It messes me up all the time, honestly.   \n\n\nI have been able to mostly get a normal life, and I am forever grateful for that. I think it just sits on me a lot because I know that many my age will not understand morality in the way I do, and so it is difficult for me to explain it to anyone.   \n\n\nHopefully, for the both of us, we are some of the lucky ones who have this in our past, and can keep going forward. Sadly, it really varies person to person..some people recover great, some have lingering lifetime issues. I am in the latter camp, had it when I was 5 and stuff just keeps getting worse as I get older :( \n\nOne piece of advice I will give is be absolutely sure it is a potential relapse if you want to be checked, as the test is a spinal tap. I went to a teaching hospital for one (poor, American) when I thought it was relapsing and now I have spinal cord damage and constant pain from three botched attempts from a resident who was too egotistical to call in help. \n\nDo not be me, be an advocate for yourself and if something hurts say so. My husband almost had to get a spinal tap here in Australia and I was floored by the consent form listing all the potential consequences, something I was never shown in America. So do not be afraid of treatment, but also do not stand for subpar, uninformed treatment. Always ask about the risks because treatment for GBS/CIDP can have risks.", "Do you know what caused your GBS? Can stress do it? When I was diagnosed, I could not remember having a significant illness that would have caused this. The only thing I can really think of is about 3 weeks before my onset of symptoms, I had a lot of pain in the back of my head where it connects to my neck, waking up with the worst headaches of my life a few times a week, and unexplainable mouth ulcers (like 6 at a time, it was awful). So maybe I had some sort of viral/bacterial infection? I was also under a lot of stress because of family related issues and had just started a new job. When I had initially gone to the doctor's for my symptoms, I had blood tests done and my Vitamin D levels were very low at 18, so that would explain a weak immune system response. The doctors did tell me that they found bacteria in my spine while doing the lumbar puncture, but that also could have been from the needle. I was never given a definitive reason as to what caused this. Anyone else out there without a known cause to their illness? The exact cause of GBS is unknown. Only 2/3 report an infection or sickness before onset. I was exposed to phosphine gas, had a hep B vaccine and the worst flu in a very long time all within a few weeks of each other. But most notably I got a deep cut on my hand from a barbwire fence with the feeling of bunched up socks in my boots a day later. Within a couple of weeks I could not walk up stairs and lost all feeling short of the buzz in my body. Luckily I did not end up in the hospital and made a recovery. I still have issues in my hands and feet 8 years later. Mine was triggered from routine gallbladder surgery. Ended up paralyzed a week after surgery They never figured out what caused my GBS one doctor said maybe it was stress induced? I did not know if he was joking or not but at the time I was under a tremendous amount of stress, I guess I will never really know! Only thing of note I had was 3 week long cold before my onset.  It was not even that bad of a cold, just would not go away. \n\nStress does screw with your immune system and general health as well, so it could be related. The cause of mine was never discovered. I do not recall having any kind of illness prior to onset. I was under the worst stress of my life when my GBS hit; I also had gotten a bug the week before, a head cold that moved to my stomach. I felt better for 1 day then it hit. I definitely have always suspected stress may have played a part in causing it. No, stress can be a risk factor, but is not a cause in itself.\n\nInfections are the most common triggers, but the disease itself is autoimmune in nature (which means your B-cells have made an unusual mistake). The first time that I had it when I was 7, I got sick with an awful stomach bug almost ten days before the onset of GBS. However, when I got it again a couple of years earlier, I had just moved to a new city from my hometown, and was under tremendous mental and physical stress. I do not recall any prior infections, so I am assuming its the stress that sealed the deal. I was paralyzed and on my back about 5 days after a Prevnar 13 vaccine. Nothing else I can point to. Had a flu shot a couple months prior, so that is not likely it, although that is a well known GBS trigger. Doctors and neurologist recommended no more vaccines ever for me. Miserable experience for months.  Do you think you will get the Covid vaccine? \nMy husband ,we think, got it from a flu shot?? Or from an ablation procedure at the hospital? Like you, his drs said he cannot get anymore flu shots. \n His internist just called and said it is ok for him to get the Covid vaccine.  Still skeptical\u2014- \nJanuary21 this was on the GBS site..\n\n  I doubt that I will get the Covid vaccine, but I have a \u201cwait an see\u201d attitude at this point. Related data could change my mind. Thx for honest response! The cause of mine is unknown, but in my opinion, I think it was stress. Four weeks prior to the onset of my symptoms I had taken the Tetanus vaccine.", "Nerve pain I was diagnosed two months ago, still recovering. I have nerve pain in hands and foot. Is that normal? I have severe neuropathy in my legs and feet. GBS 4 years ago. It is normal. Mines permanent along with foot drop Do you still have the pain, 4 years after? I would say it is normal. About 3 years later I still have neuropathy in my feet, my hands less often but sometimes they hurt still. If you are not sure, check with your neurologist. Mine has me on gabapentin to help with the pain. Yes. Severe. On high dose of lyrica but still have numbness, tingling, burning. I have barely any feeing in my feet and lower legs. My biggest complaint over the pain is I have no temperature regulation in legs and feet so I constantly feel like im standing in ice water. Needless to say I have tried so many meds and failed so I smoke weed daily. I was only able to stand for no longer than 10 mins before i was exhausted and in. Excruciating pain. I went from walker to cane soon after i started smoking daily. It depends on your age. The younger you are, the better the recovery. In my 30s I have horrible nerve pain in one leg, numbness and tingling sensation in both feet.  I was taking 800 mgs of Gabapentin every six hours.  I stopped taking it when all my hair started falling out.  I deal with the pain but have found the more walking and motion in the leg the less it hurts.  I also wear a compression bandage for the continuous swelling.  Unfortunately my nerve damage is permanent but I am learning to live with it.  I take tramadol when it is excruciating.  I have heard great things about Delta 8 that has .03% THC.  It is legal in KY and sold at most Vape shops.  Downside, if medical or recreational is not permitted in your state you should avoid it.  (It can be legal to sell at such a low % even if your state has not passed a law for medical or recreational use).  It will cause a dirty drug test and if you currently take prescribed opiods the doctors have to report the results.  They will cease prescribing pain meds immediately.  Kind of a Catch 22.  I have family members that use Delta 8 gummies for back pain, another for PTSD with favorable results.  I hope you find a solution that works for you.  We all have lived through the onslaught of GBS but the outcome is different for each of us.  It will get better and as time moves forward you will have far more sunny days than gray, gloomy ones. Its completely normal. Ive almost recovered and still have it sometimes so i got to take a pill to ease it. 8 years later \ud83d\ude0e I was 5 so i was lucky but recovered is still fairly long id say about 10 years because im 13 now and im almost 100%", "Anyone else depressed or anxious after GBS? I just feel like I am spiraling. Keep your head up. It is a tough fight. You can do this. Reach out to friends or family.  Get therapy if need be. You got this. I am getting therapy. Trying to get disability for the short term Yeah, for me, not only do I have residual nerve damage and fatigue 8 years post GBS, but it takes a mental toll. I feel like going through that caused medical PTSD since I had to get a lumbar puncture, lived temporarily at a nursing home in my mid 20s, etc. Things do get better, try to have a good support system and look to the future I think it is natural to feel these things, to go through GBS is one hell of a biographical disturbance. Do not be hard on yourself. For me focusing on growth post trauma has been key, taking all that pain and anxiety and trying to make the best of it rather than let it weigh me down. It is not easy... but it is the best way to go imo. \n\nI went from being highly active at work and in my free time to complete paralysis and blind in one eye so I can empathize.

And not being able to help or fix something drives me nuts (apologies for turning this into a \"about me\", but iam). This has turned my life into a living hell. Or we will have company over and I feel like a sociopath because she is hurting and I act numb (in the name of being a good host) cannot do anything to help aside from getting her stuff and keeping her comfortable. It is crazy. I feel obligated to explain my side of it. When it is just us I cuddle and comfort her best I can. And do all the leg work around the house.\n\n\nFuck GBS.  Is all I can say. Good luck in you future indevers. I am rooting for you. I am trying to get some sort of disability since I am unable to work. Hoping to regain more function. Apparently the government thinks I am more capable than I am. Much appreciated. I might just do that. Much appreciated. I hate it for all of us but it is nice to not feel so alone. For me, the depression did not get bad until I was almost out of the hospital and back home. It hit me then what kind of life I would have to live once I left the hospital and that was not a life I wanted to be living. I felt useless and hopeless. You are not alone in how you are feeling. It is a biologically rough time but it is also a mentally hard time. I think it is super important to remember to take care of your mental health as much as your physical health. Also, I would look online to find other GBS groups because for me, being able to talk with or be around other people who have gone through what I am going through was really helpful and allowed me to see that there is a life for me after GBS. I am in therapy and trying to get better. PTSD issues from my hospital stay. I begged them to kill me. In a Covid wing so no one could visit or touch me. The nurses did not want to come in because of having to wear a new gown each time. I have had it 3x. Once was inflammation induced, two were stress induced. To say im anxious about stressing about stressing about covid (I just had it - a feverish nightmare for 21 days and im just waiting for GBS to recur) is an understatement. \n\nThe huberman lab podcast episode with sapolaky &amp; Nagoski\u2019s burnout book were helpful educational distractions about stress tho idk I understand that 100%. I went to the hospital from my college dorm so they determined that I was at risk for covid even after testing negative a bunch of times. That definitely increased the depression for me because I was just so alone and the nurses would check in on me maybe once a day, so I felt extremely isolated from everyone. And due to COVID we could not have visitors which made it a lot harder to cope with everything Yes. I am about seven months into my recovery. I am thankful for all the progress I have made, but I am still discouraged I am not further along. I have moved in with my parents. They live in a rural area. The feeling of loneliness and missing out on the things I use to do are almost as tough as the physical limitations.\n\nI also miss working so much. My job requires lots of walking and driving, which I just cannot do yet. I have also applied for disability, but was denied as well. I am so sorry you had to experience that. I was pretty close to losing my ability to breathe, so I saw people a little more often, but I could not roll over by myself. Was always in agony. I am exactly there. In the sticks, cannot drive.

How long would it take to diagnose me with GBS after covid vaxx? i have been struggling for WEEKS. I have the worst metallic tast in my mouth ever its been since september 16th was the onset of my symptoms. Terrible pain in my head &amp; face, like a cold burning feeling. Pain in my vaccinated arm and hand, AWFUL. Heart palpitations, weak/skipping pulse, loose bowels. Chest tightness, muscle soreness (mostly in my underarms literally makes it hard for me to take a deep breath) &amp; shortness of breath, so much so that I almost passed out one time after getting ridiculously lightheaded. Could this be GBS? Its taken me two months to schedule a cerebrospinal MRI to check for GBS or something of the sort, but genuinely I feel like I am going to die. I have been to the ER 5 times for this and everytime I am sent home with a \u201cwe do not really know.\u201d PLEASE HELP.", "Can it be GBS? ", "My girlfriend had/has GBS, I am looking for information about the recovery process. First of all a huge thank you to everyone who shares their stories here, it made the hospital stay feel less lonely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend was diagnosed with GBS on the 24th of last month despite the spinal tap results coming back fine. A higher grade neurologist was called in and he confirmed the diagnosis, he said the spinal results being ok supported the diagnosis of it being mild. It was diagnosed as a mild case as it only affected her legs and hands (which I consider serious because she could not walk at all, not even stand up, move her feet or even toes) and it was said she would make a full recovery. She had IVIG treatment for 5 days and after seeing some positive results (being able to barely wiggle her toes, hand numbness slowly going away, upper legs slowly feeling less numb) we were sent home. \n\nFirst week home was great, her numbness was slowly getting better, her PT was going great even to the point of being able to walk with a walker without anybody having to hold her up, etc. however, the day after her most demanding PT day where where her body was pushed to limits she had not reached before, she could not walk at all due to pain in her feet. She says it is like a burning sensation with small needles stabbing her feet constantly as well as hypersensitivity. Because of this, her PT has regressed, she can no longer walk, and is only now beginning to stand up with help. The worst part of all is that her feet pain has gotten to the point where she cannot sleep because the pain keeps waking her up.\n\nI wanted to know (if it is someone with a \"mild\" diagnoses even better) if as the doctor (not neurologist, will see him next month) told us, this burning and needle stabbing sensation and hypersensitivity is normal to have in a diagnosis like hers, especially since she was recovering quickly, but this last week has us a bit worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you! hi i was diagnosed with mild gbs on the 26th of last month. i was lucky because i could still walk but my legs and hands were so numb walking up and down stairs was difficult for me. i have been out of the hospital for 2 weeks now.. the days after the hospital i was super sick. pale, nausea, headaches but i assume it was from the ivig side effects. the eventually went away but then my hand numbness got worse. my hands are so numb now that i cannot write. Also i get the same sensation it feels like a stinging shooting pain randomly and wake up multiple times at night from the discomfort of the numbness. i have been trying to find answers and it could be our nerves healing that is causing that. i also posted some other research i found About foods to avoid. I was diagnosed 4 years ago. Effected up to my belly button and my hands. Spinal tap also negative because they caught it so early. Ivig 6 days then sent to rehab hospital for pt/ot for a few weeks then home. I have severe neuropathy and some paralysis still in my legs and feet. I have foot drop both feet. My hands have improved. Minimal pin. The pain she has is from the nerve damage. Nerves regenerate very slowly. Gbs peak for recovery is 2 yrs so at that point you will know what permanent residual she will have. Ask PT for pool therapy. I was painless in a pool. I wear AFOs and walk with a cane.  Edited to add. I also have no temperature regulation in my feet or legs so I feel like I am always standing in ice water. I have tried multiple meds over the years. I was at a point i couldnt stand for longer than 10 minutes without being exhausted and in severe pain. Honestly smoking weed saved me   My husband was diagnosed in May. He would tell me about similar experiences and feelings that your wife is a experiencing. The burning feeling comes and goes but from my understanding, it is a sign the nerves are repairing. Some days are worst than others. Gabapentin really helped him. He still gets that feeling in his finger tips from time to time but he says the burning feeling can go away for a couple days at a time now. He notices the burning tends to be a result of an active day. He also had IVIG treatment. GBS recovery takes awhile. He still has some numbness in his hands and feet but has come such a long way. Wishing you and your wife the best and for her to have a speedy recovery! My friend's mom had GBS when she was a kid. 40 years later, she still has sensitive feet.\nMy sister had it two years ago and is still recovering. She had the most aggressive form of GBS (could not move at all, nearly stopped breathing, her intestines stopped moving), she often has cramps under the knee.\nI would say it is common, your girlfriend needs to keep working on her recovery, she cannot stall. Maybe try gently mobilizing her legs while she is laying down, blood flow is super important. My Little sister had a mild case of GBS back in 2018. She was 20 when diagnosed, and she is completely recovered now (with zero residuals).\n\nI work in film, so I filmed and edited her recovery:\n\n\nAfter her recovery I got involved with the Canadian GBS foundation and filmed a series of patient stories for them. Here is my sister's interview.\n\n\nI am at home with a newborn right now so if your partner wants to talk to someone or has questions/fears/concerns, please reach out. I was my sister's primary caregiver and I lived with her in the hospital for 2 months. I know quite intimately what the recovery process is like, and I can happily chat. The scariest part is now behind your partner, and patience is will be your biggest helper from now on. I was diagnosed with the Miller Fisher variant of GBS. I guess you could consider my symptoms as mild as I was not put on a ventilator and was still able to walk, albeit very unsteady. My symptoms started with numbness in hands and feet, double vision, my right eye drooped, headaches, muscle weakness. After spending ten days in hospital it was confirmed as mfs. Subsequent issues included massive weight loss, facial palsy and a continuation of the other issues I mentioned. Things improved after 3/4 months but I was not completely recovered for around a year or so. I feel my case was mild in comparison to others which I put down to being relatively fit and healthy and being under 40.", "Can I rework my muscles if I can still feel it despite it looking like bare bones ", "Tingling/crawling feeling in face? Does anyone know if that is a symptom or an early symptom of GBS? For the last few days off and on I have had just small tinkling feeling on my face. Like on my nose or forehead.\n\nWhen I had GBS before it really just affected my feet/legs/and hands, thankfully.\n\nI just want to know if anyone experienced this or if it is maybe just skin crawling as normal.. when I look up symptoms that is not one of them but who knows. Thank you. I had a lot of numbness in my face but I had MFS which starts from the head and works down. It was not a small tingling though it was complete numbness on the inside of my mouth, lips, and cheeks. When I had GBS my entire right side of my face drooped, I have not had any issues with it since then. Well, besides the fact that it is still weaker than my left side. Started with acute GBSabout five years ago,  got diagnosed with GBS, MFS and bilateral Bell's Palsy. Recovered about 40%. Face hurts most (literally, it hurts). Get to a neurologist quickly.  I lost all movement in my face, still cannot smile with my teeth showing, still cannot close my eyes tightly in the sure, eye nerves hurts. Left side is back about 50%, right about 30%. Stiff upper lip and cannot wrinkle forehead. Good luck man! In the shower... I am sorry. I went to the both the ER and my doctor today. Was panicking so I went to the emergency. They said they basically think it is just anxiety but if I am having a reoccurrence my symptoms are very mild right now. They said I could a lumbar puncture if I wanted but based on the mildness of my symptoms they would not recommend it with the risks involved.\n\nDoctor said they think it is a mix of anxiety (been very bad lately) and left over nerve damage/pain. She does not think I need a lumbar puncture at all.", "6 months+ cannot walk club Hey. If it took you longer than usual to recover or still have not recovered yet like me please feel free to share your story here.\n\nI am 20, 8 months in and today I did an EMG and the doctor said I have not improved much at all since my last EMG 4 months ago. I can use a walker but cannot even stand up or sit down independently and I fall all the time. Walking outside is a no go.\n\nI am losing my mind and know so few people like me and none irl. I have no idea what is going on. Just let me know if you are out there. Have you been diagnosed?  What treatments are you receiving?  I hope you are not just receiving some diagnostic testing and being sent on your way. I have and I got 5 rounds of IVIG about a week after my diagnosis. I have been doing PT ever since I left the hospital about 7 months ago. I was 24 when I got sick and had a similar trajectory like you are experiencing.\n\nIt is very likely you need more treatment and as soon as you can get it. 5 days of IVIG at diagnosis is barely a dent. It will back off that initial attack but it usually roars back once the IVIG has faded. I know IVIG is very expensive so if that is not an option, steroids or a steroid sparing medicine could help. \n\nThe PT is good but all you are doing is making nerves and muscles work while they are under attack. \n\nId also recommend AFOs. They will assist with walking  and keep you from falling which is very dangerous. I fell and tripped all the time before I got them due to the drop foot...in both feet. The doctors keep telling me I do not need more than that. Is my immune system still attacking my nerves even though I am not getting worse? My diagnosis is GBS btw. You are right IVIG is very expensive, but in my country it is possible to get it for free if the doctor is willing to prescribe it. That is why it took me a week to get my 5 rounds. The hospital (public) would not approve it because I am a refugee here and it took going through a ton of red-tape and loopholes to have my insurance cover it. I am honestly very disillusioned with healthcare and feel very lost. \n\nI took corticosteroids in my first months, I would really appreciate it if you could elaborate on that part more.\n\n\nI already use an AFO. I can barely walk without it. Hello I got gbs a year and a half ago and my balance and equilibrium was off and still is I struggle with vision issues too that can be attributing to me not walking good. At 6 months I could not walk solo it is been a year and a half I can walk solo now with a cane and walker but I poop out fast I do not know why I am still not able to walk completely solo without a walker or cane. But you will get there a lot quicker than me especially if you do not have vision issues or balance issues. Keep your strength and exercises up Only balance issues but my vision is fine. I am sorry about that. I am rooting for you. Thanks a lot for the reply. I am in the same boat,im 21 months post onset of GBS still paralyzed from my waist down with some impairment of my upper body as well. At diagnosis I was paralyzed from the neck down. I have gotten some things back like some of my upper body and I can somewhat move my legs but not much. Still have trouble swallowing,paralyzed diaphragm on 1 side,sleep apnea due to the diaphragm issue,drop foot,little to no feeling in my extremities besides my feet,severe pain,muscle spasms,gi issues,bowel and bladder issues,vision issues,etc.I am non weight baring at all. Some patients take longer to recover and some only recover certain things. Although it is frustrating you are not alone I am sorry to hear you are struggling because of the healthcare bureaucracy. This disease is difficult enough just on its own.\n\nWith GBS/CIDP, neurology uses plasmapheresis, IVIG, steroids, non steroid agents like Cellcept, methotrexate and Imuran, and in some select cases, Rituximab and other monoclonal antibody treatments.\n\nIt would appear from your post, the cost of treatment is an issue for somebody or someone, so if IVIG is not in the cards, an oral medication may work. Steroids are quite effective but they are devils in that they create new health problems like weight gain, possible diabetes, etc.\n\nBottom line is that you need something to beat it back. You do not want this to progress where it is creating large areas of muscle atrophy and nerve damage. I am not a medical doctor and this is not medical advice. But my thinking is that if there is a concern about continuing immune attack, then maybe another CSF draw could help rule that in or out? That might be a lot cheaper and faster than pursuing IVIG and then waiting to see if it worked or not? I am thinking if there are elevated antibodies that might be rationale to initiate another round of therapy and maybe even diagnose you with CIDP. But that is something to ask your doctor about, I think.\n\nIf you are not actively getting worse and just not getting better, I can also see why your doctor's might take that as positive evidence for just a slowly recovering GBS though. Might want to discuss further with your doctors to more fully understand the diagnosis, how they arrived at it, and what else there might be done to optimize understanding of your condition?\n\nIt might be worth getting a second opinion on what PT to do? I am not physical therapist, but if your exercises are not working well for you, maybe a more knowledgeable professional would have a better idea of what might do the trick? I do not think it would hurt at least. Even just somebody telling you 'no, you are working too hard', or 'you need to work harder' could be invaluable. A second pair of eyes is always valuable, too.\n\nRecovery blogs from some GBS patients detail recoveries that take years. Some also detail disappointment as they reach the 6 month or so mark and are not nearly as far as along as they thought they should be. So even your feeling of disappointment might not be unusual either. \n\nKeep fighting for your health and keep reaching out. You need more help and you are right to reach and start feeling out a way where you can find that help and start to change and improve your situation even more. Keep fighting. And good luck! Balance and coordination issues are normal from my understanding but because I was still having issues walking they did a nerve conduction test on me to make sure my nerves were reacting correctly try asking for one of those if balance issues continue. I am rooting for you too. Stay strong and keep pushing Hey man! Keep positive I was completely immobilized in icu for 6 months. Went from barely being able to stand to a full day of walking in about 2.5 months of rehab. I spent the longest time thinking things wouldnt get better and not seeing any improvements but it all came out of nowhere. If you need someone to chat with lmk! Now i have CIDP and  I have been doing plasma exchange for the last 18 months and it has helped, i started ivig first to get me waking with a walker then 60 mg of prednisone daily for 18 months which helped for twelve months then the last 6 months saw decreased effectiveness. Then i moved to plasma exchange which made it so i only need a cane to walk  now in two weeks i will be adding RITUXAN to my treatments and it has been touted as being a miracle treatment for GBS/CIDP", "Pins and needles a month after J&amp;J vaccine and mono infection- GBS? I have been trying to lurk around the sub to see if any of these symptoms look like anything I have been feeling so far, but I think it might be easiest to just ask outright? \n\nSo, on like September 31st I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, (20F if it helps) \nAnd everything went as it should have till about five days later. Fevers and headaches similar to the vaccine, escalated to some pain on both sides, tachycardia. I even nearly passed out once in a lobby trying to get a covid test. (Which turned out to be negative.) \n\nSo after a few weeks I finally got my doctor to take me seriously, and got diagnosed with mono last week. Though at that point I was on the tail end of it. \nI also had some pretty bad blood work when it came to my liver, and an enlarged spleen. \nI thought everything was fine, I kept feeling tired all day and like pretty weak towards the end of the day so I just assumed it was fatigue from mono. \nBut while I was in one of my college classes- a choir- I found it difficult to sing because breathing in too deeply hurt, (chalked it up to my spleen though) and my chest felt tight. I could feel my heart racing as well. I am positive if I had taken my heart rate it would have been too fast again. \n\nI think it was when I headed to my car- feeling really weak- naturally I went ahead and got some food, and felt better afterwards, but while I was reading up on some stuff wondering if mono had anything to do with my heart rate, I noticed out of like no where seemingly like the entirety of my legs seemed to tingle with that annoying pins and needle sensation. I am not entirely sure but I think it is been changing spots occasionally. Right now it is my thighs, knees, parts of my shins that kind of tingle. I do not know if I am imagining it but it feels like my face and hands are itching as well. \nBut it went on for hours. I got out of my car and headed to class, did not stop the tingling. Even now, like 7+ hours later it is still tingling. \n\nI do not think it is entirely constant, I only really feel it when I stay still (though it happens really quickly), and I can still walk around fine and all, it is just sometimes my legs feel weak. \n\nSo im just wondering if I am overthinking or if Im right to be a little worried about this. Especially considering that I was diagnosed positive for mono AND got the vaccine a month ago that claims to have increased risk for this. \n\nI did schedule an appointment with my doctor (she wanted me to come in this week anyways for a check up and more bloodwork to make sure everything is fine) but that is not until Thursday. Though I did have plans to go to an emergency clinic or wherever I have to go if it gets any worse. \nBut just having some insight from people who have experiences this would make me feel a little better. (Or at least less paranoid.) So sorry about what you have been going through. I know how scary it can be, as I was 24 when I was diagnosed in 2019. \n\nWhat makes your situation difficult is both J&amp;J as well as mono could cause GBS to develop, so, without significant testing, there is no way to be sure.\n\nIn terms of your symptoms, they seem relatively mild but I would definitely keep note if they get worse. If they progress before your appointment on Thursday I would go to the ER. Explain your symptoms and, if you are worried enough, request a lumbar puncture. That is really the best way to figure out if you have GBS or not.\n\nIt took a while for me to be properly diagnosed. I was first diagnosed with Bell's Palsy, then AIDP, then Miller Fisher.  My doctors could not nail down the exact cause. They think it was most likely the flu vaccine, but it could have been a virus around the same time.\n\nAgain, I am so sorry about your situation. Do not ignore your symptoms, and make sure to be very clear with how you feel and that you want them to take you seriously. If need be have a family member there with you. GBS is tough because it is (in my experience) the last diagnosis considered.\n\nBest of luck and feel free to ask any questions here. There is a lot of very knowledgeable and empathetic people on this sub. Outside of completely being unable to walk, what other symptoms would I get if it is GBS that would indicate I should head to the doctor and request testing for GBS based on both the vaccine and the mono infection leading to believe it is this? The tingling hurts but mono sucked so I am sure I can survive until Thursday, but I want to be sure I do not accidently miss signs that it is advancing? \n\nYou also said I seem to have a pretty mild case. So should I be worried about paralysis or should I be able to mostly avoid an extended hospital visit considering the lack of severity? Given that this is GBS, anyways. Though I do not think feeling your legs, feet, and face tingle as soon as you sit/lay down for hours is really normal to begin with? Definitely not mono related. The biggest symptom for me, both the first time I was admitted to the hospital (week long stay) and the second time (almost two months), was severe weakness.\n\nThe second time my wife and mom had to essentially carry me into the ER. I also had a serious migraine the second time. Additionally, if your breathing gets harder you need to act fast.\n\nAlso I do not mean to diminish what is going on by saying your symptoms are relatively mild right now. I am mostly saying if it is GBS then it can progress quite quickly. If it moves past tingling before Thursday to pain, severe weakness, or paralysis that is when you go to the ER.\n\nIn terms of a hospital stay, it really depends on what treatment they decide for you. My first stint in the hospital I could still walk and move but they kept me in-patient for a week to complete IVIG treatment. If you do need to be admitted to the hospital for treatment, more likely than not you will have to stay at least a few days. That is just based off of my limited knowledge, though. The inability to walk or use extremities within their full function due to muscle weakness is the main marker for GBS. It is also bilateral. Meaning what you are experiencing happens equally on both sides of your body. Spinal tap and or EMG test is needed to aid diagnosis confirmation. Your tendon reflexes will need to be checked as these are usually not reactive with GBS. If you are experiencing muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, chest pain,etc. you need to see a doctor/ER soon as GBS can progress quickly, resulting in paralysis and sometimes death. \n\nSources:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as personal experience. \n\nIf you have any questions for me please feel free to message me. &gt; bad blood work when it came to my liver, and an enlarged spleen\n\nThose are not GBS, though your other symptoms could be GBS.\n\nPressure your doctor for more help, and maybe try to get another opinion. Oh, I already know that is thanks to mono, I was just listing problems I experienced/am experiencing so I could be sure that some issues (like having pain when I breathe) would be unrelated to GBS or not.", "Ups and downs? From your experience, in the beginning stages do you have good days and bad days, or is it progressively and consistently worse? This is the 14 day mark (no diagnosis yet) and for instance, today was a better day than yesterday. There has been no loss of reflexes at all and no pain, just malaise. \nReally appreciate your insight. I had complete loss of reflexes, facial paralysis, numb hand and feet, and a defunct swallowing reflex, where I kept dropping food in my lungs. There was not a single good day. It was 5 years ago, and still today I do not have good days. I have the Miller-Fisher variety. Sorry to hear it. Good luck with everything, I hope it passes soon.\n\nFor me it got progressively worse over the course of a day. I woke up with numb toes and double vision (on my 18th birthday :P), I went to the hospital and sat waiting in emerg. for a few hours while it spread up my legs. I got a spinal tap, then was eventually rushed to another hospital and intubated upon arrival. Later that night I could only move my eyes, I cannot say what time it was.\n\nI got IVIG treatment and started to regain nerve function after two weeks, then spent two weeks in a rehab facility for recovery and physio. I went home with a cane and then regained most muscle control after a month or two. \n\nI still get tired often. I was diagnosed with Miller Fisher and also Hashimoto's. When I came back for a follow up the neurologist said I made a full recovery. My GP just attributes any tiredness to depression / hyopthyroidism. It is frustrating, but I do not think there is a treatment that would help anyway. I rarely think about GBS any more, though I still have lingering issues and plenty of ups and downs. You will too -- it is a long, long road and your issues sound completely normal. \n\nI was diagnosed in 1995. Not really, from the point my symptoms started until they were at its worst, it was just progressively worse and worse and worse until it settled (about two weeks) it did not get better but it also did not worsened, until I was properly diagnosed (about two or three months for a proper diagnosis). If you do not mind answering, what kinds of issues do you have? What are your bad days like?\n\nI have days where I am exhausted and dread the idea of going to work, also days where moving around and walking seems to require more concentration. If it is really bad it feels like I am piloting my body around. A psychiatrist said it could be some form of depersonalization from anxiety. That is a long story. The feet are the worst part -- extensive walking or even just wearing shoes gets painful after several hours, especially if it is hot. When we travel, I frequently need to sit down to rest my feet during a long day of touring around. After a trip like that, it can take several days to recover. If there is any constant in the last 25 years, it is that. Otherwise, it is phantom pain and sensation all over my body. I have a recurring itch/burning that ONLY appears in my left armpit from time to time. A pain on the right side of my rib cage, never the left. Bizarre itching/pins-and-needles that could show up anywhere. And tremors in my hands sometimes. This all comes and goes, and of course the worse things are the more anxiety it creates, which begets new problems...\n\nFor the most part (98% of the time) I have learned to live with it, but when I am having many symptoms flaring up together it can be really devastating. Eventually it all goes away though.", "24 hrs. Post COVID-19 VACCINE COVID-19 Vaccine-24 Hour Update\n\nSeveral of you have asked me to keep you updated on my experience with the COVID-19 vaccine and because I know what an agonizing decision this can be for so many of us who are GBS survivors. I wanted to openly share my personal experience with you all. I hope it is helpful and will aid some of you in weighing out the pros and cons in taking the vaccine. I fully respect and understand not everyone will make the choice I did and I personally struggled with this decision. It was not taken lightly.\n\nI am currently 24 hours out from having the Moderna  COVID-19 vaccine. \n\nI was able go get the vaccine through my local health department  because I feel into 1B priority group in Texas which includes people over 65 or if you have a medical condition putting you at a higher risk of complications should you become infected with COVID-19. It was free and I waited for two hours. I was prepared to have a letter of medical necessity but it was not required and when I checked in I was simply asked if I was a medical worker or high risk and that was all the vetting done. I will say the vaccine has not been in as high demand as other places and our local officials have been very liberal in giving it to people who fall into the group 1B category because they are concerned the vaccines will go to waste. \n\nAfter I got the shot I was required to wait at the clinic for 15 minutes to ensure there were no adverse side effects or an allergic reaction. I felt a little lite headed and slightly nauseated as I was waiting to leave. I contributed this to stress because of the lack of social distancing and just the anxiety I had over all in making this decision. \n\nAbout two hours after the vaccine I had chills and a low grade fever 99.8-99.9. The injection sight became very painful and has remained this way. I simply took Advil and went to bed early. \n\nToday I have a headache, feel slightly dizzy, my throat hurts a little and my stomach is kind of upset. Overall I feel really tired and sluggish. I definitely do not have a ton of energy. I would not be going to work if I had to today or doing anything extra (like my monthly book club I missing tonight). I currently do not have much of an appetite and I feel achy all over-no tingling, burning or numbness like you have with the onset of GBS. It feels like a mild version of the flu. It is not terrible but I definitely do not feel great. \n\nI will leave another update in a few days and I hope this information is helpful. Thanks for sharing.  I hope that what you are experiencing will quickly go away. Thank you for sharing, I am sure many of us appreciate it, myself included. Take care of yourself. Thank you for sharing, i hope you feel better soon! Thank you for up date. I hope you are feeling  better soon. Thank you for updating us. Hope you feel better soon enough Thanks for letting us know.  (A bit selfishly) I am wishing you all the best outcomes!\n\nI am curious if you spoke to your primary care physician or to a neurologist ahead of time, if only to let them know of your decision Thanks!  I am still waiting for my chance, but I hope to join you soon. Yes, I consulted a ton of medical professionals and I did hours of my own research. It was a challenging decision but at the end of the day for me the vaccine was the best choice. I live in an area where COVID-19 is not taken seriously and this region has stayed at level red which is the highest level. Unfortunately very few people here follow CDC guidelines, social distance or wear masks. Our hospitals have been at capacity and having already been on a ventilator from GBS I have been concerned if I needed one it may not be available to me because of the demand from COVID-19. Several times people medically in need of ventilators have had to be transported to other hospitals hundreds of miles away. The vaccine is less of a risk statistically for me than living in the area I do and not contracting COVID-19 or having a relapse due to COVID. I feel like it was overall the best choice for me. Is it without risks-no. \n\nI fully respect it is not the right or best choice for everyone but for me I feel like it is worth the risk to better protect myself and be proactive. I appreciate your outlining your reasoning.\n\nI have similar, but different reasoning, though I have not done any research.  I am now approaching an age (I swear I am not, but that would be a lie) that along with high blood pressure and some other issues makes me really not want to get covid.\n\nSo I am looking forward to getting a vaccine and getting on with my life....\n\nI do plan on waiting until our current surge is over and ICUs have room for a GBS patient, just in case.\n\nBest wishes to you! Any Update Today? Thanks for your updates. I have the opportunity to get it next week but waiting for my Neuro to get back to be sure I want to go through with it. Even though I have read the research and reports, what really tipped me towards yes is the fact I have been working from home for 9 months and my community is at something like 36% positive and most do not take it seriously. Between being so lonely from being home this long and my community's lack of concern for others, my mental health is pushing heavier than my concern of the vaccine. I know that is a highly personal decision. I am not trying to push someone either way, only explaining my reasoning. But ultimately, when my neuro gets back with me, that will solidify my decision. I would love an update, too!! Any updates? Hoping for update Update please? I am getting my second shot tomorrow and I have had no abnormal side effects from the first vaccine. Any updates?", "My story ", "GBS after J&amp;J? 23m. I got my J&amp;J shot 3 weeks ago (30th August). \n\n\n5 days ago I started having pins and needles in my right leg and arm. They were not persistent and only lasted for a few seconds. Today I was better, but I started to have a light face tingling (also lasted only for a few seconds). This thing is driving me nuts and I have read so many articles about GBS, I might have anxiety now. Are these signs of GBS? go check with a doctor, there is lots of possible reasons for your symptoms As I person coping with GBS please see a doctor. Keep us posted. Absolutely see a dr. And say you think you have GBS.  If you do and you catch it early you can avoid permanent damage.  My daughter needed a spinal tap before they could confirm gbs, so it might take some observation, before they go that far. Today was better. No more pins and needles, just a small pain in my right foot. Go see anyway. Better to have tests done and catch it early before it blows up on you. Hi did you figure out what it was? My doc was on holidays so I could not make an appointment but meanwhile all my symptoms have disappeared. Apparently pins and needles are quite common after J&amp;J and Moderna.", "How is nerve damage repaired? Is there a way to tell if nerves are permanently damaged?  Read the part about Alpha-lipoic acid\n\n", "What are your tips and tricks to prevent the inevitable night and morning cramps? 3 years ago, I contracted GBS in Japan after eating beef carpaccio and having a short, week long digestive illness. Luckily, I am a health care practitioner and was able to self diagnose using differential diagnosis and within a day of onset of symptoms was able to find my way to a hospital. \n\nRehab was long and tough (and *always* ongoing, am I right?). What sucks the most in the aftermath is the number of cramps I get per day. For the first 2 years, I would cramp nearly 100-200 times a day, often in places I would never cramped before. The worst, though, are my cramps at night/morning. \n\nI am working and am on my feet for at least 8 hours a day. When I come home, my routine has been to indulge in a rather large amount of smoked cannabis that cuts my cramps down to 10-15/day. \n\nI have decided to try and stop smoking cold Turkey in an attempt to not drive my body into the ground with all the lung/circulatory problems that come with smoking (oh, and I have hyperthyroidism so smoking is a big no no in the first place.)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt is nearly day 6 since quitting smoking. I take tinctures but they do little, if at all. My topical cannabis creams thankfully dull the painful sensations of cramping (absolutely fascinating btw, would recommend for anyone rehabbing from any type of injury or illness to prevent overwork commonly associated with taking painkillers). But as I am about to drift to sleep, I will get the **fattest** cramps in my tibialis anterior, gastrocs, or quads. It is been keeping me up at night and in the mornings, bilateral cramps in all 3 muscles are common. I arrived to work 30 min late because I physically could not get out of bed, for every micro movement triggered a massive cascade of bilateral cramps in all 3 muscle groups listed above. I could not even reach for the cannabis cream and Mohrus tape I keep on my nightstand. \n\n\n&amp;nbps;\n\nWhat are your go to meds/remedies for cramping? I would appreciate non-prescription suggestions and would greatly appreciate more natural solutions. Obviously, I stretch every day and I even use the theragun for 1-1.5 hrs after work to loosen up the muscles. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn a final note, I would like to express my sympathies for the female sex. A month ago, I experienced what was probably the closest to a menstrual cramp in my lower pelvic wall. HOLY HELL is it debilitating. I doubled over and could not move for a solid 15 minutes. \n\nOn a final, final note, I would seriously recommend smoking cannabis or eating edibles as a solid solution. It is been a blessing that I have lived in a legal state the past 2 years. High quality medical cannabis (yes, GBS is a qualifying condition for a prescription) has increased the quality of my life, albeit with some other health drawbacks. Depending on the strain, cannabis itself may not stop the cramps but it definitely changes how your brain perceives it. No longer is a cramp a debilitating pulse of fiery pain. Instead, it is a more dull tightness that nags the sides of your consciousness. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn a final, final, final note, I am curious. What does this sub think is the most debilitating cramp? A tibialis anterior cramp or a quad cramp? Both are nearly impossible to stretch out when supine and my god, they are just so ever persistent! My vote goes to quad cramps as they are harder to stretch while in bed. For tib anterior cramps I just roll over and use the bed to plantar flex my foot against the bed to stretch out the cramp. I had to use a LOT of neurontin and xanaflex for a while. Never found cannabis helpful. I started taking magnesium malate night and morning. Magnesium oil topically does help but I got to where I could not tolerate the burning on my skin. Ktape to help with proprioception can ward off untoward positions that trigger the cramp. Lidocaine patches between the cramp area and the spine help me a lot. Heated mattress pad to sleep on. TENS unit, set correctly, can break the cramp and help reset the muscle itself. I have not scraped up the money but the ketamine clinics springing up sound promising. Ketamine supposedly re-sets all those spinal pain and reflex gates to stop the spasms. Eat more bananas. The potassium helps mitigate cramps. Will help a bit! I had really bad muscle cramps that started in my feet, moved up to my calves, thighs, and even the sides of my body.  I take Robaxin (methocarbamol), and it has almost made the cramps non-existent.", "2 years ago I was in the hospital..and I was HOT. Were you? It is always with me now, and not a week goes by where I do not think about the fear of wondering if I was going to survive (prior to my diagnosis.) I was 26 at the time. Male. \n\nI had the Miller Fisher variant which started in my mouth and my eyes. Ended up in the ER as my symptoms worsened towards facial and right hand paralysis. By day 4, my face was paralyzed, my right hand was paralyzed, my other arm was getting there. Day 5, I wokeup vomiting because I could not breath. My throat muscles did not work and I couldnt swallow. My diaphragm did not work either. I went into respiratory failure. I remember contemplating my life on the way to the ICU, not knowing what was wrong. Wondering if I was dying. \n\nWell, I was not. Ended up in Boston in the ICU for 2 and a half weeks, and spent the next 2 and a half months hospitalized at a rehab where I recovered and was discharged home with a cane. \n\nI am healthy, strong, back in grad school and doing well..but man it has effected my life. Still present. I have some insomnia as a result, and unfortunately, I got back to my d job too early. So a part of me still feels it has not had enough time to heal. But other than that, I am doing great.\n\nMy question for you all: when you had GBS, were you hot and sweaty? For a month and a half, I felt like I had a 104 fever. i was shocked to see my blood temp was normal. Each day was full of sweat, heat, and my poor visitors holding a tiny fan inch from my face. \n\nDid anyone else experience extreme heat as a symptom? Even in an air conditioned room? I had ascending GBS almost 4 years ago. It took a few days to go from numbness to the ER and a couple more before full paralysis and intubation. I was on a ventilator for over 2 months, discharged in a wheelchair at 3 months, walking unassisted at 4.5 months.\n\nThe first month I spent in the ICU and I definitely felt very hot though I do not think I actually was. I requested and got ice packs constantly. I think I generally had 4 at any given time. Even some (but not all) people's hands placed on my skin felt very hot.\n\nIronically, I really did not like having a fan on me \ud83d\ude42. And there was a relaxing courtyard in the hospital with lots of bamboo and and open ceiling that I was taken down to once. I was certain it had extremely strong fans in the floor. I visited after discharged and there was no mechanical wind.\n\nGlad to hear you are doing better and hope you keep recovering! YES. The 2.5 weeks I was in the hospital, before the rehabilitation hospital, I had a cool cloth on my forehead because I was CONSTANTLY burning up. The only time I was cold was when I had to get plasmapheresis.\n\nIt was January, single digit temperatures, and I would BEG the physical therapist to take me downstairs and outside so I could cool off!\n\nEven after being discharged, I was running hot for about 3 months. Wow!. I cooled off while I was in rehabilitation. However, one of the frightening moments was when I realized I did not have a temperature. The day I had the nerve conducting test, I was completely paralyzed and had no sensation. Other than heat. My eyes were closed, so I could not see my body. however, I had this ghost sensation that my hands were crossed over my stomach. They sat me up and lifted my arm to do the nerve test. Mind you, they told me it may be painful. I felt nothing. I did not feel them lift my arm, I did not feel any electricity, I felt. absolutely nothing. I remember being so confused when I saw my right arm being lifted when I still felt my hands crossed over my stomach. It was shocking, my brain convinced itself that it was feeling my hands on my stomach when my arms were to my side.\n\nAnyway I am off track, because my point here is that I thought I had a fever of over 104\u00b0. When they sat me up to do the test, I got to look at my vitals and my body temperature which was around 98\u00b0. I was utterly shocked and confused why I was feeling so hot What is weird is I struggled to sense temperature at all the first month or so I was home. Or at least that is when I noticed it since I was able to go sit outside a little more.  It was winter and I could be out without a jacket. I still put one on since I knew it was just my body being weird. I even got a third degree burn on my leg because I could not feel heat (I think it was my heating pad I had wrapped around my legs to try to help with pain). Now I am super careful feeling stuff or asking a family member for help if I am not sure. I did! I refused a gown or sheets and needed aircon and a fan.       \n\nI was not a pretty sight in my glorious adult diaper. I guess nursing staff have seen far worse. I was diagnosed with MFS on June 3rd 2019. I recovered really quickly and was discharged from hospital on July 19th. I was then fully recovered by November 2019 I would say. \n\nBut after I got home to continue my recovery I remember at almost the same time every day I would be overcome with an extremely hot flush and would sweat profusely for about 10-15 minutes. It would only ever happen once a day and took a good few months to stop. \n\nIn hospital I felt hot alot too. But I also took cold flushes. I used to alternate between the two, sometimes several times an hour.\n\nIt does eventually stop, though. Oh I know! I was sick 2 years ago. It stopped before I was even discharged. What caused your MFS to start? \n\nMine was triggered after I got food poisoning from a Dominos chicken pizza. The chicken was not cooked properly and had campylobacter in it which gave me food poisoning which developed into MFS 8 days later. 3 days later I was completely paralysed, unable to even open my eyes. It was fucking horrendous to say the least, as I am no doubt sure you will know!\n\nCongrats on beating it, too, by the way!! Oh wow! How are you doing now? Any residual symptoms?\n\nMine was from the Epstein Barr Virus (mono virus), although I did not have viral symptoms. Well, I did. For a week I was getting daily headaches, which does not usually happen. I went to a doctor, saw an NP who tried to diagnose me with an allergy headache. Did not buy it. I ended up getting a fever. A few days later I finally felt back to normal. Later that day it started with blurred vision and numbness in the roof of my mouth. Went to urgent care, who sent me to the ER for a spinal tap to rule out meningitis. I was admitted and treated for neuro lyme for 4 days. Over the next 4 days my face became more numb and paralyzed, as did my right hand. I am the 5th day, I went into respiratory failure and was med flown into Boston where I received my diagnosis. Over the next week I defended into total paralysis where I remained for 2 weeks. Was then transferred to rehab hospital where I recovered and was weened off the ventilator. After terrible nerve pain, catheter issues etc, I was discharged. I was hospitalized from June 15th to august 28th. That sounds horrendous. I hated being on a ventilator and a tracheostomy, unable to speak, eat or drink for a full month while I had the tracheostomy fitted.\n\nI would say I am 99% back to normal and have been since november or december last year. The only residual effect I notice sometimes is when im tired my eyes do not quite focus perfectly but that is not very often. All in all I cant complain with how I have recovered considering it completely took over my body within 3 days of my symptoms starting, which were have no balance, double vision and unable to speak properly as if my tongue was swollen (which it wasnt). I actually thought I would taken a stroke or something similar at first, but luckily the doctor who diagnosed me had previously diagnosed someone with MFS so knew exactly what it was.", "Update 2: One month out Hi. I have been out of the hospital for one month and I have gotten back to 100% again. I have been hiking and swimming and am generally the active person I was before I got GBS. Granted, I am not exactly *old*, so that may contribute to the fast time of recovery. I have had a bit of leg pain but that seems to be alleviated for the most part. It is the end of a long and painful era, I guess. \n\nSome of the nurses and CNA's I had to deal with were human scum, but they are in the past now and I never have to see *them* again. I still cannot get over the sharp contrast between the hospitals in Buffalo, NY and Winston-Salem, NC. In Buffalo everyone was nice and really wanted to help me. Once I got medivac'd to North Carolina I was pretty much just treated like a number. Man, I hate American health care. Luckily I had insurance because there are people who do not and have to pay *TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FUCKING DOLLARS FOR AN ER VISIT!* I feel so bad for all of the people still stuck in that rehab center that have been there for months. I wish there was something I could do to help them but I do not know how. \n\nI came out of the hospital extremely motivated to continue with life but after seeing what I saw there I just want to isolate myself from everyone and live in a shack in the woods, or something. Luckily we had a GoFundMe that raised 20k to support us, which was pretty damn cool. Also, celebrities I like (and some that I have never heard of in my life) sent me well-wishes over Twitter. I also received a bunch of gifts from Internet strangers. What really bothered me, though, is all the \"prayers\" that people were giving me. I do not personally have a religion and feel prayer is a way to do nothing and say you are helping. I do not really know how to describe it.. \"cheated\", maybe? I get that they meant well but it irritated me for unrelated reasons. Overall, though, my life is pretty damn good and I am back to where I was before I got sick, but with a new understanding and purpose.\n\nTL;DR If I can do it, you can too. Stay safe. Congrats on the recovery. Congrats! Glad to hear you are doing better! It is awesome on the other side, yeah?\n\nDo you have lingering neuropathy? I had to take gabapentin for 9 months after I got out of the hospital but fortunately do not have to now. For someone who had a relatively fast recovery, you seem extremely bitter. And that makes me bitter. \n\nI am 29 and am a month and a day since my first symptom. I am still having issues with my autonomic system and fatigue like crazy. I was a very active and in shape person. Considering that I fracture 5 vertebrae in May in an outside fall and after both issues, I am back to walking and I am very grateful.\n\nI was given no money but I also did not ask for anything. I have fairly good insurance but am still at $5k out of pocket expenses so far. You have so many things to be thankful for. Probably not what you wanted to hear but I feel like it is the truth. \n\nI wish you the best of luck I got off of it (gabapentin) like 10 days later man Why are you so pissed off at me? What does my story have to do with anything you are experiencing? Thousands of people have it worse off than either of us. The world is bleak and full of hardship and wasted lives that are snuffed out every single day. I do not have time to be thankful for anything. There is too many people out there who are in need of support and I *have* to find a way to help them. Congratulations on your recovery! I am so happy you are doing better.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to help out others. A great way is to volunteer for the (\n\nI was visited by a volunteer while I was in the hospital and it was incredibly helpful to be able to ask questions and get assurances, from someone who had gone through it, that I would make it through and it would get better. Ive been in a great shape before GBS (power lifter, gym 5x week), 1 year later still not 100% recovered. 1 month after onset my hand grip was too weak to hold a 4kg dumbbell. You are so lucky! I dislike them for a petty reason.. they recommend acupuncture on their website and that makes me irrationally angry. Also their packet for teenagers was annoyingly optimistic and did not describe anything nearly as bad as I experienced Hmm, I am surprised they recommend acupuncture given most of their spending is supposed to go to scientific research.\n\nBut I imagine they would like to hear any suggestions. They train their volunteers and I think a lot of that is how to walk the fine line between offering hope and being realistic.\n\nI have not done the training or become a volunteer yet but plan to in the future.", "Is it safe to get the vaccine? Some context, my Grandfather, father and older sister have been diagnosed with CIDP. I am at risk and show some symptoms, but no actual neuropathy. \n\nI am not anti Vax but my mom is and being young I was not allowed to get the vaccine because she said it could trigger cidp. \n\nI have since moved out and do not know if it is actually dangerous for me. I would speak to a neurologist but it is impossible to get appointment right now. Any insight would be appreciated thank you", "GBS 19 years ago, fingers never stopped tingling I was wondering if anyone else here still has tingling in their fingers after recovering from GBS? I had it in 2002 and my fingers have not stopped tingling since then. The tingling gets worse when it is cold. \n\nI have learned to live with the tingling, but am curios to know how many others have had the same experience. Ten years out. My feet are still tingling. I explain its like wearing shoes that are two sizes to small. And you can NEVER take them off.  Last thing I feel at night, first thing I feel in the morning. Fortunately there are moments I can be distracted enough to not notice. 6 years out and not only are my feet constantly tingling but my lower leg muscles are in constant twitching motion. My 4th year anniversary of GBS onset is this week and I still have the tingling in the fingers and toes, but the neurologist said that is not unexpected since these extremeties are the farthest from the spinal cord and would naturally be the last to recover, if ever. I use Aspercreme with Lidocaine on my feet and hands to releive the neuropathy, and sometimes a product called Willow Balm. Both help temporarily. You could also research products that help with nerve health, such as vitamins. I take a few, B, D, Fish Oil. I am grateful to be where I am at compared to where I was 4 years ago - paralyzed from the neck down. Good luck! Hands and feet all the time. Magnesium seems to help. 9 years out. My hands,feet and really my whole body still tingles and I deal with pain daily. I fought for and finally got disability. I am so tired all the time. But at least I can walk and for that I am grateful. This is my biggest fear. I was diagnosed on the 18th of February and after 2 (5-day) rounds of ivig, I am in a rehab facility. \nThe tingling is horrible. I play piano and make jewelry, so the pins and needles are my main concern. I am so scared it will never go away.", "I am 16 recently diagnosed with GBS and I need some advice/information The story: So 2 weeks back I would get a weird tingling in my thighs I thought it was nothing. Then a week later I tried to walk up a curb and collapsed (Christmas eve) and I tried to hide it from my family but it got to bad and I told my mom. I went to the er on (New Year\u2019s Eve) because I was unable to walk correctly I could walk but it was painful for my legs and I felt very weak In my legs. The doctors diagnosed me and I had 2 dosages of ivig. I am currently feeling numbness, tingling and pain in my feet and numbness in my calves\n\nMy Questions/thoughts: 1.  I was released today 1-3-21 but when I got home my voice started getting raspy should I be concerned or did I just lose my voice?\n2. I am currently able to walk with a walker but my legs are so weak I can barely get myself up to stand. I walked a little bit today and my feet are swollen is this normal? \n3. Do I need to go back to the hospital? because In just a few hours I started noticing a numbness sensation in my fingertips and my arms feel heavy\n4. I have headaches and they seem to be getting better but they only come at night is this normal?\n5. Is loss of voice normal with this \n\nIf anyone has the time to read and help me out I would appreciate it a lot much luck do whoever else is out there in recovery Go to the doctor or ER again, we cannot diagnose you properly. \n\nMy case: it took a week from when I started to feel numbness to being paralyzed from neck to toes I had GBS when I was 13 and was hospitalized for a week. I received 5 or 6 IVIG transfusions while hospitalized. I recommend you go back to the hospital to be safe. My paralysis was localized to my legs and was not complete (like you, I could walk with a walker but I was weak) while hospitalized and receiving treatment. I developed an unexplained rapid heart rate in the hospital that took months to go away. I also developed bell's palsy after being discharged from the hospital. Both of these things made me go back to the hospital several times after being discharged. You should go back and tell them everything you have been experiencing to make sure you are getting the care you need. I am *surprised* they sent you home already. I was in the hospital for more than a few weeks. I would go back to the doctor if you deteriorate further (cannot take care of yourself) or if you had any problem breathing. Keep in mind that if you deteriorate enough you will be unable to take care of basic needs (going to the bathroom, showers, getting dressed) without assistance and you will need to make sure you have a way to get the hospital safely. You cannot drive yourself and you will likely need assistance walking to the car. Do not add a concussion to your list of problems!\n\nI am **not** a doctor, so I will not comment on what you should expect, only what I experienced. I did not lose my voice. I did not have headaches. I was bed ridden for a couple weeks and required months of physical and occupational therapy. If your feet are swollen lay down on a bed and elevate your feet using pillows, but I did not experience this as a result of GBS ( I did however see this from a blood clot I had during my hospital stay). **AVOID STAIRS** if you are unsure about your walking ability.\n\nI am wondering if they \"kicked you out of the hospital\" as quickly as they could because of covid? I am not a doctor, but I am a recovering GBS patient. Did they do a spinal tap? That is supposedly the best test for a GBS diagnosis. These symptoms you are experiencing are pretty much what I had starting out. I hope you do not get any worse, but it is certainly possible. I went from what you are experiencing to total parlyzation from the neck down within about 5 days. I did lose my voice, but did not have the headaches you mentioned. My limbs also felt very heavy and felt swollen to me, although they were not. The IVIG you had will help. I am wondering why they only adminstered 2 doses - it should be 5 doses in 5 days. I had 2 rounds of that, but my case was considered severe. Plus my age at the time was 59 years old, so you also have your young age in your favor!\n\nI wish you luck and hope you are on the road to recovery quickly. Please choose to get competent medical advice.  \n\nI was age 10 when I got GBS (long before current treatment options were available).  I had complete paralysis, but regained the ability to walk and other motor skills over a period of months.  Losing my voice was profoundly challenging, particularly given how little I understood about what was happening and why.\n\nI cannot provide medical advice, but I am always happy to offer a word of encouragement or to share experiences.  Feel free to DM if you ever need. Right here with the others, Contact a Dr, if you do not have one available work with the ER.  The costs of healthcare or Covid can be impactful so work around those however your family can.\n\nThere is no shame in this.  GBS is scary, and confusing even for the medical staff.  Cases do not sound terribly alike in this subreddit, so while we can tell you what happened to us, we cannot really tell you what to expect. ###GBS IS RARE, SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO FIND THE RIGHT DOCTOR\n\nDo you have a regular doctor?  \n\nDo you have a neurologist?\n\nAsk your regular doctor to find you a neurologist who is most familiar with GBS, esp in teens\n\nDo not feel bad, understand that it is okay to ask for a second opinion!!\n\nThere is a facebook group: Guillain-Barre' Syndrome Survivors\n\nAnd a national foundation  that can provide more information and help you find a doctor knowledgeable in GBS.  I was sent to a specialist and there they had diagnosed me. I do have a neurologist but I have not met him yet but he told the specialist he is very confident that it is GBS I have an appointment with him this Friday. Thank you for you information I appreciate it a lot \u2764\ufe0f Thank you for this information and I have assistance from my parents with walking anywhere just in case I feel like I am going to lose balance. At the hospital they tested me for covid 3 times all came back negative but maybe your right about being there for a short amount of time. Thank you for this information I appreciate it very much and I hope you fully recovered from GBS I am just a layman who had gbs two decades ago.\n\nDo you have a regular doctor who knows you?\n\nI am a bit concerned you will not meet your neurologist until Friday.\n\nI know when I had GBS, 20 years ago, the neurologist insisted I come in that day, and canceled other appointments to make sure he saw me that day.\n\nI cannot tell you what doctors should or should not do, but make sure your primary care physician is informed about all of this, the best think my primary care physician ever did for me, is to say to me about another specialist's care \"Wait by your phone, I am going to get you a second opinion\" Thank you for this information and sharing your experience I appreciate it very much Thank you for sharing your experience yes I do have a primary doctor I had a virtual appointment earlier today and he said as long as I am breathing okay, eating okay, and swallowing okay I will be fine do keep breathing!!\n\nAnd best wishes!

I just want to hear from you it is who have had covid after GBS or specifically after covid vaccine.\n\nThanks", "Severe ongoing neck pain  Hi all, I am 21 days post IVIG and am still experiencing severe neck pain. Also orthostatic hypotension when I am not laying flat. It is slowing down my progress with pt. Anyone else experience this? What helped? TIA Not a doctor. Just wondering, are you experiencing any other symptoms like stiff neck, fever, nausea? Do you or have you shown symptoms after IVIG such as rash or shortness of breath? Has your pain been getting better, worse, or about the same? What treatments, if any, have your doctors given to help manage your pain? Have you been evaluated for aseptic meningitis? As far as other symptoms: Increased weakness (possibly due to lack of pt with the pain) and occasional double vision. No fever Are you receiving treatment for the pain? How bad would you say the pain is on a 1-10 scale? It varies, worst in the morning when I wake and when I am sitting up for a while at a 7, best with rest at a 1-2 Tylenol and flexerol Severe neck pain can be related to aseptic meningitis, a fairly serious condition. However, that tends to occur within a few days, lasts only a few days, and tend to be self-limiting. In some cases, it can start after a longer time and last longer, so you should contact your doctor and ask if this is a concern if it has not previously been addressed.\n\nIt might also be the case that the pain is not being as well managed as it could be. NSAIDs, opiates, corticosteroids, propranolol, and sumatriptan are sometimes used alone or in combination to give a better impact. I would also recommend asking your doctor if you can explore different pain management options. Taking care to note that you feel it is impacting your recovery (physical therapy).\n\nIf you are experiencing adverse events from IVIG, there are options such as changing the way it was delivered, switching to a different preparation, or switching from IVIG to something like SCIG. It would be worth bringing up with your doctor to have them balance the risk/reward of switching therapies. Be prepared that if it is only a headache, they might be inclined to stick with IVIG. Since you could do a whole lot worse with other things. But people who have adverse events are more likely to continue experiencing adverse events. So at least it might be something for you to all keep track of in case things get worse in the future, at least.\n\nSome of your other symptoms, such as orthostatic hypotension, double vision, and weakness are rarely associated with IVIG side-effects. And those also tend to be self-limiting and resolving within days to hours after infusion. Those are more often problems stemming from the underlying condition that is being treated. That is not to say that those could not be side-effects IVIG. But more to suggest that they might not be, if it helps to organize things in your head and potentially worry less. My advice is bring this all up with your doctor and ask what they think. Ask if you think these symptoms could be related to IVIG and what could be done to best manage. The headache sounds like the thing to focus on. If you have an online message service with your health provider, I would recommend using that so you have time to make sure you talk about everything you want to talk about and mention.\n\nFinally, consult with your doctor! You might notice a theme in my message. :) If something does not feel right to you, reach out and ask. If you do not like their answer, ask if they can explain to help you understand the reasoning. If you do not like the explanation, seek out a second opinion. Again, I recommend doing this all in writing so you do not forget to say something important and so you can view their correspondence as a reference for if you want to look back at it later. \n\nWhen you contact your doctor, I recommend to be brief, stick with the facts and be direct about what is bothering and what you are asking for or what you would like them to evaluate. The trick is to be as brief as possible while jamming as much detail in as you can. Assume they will read your message in 30 seconds or less. It pays to spend time crafting your message, if you can. If it is hard to write one message that contains everything, sometimes a good strategy is to write smaller messages and space them out to make sure they are fully responsive to each of your concerns, starting with whatever issue you think is most important first.\n\nIf it helps you feel less anxious, I personally think you will be fine, that you will get better or find treatment options that help you better manage your situation. I think what you are going through is terrible and would be anxiety-provoking and exhausting to everyone. It is not fair to continue to suffer when you are already suffered so much. But I believe you will get through this as well. However, all that said, do not rely on my personal unprofessional opinion -- definitely seek out professional medical advice, because we want to make sure you are covered with that if you are not already. Good luck! Thank you so very much \u2665\ufe0f Diagnosed 12/20. I had a stiff upper back and neck. Still dealing with orthostatic hypotension.

The weather for his last performance was pretty breezy so his music pages were flipped on him several times.  Luckily, my dad continued on by memory but I would like to help prevent that from happening again.\n\nMy dad has permanent damage in his hands from Guillan-Barre due to a slow diagnosis and a year long, full body paralysis.   Now binder clips take both hands to remove and he does not have the dexterity to quickly manipulate paper clips.  Playing the piano is his livelihood and he is managed to continue doing so despite his partial hand paralysis so I would like to help him continue being booked by these venues.\n\nI was hoping there may be someone out there who similarly has had to adapt to their new hands and could make a suggestion.", "What No One Tells You About Guillain-Barre Syndrome  Seriously. I think this is my favorite video of yours so far - the ow bitch, the vagina word countdown, the fact that you are talking about this...it is all awesome and fierce. Thank you so much for sharing! I love every video, but this one is the best so far!\n\nI will definitely have a monthly discussion soon about womanly issues after GBS - not just periods, but stuff like sex as well. It is huge and not really talked about. Thank you for opening up the conversation. &lt;3 GIGGITY Thank you so much \ud83d\ude0a New monthly discussion thanks to your post - thanks again for your videos, they really are great and inspire conversation! Well the huge was referring to my husband ;)", "Major decline, need support :( Double vision, facial weakness (cannot hold air in cheeks), cannot transfer , cannot roll over. Going back to hospital for IVIG again most likely. Having a relapse was my worst fear. I have only been discharged a week. Hey there, I am here for you. Keep us in touch with how you are doing. I am glad to hear you are able to text. If IVIG was helpful, try that again. I found that my pain was aided a lot by someone moving my joints around so if you are able to have someone help you in that way. You are not alone and it can feel scary. Your body responds to that fear by increasing your nerve function which can lead to an increase in development of GB. Try to take deep breaths and calm your mind. You were able to get better the first time and you will be able to get better again. Breath and tell yourself that. Believe that. \n\nKeep in touch. I am so sorry for what you are going through, it is terrifying to go through a rapid decline.  Please try not to panic as that tends to make things worse.  Take slow breaths as deep as you can, hold it as long as you can and let it go slowly.  Trust your instincts and get treatment as soon as possible. One minute at a time, one hour, one day.  The future is waiting for you and it will wait until you can meet it full on.  \ud83d\udc8c I am so sorry to hear that. Hardly anyone in the world is going to have any insight into what this feels like. What you are going through. But the people around here will know. And they will all tell you the same thing: You can do this. It will suck. But you can do this.\n\nMy advice is make your plans for how to get help. And once you have done what you can do... then do everything you can to just put your mind somewhere else. Distract yourself. If you can call people up and talk, or if somebody is around who can talk to you, just keep talking. Talking to others helped me so much. Just keep distracting. Put the TV on and try to be somewhere else. Because like other people have said, anxiety is a really enemy right now. Afaik, it will not cause damage, but it will just make everything feel worse and make the experience so much harder. It might get pretty hard. But there is literally nothing in front of you right now that you can not get through. Good luck. Take care. And please keep us updated on how you are doing. You may not be having a relapse.  It could be that you just needed IVIG for longer than the initial week.  I know it is hard, and nobody here will tell you otherwise.  Your feelings are real, I know.  I agree with what others have said.  Talk to trusted family/friends that will listen to you and let you say what is on your mind.  It does help to get it out, and then come up with your game plan.  If that is going back to the hospital, so be it.  If it is calling your doctor in the morning, so be it.\n\nPlease keep us updated.  We care! I am so sorry for what you are going through. As another patient currently hospitalized and went through identical symptoms, I just felt sad and hopeless because of how sudden the symptoms take over and you feel like you have lost every right to your body that you once had. It is so terrifying, lonely, and frustrating. I feel you so much, you are not alone my friend!! I know it feels like you are battling it alone, you are not. \nSending you so much love wherever you are. \n\nListen to some good music or an easy audio book if you can, think about good memories or have some close ones send you pictures from your childhood/ good memories. \nYou are going to get through this!!!!  Thank you all so much for your caring and supportive comments - they mean the world to me. I have had 3 of 5 plasmaphresis treatments and am showing improvements. I am trying very hard not to stress or have negative emotions which is a struggle with my preexisting anxiety issues. Improvements sure help the mindset. I am so grateful to have found this community.", " Accessibility Have you struggled with accessibility after getting GBS? If so, how? What ways do you think things could be improved? Some crosswalks really need longer walk times. When I moved back to college after my hospital discharge I almost got hit by cars most days while crossing the street next to my dorm because I literally could not walk fast enough. For me, it is the following:\n\n- Delivery orders: a mobility aide is doing me zero use if it is at the post office for collection, and my lack of mobility makes it pretty hard to collect!\n\n- Public wheelchairs: I can usually walk great but standing is horrible. That translates to lazy to 3rd parties who are not ashamed to criticize...Blizzcon, Disneyland, etc, people do not understand that standing is horrible and base this off core mobility.\n\n- Shame: this is just me getting in my own head, but I feel so anxious using a mobility aide as an overweight woman. There is so much hate and mocking and I just want to avoid being shamed\n\n- Public access: so many places will have ramps but it will be a rather long distance to get to the actual spot. Perth's art museum is a good example - there is a giant plaza between it and the closest car drop off. It is technically wheelchair accessible but it is a fucking trek if you are using a cane. That is not accessible.\n\n- Any sort of security check, sobriety test, etc: you are put through laps because you have shit balance.\n\n- Skepticism: because GBS is so rare, people are skeptical about us and our needs. I actually had to file an ADA complaint because Blizzcon was requiring medical records back to 1985 to give me a ticket sticker which allowed me to easily sit down as needed. Omg agreed, crosswalks are way too quick.\n\nEdit: I had a neighbor who was blind and they put in elongated traffic signals and chirps to help him cross to get groceries (we lived across the street from a grocery store, there were a ton of us, actually kind of makes sense). Maybe there is an option to help make local ones slower? That sobriety test one got me.  I was out on a job site with my boss when I wobbled and the resident made a snappy remarks about drinking already.  I was so stunned I did not know what to say but fortunately my boss quickly responded with \"neurological disease\".  No apology though, just a skeptical look from the resident.  Ended up hospitalized less than a week later.  \ud83d\ude11 Yep, I actually got arrested once at a traffic stop because I could not do a field sobriety test as they base it on a stupid \"walk on the straight line.\" They never breathalyzed me and I was not charged for reckless driving. It did not hold up in court but I still had to deal with the trauma of arrest, strip search, *cavity search* (this is so fuckeddddd, I consider it rape. I refused and they forcibly do it if you refuse, how is that not rape?), and several days in jail. Plus I could not afford to get my car out of impound and I could not get a new job (because I got fired for being MIA due to being imprisoned) without a car.\n\nAll because the stupid fucking laws do not take into account someone with nerve damage. That sucks so bad I am just going to shut up about my minor insult.  I am so sorry this happened to you!  \ud83d\ude2a No, please do not feel bad or be quiet about what you have been through... Everything we each go through sucks for each of us. You talking about that made me feel brave enough to share my own story and I am grateful you opened that door. \n\nMy story is pretty horrible but it is not better or worse, it is just another experience. Your story can help job sites improve while mine can help policing improve.\n\n One goal of this sub is to collect stories and anecdotes to help improve things for everyone, especially future generations, so every single experience is just as important to helping change the world for GBS :)\n\nThank you for sharing.", "Anyone who has had GBS and got COVID, did you guys do the Monoclonal Antibody treatment? Wondering if it is safe for people who has had GBS. \n\nI know we are not allowed to do any vaccines like flu shots and any sort of viruses is a trigger for it.", "Husband with GBS being vague about covid vaccine. My F37 husband M48 had GBS in youth and recovered more than 20 years ago.   \n\nI am being informed by him that he was told by a doctor that he is immune from covid due to the prior GBS.\n\nI do not feel like this is correct and I cannot find much info online no matter how I search.\n\n\nIs there any advise or sources anyone might be able to provide?  My husband is also immunocompromised due to congestive heart failure.\n\nI have no opinion on the vaccine and I will likely have mine soon (I am the only person employeed in the household and leaves little time to make the appointments I have scheduled.). I am not crazy about the vaccine but not unwilling.  I am just not able to keep my appointments as of now. Yeah that are not a thing. Rare but can contract GBS again. I had GBS in 2014. Had Pfizer vax one week ago and no side effects so far. TY for your response.  Would you happen to know any sources I can share with him to express this? \n\nThank you in advance.  Thank you most for your response and my sympathy(?) For you having to endure GBS.  From what I have been told it is quite intolerable down to the core. You really should both get it to be safe. GBS can be caused by a covid infection, which would be worse in someone who has already had GBS. Doctors have weighed in to say GBS folks should get it  I will give your husband the benefit of the doubt and say he misunderstood the doctor. \n\nI have CIDP or chronic GBS. My Neuro said to get the shot, even though I had covid in March 2020. Anything can cause a flare up for me, but my Neuro said it would be safer for me to get vaccinated. Yeah that is 100% not true. He can absolutely contract COVID. You both should get the vaccine. There is a high chance of reoccurrence of GBS from contracting COVID The GBS|CIDP International Foundation has good information  I had gbs 11 years ago. My husband had covid last dec.i give blood regular and they check, I have not had covid.\nBut I did get the shot,my arm sore but that was it.i did have a bit of hesitant.  I had m. Shot, not j&amp;J.Stay safe. So they are willing to let you possibly die because of their misguided beliefs? Nice...Ho great of them to do that for you...... Good thing your life is yours to live and not theirs.  \n\n\nGet the shot, then get the hell away from them as soon as you can. Immune from Covid due to having GBS does not make any sense, if anything it makes him more vulnerable. Had GBS in 1978 when I was 13. Got GBS again this year following Covid vaccine. All my docs attribute my GBS to the vax however to the last one they all say it is better to have gotten the vax anyway because I probably would have gotten GBS with Covid and the risks of Covid at least for me are greater because I am immuno compromised due to an unrelated condition. I do not believe in mandating the vax but ppl are politicizing it and spreading misinformation. I do not trust the government either but I do trust my docs. IMHO getting the vax is a no brainer. Went would having gbs give you immunity to covid? That.. Does not correlate. Covid can cause gbs. Some of the vaccines can also cause gbs. I was told gbs (Miller Fisher) was monophasic. Only get it once. Lo and behold i got it twice. Got the pfizer both shots. Nothing but a sore arm. I would stick to pfizer/moderna tho vs AZ/J&amp;J My GBS was in 2017, most likely from the Prevnar 13 vaccine. I was very hesitant to get the Covid 19 vaccine but I got the Covid 19 vaccine in May 2021 with typical side effects - sore shoulder and a headache, nothing more. Your husband should talk to his doctor for professional medical advice. From everythong I have read and discussed with my doctors, GBS from the Covid 19 vaccine is extemely rare. The CDC is also a good source of factual information. Good luck to both of you! My partner got covid last summer and GBS in September \u201820. He is just now recovering, but the doctor said it was important he get the vaccine because his system was not equipped to fight it off well enough without it. I had GBS this time 3 years ago. I had Covid earlier this year, worst part being loss of taste and smell for a month or so. My doctors all said not to get Moderna due to the way it is made, so I got Pfizer last month. Just had a sore arm for a day. I just got my second dose and I am having a tingling pins and needles feeling in my hands and arms. My symptoms took 4 weeks to appear. From Pfizer? Or from a different catalyst? \nMine was flu shot a few years ago, took 3 weeks to go from fine to could not walk. Hope you are doing okay. yes, from pfizer. recovery is going super slow and is making life hard. &gt;I am sorry to hear you are going through this, I hope you are getting well.  If you do not mind me asking, did you have GBS in your past as well prior to getting the vaccine? No, never had it before. Hi,I am sorry this happened to you. Would you mind me asking which vaccine did you take? Hope you are better now. I received my first vaccine 8 days later my foot cramped up like a 90 year old arthritis patient.\nI am now having muscle spasms and twitching all through my body please beware\u2026 I am so scared!!!\nHelp!", "Got GBS for the second time from a vaccine. ", "I did not know this place existed, but I am here and I want to support others! Hi, my name is Damien and I was diagnosed with GBS when I was 4. This was back in Easter of 1998.\n\nI had a bad case of tonsillitis and I was slowly getting over it. But it was one day that I was staying over at my grandparents, I was complaining of pins and needles in my joints, fingertips etc. I eventually slept that night, but by the morning I could not move my feet or legs. I remember my Gran (god rest her) telling me to stop kidding on, must have thought I was lazy lol.\n\nAnyway, roll on to when I got home that day and I was playing the playstation at the table....then my head just hit the table. Total paralysis within the space of 24-48 hours. I do not remember much after that, only what my parents have told me.\n\nI did not need a respirator thankfully. It took ~2 years to get mobile again. I have been left with a permanent bilateral foot drop requiring to get AFO's for the rest of my life. Roughly every 1-2 years.\n\n(Not related to the GBS, but I broke the same leg twice in the space of 7 months when I was 16, which has not helped the condition)\n\nIn terms of after effects....I have a terrible balance. I cannot stand for long periods of time before my back and ankles get sore. Fatigue is the biggest thing, even when growing up as a child, I could sleep for 9/10 hours easily.\n\nI got used to waking up in the morning and putting my AFO's on. You just do, because its the easiest way to walk around.\n\nI did not really know that you could relapse....I am 20 years this year since I have had it.\n\nI want to help others, even if just to let people know that things can work out. I am a Software Architect doing really well in the field. Engaged, loving life. And hopefully I can help others :D Hi, I was diagnosed with GBS December 13, 2017, and was hospitalized from then until January 9, 2018. I spent 2 days on a ventilator, 7 days in the ICU/SICU in 2 separate hospitals, ~2 weeks in the acute/neuro wing of the second hospital, then about a week and a half in inpatient rehab hospital. I then did 2 months of outpatient physical and occupational therapy.\n\nIt sounds like you might have CIDP, the reoccurring form of GBS. I learned about that at the end of my stay at rehab, because I started to relapse. This is apparently common at the 4-6 week mark of GBS, the neurologist at that hospital told me it was unlikely that I had CIDP based on my lab work. \n\nI was fortunate, I recovered pretty quickly. My neurologist originally estimated that I would be hospitalized for 4-6 months. I blew that out of the water, probably from the plasmapheresis and just plain old spite. My physical therapist at the hospital when I was in the neuro wing said he did not think I would be able to walk back to my room, after walking about 45 feet and it pissed me the fuck off, so even though I struggled, I did it just to spite him.\n\nHow are you dealing with it now? So far removed? It was really traumatic for me, I saw a psychologist for a while after I got home, and now I journal to get my thoughts out. It kind of fucked me up in the head, to be so normal and then all the sudden just not be in control of your body. Very frustrating. Since getting out of the hospital, I have been having chest pains, so my neurologist sent me to a cardiologist, and we found out that I have a congenital heart defect. I feel like I got knocked down, got back up and then got kicked down again lol.\n\nSorry this was long and rambling but if you ever want to talk, feel free to message me! I love talking to other people who have gone through GBS, it is nice to have someone understand because someone who has not had it just does not get it.  Hey! Yea, CIPD rings a bell. It was the medical term that was always thrown about at the time.\nYou see, I was lucky(if you can call it that) as I did not need ventilated. I was 4 when I was hit with the paralysis, so I did not have too much of a life before. I do not really remember life without my orthotics....so I just kind of go with it. I was on very very very very weak anti-depressants when I was younger. But I have not needed them since.\nIt was more traumatic for my parents than me. When you are a kid, you just kind of deal with it. You know nothing less than what your parents tell you to do.\nI am sorry to hear about your chest pains! It does kind of knock you down, does not it? I can relate in a way as just as I was told/learnt that I was always going to be wearing orthotics for the rest of my life I ended up breaking my left leg.....then 6 months later breaking it again.....I could not catch a break at that point (Excuse the terrible pun lol)\nI cope in many ways. I was told that I would not be able to do much/any sports....I constantly gym (When I am not fatigued) and play football as much as I can. Always trying to walk everywhere and do as much manual labour as possible. I was the same, I wanted to do it out of spite. All the doctors thought I would be wheelchair bound, I proved them wrong. It gives me a kick knowing that I can do it to prove them wrong.\nI mean, I am currently working for a company that is designing software that could help diagnose this or even assess the extent of the damage...which is really weird how it works out.\nGood to hear from you, send me a message and I am more than happy to chat. Hi! I had Guillain Barre in October 2012. I was in college at the time studying violin performance. I woke up one morning with really sore legs which I initially thought was from using the elliptical at the gym before \\(I was a runner and did not typically elliptical, so I thought maybe my muscles just were not used to that movement\\). Throughout the next few days it started to get worse to the point of not being able to write or get dressed by myself. I went to a hospital near my school on day 3 and they told me it was psychosomatic, probably from stress. I had done research and brought up GBS to them, but they said that definitely was not it and they would not let me see a neurologist.\n\nLuckily I did not listen to them and my dad drove the 8 hours to my school to pick me up and brought me home. I went to a hospital near my parents' house and they diagnosed me almost immediately. I had a MRI and LP to confirm and they started me on IVIG that night. This was about a week after the initial symptoms started. I was in the hospital for a week and then discharged to a rehab hospital and spent another week there, and then did a week of outpatient PT and OT.\n\nI guess I was super lucky that my GBS progressed so slowly. At the worst, I could not walk or use my hands, but I never had to be intubated and never lost sensation in my libs, though I did lose my reflexes. I progressed pretty quickly through PT, and I was actually able to return to school and finish out the semester. Overall I missed a month of classes and was able to finish 3 of the 5 that I had been taking. I also had to relearn to play the violin, which was pretty annoying, but I did it. I would say at this point that I made about a 95&amp;#37; recovery \\- I still have some weakness in my hands and shoulders, but it is very manageable. \n\nAt follow\\-up appointments with my neurologist, he has told me that he tells my story to all of his GBS patients and that it makes them feel better about their recovery, so I hope posting this here can provide others with a little optimism about their GBS!", "TIL Noninvasive spinal stimulation enables paralyzed people to regain use of hands. A team of scientists reports that six people with severe spinal cord injuries \u2014 three of them completely paralyzed \u2014 have regained use of their hands and fingers ", "GBS Helped Me Find Myself - Cheryl's Story ", "Come To My Outpatient Therapy Appointment With Me  You are a cutie pants", "Clime a Mountain by wheelchair for Disability support group and Hospice ", "Quick question to all those who have had a EMG how bad is the procedure itself and how is the recovery afterwards?  Recovery was instant like as soon as she was done\u2026 it hurt like a bitch at first then I got somewhat use to it It is not pleasant but it is not going to bother you that much. You will be fine after, there is no real recovery to it. At least for me, they shocked me in various places starting from my feet up to my neck on one side of my body, then a few select places on the other side. They said the info they get from one side normally mirrors the other, but they might and did end up testing a few spots on the opposite side. \n\nThe first half of the process is done with stickers and is just like any other device like a TENS unit, just cranked up a bit. You will make involuntary twitches. The second half is done with needles inserted. For that part, you will be asked to try and flex the muscle while the test is happening. The machine will be making static noises, I was told the noise means it is a good recording. This will be the painful part, but I trust that you can tough through it. Do not worry.\n\nThe entire process took about 90 minutes including waiting in between steps. They put a taser like device on the inner part of my forearms, then they make current go through it and I remember it hurted like a bitch on my finger tips, of course I moved a lot, but they tell you to not to move, easier said than done. I do not remember if they did it for my feet.\nAfterwards they inserted what seemed to me like a long ass needle (5 or 6 inches iirc) again on my forearms, this time on the outer side. Once the needle is all the way in, they ask you to move your fingers. Next I clearly remember they inserted the same needle on my legs, what I cannot remember is if it was on my sheens or my calves, once inserted they ask you to move your toes. Surprisingly there was almost no blood involved in the procedure.\nThe doctors said to each other \u2018he has no F\u2019 whatever that means, but I had to ask them if I was going to be able to walk again, after a small pause, the doctor who was in charge said something like \u2018yes, after a lot of rehabilitation\u2019.\n\nNeither of both tests were pleasant at all, but I must say the taser one was the worst in terms of pain.\n\nBut yeah there is no recovery to them. It is unpleasant but not excruciating. The nerve conduction portion can feel like a strong static shock. Painful but over in a flash each time. The EMG portion with the needle was not too bad. Again, painful, but not white knuckle pain. The hands are the most sensitive. Afterwards you may be a little sore but only minor. It was not bad. Very brief flashes of mild pain.", "How has GBS impacted your mental health?  It made me **more** depressed. I already suffered with depression/anxiety but that shit....\n\nI had just moved into my own house in like 2 months prior and them boom. So that made me angry and miss my home. During my time starting in the hospital I had a hard time remembering things. No clue why but that lasted even after I came home. Its way better now.\n\nIt made me frustrated with myself and made me wish I had died. I am glad I did not, but sometimes I wanted to. It did not make me depressed, but I was not depressed before. Somebody in this forum described it best: It has taken away my vitality. I work from home for a software company for a good salary, so I have it better than most. I get 4 good hours out of my workday. For the rest I just try to be available. I felt for a while that I should have died, but did not want to die, if that makes sense. My kids do not remember me athletic in any way, and my face is paralyzed for the most part. But it could be worse. It is not cancer. We will just have to ride it out. :) You are in good company. Alexander the Great had it too. Good luck my friend. It will be hopefully the worst thing that ever happened to you! It consolidated and strengthened mental health vulnerabilities that were present before I got it - like depression.\n\nThe one that caught me off guard was the PTSD vulnerability - after being in an intensive care unit 4 months and some hairy moments (an NG tube passed into my lungs instead of stomach and it took me hours using a spell-board to convince a nurse something was badly wrong for example) - 20 years later after an assault at worki became very depressed but could not understand why. I remember I kept telling the nurses/doctors my throat was hurting. I could not talk but would try to signal pain any way I could. They all said ya you have a breathing tube in of course it hurts. What they did not know is my bite block had slipped and was stuck in my throat scratching and cutting me. Finally after days of this and throwing up they finally took a look and realized what was happening. Not being able to communicate what is happening with you can be so frustrating. Do you think that is left you with a ptsd type vulnerability? I think the whole experience definitely did mine was awful as I am sure everyone else\u2019s was. I had botulism by the way which is different than GBS but symptom wise presents very similar. My hospitalization was rough I spend 49 days in the hospital 22 in the ICU. I was on a breathing tube for 3 weeks, trach for 9 days. I was on feeding tubes for about 4 months. Got pneumonia twice. Lost over 40 pounds. Was completely paralyzed besides a few fingers on my right hand. Eyes were paralyzed for months so never knew where I was or what time it was. I had to relearn how to walk and talk and almost six months later I am still unable to lift my arms and have constant pain in my left shoulder from all the atrophy. I am looking into seeing someone for the ptsd and it sounds like that may also be something you could benefit from. I think it is normal to be traumatized by events like these. Both out kind and body need to recover. Let me know if there is any other questions you have. You are right about normal. As in it is what it is....... I have to be careful as, dont know about you, but when i met a couple of GBS experiencers after my illness it felt like a competition as to who had it the worse :) But similar - 4 months on a vent, complications - and 20 years on, still have the footdrop, scars and mental scars\n\nThe PTSD thing - what surprised me is that it surfaced 20 years later. I got GBS at 25 and then 45yrs old after an assault I got PTSD - but didnt realise it was PTSD at the time and now found out there was a vulnerability there I understand what you are saying, who had it worse is all relative to each individual. The point I was trying to make is any one of those things could cause someone trauma most of us experienced all of them and some had even more to deal with for longer. I have heard GBS has a much longer recovery period than botulism so I am definitely not comparing war stories but the things we have gone through are awful and many people cannot understand it because of how rare these conditions are. As far as the 20 years maybe something recently triggered it or maybe it just took time to process it I know it took me a few months to start thinking about the time in the hospital but I have no idea when that will go away or if it will. I have had therapy which has helped me accept it massively How long ago did you get it? I am 20 years past, and I still feel like it is sapped my vitality to a degree. \n\nI get super sick all the time, and I have accumulated a few serious conditions since as well. Dysphagia (ENT thinks that the gbs has mis coordinated my swallowing process) severe apnea, erethyma nodosum, and I have been having fibromyalgia symptoms that I am going to a rheumatologist for next week. \n\nI was very lucky that I did not get any permanent paralysis. I am sorry that happened to you \ud83d\ude14 \n\nIs there chance that it will get better?\n\nSorry to list out my afflictions like that, but there is really no one irl that can comprehend the impact of gbs on your body like we do.. We have very similar symptoms. My swallowing does not work perfectly either, especially when I am under Stress. My nerves hurt bad, sometimes unbearably. I cannot work out, because the next day I hurt so bad that I do not want to do it again. But I am alive, I have 2 boys,10 and 11, and they keep me going. It could be worse. Could be MS.  Hi under, I am Dad! That is the only outlook we can have! It is how I keep going every day. I have to keep the positive view and be upbeat. Sometimes I hear my wife behind closed doors crying because she is worried so much. That is the thing that gets me the most. I can deal with the physical pain, fatigue, and all the rest but the emotional pain that others feel is so hard :(\n\nGood news though! I am on the tail end of this flare up, and I am feeling better today!!\n\nI am so glad I found a place with people that actually understand what were going through. It is not as obvious as limb deficiency, or being in a wheel chair (in no way am I down playing any disease). \n\nWe got this! More good news:I found your 50 pounds! I got GBS as a very young child, so I do not remember much about the experience. However, I have had lingering effects my whole life - thing is, when it is something you have had for your WHOLE life, you do not realize why your body is shit and you are in pain when you wake up and why standing hurts... you just think you are subpar and lazy and pathetic. You think the weakness and pain is normal, because you have never known anything else, and that you are lame for not powering through it like everyone else.\n\nI did not research into GBS until my 30s. My family always treated it as a fluke thing that happened to me and that it was a one and done thing, and I have dealt with low key shaming my whole life for being \"lazy\" or \"weak.\" One day, I remarked to my boyfriend about how waking up sucks due to pain and he was confused - I did not realize until then that most people do not wake up in pain and do not deal with foot pain for days after walking/standing for a while.\n\n Research and realization about long term effects was very empowering for me and boosted my self confidence. I have always tried hard to push myself despite pain and weakness, and now I do not beat myself up for my limitations. It is made me more confident in asking for things I need and I actually rented a scooter last time I went to Disneyland - in the past, I was too embarrassed to, as I thought I was just lazy/weak, but now I have the confidence to accept it is a limit of my body. I was able to enjoy a full, fun day without being in immense pain at the end of it! No way! That is awesome!! I am glad to hear you are being able to eat more :)"]
