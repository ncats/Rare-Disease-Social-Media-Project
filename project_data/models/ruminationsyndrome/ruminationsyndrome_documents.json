["Does this sound like rumination syndrome? \nHey everyone. I hope this is not against the rules. I have been dealing with regurgitation issues for about 2-3 years  and have been diagnosed with acid reflux before. But The thing is I do not get acid near as much as I regurgitate undigested food it happens after almost every meal. Another thing is that I control my regurgitation. I have to do a almost burp like action where I guess I push the food up, it is never just came up on it is own. It is voluntary but It seems like if I am not focusing on it I will just do it without thinking.  If I focus on not doing it I will not do it but I get a uncomfortable feeling / pressure in my stomach/chest if I do not do it.  I am constantly regurgitating food. Does anyone here have similar issues and does this sound like This syndrome?

It is the feeling of having something stuck in your throat. Recently when I regurgitate, I get the feeling of having something stuck in my throat. My ENT said it is likely from acidity although when the food comes up, it rarely feels/tastes acidic. Just wondering if anyone here can relate. I get this all of the time. I also have difficulty swallowing food at times irregardless of how well I chew it. It feels like I am going to choke if I try to swallow it\u2014 I never do, but it is a terrible feeling. Yes I get this especially if I have eaten stodgy food Yes! This happens to me once in a while. I am actually dealing with it right now. In my case it came on after a particularly bad episode with RS last week. I was pretty freaked out for a few days, but my symptoms are finally starting to fade. It is super annoying and it gets me kind of worried everytime it happens :/ what triggers yours..... and how you feeling now Yes I sure do. Mostly because of my anixety disorder.

Hi guys, I was excited to find this little corner of the internet and hear your stories. For context I am 24F based in the UK. I cannot pinpoint exactly when I started ruminating, I think it must have been something that happened now and then for quite a while and I just did not think anything of it. For about a year or so now I have been ruminating after basically every meal and drink, I guess I am lucky in that I do not really feel any shame about it. I am quite used to rechewing and swallowing as gross as it may seem. When I began to google I was quite surprised to find out it is classed as an eating disorder and usually linked to trauma - I cannot put my finger on anything that has caused my ruminating. I mentioned it to my parents and it turns out that my dad ruminates and so did his dad, just wondering if anyone else thinks they might have inherited ruminating? I have not been to the doctor yet - was waiting for the craziness in the world to die down a bit but will be interested to see how it will be taken there. Wishing you all well, especially those of you who are struggling with this - every body has something a little weird about it, I guess this is just ours! I have not heard any reliable sources say that it could be hereditary, but it is hard to say when there is so little research. Personally, I do not know any family members who also have RS. I do remember chatting to somone on this sub who had a sibling who also had it, but there may have been other factors involved there.\n\nEither way, welcome to the sub! It is always nice to find others who understand :)", "What type of food are you regurgitating? I know there is several of you that have had this for a while now, what did I have always been wondering if our bodies mainly only regurgitate proteins, fats, or carbs. For me it can regurgitate certain foods and somehow magically separates it from all the other food. It was water when I was binging on potato chips. It was also pineapples from a pizza but it all changes. Another time it could be just chips. Worst part is when it just separates the water \ud83d\ude22 Then you are dehydrated and it keeps coming up \ud83d\ude2d but the method to overcome that is to try drinking it in small amounts with many intervals so you can stomach it or try drinking lemon juice Generally for me it is almost every meal no matter the food, but I have noticed I tend to regurgitate more violently with popcorn for whatever reason.", "Can rumination syndrome turn into GERD? I been having signs of acid reflux lately, and I was wondering if I have GERD or is acid another part of rumination syndrome? I never had acid in my throat for the past 4 years with rumination syndrome. I personally have known GERD since I have had rumination syndrome. The two are intricately connected to me.\n\nGaviscon is your friend if these heartburns are sporadic Its like my Rumination comes up for 30-45 mins now then turns into acid reflux Maybe it is a sign it is going away who knows Medically, GERD is not a part of rumination syndrome. However you may have both.\n\nI do not have GERD but occasionally my regurgitation is a little more acidic, usually if I am bringing up orange juice or something like that. This is just natural food-acid and is a part of RS. Or a sign you are getting older, and thus food lingers longer in your stomach, your digestive system is less efficient, which leaves you vulnerable to GERD? I have both silent and acid reflux but not diagnosed with Gerd but have got rs Maybe it is because the food you ate was very acidic, for me I drink coke and it somehow helps stabilise it you should try it out for me i have been diagnosed with gerd at first, and after years i started experiencing the food coming back up. i would say try lowering triggering foods that is on the basic gerd list.

I thought I would look to see if there is an RS sub and sure enough, here we are. I am not sure if others have had the same situation of RS presenting in a kid so I figured I would share our experience thus far. Ok. Back to September 2020: My kid, C, is a *completely healthy* vegetarian 11 year old. No history of any major medical issues and virtually free of family medical issues as well. She had been doing this odd burp-run to bathroom-spit into toilet for a few weeks before I realized it was definitely happening every day, regardless of what she ate. As a distance-learning middle school kid with a wild little sibling at home she usually eats breakfast and lunch in her room during/between classes so it was really only after dinner I would be around her to see/hear this. Ruled out induced-vomiting early on as I was right there with her watching it happen through no effort on her part at all and she was not happy with the situation although she also did not bring it up much. She said it was just annoying but finally admitted that it had been happening every day - after every meal - for over a month and that she was now usually just re-chewing and swallowing without even getting up (ok, wait, what?!) It could not be heartburn or GERD bc she has had heartburn before and she is not a super-tough kid, she would have been whining and complaining that it burns etc.... I am a dietitian so I immediately think possible hernia, esophagitis, malfunction of pyloric sphincter, stricture or obstruction?... but the total lack of pain was a dead end for me. She has no history of swallow issues and she says it does not hurt to chew, swallow, etc. I cut her to an ultra-bland, low fiber, elimination diet thinking it is some new allergy flare up (so she is now only eating things like plain white rice. Bananas. Applesauce. Steamed Carrots or green beans. Plain white bread or crackers. No dairy. No citrus. No tomato. No chocolate, very little fat etc) but... no change except that she was completely miserable and starting to hate me. I also started monitoring her weight daily and after 2 weeks of no weight change I am at a total loss. Pediatrician  suggested three weeks of Prilosec and go back to normal diet, which is high fiber &amp; lots of variety. I figured it would be a dead end but also I am not a doctor and C is not suffering or losing weight so we try the Prilosec. after three more weeks we are well into October and so far no better off. Now we wait to see the pediatrician again. One evening C is drinking water at the dinner table and immediately it is just right back up everywhere it is like her body is now rejecting even just water(!) no retching. Just rejecting. Now I am really freaked although again C says she is fine, nothing hurts. Well, like hell I am going to just watch to see what happens to my kid next - we get a referral straight to a pediatric gastro-specialist. Couple weeks later (Nov 2020) we have a theory: Rumination syndrome. Not something I am at all familiar with but at least we have a name and the more I am reading and talking with C this really seems to be it. It fits every sign and symptom she has been experiencing. The only mystery is ... why? No conclusive answers there. Gastro doc says possible that it is a stress reaction to ::gestures broadly:: ... I want to say 2020? Poor kid. Of course I am thankful up and down forever that this is something we can work out without surgery or even needing to involve needles. So we are scheduled for an early Jan first session with a pediatric psychologist for feeding therapy. essentially the plan is to reteach C how to eat and to train her stomach and brain to work together again to accept food without the rumination issues. Recognize the feelings of the rejection and stop it from happening. I am beyond fascinated to find out how this all works and very hopeful that the estimated time to resolve (3-4, maybe 6 months) will work out for her. \nFingers crossed! Although I am not a doctor and cannot diagnose, this is what it was like for me when I first started ruminating. I was sent back and forth between paediatricians for years, misdiagnosed with GERD and this and that and a hernia at one point. I am so glad that you have discovered rumination syndrome so that your daughter does not have to do that.\n\nSome people find its best to avoid certain foods hat cause discomfort, for example I avoid eggs and orange juice as they are not pleasant for me coming back up. Orange juice can burn and egg is just WEIRD.\n\nI also bring up water, that is not abnormal at all for a rumination syndrome (RS) patient. I would like to clarify, it is not that our bodies \u2018reject\u2019 the food. It is not bringing the food back up due to any sort of disagreement, which is why certain dietary changes will not change how often regurgitation occurs. Only cut foods out if they are causing discomfort. \n\nRS is caused by the contractions of the abdominal muscles, which you can read about on the Wikipedia page linked at the top of the sub. Treatments I know of are muscle relaxants and diaphragmatic breathing, although purely from conversations in this subreddit (and no scientific research) it have heard that diaphragmatic breathing is more effective. It takes time to learn, but it has helped me a lot. It feels like it is not doing anything for a while, but just learning how to relax those muscles makes a big difference. Also, I get flare-ups due to stress, so try to minimise that as beat you can, although often it is out of our hands.\n\nI have had RS since I was about your daughters age- I think I was 10- so I have had to grow up with it. These are some important things you can do as a parent:\n\n- Never tell her it is gross or disgusting. Yes, it is unpleasant, but constantly hearing how gross your rumination is makes you feel like YOU are disgusting. This is something I have had to battle within myself. I thought I was unloveable and would never be in a relationship as I was too disgusting. No, she is not at that age yet, but when she gets there it is important she knows that she is not disgusting, and somone will love and accept her for who she is. \n\n- Reassure her if/when she feels sad about it. She is not disgusting, and you will both get through this. Together. You will find a way to help her and it will be okay.\n\n- Do not let the doctors misdiagnose, and even worse, mistreat her. I nearly had an operation which would have caused significant discomfort for me throughout my life, and it would not have even cured my RS because the operation was for an ailment I did not have\n\n- Never imply or let others say she is just bullemic. Most doctors have never heard of RS, and some may just think she has an eating disorder. It has happened to me plenty of times, and some people just will not believe you.\n\nSomething to note, though, is that RS can TURN into an eating disorder. It is hard to learn to suppress the rumination, but it is easier to learn to encourage it. I and some others on this sub have suffered from eating disorders and used our rumination to bring up as much food as we could after eating. Do not stress out about it as it takes time to learn, and clearly your daughter does not WANT to be bringing up her food anyway, but if you notice any unhealthy weight loss or a changed attitude to food then just keep an eye on her and make sure she is okay. It is just important to be sensitive and understanding in situations like these. Work with her, bot against her.\n\nSorry this has been so long but I hope it helped, and thank you for being such a caring, understanding mother to your daughter. I wish you both the best of luck, and know that you are always welcome here in this sub. :) Wow. Thank you for taking the time to reply.

For wanting to really help the person, rather than just diagnose (rightly or wrongly) and move on.\n\nIt was difficult having various EDs but I have changed my relationship with my body and with food and I am okay now.\n\nNo worries for the reply, and I hope you have a nice week!", "How does alcohol affect you?

Over time it became kind of of a joke to laugh about. We called it \u201cthe thing\u201d while it is quite disgusting, it sometimes happens very unexpectedly like mid sentence and causes a good laugh. Only those closest to me know I have it and nobody judges or treats me different for it. I do not advertise it to everyone just as I would not tell people about my bathroom habits. It saddens me to know that some people suffer with severe depression because of RS. My best advice is to embrace it and Learn to laugh at yourself if it happens unexpectedly. When I was younger I used to find enjoyment out of grossing my sisters out with it by spitting it onto the pavement. You know how little boys are \ud83d\ude05. Even though the thought of it is gross, it is not the same as vomiting. I like to think of it as an undo button for the swallowing action. It is the same thing you were just chewing and honestly some foods taste good to ruminate (any kind of potato chips for me) sometimes even better than the first time around.

I cannot tell if it is a placebo or if it is actually working, but I have not ruminated since starting it, so I was wondering if anyone has also been prescribed/used Buspar before? Seems like Buspar is an anxiety med? I have never taken it but perhaps it helps you to relax which helps your stomach muscles to not contract. It loosley makes sense, I suppose? Although I ruminate even when I feel good, so Idk. Just wondering how things are going now, 13 days later? Hi! So an update, the Buspar has been working surprisingly well! Like most people on this thread I have been ruminating since birth (22f) and this is the first time I have gone long stretches without ruminating. I am still unsure if it is actually working or just a placebo, but I am really thrilled by the results. Although it is somewhat distressing to not rumination as much, I know it is better for my esophagus and GI tract. I go back to my PCP soon, and am hoping to discuss the minor success with them. Overall, Buspar might be something for people to discuss with their general practitioners, but I know that \u201closing\u201d the rumination can be a scary thought so to each their own!\n\nSide note: at first there were some side effects (dizziness, dissociation, tiredness) but after a few days this went away.

Hi all! Hope everyone is having a good weekend :)\n\nI am curious about the age of people in this community and how rumination affects you as you grow with it.\n\nI am 26 and I am worried my esophagus will be very worn and have even more serious consequences in my health. Most of the time the regurgitation is not super acid but sometimes it is. I am just curious - how have people here dealt with it? Are you concerned about esophagus damage long term? Hi, I have had RS for about ten years (I think), and a year or two ago I had an endoscopy where they put a camera down my throat. The doctors did not find basically any damage to my oesophagus, however my teeth are in a pretty rough shape. I was born with weak enamel so it could not totally be helped anyway, but RS has definitely made it worse because of all the extra chewing.\n\nI also do not get much acid, but I do tend to avoid things like orange juice which hurt when they come up. It depends on you and if anything hurts. Weetabix also used to hurt my throat for some reason but it does not anymore. Try to avoid foods that cause acid for you.\n\nAside from that, there is the social aspect but I am quite good ah hiding it and only tell people I am closest to. With diaphragmatic breathing I have been able to control it better and find my abdomen-area feels less tense, and I bring up less food. It also depends on my mood that day if I am stressed, because then I will definitely ruminate. I am 14 and it started when I was 8, your esophagus can be completely destroyed, causing you to have to eat through a tube. I have had it consistently since I was 16 and I am 21 now.

I know everyone is story is different, but I would like to share mine.\n\n I never ruminated as a kid. I had never even heard about it until this past year, when I was sent to a residential treatment facility for my eating disorder. Apparently, through my repeated purging, I had disrupted the muscles in my GI tract, so I have learned how to ruminate. I have been doing it for a little over a year, now. At this point, I would like for it to stop. It is hard enough going through eating disorder recovery, let alone having to sit through the food coming up every time I eat.

I just feel that it would give my body a chance to heal itself, and once I have it removed, my body will relearn how to eat properly. Are there any professional opinions on this? Or maybe firsthand experiences? How do I best recover? Cannot really say anything about recovery but i think i am in the same situation. And I am sorry you going through this, i understand what it feels like. I also have an eating disorder and i am underweight but recently i understood that and want to recover and even gain some weight. I am eating normal portions but almost immediately i kind of throw up.  It is disgusting. I have experienced this before trying to recover from ed too  (probably because of gerd i have been diagnosed but the medication do not help me)   but now i think i have worsened it a lot.  (at first i think that was because of guilt and fear of food and now it is just become a habit i cannot get rid of). \nI have heard about diaphragmatic breathing. Have you tried it? \nThe tube probably should work and help you but i recommend to seek help about rumination syndrome too. Though the only thing i heard of is diaphragmatic breathing with weights on your stomach and maybe psychotherapy. I am sorry you are going through this as well, but I am glad we have all found this community! I have heard of diaphragmatic breathing and it helps to an extent, but with my eating disorder treatment team we tend to eat larger portions for our meals in the name of \"recovery\" and that nearly always ends in a behavior, simply because my stomach cannot handle the large quantities. I guess that is where the ED comes in becausebI bbn do not want to tell anyone I did not keep it down, but at this point I do not know of it is tje ED or just the rumination that is the issue :/ probably both. And have you considered maybe drinking those supplemental shakes like ensure or boost? I usually cannot keep them down, but maybe you would find it helpful? After the talk with dietitian she recommended me supplemental drinks but my mom and i found it really expensive. Yesterday i had pretty honest talk with my mom about my problems. I think that helped me realise my situation a little better. I recommend that. But i still think you should open up to the specialist, it would be just easier for you to handle all your burden and just let them do what they know the best (it is hard to accept but they know it better than you). I hope you will trust them. I now also searching for ed centre help.", "How Do You Practice Diaphragmatic Breathing I was told I need a behavioural therapist to help me with diaphragmatic breathing but nobody in this damned country knows how to refer me to one-one GP just told me to go to counselling instead; my symptoms are not anxiety related, he is just a terrible doctor, its a long story. It been months since I was diagnosed so could anyone tell me the steps involved, how often and when do you do it, etc. Its been months and I cannot get a hold of or referred to a behavioural therapist for love or money. /u/_Urethra___Franklin_, I have found an error in your post:\n\n &gt; \u201cdoctor, ~~its~~  a long\u201d\n\nI consider this post of _Urethra___Franklin_ unsuitable; it should say \u201cdoctor, ~~its~~  a long\u201d instead. \u2018Its\u2019 is possessive; \u2018it is\u2019 means \u2018it is\u2019 or \u2018it has\u2019.\n\n ^(This is an automated bot. I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!) Tbh i dont (used to) regurgitate water, like any other liquids such as coke, watermelon juice anything i can regurgitate but water is something i dont regurgitate unless i had food previous to it.\n\nMy strategy was to have my food to a limit that i *wasnt* full but satisfied, then drink water until i was full but not to the level of vomiting (important) and then i laid down flat on my back with my knees bent and for a half n hour just practiced slow breathing with me trying my best to not regurgitate.\n\nAnother thing i did was to sit on a chair, make my back as straight as possible after drinking water and just breathing in and out with my diaphragm/lung (idk, deep breaths in both cases basically). This method helped more as i had a tendency to regurgitate if i layed on my back but as i was sitting straight in this, that was not the case and i could feel like the food staying in my stomach and not my throat waiting to come out.\n\nIm just telling from my experience, diaphragmatic breathing is deep breaths with focus on your stomach than lungs, physically think of your stomach while breathing than your lungs in a manner.\n\nTldr: breathe slowly sitting straight after drinking water, with focus on your stomach than lungs Diaphragmatic breathing is not terribly complicated. Take a deep breath, and if your belly expands, that is diaphragmatic breathing. If your chest expands, it is not. For 5-10 minutes before eating, pay attention to the breath, and continue to monitor the breath while eating and afterward to make sure you are still breathing in deep belly breaths. When I do remember to do this, there is the added benefit of eating more slowly and paying attention to when I am full, which both help reduce RS. (I often scarf food and overeat, which cause more RS issues.)\n\n\nBest of luck! Wow this is so helpful for me. I have never understood diaphragmatic breathing before this! I found this article online!\n\n You can find a lot of videos on YouTube to teach you. I initially learned by laying on my back with my hands on my belly, and you can feel your belly expand. I found it useful to visualise the air flowing to my belly rather than to my lungs. At first I found that my belly could not expand very much or get much air in, but with practice I got better and could get enough air in to breathe comfortably. Then I tried it sitting and standing. I can do all of them now which is really useful, as I can try to relax my abdomen in any situation to stop regurgitation. For sitting however, I recommend putting your legs either side of the chair. I found this helped my posture so that my abdomen was more relaxed and I could expand my belly more.\n\nGood luck! :)", "Why does our regurgitation lead to bloating? ", "How Do You Dispose of Your Regurgitation So I spit my regurgitated foods/drinks into a large bottle and empty it down the toilet when the bottle is full. I bleach, scrub and wipe down the toilet daily, however my flatmates have told me they want me out of the house as there is apparently still a smell regardless, so I am at a loss of what I can do. How do you all dispose of regurgitated foods/items. All public amenities are shut due to  sever lockdown for the foreseeable future so IDK if anyone was going to suggest something like that but unfortunately for me it is currently not an option. I buy disposable coffee cups to throw up in. And then dump those in the toilet. That way I can be more discrete! Might be a better option for you? (Not that it necessarily helps more with smell than your current system, but can help with other's perception...)\n\nI feel like this is psychological on the roommate's part?? Like regurgitation does not smell that strong if it is in a closed container (AND in a different room)... It does not have the same high acid content of regular vomit.\n\nSo yeah, I am thinking it is more that they *think* they can smell it... (OR possibly one of them is extra sensitive to smells and scents!) Could you possibly test this, like pretend you dumped it in the toilet, then say you cleaned it, then see if they can \"smell it\"?\n\nOr even lie and say your Dr got you on a new medication, and you are not throwing up now.\n\nI know this might all be risky, but if they are threatening to kick you out, seems like not a lot left to lose??\n\nSorry if this is not helpful! (And also sounds like discriminatory BS, so that is really unfair and I am sorry you are dealing with that on top of your symptoms.)", "Just realized I have rumination syndrome I am 21F and I have regurgitated my food after every meal for as long as I can remember. I do not do it on purpose, it is completely involuntary. I was diagnosed with acid reflux at about 4 years old, they told my mom to give me antacids and change my diet to prevent the reflux. None of that ever helped, I regurgitated after every meal no matter what I ate and it was never acidic. It tasted the same way coming up as going down. As a little kid I used to to chew it before swallowing it down and now I just swallow it. I have never experienced heartburn or any of the other acid reflux symptoms in my life. Regurgitating never really affected me negatively since I had done it my whole life, and nobody ever noticed when it happened to me (swallowing back vomit basically). I have never tried to do it, it just happens naturally to me and I barely even notice or care when it happens because it is like a daily biological function for me. I do not really know what it is like to not ruminate/regurgitate after eating. Up until now I actually thought this was normal to some degree because I never talked to anyone about it (I assumed everyone ruminated at least sometimes and that my problem was that It happened to me more often than normal). Today I got curious and looked up why it happens, and i was actually shocked to find out that it is not normal at *all*. It is supposed very rare and usually only happens to babies or people with severe cognitive disabilities, which is embarrassing. A lot of things online were claiming that people who do it are either doing it on purpose (because they are mentally handicapped and just want to re-taste their food?!) or because of a mental disorder, emotional trauma, or bulimia. \n\nMy rumination is not caused by a mental handicap, mental illness, trauma or an eating disorder. \n\nI have anxiety, but it is not related to my rumination. I did have some trauma as a teenager but I had been ruminating every day way before that. I have never been bulimic and I am fit physically and at a healthy weight, I have always been at an ideal weight for my height. As far intellectual disability goes, I have no learning disabilities and I have always been somewhat intelligent. I am no genius, but I had my IQ tested as a child and it was considerably above average (although I hate to be one of the people who brings their IQ into everything). People have always considered me to be an intelligent person... I am far from cognitively impaired. I am not saying all this to gloat about myself, it is just that now I am wondering why the hell this happens to me. I am honestly really embarrassed by myself now. Is there a way I can stop doing it? I feel disgusting after realizing how abnormal it actually is. It seems like there is not much information about it, but I really do not think my issue is psychological. Could it it be caused by an abnormality in my digestive system?", "Question about absorption? I take medication (pills) every morning. If I have RS but swallow everything, am I still getting the full amount of medication from my pills? You are still digesting it eventually so yes I would think that you get the same amount of nutrition in the end. That is what my logic says, but I am not a doctor so I cannot say for sure. I would not start taking extra pills though to compensate- that is very unsafe. Probably", "Any long-time ruminators here with throat issues? I am in my early 20s and have had RS ever since I can remember. I have always been so afraid of having throat issues because of it. I get sore throats and sinus infections  pretty often compared to most people, and I wonder if it could be because of this as well, as I have gotten food stuck in and behind my nose due to violent regurge. I have only had RS for a few years now, and it is only getting worse. I did not realize food might get stuck behind the nose... what do you do if that happens? It does not happen to me very often, it is kind of like when you try not to laugh while you are drinking, but it causes the drink to come out of your nose. Only with regurge, pieces of food get in there too.\n\nI usually take giant breath of air through my nose to get it out, or I just try to suck it out by creating negative pressure with my mouth.\n\n\nIt is uncomfortable as hell. I do not regurgitate as violently but I am also a mouth breather at night. I used to always wake up to a dry throat which made it very sensitive to the food that comes up (I would cry from acidic foods sometimes). What really helped was 1. Taping my mouth to breathe through my nose at night. This kept my throat hydrated. 2. I have also learned to keep it down by somewhat learning to close the back of my throat and sometimes I can stop it midway through my gullet. This prevents my throat from being overused. 3. I drink a lot of honey and hot water. It is a lifesaver and has given me my voice after many times not being able to speak because of how bad my throat was. 4. Surprisingly try to learn to sing. The vocal lessons and all help widen your throat and in a way you learn to control rumination much more. (I have had rumination for 15 years). You could also try eating baking soda tablets which neutralise acid. Acid is what damages my throat most, but if the amount of food you eat is what damages yours, I suggest eating more frequent smaller meals and chew much more. I chew a lot and eat 5 small meals daily, it has helped my rumination so much. I hope this helps you and I wish you the best of luck Yes....i have nerve damage in my throat because of this issue, combined with acidic foods and alcohol.\n\nI highly HIGHLY suggest you go on a low acid diet and quit all caffeine and alcohol.\n\nYou can get neuropathy in your throat which causes all types of symptoms. It is what I am dealing with and it is not fun. Only way to control it is to practice breathing....but DieT DIET DIET!!!", "How does one proply combat this issue I have had rumination syndrome my entire life, and I have been trying to combat it, but I have not found great advice on how to, only vague mentions, does anyone have solid advice on how to proply combat this, any link to a resource for that would be lovely! Or commenting any knowledge.\n\nAlso any knowledge on what types of foods to avoid would be nice too :). Thank you!", "I am so happy I found this subreddit I am 16, and I have had rumination syndrome my whole life I think.\n\nI had a bunch of tests done back in 2014 and they told me to get physical therapy, and that did nothing\n\n2 weeks ago I went to a specialist and it took like 30 mins and she pulled up a diagnosis, so I am a bit pissed nobody did that sooner.\n\ncurrently, I am having anxiety eating around people and things are getting worse.\n\nI have been trying \"belly breathing\" and things like that but nothing is helping so far\n\nanyone have any advice for this stuff, I am not even sure what to ask because I still know so little about this condition. I am glad you have found the sub! I do not really know what advice to give beyond belly breathing unfortunately. However on the edit - you can spit or swallow - whatever works for you. I mostly swallow and only spit if it tastes gross. thank you! I also re-swallow it. It generally does not taste bad, and I do not want to waste a ton of food. My rumination has gotten a lot better since I have learned diaphragmatic (belly) breathing, so I advise you stick with it! Check out YouTube tutorials to see if you are doing it right, and just keep practicing. It can be tricky at first but it is easy once you get used to it. Someone advised doing it just before eating, whereas I do it WHILE I eat, or whenever I get rumination. Find out what works for you.\n\nUnfortunately breathing is the only successful method I have really heard of so far. There have been some odd cases where anxiety meds (I think) helped someone is rumination, presumably because they (and their stomach muscles) were more relaxed, but I cannot say that is work for everyone.\n\nI just live with it, and it is so much better now I have more control over it and it does not make me embarrassed or anxious at social events. I hope diaphragmatic breathing works for you too, but we are always here if you want to talk! :) Woahhh crazy to think there is people like me, it is weird man, really weird. It is so useful whenever you are trying to get shredded but it makes my social life embarrassing.

By the sounds of it you seem to be struggling with an eating disorder (sorry if this is incorrect).  If you would like advice on how to help with an ED then I advise going to a subreddit that specifically helps with that.\n\nRumination Syndrome is where the food comes up on its own, without the person doing it on purpose. If this is what you are struggling with then my best advice is to re-chew and re-swallow your food. That is what the majority of people do, I think. After all, if we spat out all the food that came up then we would all lose an unhealthy amount of weight.\n\nIf it is coming up on its own, but you are spitting it out in order to lose weight, then this is an ED combined with RS, which is what a lot of people with RS struggle with. I understand how easy it is to slip into bulimia when your body is doing half of the work for you. This is still an ED and you should seek help for your health and well-being. You are beautiful and you do not need to throw up your food or lose weight. If you feel unhappy with your body, there are healthier ways to manage your weight without damaging your health.\n\nI hope you are okay, and you get through whatever is troubling you. Best wishes from an ED survivor x I meant to put unintentionally Ohh okay. I see what you are saying now. Yeah sometimes it is uncomfortable and it feels like it is stuck in my throat so I just try to make it come up faster too. But yes overall I recommend just re-chewing your food and swallowing it. If there are any foods which you hate re-chewing due to weird flavours/textures then avoid those- I really dislike how milk curdles then comes back up all bitter. I also find orange juice to be quite acidic.\nYou can also practice diaphragmatic breathing to help keep the food down in the first place. If it gets really bad then perhaps go to the doctors. I know people who take calorie pills to stop excessive weight loss (for other conditions), perhaps they could help you with something like that. Just a thought.\n\nGood luck, I hope you are okay :)", "Food ideas!! Hi! I vomit back up my food almost immediately including liquids. My quality of life is just down the drain.  Does anyone have suggestions for meals and safe foods? I know everyone is different but I am unsure what to try? Or any guidelines So sorry to hear! I have had rumination syndrome for 16 years but about a year it got super bad after I had the stomach flu. Similar to you I regurgitated almost everything including water. I found that really bland foods like crackers or corn Chex did not come up for me as much. Also I found popsicles did not come up for me nearly at all. If you are looking for more of a long term suggestion. I would suggest looking up diaphragmatic breathing and if you need to go a step further maybe find a physical therapist who can help you with biofeedback.

I have rumination syndrome (and ruminate very frequently, after pretty much every meal) and have been having some issues related to anxiety that I think may be caused due to reactive hypoglycemia (low blood sugar caused by eating??). It usually leads to me getting really bad anxiety and phantom pain in my chest when i lay down, and then i get really stressed out about my breathing. It seems to be linked to my eating habits/blood sugar, so I was curious as to whether or not anyone else had experienced blood sugar abnormalities with rumination syndrome?? Thanks:)", "Should I bother getting tested for other things? I am fairly certain I have rumination syndrome, and my doctor thinks it is is possible. He ordered other tests including gastric emptying and and endoscopy to rule out other things. But it is really expensive and I am wondering if it is even worth it to take the other tests. I think this is really down to you. Do all your symptoms line up with rumination syndrome? Do you have any doubts because of anything? I would not spend my money if I already knew what was wrong with me, but just because you might have RS does not mean you do not have anything else on top of that. You know you are symptoms so if there is any doubt or anything that does not fit into RS then I would look into these other things and get tested on what you think you might have. No point shooting in the dark.\n\nThe Mayo clinic\u2019s website has the symptoms if you would like to check them.", "Tips on maintaining strong teeth? Since If I do not ruminate i feel clogged I have no other choice but to let go. I was wondering what do you guys do in order to keep your teeth strong and clean?", "Has anyone successfully actually cured this? I have been trying very hard to do diaphragmatic breathing, but a lot of the time it just happens without me realizing or something. I really want to be rid of this. Has anyone at all really fixed it? or is it something im really going to deal with forever?  I know that people have been able to better manage their symptoms to the point rumination is non existent. However, I have also heard stories of people who are \"cured\" but then the issue resurfaces later on or they have small events occasionally.\n\nI think it really is a lifestyle change and I too am doing my best to eliminate the problem. However, I have come to accept that it will not be easy and know that it will not magically go away. Sure wish it would though. I am not sure if I consider myself cured but I have not had any symptoms for the past 10 months. I was regurgitating after every meal but started to use biofeedback techniques and breathing and after a lot of work it has allowed me to not regurgitate at all anymore. Occasionally if I am really stressed I get the feeling I used to get before regurgitating but I am able to stop it before it happens. Your body is going to try and ruminate with those spasms in your esophagus you can feel, but if you relax your stomach and keep your food portions small, nothing will come up. That is the point you are trying to get to.\n\nI highly recommend you start a low acid diet and absolutely NO alcohol or caffeine. You do not want nerve damage in your throat like I have. Pepsin will eat at your throat if you eat acidic stuff. Would you mind sharing what the biofeedback techniques are?

I went to a GI doctor over two weeks ago and told him that my only symptoms (since a child) have been burping and regurgitation after every meal, depending on how big the meal was. It would last anywhere from 5 minutes after the meal, to an hour or two. I also explained to him that it NEVER tasted acidic unless the food itself was acidic. I also told him that I did not mind it honestly because it always tasted exactly like it went down. I seriously do not think I have EVER had heartburn (people say I would know if I did). \n\nHaving said all of this, he decided to put me on pantoprazole. It has been a week and I half now and I literally have not seen a difference in anything. If anything, it makes my stomach grumble/upset and causes diarrhea.  He also ordered for me to have an endoscopy done... It seems he is fixated on me having GERD. \n\nTo you guys/gals that have been diagnosed with RS - does this sound like RS to you? If so, what should I do to actually get diagnosed with it? This whole thing has been frustrating so any guidance would be awesome. \n\nThanks! I have rs and it sounds like it but I have also got acid reflux and silent reflux with a history of grade b osphegitis and eroded duodenum he might want to rule those things out hope this helps your question Thanks for the response. \n\nI did not realize it was possible to have both. How did your doctor diagnose you with both? Like what was the process? I was diagnosed with acid reflux first as I kept getting heartburn which presents itself as chest pains and acid in back of my throat it took me two years to get a diagnosis of rs and I had a barium swallow and two endoscopies and an mri which all came back normal then they diagnosed the silent reflux two years ago due to me getting shortness of breath I am now on lanzaprazole and cyclizine Interesting! Where was your chest pain exactly? And what did it feel like?\n\nI am sorry you are having to go through all of this! Do the meds help? It was on the right hand side and a sharp burning pain and yes the meds do help but only sometimes but if I have a flare up they do not work as I cannot keep meds down then Hmmm. That is interesting. I never knew heartburn to be anywhere other than the breastbone. It is on the breastbone but the right hand side but that might be my silent reflux It sounds like RS for sure. There are good scientific papers on this sub about RS, check them out and give them to your dr. Thanks for the info! I appreciate it.", "This is my first post on reddit! Cannot say I saw this coming! I do not even know when my regurgitation began because it is just been a part of my life for so long, I suspect while a pre-teen (I am 27 now). I have always had some control over it, in the sense that it is never effected my social life or my relationship, I have never thought about my breath, I have never worried about it happening in an inopportune time, it is just always been a quirk of mine that I kept to myself. I eat, I regurgitate, I chew or swallow, repeat for a half hour/hour. That is life and that is my normal. Worse with certain meals, like pasta,  where it will just be back to back to back regurgitation and I think some meals I do not have it at all. \n\nMy dad has some esophageal issues when he eats that make it hard for him to swallow and it can be very noisy and painful to watch him struggle.  I never wanted to overshadow him so I just kept it to myself as a kid and still just have not brought it up. \n\nI found this group today because I am beginning to worry that it is not an isolated issue, I have a few other quirks that I feel could be related.

I self diagnosed it as GERD on multiple times between 16-19 and thought i had a rare case without heartburn and assumed i cant do anything about it. Lifes shit, got to deal with it ig. Major complications in the future for GERD patients and i thought I will see it when it comes then.\n\n19 today i just went on google and decided to recheck it but with a different title \" food stomach goes back throat and re eat \" or something and even then the first links were GERD, 5th link or so The Rumination Syndrome and that too a single article fml.\n\nResearched it for an hour now, ya its definitely that. Now ive found out theres people with it much worse than me.\nFrom my knowledge there two types of us \n1.) Rechewer and \n2.) Vomitter\n\nLuckily i was a Rechewer so not much drastic unlike the unlucky Vomitter, but now i find out the Rechewer has higher chances of yellow teeth, loss of teeth, bad breath, loss in enamel and ive heard that both 1 and 2 categories have chances of death involved as well.\n\nYeahhh we are not doing well bois. Decided to actively stop regurgitation, been an hour and my body knows that ive decided to stop as well. Its trying to force me even if i have nothing in my stomach which is quite rare. Its like my body knows what im about to do. Have been thinking of this for the last 2 hours and have practiced diaphragmatic breathing dont worry.\n\nAlso found out that people with this have higher chances of Multiple Personality Disorder, Depression, Low self esteem. I had all these at 13-18. Got over it more or less this year and last year.\n\nA wild conclusion ive come up with the origin of mine. As a child i remember me physically forcing myself to burp as a \"power\"; it involved me gulping large amounts of air into my stomach, waiting 10 or so sec and then burping it out. Would doing this at such a young age have made my stomach more prone and strong in doing this to even food by chance ?\nOnly assumption i have other than stress and mental problems.\n\nHows life been for you guys ? Especially the older people. Have yall tried controlling or stopping this ?\n\nNote : Sorry for the large thread, had to get it all out there. Sidenote: Talked with one of the members of the subreddit. Most of my doubts are cleared and im actively looking into this now at all aspects. Wait! I also did the burping technique as a child all the time! It relieved anxiety for me! I believe I have always been an anxious child! \nI am a rechewer and a vomiter? I can do both?? It is really confusing I did burping thing for fun but this couldve developed from there, i remember RS only from maximum 12 year onwards before which i cant recall.\n\nTechnically if you are a Rechewer you cam vomit it out as well if that is what you mean but forced to vomit is different.\n\nI can rechew and dont get forced vomit Hey, I just wanted to say that I am literally in the same exact position as you, except I am 18. I just started to stop after learning about RS about a week ago. I was just wondering, r u experiencing any symptoms when you tried to stop? Like for me, after a week or so of not regurgitating my food, I started feeling something in the back of my throat. Idk what that is called, but I was just curious if your going through the same thing also? Been about a day since i started this so cant give a fair ans.\n\nIn a month ill make another thread with everything i felt during these days.\n\nIf you would like i can update you in a week how my situation is. That would be great, thanks! I rechew but do not force vomit Haha wow, almost the exact same story for me, I self diagnosed it as rumination syndrome recently and asked my pediatrician about it and they said the same thing today, though they also said that overuse of the habit of regurgitation can damage the gastroesophageal junction. Ya ive been doing it almsot everyday for the past 7 or so years. Trying my best to cold turkey stop that practice as a whole now. Glad to see im not alone here with this atleast. Sidenote : Day 3 of forcing myself to not regurgitate as of now. Ill submit a thread in the future 19 days from now since it takes 21 days to form a habbit and my experiences could serve as a guide to those willing to follow &amp; stop it (applicable only to rechewers; sorry, idk about the vomitters). Death? Can you expand (I am curious, also confused as to how on Earth this could cause death).\n\nAside from that, you can do it! Stopping can feel challenging but I know that if you are really persistent and stick to it then you can get rid of it.\n\nAlso, I totally relate to you with your stomach trying to ruminate when there is nothing in there. It is very annoying, sometimes I just get weird salaiva/bile stuff come up instead. Idk tbh but imagine it getting stuck in your throat and you dying of aphyxiation or your esophagus/throat gives up after a while because the barricade stopping the food from going gives up and you have a constant flow of acid or worse even your throat gives up or smthin\n\nIdk just hypothesizing but i read online as death Definitely interesting ideas, and we cannot confirm or deny any of them due to lack of research but I am not sure these are likely and have never heard of anyone dying from RS. Your post just made it sound like it was a fact and it scared me a little for a second!\n\nEdit: The only plausible way someone could die that I can think of is from malnutrition, but that still seems unlikely. ( Interesting. Thanks for linking that. It does not say how it directly causes death though which is interesting. The fact it is death is more common in elders and small children does suggest it is linked to the immune system/ overall health (just a guess). It would be interesting if there was more research on this. I am going to go web-hunting hehe.\n\nEdit post web-hunt: Honestly, apart from the source you provided I could not find any mention of rumination syndrome causing death. The Mayo Clinic lists the( of RS and the only ones that could be linked to death are extreme weight loss and malnutrition. Perhaps you could also choke on it as it comes back up, but that is the same risk as choking when swallowing in the first place so I would not consider it to be significant. Have fun tell me if u get something Above :)", "Did anyone else use to assume that everyone ruminated? I am a 28-year-old woman who have had rumination syndrome for at least 20 years (or, for as long as I remember, at least). I am not diagnosed, but since I have had the symptoms all my life, I am pretty sure this is what I have. It never bothered me when I was younger - it only happened after large meals, and usually I would even kind of enjoy it. It never tasted awful or acidic. Usually it just tasted of whatever I just ate, sometimes even hours after eating.\n\nAbout 6 years ago I brought it up with a friend of mine in a casual way. Like \"you know when you mini-puke after a meal, and it is kind of gross but also kind of enjoyable at the same time?\" My friend looked absolutely mortified. She told me no, and that it certainly was not normal. I quickly back-tracked and played it off as a joke, but honestly I was shocked to learn that not everybody did this.\n\nLately I have experienced ruminating more often than usual (every day rather than 3-4 times a week) and is finally thinking about seeing a doctor about it. I just do not even know where to start. It feels embarrassing to admit that I have been experiencing this all of my life, yet never saw a doctor about it. It is also an unflattering and embarrassing thing to explain. Lastly, it is not even a diagnosis that \"exists\" in my country. I live in Denmark and there is no information about rumination syndrome whatsoever in Danish. It just does not exist. But yeah, it still blows my mind when I think about how thing is not \"normal\" when it is been my \"normal\" pretty much my entire life. Not really. But it is hard for me to imagine what it is like to live without it. Eating whatever you want, fast or slow, in any setting without worrying about throwing up in your mouth. Must be nice. \n\nMy symptoms used to be more like yours, it was honestly pretty enjoyable from time to time and did not happen too often. Now however it is every meal. Only way I can get away without it is if I make sure I am in a super calm setting with 0 stressors. It is also a lot more violent than in the past, it is more of a small throw up (without the nausea) rather than the previously smooth regurgitation.\n\nSo I would suggest you just follow through and do not give up with your doctors visits. It is worth it!\n\nI live in Sweden so I feel you with no one knowing wth it is. I did however have a online doctor refer to it as \u201cregurgitationssyndrom\u201d. So I guess that is rumination syndrome in our language. But it is still not widely known at all. Mine has always been every meal, for over 10 years now. Recently I have gotten more control over it thanks to learning diaphragmatic breathing, and I do not get it every meal anymore. I advise looking diaphragmatic breathing up and learning it yourself. I have not had any help from doctors as (even in England) they had not heard of it and just misdiagnosed me, and gave me the wrong medication.\n\nYou should not feel any shame about it, it is not gross- it is just the same as food that you chew. It is just a little hard for other people to understand sometimes, because it is extremely uncommon. But we all get it here, and we are here for you :) To answer your question - yes, me. And after going in this topic deeper I actually got that almost everyone experiences that but, instead of food, they just get the air. As some people tried to explain me - some can feel the food coming back up but it do not reach their throat. But also they get that pretty rarely- once a month or even less.\n\nAnd, to be honest, I would not go to the doctors anymore. Especially if you did not find any info in your country. You will probably do a lot of different tests and will be sent to psychotherapy. In my opinion, just a waste of time. But, of course, there is a little chance someone might help you. That is you own decision and I do not want to make a bad impact an you.\n\nAnyway, update if you decide on something. Thanks for your reply! It is weird how RS is seen as this super rare illness, while acid reflux and heartburn are both considered pretty normal. Like, strange how refluxing undigested stomach contents is basically unheard of, while refluxing partly-digested (or just straight-up stomach acid) is considered a common thing (the latter two are of course also way more serious).\n\nI might schedule an endoscopy (if my doctor agrees to refer me), just to see if I happen to be born with some kind of defect that could explain my long history with RS. Although I am suspecting that this is mainly a bad habit that I picked up as a kid, and never managed to get rid of.. Either way, I will definitely make an update thread if I follow through! I am exactly the same. I was pretty open about being able to throw up when I was a kid. Great party trick right? I never really said I throw up after every meal and that it tastes great, but I do not think I tried to hide it until I got older.", "If you have rumination disorder, join the community and help figure out which treatments work best. ", "I want to hear about your rumination syndrome experiences! Hi, I am really interested in exploring peoples' experiences of rumination syndrome. I myself have recovered from rumination syndrome following surgery- and ever since this I have been fascinated by how different everyone is experiences are and how much different advice there is. However, there is also lots we all have in common.\n\nI am a researcher, but I am also working with a charity to develop some support for people with rumination syndrome.\n\nWould anyone be interested in taking part in a discussion, or answering some questions? You mean to say you have lost the syndrome after surgery ?\nIsnt this supposed to be incurable This is precisely why I am so interested in rumination syndrome. I have complete 100% remission of my symptoms following surgery.\n\nIt is possible there are variations of rumination syndrome- depending on the cause and individual pathology/symptoms. So, it may be that some forms are not curable.\n\nHowever, I believe we need to do some more research in this area and collect the stories of people who are living with rumination syndrome so we can learn more. Can I ask what surgery you got? I am really curious. I nearly went through with a surgery but it was definitely not the right cause of action for RS. Do you have any negative side affects following?\n\nIt is also very interesting that a surgery helped considering RS is supposed to be a habitual condition. I would love to understand how the surgery works. \n\nWas the surgery purely for RS or was RS stopping just a fortunate side affect of a surgery for a different medical condition?\n\nA lot of questions, I know. Thanks in advance! No problems - my surgery was a nissens fundoplication surgery- I had three tests, esophageal manometry, endoscopy and a barium swallow, that all showed a physical problem with the valve between esophagus and stomach. My surgeon did not really talk about rumination syndrome- he was interested in the physiology. I was a bit shocked when he recommended surgery, as I thought I would get referred for breathing exercises/psychology.\n\nMy backstory - I had bulimia for 10 years, and I developed rumination syndrome after recovering from bulimia. I ruminated for 2-3 years and it kept getting worse and worse. I could not even keep drinks down by the end. I tried to stop it myself, but I realised that I could not. \n\nThe surgery was keyhole- they wrapped the top part of my stomach round the eosphagus to form a new valve. It was a loose wrap- they usually use this surgery for acid reflux. I did not have acid reflux so was a candidate for the loose wrap rather than the tight wrap. This is good as it still means I can burp, and be sick. If you have the tight wrap, then you cannot. \n\n When they went inside, they found I had a hiatal hernia as well, and it was a big one. So they repaired that. \n\nIt took me about a year to recover fully from the surgery, and about two years to feel normal with my new situation. But, I am 100% in remission from rumination. It is strange, sometimes when I get stressed I subconsciously go to do the movement to bring up food... and I cannot. Haha!\n\nI have an idea that there are many different types of rumination syndrome caused by different things. So, it may be that surgery would not work for some, or that, for some, it is possible to treat with breathing and unlearning habits etc. This is why i am interested in rumination syndrome - I think we need to find out more. ~~ I knew that surgery was an option but I never really considered that until now ~~\nI thought that this specific surgery was very dangerous and that many people had more adverse effects than positive\n\n you gave me hope back because honestly after more than 10 years of rumination syndrome I feel very tired and I have less and less energy to fight it off. Motivation to overcome the syndrome by pure will power is currently at its lowest.\n\nAnd I am doing it by pure addiction to the taste of the food.\nI have come to the severely depressing stage where the only activity of the day is eating and ruminating over and over again. And motivation to do anything else with my life is also nonexistent\n\nI know very well how not to do it. But I keep on doing it cause I am damn addicted Sorry to hear of your situation. I too got to the point where I did not have the mental energy to fight the ruminating. Recovering from bulimia was a huge mental battle, and when surgery was offered, I was like hell yes! \n\nThe surgery can have side effects, and you have to accept that things will not be the same again. You have to eat a bit slower, and sometimes food feels like it is getting stuck. None of this is anywhere close to annoying as ruminating.\n\nI think a danger is, I am sure, if I forced it, a lot, I could probably ruminate again. And so maybe you have to be in a situation where you are recovered from any psychological reliance on rumination before you have the surgery as it could be dangerous if someone tries to make themselves sick for example, or forces the ruminating. That is just conjecture though, so not sure if that is true. I have never \"tried\" to ruminate or be sick since my op. Sometimes I do the motion subconsciously but it does not work and I stop immediately\n\nIn my experience, the surgery is pretty invasive and I was so worried about it all healing properly that the idea of ruminating became repugnant and it removed it from my mind. \n\nIn my case, there was a physical issue. I wonder whether that is true of everyone with ruminaton?\n\nAnyway, best of luck! Thanks a lot for the feedback. I appreciate it very much since you address one of my biggest fears, that is my ability to destroy the work of the surgeon by force. \n\nAnd as you say the amount of time and energy this piece of surgery takes, not to mention the amount of energy - makes me feel like it is too dangerous for me \n\nI do not trust myself enough to behave properly... And I guess there are pretty bad other side effects. It would be better if I could stop by pure willpower.\n\nEveryday I tell myself it is the last day and tomorrow rehab begins. But laziness has systematically proven me wrong for ten years. I did not think my self-esteem could plummet that much.\n\nI wasted such a long time. I really despise my weakness This is the surgery I almost got! I was going to get a tight wrap though as I remember them saying burping/ coughing would be uncomfortable or not possible. And they said I would not be able to be sick. \n\nI was misdiagnosed with acid reflux which is why it was brought up, and I am glad I did not get the surgery because the side effects are not nice, but you do make me wonder about the loose wrap seeing as it does not seem like there are any bad effects from what you have mentioned?\n\nI do not feel like I NEED surgery as my rumination is so much better now and I am better at controlling it, but at the same time I wonder if it would be better. I am literally ruminating my tea and fake bacon right now and I just wish it would go away. I really feel like surgery worked for me- I did not want to have to deal with ruminating, and also the tests confirmed that there were physiological problems that enabled me to ruminate, that perhaps could not ever be reversed through sheer will power alone. I was in two minds as I could not work out whether it was a physical or mental issue. But, my surgeon said there was a physical issue that he thought he could treat. And, he was right!\nI am a very active person, and the worst part of the surgery for me was the recovery time. It took about a year and a half for me to feel back to normal. But, last year I spent three  months hiking in the Himalayas carrying a huge backpack with all my stuff. Surgery held out find. No ruminating.\nSometimes I have some discomfort if I overdo it on the weight training or push myself too much physically- but I think it is scar tissue. Sometimes I get a bit of heart burn (hilarious as I never had this before surgery), but  its rare, like maybe once a month. I can tell something is different inside, but... it was worth it for me.\n\nI do stress though that maybe it will not work this way for everyone. also... I did not need the surgery either. It was elective. I could live my life without it, but, like you, I just got fed up of the whole process. And my teeth started to get cavities. That tipped me over the edge- I just wanted to be done. Makes sense, thanks for sharing. Hello, fellow researcher! I actually just happened to finally figure this out today after waking up and wondering if there is other people that could vomit on command like me. I had always thought it was just a cool talent I had, not knowing it was an actual disorder. I know a self-diagnosis is not the best thing but reading the entire Wikipedia page, I realized I fit 100% of the symptoms. It was as if I had written the article based on my personal experiences.\n\nI have never had an eating disorder although if I am being completely honest, I remember being in middle school and thinking anorexia was kind of cool. So one day I decided that since I know that I can make food come back up, I might as well try to be bulimic. I noted a few days later in my diary that I liked food way too much to be bulimic. I know it was a stupid thing to try since I could have actually developed an eating disorder but at least I can rule it out as a potential cause in this case. The wiki also states that another potential cause could be trauma. The earliest defined moment I can pinpoint this would be 6th grade (when I was 11 or 12) because I distinctly remember avoiding running the mile by pretending to be stomach sick by using my ability to throw up on command. However, I know I have had it from before then, too. I remember being around 5-9 years old and eating a bunch of bad strawberries. That was the first time I had a really bad experience vomiting to the point that it tasted so bad and felt so forceful that I started to cry. It was such a bad experience\u00a0that I distinctly remember wondering why of all the times that I have ever vomited in my life, why this specific occasion hurt and why I could not control it. Throughout my life, if I ever had a stomach ache following a meal, I could simply go to the bathroom, throw up, feel relieved, and go about my day. It was as normal to me as urinating following water consumption. \n\nI cannot say exactly when I developed it but I can rule out the habit theory. Regarding the trauma theory, I am not sure if it was related to my life events or if I developed it some other way. I moved more times in my life than I have fingers, my father was emotionally abusive to my mother and emotionally distant to me, and until I was around 5 years old, my family was so poor that we lived in a car garage and ate rice, beans, and eggs as dinner. Regardless, I never considered myself to be poor since I was so appreciative of everything and despite all the hardships I went through in my life, I had a really optimistic outlook on everything and had fun just being a kid. For the amount of stuff I have gone through in my life, I should probably have some sort of stress disorder but all I have is ADHD, which runs in my family. If the cause is trauma-related, it must have been a repressed memory that I have, or perhaps it was from a life event that I do not mind thinking about because I learned good coping skills on my own. \n\nI think the theory that best fits my own is probably the under-stimulated theory of developing it as an infant since I cannot pinpoint any one memory that could attribute to it. I remember when I was younger, I liked to do it after every meal because it was like getting to taste the best parts of the meal for the second time. I think I did it so often as a kid that it just persisted into adulthood. I have become a lot better at controlling it. If I want to, I can vomit on command and it does feel exactly like how the wiki describes it, like when you breathe in air to belch on command. However, I also have it happen even if I actively do not want it to happen but it is more like a \"why did I do that?\" situation. But in this case, it is not really vomiting because it is not leaving my mouth. I keep it in my mouth and like to taste and chew it. It is kind of mindless to me when it happens and it can happen multiple times following a meal but sometimes, when I am talking to someone or do not want it to happen, it feels kind of like an itch that needs to be scratched. Usually, if I do it just once or twice following a meal, I do not get any more of these \"itches\" to do it again but if I try to not do it at all, it gets very \"itchy\". It is especially embarrassing when I am in front of other people and it happens because I then start to worry about my bad breath and if they notice or not. I remember one time in 8th grade, I did it during lunch class since I was bored and a kid noticed me chewing and accused me of having gum in my mouth but since it was just food, I had no problem swallowing and showing the teacher that I had nothing in my mouth. To cope with the bad breath, I started only doing it within 5 minutes after eating so that only undigested food would come back up and I would not have bad breath, only food breath. I always kept it to myself and it felt like a guilty pleasure. I would not be surprised if I actually developed this as a coping method for my ADHD so my mind could be stimulated enough as a kid when I was bored in class or in other situations. \n\nI still do this every day and never paid much attention to it before reading about Rumination Syndrome. I had never even considered that this may actually be a pathological behavior. To me, it was a completely normal bodily function that I enjoyed doing so I never thought it could be a bad thing. I actually did not start recognizing it as a problem aside from a social faux pas until two years ago when the dentist told me that my enamel was very weakened and that I needed to make sure I stop eating overly sweet or acidic foods. It was not until last year that I realized it could be connected to my mouth-vomiting that I really tried to limit it to just once a meal. Since it is so normal, I did not pay too much attention to how often I did it. I just kind of assume that it is not really that much. It is like, you do not pay attention to how often you scratch a mosquito bite but you know that you have definitely scratched it at least once every day. I never noticed how habitual it actually was and now that I think about it, this can actually be very damaging to me in the long run. Other symptoms from the Wiki that I also noticed are being bloated and having diarrhea. However, I regularly drink milk even though I am slightly lactose intolerant, haha. So I cannot rule this out as being a related symptom, but it very well could be. I would have to remove milk from my diet for a week and see if I still get those two symptoms. Other than that, I also have had Pica for a large majority of my life. I get cravings to eat ice but it is gone away for the most part once I reached my 20s. However, this may have to do more with my Iron Deficiency rather than Rumination Syndrome as well. \n\nI am really interested in learning more about this condition so please feel welcome to contact me further regarding the topic! I would love to give as much information as possible if it could help further investigate and possibly lead to finding a treatment for this condition :) Hi, thanks so much for sharing your story! It is really interesting to hear about your experiences with ruminating. Apologies it has taken me so long to read this post- I have been very busy and forgot to check! I will certainly be in touch - it would be great to talk. :) I could have written this myself. Are you me?? So glad I am not alone. Howdy, pretty sure I have rumination syndrome though I have not been officially diagnosed. I have had these sorts of throw up/regurgitation burps for as long as I can remember, as in since I was at least a toddler. It actually worried my mom when I was a toddler so she took me to the doctors about it and they did not have any answers for her back then. As for me I never knew people did not regurgitate when they burped until like, last year? lol. I knew my mom thought it was weird but I just assumed I got them more often than more people and that is why she was concerned. I just thought that there were air burps and regurgitation burps and that was a universal experience, go figure. I do not think this is linked to any type of trauma as I have had this all my life and if there was trauma it would have had to be when I was an infant. But with loving parents, including my mother being a stay at home mom, meaning no one else looked after me, I really do not think I can link this to trauma. I have also never had any type of eating disorder, I am in my early 20's for reference. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must say when finding this group I have been shocked to see how many people are here to try and get rid of their rumination syndrome, as someone who has always had these regurgitations, it has just always been normal for me, its interesting to se how not normal this is to everyone else, rip. I am not sure if surgery would do anything to help me tbh, I feel like I should ask my doctor next time I see them though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso I know many people have gotten rumination syndrome after an eating disorder and I have seen a few mentions of it in regards to weight. I must say I am interested if anyone has any insight on how this effects your eating and weight. I have always been on the edge of a healthy weight for my height and age, but my weight has never fluctuated and has stayed the same for my adult life, it could be that my general habits keep me at the same weight, but knowing that some people here have seen a link between rumination syndrome and their weight I felt that I should at least ask if anyone has some insight to share. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions for me I can do my best to answer them, ty. Yeah, it seems quite shocking to me as well how many people here are trying to get rid of the symptom. I personally do not really find it much of a problem since I can always just force it back down, and though it may sound gross to a lot of people I kind of enjoy re-tasting that delicious meal I just ate. Hello! I am not diagnosed with rs, but I have all the symptoms. After I eat a medium to large sized meal, it comes back up. I have to swallow it again, then it comes back up. This lasts for about an hour or two. Everything that I eat will always come back up, no matter the food. Even water will come back up. When the food comes back up, it is not acidic unless the food I ate was acidic, like kiwi or blueberries. I usually do not experience pain when the food comes back up, but my stomach might growl or I might get gassy. RS can be very annoying, especially since I run. When I run, I do my best to keep a regular breathing pattern, so it does not mess up my time. Because of RS, when the food comes up it messes up my breathing and makes it harder to keep a steady pace. I am going to try breathing exercises and see if that helps keep my food down.", "Pretty sure I have rumination syndrome Since i (m28) was 20 (I think) I have had food come up again 10 minutes to 2-3 hours after I have eaten.\n\nGone to multiple doctor visits this last year cus I am getting pretty sick of it all, I started getting panic attacks due to rumination this year since sometimes it is like it gets stuck in my chest for 20 minutes or more, making me feel very uncomfortable. Might be worth noting I have had issues with mental health since I was 18.\n\nAnyways I was wondering if this might be it, it sure sounds like it. I rarely ever get acidic stuff back in my mouth, just food or mild fluids.\n\nSo how do you guys cope? I have heard of diaphragmatic breathing and I could give that a shot. Anything else that I might want to take up?\n\nI am also trying to do 15 minutes of mindfulness meditation a day and sometimes also some yoga in order to cope with stress. I have an 18-month-old grandson that has been diagnosed with rumination syndrome. I am a science teacher by trade so I try to observe details. I have noticed certain foods (bananas) and smells may trigger an episode. Also, if he watches tv after eating it may trigger an episode. I understand that correlation does not always equal causation so more observations are needed. I have not found much research on this syndrome. I am 18, and I have had this for around 6 years now, and it is still just as prevalent. What is difficult is that it does differ from person to person. \nI would recommend getting very regular and pointed about teeth hygiene, I am serious I have really sensitive teeth now.\nI would also recommend not taking in any lactose. It is one of the hardest things for even a strong digestive system to intake and I have personally found that it burns the throat(the lactic acid) when it comes up.\nA tip I would give in terms of social convenience, is to have a puke bottle with you when you go to gatherings. Sounds disgusting, but there is not always going to be a place to puke discreetly. \n\nOoh, one that my dietician got me to do was to eat in smaller frequent meals so that the body doesnt push everything out violently but instead takes it in at a slower pace.\n\nI hope everything goes well with you!:) Some ways you can work out whether it is RS is that:\n\nThe food comes up on its own, though you may feel your stomach and oesophagus tense.\nThe food will be undigested (whole bits of food).\nThe food will taste like it did before.\nThe food comes up into your mouth, so you either rechew and reswallow or spit it out.\nThe food comes up in manageable amounts- It is not like puke where there is too much and you could not possibly contain it.\nFluids can also come up in the same way.\n\nI think from those you could probably work out if you do have RS or not.\n\nIf you do think you have RS then I do recommend learning diaphragmatic breathing- it really helped me to learn to control it a bit better by stopping my abdomen from always tensing up after I eat. I still get flare ups when I am stressed though, and often I ruminate without realising it when I am doing stuff like watching TV.\n\nEdit: it removed my formatting in the second paragraph so I apologise as it is a little messy", "When did it start for you. I am a male in my early 40s. I had my first rumination event about 4 years ago. It would happen once in a while, but starting about 5 months ago, it became an every meal event. It is awful, and the doctor has no clue. Just wondering if it is common for RS to start so late in life. Not 100% sure but I started properly around 5 years ago I have had RS for almost 10 years now. I am good at diaphragmatic breathing so can usually stop it from coming up if I need to, but most of the time I do not notice I am ruminating as Im so used to it, and therefore I do not really mind it. Start of 2020. I have no clue why I have had it for about 16 years and it started when I was very young. 15 year old here. I used to do it as a kid. In quarantine I got anxiety issues, so it started again I have had it since i was a kid. My doctor said out of the 2 other people she had who suffered this it seemed to occur after an illness. Who knows though.", "Diaphragmatic breathing feels like it is forcing food up? I have had RS for a couple years but just started trying diaphragmatic breathing. It feels very counterintuitive, when I try to breathe and have my stomach move it feels like food is likely to come up. Again, I am new to the practice, so I do not know, am I doing something wrong, or should I push past that feeling, or does it means anything different? Thank you. I only did it before eating when I first started. I used to have similar problems with diaphragmatic breathing. I felt like focusing on the breathing made me feel out of control in terms of regurgitation. However for me after a months of practice it really helped me. I would suggest pushing past that feeling but if it is really uncomfortable for you maybe try a different type of strategy. Had this feeling as well, but then I read an article that said to place one hand on your chest and one on your stomach. When you do the DB, only the stomach hand should move up and down. In through the nostrils, out through the mouth.  When you do this, it seems to help the food move in the right direction. That makes sense, to get comfortable with it before its in that situation. Thank you! I have the same feeling, but after a few seconds it gets better. Lay on your back with a pillow behind you and just relax. It will cause you to diaphragmatic breath naturally.\n\nIn terms of standing up and breathing once the attack happens and your esophagus starts to contract there is nothing I have been able to do except try not to breath too deep and to relax abdomen or food WILL COME UP", "Never thought I would find others I have had rumination for close to 9 years.\nIt started with full on vomiting, which I did all the time for about 6 months. Eventually the vomiting subsided, and I can now go months without having to vomit.\nBut the regurgitation is still there. \n\nIt definitely correlates to my anxiety. My anxiety has been worse lately, so I have been regurgitating a lot. Regurgitating makes me more anxious, so the cycle continues. Sometimes I find it easier to make myself throw up.\nAlso when regurgitating a lot, I opt for more carbs, because rechewing a salad is exhausting", "I am not alone!!! Thank goodness for this subreddit! I have had RS for as long as I can remember until the present (28 y.o.). I remember in first grade bragging about it and thinking that it was cool, in highschool faking an illness using it to get out of school, it facilitating an eating disorder when I was modeling my early 20s, and the constant embarrassment of it. The other day I used a coffee cup after it got bad and threw it away at a store--now I am afraid of going back. Growing up I used glass cups when no one was around and would sometimes forget about them, so my parents and brothers would stumble across them in drawers once in a while and become deeply disgusted. I have gone through so many fazes with it, from swallowing it, to using various portable cups, to sneaking to the bathroom, to spitting it out in public when no one was looking, to trying to ignore it. I have never met a person who can relate, and everyone seems to think that rumination = vomiting or bulimia, not understanding that it is so much less gross (food which tastes the same as before eating it). After what has been probably 22 years with this disorder, I just want to thank the moderators and everyone here for having this community and letting me know that I am not alone. Finally, others understand the process of hiding it and the social embarrassment and stigma of it. And, of course, doctors never knowing what it is. And not to mention struggling with weight gain and dealing with strangers and family gossiping about an eating disorder and my body when it has just been RS (except for a phase that lasted a few years).\n\nThank you all! And best of luck and good vibes. Moms always like, let us go to a doctor, like a doctors going to help. I feel this", "Rumination / NG tube and the Mayo Clinic Hi everyone\n\nFor some reason I never thought to check reddit for a community of people that suffer from the same thing I do but I am glad I did. After being diagnosed by northwestern university I have recently gone to the Mayo Clinic which is widely known as the number 1 hospital in the world. I highly recommend if anyone is still struggling to find answers. They were able to get me in the right path and did not just treat me like a lab rat. \n\nMy main thing is has anyone dealt with having an NG tube inserted into their small intestine to receive nutrients? I had dropped to about 97lbs as a 29 year old adult and had a tube inserted about 2 weeks ago. It is one of the toughest things I have had to deal with and I was looking for tips from anyone. I have not brought food up in 2 weeks though which is amazing but I miss food ! Looking for any tips or suggestions. Been eating chicken broth and jello. Just tried mashed potatoes I am really small portions which seems to work. Anyways thanks everyone!!! Have you tried diaphragmatic breathing exercises before/during/after meals? It is the only thing I have seen for rumination, and it works for me when I remember to do it.\n\n\nIt sounds like you are in a very tough situation. I am glad you were able to get the tube after all that weight loss, but I am sure it is not fun to have in. The first time at Northwestern they showed me the diaphragmatic breathing. They were having he do it 10 minutes before , in the middle and 10 minutes after. I found little success it also it was giving me even more anxiety during meals. Mayo Clinic has me doing it just 6 of the breathing ,10 times a day which definitely helps. \n\nThe NG tube is awful though just based on throat pain and it does not give me the feeling of being full", "When did you realize you had RS?  I am new to this, but I have had RS for quite a while, honestly it makes life so awkward. I cannot ever attend really big events because then I will probably get called a freak, Only people who know about it are my family. I am not sure when exactly It started but it was sometime last summer when I vacationed to Mexico. It started off slow but as I got used to it, it became an every meal occurrence:/ Probably 3-4 years ago. At the dinner with my mum and aunt. It was New Year\u2019s vacation in Sharm el sheikh. I just \u2018burped\u2019 and then quickly run to the bathroom. I think i have even spitted some onto the table/chair (but definitely on myself). So fckin disgusting First noticed it like 10-15 years ago but it seems like it has gotten a LOT worse in the last handful of years It used to happen every few days, turned into everyday now it is every meal Damn man, that must have felt so terrible, did he begin to happen more often? Yup. Not sure but i think it is bulimia now", "Ive undertaken the decision of TRYING to stop this syndrome if possible and detailing my experiences as a form of Guide for those looking to possibly stop it too. What would you like it to be ? Idk other people have suppressed the urge to do so as well and if possible id like to too so ill be doing it for 21 days. Just see how you all would like the info if interested.\n\nWould be interested to see what you would prefer.\n\n( Raw because we will be sure you keep that up lol.\n\nI will also try to stop this syndrome ! Good luck ;) I would be really interested in this. I am on a journey of my own and I have not regurgitates anything in a while. I am really proud!

I am trying to go and switch over to a drink diet like smoothies and protein shakes, will this help? if not what else could i do", "I think my brother has RS and want tips for talking about it with him Hi! This is actually my first ever post on reddit so here goes. Im almost positive that my older brother (28) has RS. We have been together all week at our parents\u2019 beach house which has really highlighted for me the behaviors that I had somewhat noticed over the past few years: after meals, he will read or look at his phone or whatever and chew seemingly nothing for like 15 minutes. Sometimes he blows out his cheeks too. I had no idea what this could possibly be until I spent some time googling tonight and discovered this. For what it is worth, my brother had serious anorexia as a child (11-13). \n\nMy mom and I tried to bring it up in a jokey way with him and he did not at all engage and I think maybe was trying not to cry. So clearly this is a super sensitive topic for him. But I would like to be supportive/help him see a doctor etc if this is something he wants to get treated. Any thoughts?? What is the best way to approach this?? Generally we are close but this is not the kind of issue he and I have talked about in the past  (unsurprisingly since I did not know this condition existed until 30 minutes ago!!) \n\nThanks in advance. From what you have said it seems like it could be RS, but of course we cannot diagnose. \n\nI do not know how his relationships are in the family but I would advise you speak to him with somone he trusts and is comfortable with, in a space he feels safe in. Tell him right from the start that you are not going to judge him no matter what he tells you about, you just want to know what is going on and if you can support him in any way.\n\nThe best thing you could do is when you get into the conversation, ask him more about your symptoms and see if they match up to what you have learned about rumination syndrome. If you think his symptoms are similar you can tell him that you heard of something that sounds like what he has, and ask if he would want to look into it. You can tell him about this community here if you think that would help.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that he could be really ashamed of this and be disgusted by himself, or he could even enjoy ruminating as it brings comfort to many people, and he may not want to stop.\n\nYou need to discuss his feelings and what he would like to do moving forward.\n\nGood luck! :)", "Is a fast heart rate and put of breath normal while rumination or while regurgitating food? Generally while ruminatig or regurgitation, we have to forcefully contract the muscles of our abdomen and chest right?\nSo sometimes, during the course of an hour or two, as long as I ruminate or regurgitate, the heart rate rises and breathlessness happens. Is that normal while regurgitation? Like sometimes, the heart pains and burns which may be due to acid reflux but I wanted to know if a high heartbeat and fluttering is also common during the course of food regurgitation? Like if I do it for 2 hours, sometimes it pains and buzzing happens?\nIs it the acid coming up? That happens to me, too. I do not know why it happens. I wish there was more information on rumination syndrome. U do not have any heart issues? no, I my heart rate goes up to the hundreds when I ruminate. I have rumination syndrome and I get this as well! My dad, a doctor who also has GERD, pointed out that when the abyss reflux travels upwards at a very high speed, the body is not prepared for it, this oxygen and effort taken and labored breathing to return to normal. The heart burns as you assumed are from the acid that sits uncomfortably in the esophageal tube or other alimentary places and as a result, causes discomfort and pressure on that region. So the fluttering and vibrations in the heart is normal? So the heart is not getting affected even though it pains? I cannot guarantee anything, it shouldnt be affected though. It is mostly probably unrelated but it might be worth it to check it out!", "Jackhammer esophagus Has anyone been diagnosed with this as part of their RS journey? This was the verdict I was given. The doctor has given me muscle relaxers to calm contractions in the esophagus. It is definitely helping, but I am not cured yet.", "Tonsil stones Does anyone else get bad tonsil stones? I was speaking to my dentist and he said a possible reason for my tonsil stones could be from having rumination syndrome. Just wondering if anyone else also has issues with them? Yes! I pretty much have them constantly. I get them out when I can (recently bought a Waterpik which worked well!), but I do not think I will ever be able to reach them all. They are usually back within a week or two.\n\nI have not been officially diagnosed with rumination syndrome yet, but I have discussed tonsil stones with my doctor, I was meant to see an ENT to see if they had a solution but then COVID happened and I did not end up going.  Nope. Perhaps you could do this as a poll to get a better idea of who does and does not? I actually spoke to my doctor today and he told me it was not a medical problem and that I just have to get used to them... most unhelpful doctor ever! Think I will order a Waterpik and have a try of that That sucks! It is not really something you can get over, actually gives me anxiety about my breath.\n\nI hope the waterpik works for you! I just started to get them I do every now and again yes Yes it is so gross but I also kind of love it?? (lmao)\n\nBut I was told it was because I have such big tonsils!

I would get really sweaty, and have this feeling like the good j was not going down properly, and then i would get sick after i ate. I would dry heave sometimes and throw up flem, it was like maybe once a week than but now it seems to be every other day and whenever i eat, i cannot keep anything down. the only thing that helps me is smoking marijuana. is anyone else like this? The fact that you smoke marijuana does not help at all, talk to a psychiatrist and tell him everything okay. i only started bc it said it could help with pain and it is the only thing that i can use that will keep food down You and I know that that shit does not do good, it fucking kills you. Talk to a professional, trust me, it could be embarrassing but it will save your life and improve it so much. it will not kill me tf Bruh have you even taken basic biology lessons regarding drugs, come on, that shit is poison, it is your choice to keep fucking your brain tho, follow my steps( my mum is a fucking doctor I think she knows better jeez) my step moms a doctor and she bought me a bowl? if it helps it helps", "Lactaid? Hi, does anyone have experience taking lactaid ? I did for the first time and it made regurgitation realllllly weird / difficult. I am a lil worried it is dangerous ??? Are you lactose intolerant? you take it for regurgitation or regurgitation started after taking them? I have RS + also am lactose intolerant. I took lactaid and it made regurgitation afterward different / difficult. Like my body was still trying to do it, just encountering more resistance. i get it now. i am sorry for this. personally i do not have any experience. hope there are someone. try to write in lactose intolerant forums. btw, are there any info about side effects on this medicine paper? Sorry to hear that! I feel ya. It did not work for me either. With ice cream, I still just threw it up immediately. For milk, I did not throw it up, but I instead had intense abdominal pain about 6+ hrs later. So my theory is that lactaid is probably best with simple cases. (That is, someone is lactose intolerant and has no other GI issues.)", "Do not ignore this Condition I have had Rumination syndrome since i was a young boy. I remember being hospitalized for being able to essentially vomit on command.\n\nAcid Reflux was my diagnosis....they gave me pills and sent me on my way for decades.\n\nAcid is 1 component of destruction when it comes to conditions like GERD or Rumination syndrome. Luckily for us our food is ruminated before it becomes very acidic in our stomaches, BUT there are other enzymes that damage your throat such as Pepsin and Bile.\n\nI know there is a temptation to ignore this issue. Just take some Prilosec and just drink some alcohol with the boys eat some Lemon candy, and start your day with a nice sugary coffee.\n\nDo not do this. Eat a low acid diet, stay away from all alcohol, chocolate, and caffeine.\n\nWhat happens if you do not? When your body ruminated, especially at night if you have a full stomach. The contents go not only into your throat but your Eustachian tubes as well which connect to your ears. This will cause over time not only nerve damage on your throat but Tinnitus.\n\nDoctors will be of no use once you develop either. Tinnitus nothing can be done and Nerve damage can only be treated with medication that just takes away the effects.\n\nSo not ignore this. I finally know what is going on with my body and it has taken years to figure out my diagnosis, but also my own research and bad moves to learn about where this road leads.\n\nThe good news? If you watch your diet, do not overeat, and stay away from acidic foods the damage from rumination can be quite minimal! If fact despite my throat issues my esophagus itself is in pretty good shape.\n\nTake care of yourself. I just discovered this sub and I am thinking this is my problem. I have been regurgitating food after meals for a couple years now. Mostly after overeating, often triggered by ice cream or cold liquids. I work at a private school and in the cafeteria they have a soft serve machine. I would eat a big meal (the food there is really good,) have an ice cream cone, go back to my office and recline in my chair. The ice cream would come back up (which was not so bad!) but also some of the other food I had for lunch would come up and it was kind of gross. I just chewed it up again and swallow. Eventually I started getting daily heart burn, and a bad sore throat in the morning. Sometimes id get that scary ear pain or chest tightness. I have had tinnitus and depression since I was a teenager.\n\nI talked to my Dr. and got an endoscopy and was diagnosed with GERD. Have been taking omeprazole for 15 months, sleeping with a wedge pillow for a year. The medication helps with acid related pain but does not stop the regurgitation or the incessant burping and farting. I have cut back big time on alcohol, marijuana, ice cream, and greasy food. Recently I switched from coffee to NUUN caffeinated sports drink and also started diaphragmatic breathing throughout the day. These changes have helped considerably and I am starting to wean off my medication. Posture after eating and regular exercise also really help my stomache.\n\nMuch of these issues have to do with stress. I had bad depression, a drug problem, marital issues, unsatisfied at work, pandemic stress, and two young boys exhausting me daily! After ditching my bad habits, exercising more, modifying my diet, and diaphragmatic breathing I have improved my situation considerably. I feel like I see the light at the end of the tunnel and no longer have to live with regurgitation and pain. My depression has gone down to record a low. I am grateful for having the resilience and gumption to improve this health issue.", "Anyone Here from Ireland Hi all is anyone here from Ireland and if so how did you get referred to a behavioral therapist/how long did it take?", "How much food do you bring up at a time?

I ended up not eating to suppress it and when I would eat I would just throw food back up again. Eventually got diagnosed with it. Later down the road because of this I developed two eating disorders, depression, Agra phobia and anxiety. Am still facing these issues to this day.

In short it is effortless regurgitation of food and drinks after consumption due to the involuntary contraction of muscles around the abdomen.\n\nThis is seen as a rare disease as it is often misdiagnosed as GERD or labelled as bulimia.\n\nIt can be very difficult to live with this however as it is so uncommon it is difficult to find support or other sufferers. Rumination syndrome is also commonly combined with anxiety and depression.\n\nIn a way I have made this community for myself, however I hope someone else with rumination syndrome finds this and maybe it would help them too.\n\n( Holy cow, when did you think of this idea?  I kept meaning to start this subreddit after a conversation on Thursday, and tonight when I went to start it I see you started one 10 hours earlier.  Great minds think alike! I have been thinking about starting it for a while but I never thought it would work so I suppose I just did not bother. Yesterday I just thought it was worth a shot and you do not even know how happy I am right now! I am glad I finally went on reddit and looked this up. I researched this a few years ago because this has been going on for as long as I can remember, since I was in preschool. It always happens after I eat, and sometimes at anytime. I thought it was normal for a while but I have not been able to ask for medical help because it seems like such a gross syndrome. I have been throwing up in my mouth and forced to swallow it and chase it down with water because I cannot always run to a bathroom, I always have gum on me to freshen my breath, I am not sure how to go about asking for help because the syndrome is so rare and not researched. I definitely remember fresh breath being an issue and chewed a lot of gum too.  My biggest issue was always more the embarrassment parts as it definitely looks weird when you are chewing food half an hour after dinner and whatnot.\n\nAnd I am glad to see more people finding/joining this group! I am just glad I am not alone with it \ud83d\ude02 I did not know who to talk to about it, so it is nice to see that I am not so different than some others out there Yay internet/reddit!  It definitely was weird going through it pre internet.  I do not think I really talked to anyone about it until high school/college but a few kids definitely noticed from time to time before that. I have been lucky enough to not have anyone notice so far No one was ever really mean about it or anything but I am sure a cute girl or two was like what the heck is this guy doing lol Luckily with school, people put it off as gum chewing if they notice people chewing Welcome to the sub! I have had rumination syndrome for a while now and have tried various treatments. Learning diaphragmatic breathing can help to control it but I have not found a cure myself yet. I recommend trying it out", "How do you get rid of rumination syndrome without going to the doctor I tried diaphragm breathing a few times does not help I am getting ready to go back to school at a new school and I honestly want to get rid of rumination syndrome but my parents know nothing about it Imo, you need to see a specialist to treat your exact situation. RS does not even have a set cause, I do not think it is fair to yourself to expect to be able to end the issue without help. \nBut that is just my opinion after watching my daughter get RS, see a psych who specializes in treatment for RS, &amp; get control of it. Alright I will probably be stuck with rs until I can show my parents somehow I have it My daughter is the only situation I am familiar with (so admittedly I am very limited in my own experience) but sitting with her at mealtime and afterward just chilling on the couch made it clear to both her parents that something odd was happening. \nShe was never loud about it or gross, but it sounded like she was burping a lot and would sometimes run to the bathroom and spit into the toilet. She was also 11 so hiding it was difficult for her. I guess what I am saying is that if you have RS and feel it is not being taken seriously by your parents I would just start spitting out what comes up - it will not be digested or acidic - and it should solve the issue of proof. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Wow, does your daughter have control of it now? What did the specialist do? Yes, we are so thankful that she is almost always totally able to control the feeling and avoid the rumination events :) she had 8 weekly 1hr sessions - remote because it is not easy to find a local psych for pediatrics who further specializes with uncommon digestive disorders. They worked mostly on diaphragmatic breathing and I know she had a pretty easy time with that concept from being in choir groups and having done breathing exercises for that. it happens now when she is either too excited while eating or especially distracted during a meal. Distraction is the worst for focussing on the events to stop them before they happen. Drink soda, they have those chemicals in it that physically stop you from throwing up", "I started taking Lexapro for anxiety and my rumination came to an abrupt halt. I have been ruminating for a few years now, giving what is pretty much a Tyson uppercut to my esophagus. My doctor prescribed me Lexapro for anxiety (And depression that I did not know about until my personality changed a bunch) and once it kicked in (One week after I got it) My rumination stopped. I did not notice it for a few days, because I had lived with it for so long. It is odd. Rumination syndrome is definitely related to stress and anxiety in my experience. While in lockdown I was a lot more relaxed (no social anxiety and nothing I had to do, I know this was not the case for everyone) but now I am back to life I am stressed and anxious again and my RS has come back really strong. Unfortunately I do not think meds can take away my stress haha. If only Do you notice the Lexapro affecting you in any other ways (e.g., lower energy, more moody, etc.)?\n\nAlso, what is an update 20 days later? Has your rumination gone away (or slowed down)? Are you happy with the Lexapro? I have not got surgery to fix the hiatal hernia, though I predict that this will require it as nothing helps it. Lexapro seems to affect my sleep, whereas it takes hours to fall asleep. I do hate my little 6 year old brothers less when taking it. 20 days later I upped my dose to 20mg because I was having an issue where I was full-on vomiting, the rumination has come back, but it is slowed down. I will eventually have to get surgery to fix the hiatal hernia, but it was 3 years ago that they did a GI scan and found it. It might have grown since then but I would not know. You do not know. Well actually you kind of do. If you are feeling depressed/anxious (like me) you have low serotonin. If you are having diarrhea and muscle spasms, you have too much serotonin. Dopamine is not affected by SSRI class antidepressants such as Lexapro.", "Netflix Diagnosis episode on rumination I recently watched the Netflix show Diagnosis and one the episodes is about rumination syndrome. The girl in the episode, named Lashay, is diagnosed with rumination disorder but seems to have symptoms that are inconsistent with rumination. She has debilitating abdominal pain and cannot go to school anymore. She also has to have a port installed (which is a pretty serious procedure) so she can get regular IV bags.\n\nIn my personal experience with rumination, I experience no pain, no abdominal cramps, and I certainly have been able to go through both high school and college with no issues. And this seems to be the norm according to the posts on this sub and the medical definition of rumination. Some other posts I have read about the episode thought that Lashay and her mom seemed sketchy. Regardless, the show framed rumination as the definitive diagnosis even though, to me, the symptoms shown were far more severe than my understanding of rumination.\n\nFor those who watched the episode, what did you think about Lashay\u2019s illness and her diagnosis of rumination? I completely agree with your assessment. She might have had rumination syndrome *and* something else. But no, all the stuff she experienced is not encompassed by rumination syndrome. As far as I know, ( of rumination is literally done by just telling a doctor that you are experiencing... rumination. She had some test done and that makes no sense. It is like getting a blood test to find out whether you have anxiety or not. Like, what?\n\nThe episode completely misrepresents what it is, makes it out to be some insidious thing when it is actually really simple.\n\nSensationalized garbage. Yes thank you I am glad I am not the only one! The show is hosted by a well known doctor from Yale too so misrepresenting the disorder so badly is really surprising and unfortunate. This sub started shortly after I saw that episode (I did not start the sub but was talking to someone about this episode and they started the sub lol).\n\nPart of why I came here is exactly what you are saying - I saw this version of rumination that was nothing like mine and wanted to see what others experiences were like.  This sub has been helpful to show that my experience not being like hers is reasonable. I cannot believe this. It is such an unknown disease and they have completely misrepresented it? I got excited when I read the title as I thought that somehow, awareness was being spread but really this is just confusing things. Disappointed ngl. \n\nAgreed there is no funny test to find out. It is absolute rubbish. Some part of me wants to contact the people who made it but that would t do anything. I am just a bit deflated I suppose that the biggest awareness out there is inaccurate. \n\nThanks for reading my rant hehe. I had the same first reaction when I heard there was a Netflix episode on it I was like ooh yay! But then they totally misrepresented it. I guess it would not hurt to reach out to the show. The show is big on \u201ccrowdsourcing diagnoses\u201d so it might fall on deaf ears but you have a better chance than other shows I think the mother needed a munchausen by proxy diagnosis. Think that played into Lashays unwillingness to seek help. Particularly as the mother would have no control over her daughter while she was in that intense program, and a cure would change the families life.", "Not Officially Diagnosed but I have some questions!! So I am like 90% sure I have RS\u2014 i have been regurgitating for as long as I could remember but I pushed it to the side because I probably did not want to confront the fact that this was not normal. I recently made an appointment with a gastroenterologist because I also have terrible acid reflux and I thought that my regurgitation issues were due to the acid reflux. After researching, I found that they are not the same thing and found out about RS. However I was wondering if I should see this doctor first, because i am worried about running the risk of it being misdiagnosed as just GERD, when i am pretty sure I might have both. I know that RS will commonly get misdiagnosed as GERD so i am just concerned and I want to stop doing this!! Do not stress about the order too much, you can still go and see the doctor afterwards even if your gastroenterologist says that you only have GERD. I would just recommend being very plain with them that yes, you have acid reflux but you slep bring up a large amount of food on a daily basis. If they try misdiagnose you it does not really matter because YOU know what you have. Just do not let them give you medication if it is not for a problem you actually have.\n\nIn terms of stopping, I recommend learning diaphragmatic breathing. It can be tricky to get at first, and it takes a while to use it well but I now am much better at relaxing my diaphragm and I do not ruminate anywhere near as much, aside from when I am very stressed.\n\nGood luck and welcome to the community! :) Even i ruminate after meals for like an hour or so\nAt that time, is the fast heart rate normal and fluttering and tingling sensations while rumination. Like I generally do have a faster heartbeat and sometimes it feels like pain happening. It is due to the acid coming up or what? Plus, I have terrible acid reflux. Here is what happened with me... Diagnosed with GERD/reflux, taking the maximum dose of omeprazole, and it is STILL not enough. I also have a hiatal hernia (a tiny part of my stomach protrudes into my esophagus, which means it is never completely closed).\n\nWell today my new gastroenterologist says that with the amount of regurgitation I have, it just does not make sense that it is only reflux or the hernia. So she is wondering if I have rumination syndrome. \n\nShe wants me to do a 24hr pH impedance test. I already did an endoscopy, which found the hernia. And a gastric emptying scan, which is to see if gastroparesis is a factor. (Just some tests that you may want to look into / be aware of.)\n\nSo yeah, it is def possible you could have reflux AND rumination syndrome. If you have not already (I see this is an old post), I def recommend seeing a gastroenterologist. And mention you think you could have RS. If they want to put you on a reflux med, I would say try it and see if it helps. It will be clear after a little bit of time if the medication is not enough, and you can always bring up RS again.\n\nBest of luck!! Hey thanks! I did see a gastroenterologist and he said i could not possibly have RS, yet the omprezole is not stopping the regurgitation at all lol, though i did have reflux as well! I def want a second opinion but i am in between insurances right now so i am going to have to wait, but thanks for sharing your story i really appreciate it!", "Causes of rumination syndrome? A bit about my experience Hi I have rumination syndrome and it has been improving a lot, especially as I have become more aware as to what it actually is! \n\nI have had it since I was 10-12, and doctors would always say GERD or Acid Reflux. Which was confusing because even ice cream would come back up. When I was 14 or 15 they did an endoscopy (camera down throat), and said they could not find anything bad in my stomach. And so the doctor told me to \u201csuppress it mentally\u201d... teenage me was left a bit disappointed. \n\nIn my first year of uni I had a difficult time despite putting myself out there I struggled to make friends. I mean good compatible friends. I ended up experiencing an eating disorder because I thought my social situation was linked to how I looked. Because of rumination I think it was what is called purging disorder. I was also eating a lot less and walking a lot and doing powerlifting but I lost 10kg in 4 months. I have not gone back to that, but in my 2nd year had a few incidents where I would do that but during parties with alcohol and drinking lots of water. \n\nI found that avoiding problematic foods has been a big help to me in not having food come up. When I do have problem foods/drinks I try to control my breathing. \n\nBut I do not get what caused it? Google says stress? But I was super young when I started having this.", "Let us make the list of the worst food which always come up/ is the worst to regurgitate \n\nmine - nuts/ nut butter, mushrooms, oranges, tomatoes, dough. Ice cream. Every single time. The ones that are bad to bring up imo are orange juice, ice cream, fried egg, milk, and sometimes oaty/wholegrain food comes up really acidic Not a food, but vitamins. Oh yess!  for me it is PPI or other acid reduction medicine. The most disgusting thing i have ever tasted. for me it is also boiled egg but somehow only the egg white. For me it is not that disgusting \ud83d\ude02 bread hurts so bad :/ also really sharp or crunchy crackers/chips. and of course, spicy foods Spicy!! ouch POPCORN. Just the shell shards, oh my days. I find vegetables and fruits awful tbh. Coffee taste is awful. I end up choking on spaghetti. Boiled egg makes me feel really nauseous. Anything acidic or spicy-and obviously the PPI medication. Before I was on PPI meds my regurgitation used to be hugely acidic for a number of reasons so I would try to relieve it with milk-WORST. MISTAKE. EVER. The milk would immediately come back up separated. First the curds which were ok-but then the when which literally tastes of poison.\n\nPeople here have said dough/bread  but tbh for me its the best, it is more likely to stay down and does not have a painful texture or awful taste when coming back up. Personally I would say one of the best things to bring back up is icecream :P Problem is...I do not like icecream.\n\nI do have RS very bad apparently-4-6L a day so EVERYTHING comes up. These are just the worst taste and texture wise for me. Nuts are not even that bad to me, I think meats are the worse, especially pork. \n\nOther than that, definitely things like candy or cake/bread, its always mushy! I also hate when mash potatoes come up. Bread and Nut butters always come up but get stuck in my chest, so painful :( Seems odd to me but foods that are not super processed (in comparison to things like cereal and potato chips) seem to be the worst for me. I love things like apples, homemade hummus, and broccoli, but they my me ruminate every time. Other things (regardless of \"processedness\", and I am aware that is not a word) the make me ruminate are beef, orange juice, bananas, pasta, and of course ice cream. As long as it is the only thing that comes up I... I um do not really mind it either? It rarely, if ever hurts because it is so well, creamy. I think it can even be soothing after you get a spicy dinner up and down. Tastes better than anything else I think of that I ruminate. never thought to sort food in that categories but that is so true!! omg funny but yup, i agree:D Processed meats! Like a sausage - every time. And dairy like ice cream. This is my first post here. I did not realise I had an issue until I read about this and realised it is part of my every day life and has been for over a decade \ud83d\ude1f I know this comment is kind of old now but OML SAME. Popcorn is EVIL milk is DISGUSTING, why do they feel the need? Why does milk curdle? WHY? It is so gross (T ^ T)\n\nAnd the spaghetti proble oh my. With spinach as well, why does it always just come up half way? I should just blend all my meals at this point Trueee Actually good point tho Ice cream (whether it is dairy or vegan) and unhealthful foods with too much oil/grease are the most frequent offenders for me currently. ice cream definitely (although not complaining) and marshmallows always come up. and cake/muffins ! \n\nSame with any type of potatoes like chips and hot chips. \n\nI hate the taste of onions coming back up too!! :/ currently dealing with pizza.... it tastes SO BAD CHEESEBURGERS \ud83e\udd2e AND POPCORN", "Concerns Hi, I am sixteen years old and I am concerned about my eating habits and came on here to figure out if I may have RS.\n\nI do not have any weight issues with myself, I never started throwing up because I dislike my body. I started throwing stuff up when I was a little kid (maybe around 8 years old? Not sure), I am a very picky eater and would get easily full at the dinner table so I would run to the bathroom and throw it up so I could eat more so my family would not yell at me for wasting food. This still goes on to this day, except I do it practically every meal. Even after I take medication I throw it up and re-swallow (Which while yes, disgusting, is probably not good to re-swallow the meds.)\n\nI try to stop sometimes but it just feels... wrong. It feels like my esophagus is just clogged up.\n\nNo one knows that I do this, I do it subconsciously 82% of the time with literally anything I eat.

Along with food water also comes out in my mouth.I am diagnosed with general anxiety disorder as well.Am wondering if water also comes out or not,since nowhere in internet it is been said so. Yes. You can ruminate water. It is not as common as food I believe but definitely possible. I ruminate liquids all the time. I underwent a manometry test for a diagnosis, the doctor asked that instead of the standard way of just swallowing water to be used during the test, that I eat bread throughout. My manometry showed some rumination with water but it was much greater/obvious with the bread. He is new to RS but believes doing the test with liquids is insufficient as it is not quite the same as ruminating food, some people do not ruminate liquids at all. I ruminate much more (or it is a lot harder to keep it down instead of letting it up) when I have a lot of liquids. Water especially. Water is the worst of the liquids for me. \n\nI somehow accidentally adopted burping to keep the food down (as if the air I burp rolls past the food and pushes it down and let us the air up instead)  sometimes I can feel the food come up with the air most of the way before going back down. Sometimes even farther. But most of my rumination has disappeared and been replaced with disgusting burps instead. At least ruminating was quiet. \n\nBut anyways, if I drink water, sometimes even the burps cannot keep it down.

I know the treatment for rumination syndrome is still uncertain, however a lot of what I see says to change your breathing and retrain your stomach.

How long has this been a known thing? I am in my 30s and have literally done this MY ENTIRE LIFE. I have gone to NUMEROUS doctors growing up,(80-90s) and I find out about this from Reddit? (Recently diagnosed with EoE and when I just told my story there someone asked). I am definitely mentioning this to my GI DR. I was misdiagnosed until I was 20 and have had this my whole life. It is so frustrating! Good luck bringing it up to your GI. Seriously, I would describe it to the DR like this: \"You know how a baby would spit up it is food? I still do that. Like just a small mouthful. I can usually tell which food it was (hotdog was a prime suspect because of diet at one point) re-chew and swallow. It is literally been my entire life and it was less socially awkward for me to quickly chew/swallow than get up in the middle of class in elementary school every 10 minutes.

It is just nice to hear from someone who gets it!", "my rumination experience Hii, I have just turned 17 and i have had rumination syndrome since 15. For the first few months I did not really think much of it or notice it, but when I did, and told my parents, they got really worried. Ngl, I initially was quite okay with it. I mean, it meant that whenever I ate something bad, or maybe overate, I could easily just spit it out and it would be as if I never consumed it in the first place. but thing is, now i just really cannot help it - i dont even get to decide or anticipate when it is going to happen or what is going to come up - like salads or fish that is good for me. Of course it comes in handy when it comes to being super full and uncomfy or guilty for eating crap.\n\nFor me, this regurgitation thing is both controllable and uncontrollable. It will come up whenever and I cant control that. However, I sometimes can encourage it to come up myself - which I should not but still do (IDK it just makes me feel better sometimes). When I try to stop it from coming up it is really uncomfortable. It is like a heavy feeling in my throat or chest. Sometimes I cannot tell if it is going to be a burp or actual regurgitation. Also i am one of those people that regurgitate water too :( Another thing- everyone is saying it often happens to them within 10-15 mins after a meal, but for me it can happen anytime. Like even can be the case where my lunch food comes up after dinner. usually the later it happens, it may be slightly more acidic. If it is right after consumption tho, it wont be acidic at all. sometimes i kind of enjoy it. ew it is kind of gross thinking about it.\n\nAnyways, back to my journey, before i had no idea what this thing was, I went to a GI and we spent like thousands of dollars doing all these different things to figure out what it is I have got - like pills, breath test, endoscopy. We found that there was really nothing wrong except for the fact that my throat i think (cannot really remember) was affected but the doctor said it is probably a result of this regurgitation thing - like the acid. He suggested going to see a psychologist cause he said if it is not anything physical, it might be and eating disorder - and i really did not like the sound of that. like i dont want my parents worrying about me having an eating disorder and i felt bad cause i thought it would be another waste of money. So we kind of let it be for the rest of the year but i recently, my parents made me go to visit a psychologist or psychiatrist not sure which\n\nExperience with psychsomething: I basically told her all my personal problems in my life and thoughts on those regurgitation. She concluded that it may be related to me putting too much pressure on myself or stress and that this regurgitation was a way of my body coping or dealing with this pressure.  She described the body as a house - it may look fine from the inside but if theres too much pressure in it, the walls may start to crack a little. This food coming up thing is something my body has learnt. Like it is addicted to it because whenever i do it, it feels like i am releasing pressure (from my chest) so it makes me feel better. In the end, she did not really give me any info on how exactly i was supposed to solve this thing but just to be less hard on myself. I do not think ill be going back again cause i dont think it really was that helpful cause i still dont know what to do. But maybe that may be helpful to some of u guys? not sure.\n\nNow: last night I was regurgitating a TONNE and i was so fed up. I mean i did overeat quite a bit yesterday but still, it was such a hassle to keep getting up to spit it out, and this time the stuff was all mushy thick and gross (sorry if that is tmi). Also i hate having it happen when im around people. first off it is gross, second if it is my parents, they get all worried for me all over again. so i decided to do some research. I ended up finding a bunch of youtube videos and stuff  on rumination syndrome so I feel a lot better cause now i know there are others out there who have the same thing as me :) Anyways, I am determined to get rid of it cause i dont want to have it my whole life. And i figure the later i leave it, the harder it will be to get rid of it. So now i am going to be practicing diaphragmatic breathing as much as possible and eat my food slower. i hope that it will get better and knowing that there are others out there who managed to get rid of it, i feel a lot more hopeful :)\n\nsorry this message is really long - just felt like sharing and it made me feel better to read about others having this rumination thing so i decided to share too Honestly same experience except without all the doctor. It never went away, but I did have some short several long months break from it. I am not how but eventually I found a way to burp in a special way and it keeps it down. Now in at the point when I do not know when I am burping to burp, or burping to keep it down. The only time it really bothers me is when I bend over too fast. Then it comes up without warning. It also led.me.to finding a way to vomit (not just spit up) without using fingers or anything. Literally just muscle control.", "I do not chew or vomit, but I think I might have rumination syndrome? I always thought that maybe my throat does not close all the way or something. I had at one point gone to an ENT doctor as a child but I cannot remember them saying anything important. I do have GERD afaik, since I burp up acidic stuff without taking my pepcid. This has happened as far back as I can remember though; after I eat or drink or anything, a pressure comes in my throat like a burp, but when I try to burp, the undigested food/drink comes with it. \n\nI have never regurgitated into my actual mouth, I have never re-chewed it or vomited it out, I always just swallow it back down. I do not enjoy it, I do not want it in my mouth and I definitely do not want to chew it, it is just an annoyance. If I wanted to spit it out I would have to hack it out like one would do phlegm. It always stops at the back of my throat, if that makes sense? \n\nI have mentioned it to my doctor, but I am pretty sure she just thinks it is GERD, - but I am always paranoid of that fucking up my esophagus or my teeth (even though it does not go in my mouth). I am going to try to practice the tips in this sub and see if it helps. Do you have acid in your cud? If it does not go into the mouth, it is GERD my dude.

For the past few days it has felt as if there is something in my chest area and that it makes it slightly hard to breathe. Like I cannot get a completely satisfying breath. Lmk if anyone has had this ! Thanks! I guess no one has, sorry. I have never heard of this. Seeing as this is only the past few days I would imagine it is unrelated (assuming you have had RS for a while.) Perhaps you should go and see a doctor. I hope you are alright :) Yes! I totally have, and it is been leading to a ton of anxiety surrounding my breathing and heart. I have got some other conditions that could influence this too, though, so i am not sure if it is totally the RS. Any chance you have experienced weirdness with your heart/rate or blood sugar?? I usually get symptoms that make it feel like I am about to burp, they can last for 20 minutes. So far I have had 2-3 panic attacks due to this thinking it is something to do with my breathing. I have it as well! I honestly could not even think that anyone else could have this combo. I previously thought that it was Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and as I have discovered just now that I probably have RS (as I have all of the exact symptoms, will probably double check that w a doc). I dunno if that can help\nor anything, I mean when I went to the doc regarding RS he pretty much told me nothing, did a gastroscopy and said it was all fine (except one thing but it was like that only bc of my purging problems at that time) \nI honestly did not even think that anyone else than me has it\nbecause no one has heard of that or whatsoever \nand I just started dealing w it as it was just a daily normal thing\nas I said, I will definitely see a doctor regarding that\nbecause that is..... weird\nin a bad way Yeah sometimes I feel like I can get a \"deep\" breath, it is so awful. I just learned about diaphragmatic breathing today, and breathing through my stomach is actually helping a bit! You are def not alone!!", "My RS Experience, what is yours? I just found this sub, but I have had RS for as long as I can remember. I have been able to figure out the main food groups that always triggers ruminating. Dairy, meat, grains, hard fruit(apples only really), and oil/grease. Everything else outside of that can trigger, but mostly only in large volumes. Ice cream is my favorite, taco bell is the worst lol. \n\nWhen I was young, it was constant. But I was a stressed out miserable little kid. Bad past, and when I was adopted, I was incapable of actually connecting to anyone as family. I phrased the family experience as, Outside the window looking in. (This was figurative, but sometimes literal) Eventually, I chose to enlist to make sure I still had a future when my parents kicked me out. During those five years, I made tremendous progress in growing in myself mentally, and understanding ways I worked emotionally. Eventually I even grew to learn to be social. Invested. Interested. \n\nDuring that time. I have no idea when the vaaaassst majority of my RS disappeared. But I did not even realize (except those rare moments I ate too much)  that it was gone until it came back nearly full force. \n\nI saw some threads that talked about varying levels of control over it. When RS is at its worst for me, I found I can sometimes help or stop the \"hesitant\" mouthfuls. But if I do help, or if it is not controllable, it does not stop for awhile varying every 5-15 minutes for the first 30 minutes, to an hour. And then it starts to wane down, taking longer in between til it tapers off.  Somewhere between 2-4 hours, with a few times getting up to 6 or 7. If I do not help the hesitant ones, it will go both ways of either happening anyways but sometimes painfully slow, or not at all. \n\nThe uncontrollable ones are much faster. A lot harder to keep everything from jettisoning out. So gross. This one I have to attack with gulps of air and subsequent burps, so gross too, but somehow I can hold the food down while burping so less gross socially. Until I thankfully rarely fail to hold it down and liquids with small chunks comes up. Then the burp gargles. Ugh. \n\nLast but definitely not least, the relaxed one. This one is weird because I do not feel it or think about it until all of sudden, it just shows up in my mouth. These ones are somehow gentle? And front have any inertia behind them. If I had to say something stupid. It literally just materializes on my tongue. Chewing this one is comfortable, easy and tastes the best for the longest. But it also goes back down easy if I chose not to chew it again. (This is also the only one I do not have to chew again in order for it all to go back down)\n\nThis one is also the only one I identified the main food triggers for the relaxing RS. Mostly bread or any thick/soft foods. But mostly just bread. \n\nI wanted to share this in more detail so I could see if anyone else experienced the same or, if not, what you go through? For me, everything triggers it. Drinks, food, you name it, I have ruminated it. Any ritualistic behaviours you learned to control it? I started taking Lexapro, this is an antidepressant, so you should consider different options first. I just found this sub too, hence the super late comment.\n\nMy experience is long and complicated. Usually thin liquids, candy, and protein bars in very limited amounts will not induce rumination, but sometimes they will. Even a bite of solids will induce rumination for hours (constant, multiple times a minute) until I finally spit it out. I survive on a liquid diet, and used to be tube fed through a j tube but that made it even worse. While being tube fed, I regurgitate everything, even if npo I will regurgitate the acid/ bile in my stomach and cannot even sip fluids. I have a g tube to drain my stomach when I accidentally drink more than my body can keep down, but it can only drain if I have not consumed any solids, so I can only eat solids of I accept the hours of rumination. Still, I feel intense pain/ nausea by the end of the day if I do not \"allow\" myself to ruminate, so I usually give in and ruminate for a few hours so that I can actually go to bed. It kind of sucks, but I am used to it.\n\nI have had rumination syndrome for 8 years and have been to nationwide children's hospital for their rumination program, and have tried countless therapies, medications, acupuncture and have had so many doctors who have been mystified. I also have gastroparesis, which complicates matters. I am so sorry. That is such a rough hand to be dealing with", "smoking weed I smoked the other day and it was one of the only times I did not ruminate.  Is this the case for anyone else?", "Returning with stress? I was diagnosed with RS after dozens of misdiagnoses and tests back when I was 17, right after a traumatic event. Well eventually it went away and I assumed it was just a stress reaction. Well low and behold now at 26 I am dealing with it again. Is this common to come and go? I assumed I was in the clear after almost a decade of no symptoms and now I am panicked about going back to where I was in high school. I have not had it come and go- it is been constant for over 10 years now. I do however find that it flares up with stress. I have learnt to keep my rumination down better with diaphragmatic breathing but when I am very stressed then it is a lot harder to keep down.\n\nI recommend diaphragmatic breathing (it is tough to get the hang of, but after consistent practice it helps!) and actively working on self-care and trying to manage the stress in your life to the best of your ability.\n\nGood luck, we are here for you :) For me, my rumination has never really gone away! I am so sorry you have to go through this experience again. Diaphramatic breathing is said to help. I have also found practicing mindfulness around digestion can be effective at times as well. I hope you are able to find a way to get some relief from this!", "So glad I found this sub I *just* heard rumination syndrome for the first time ever. I am at 23F and I have had RS for as long as I can remember. I am 100000% certain. After everything I eat since I was a baby, I throw it up. I learned at a very young age to swallow it so I did not disrupt my day. Sometimes when I was in grade school I would do it publicly so I could go home for the day (oops lol) It is not painful, there is no discomfort. It tastes like it did ten minutes before. I always chew it back up and swallow it again. I have never told a soul about it. My mom is dead so I cannot ask her about the details from when I was little, but I went to so many GI doctors and they just said it acid reflex. I got prescribed prevacid and I never brought it back up to my mom. This is so crazy. I really thought I was going to take this to the grave. It is so amazing to know that it has a name and there are potentially ways to make it stop. What do I do next? since you have an idea of what it is and reasons to back it up, i would consult your doctor. they may be able to prescribe something to help or teach you some ways to deal with it. good luck! Welcome to the sub!\n\nIt is crazy how similar our stories are. I would do the exact same thing to get off of school sometimes, and even though I did not bring up much food the school nurses still thought it was sick and sent me home. Your experience is identical to mine and I was also misdiagnosed with acid reflux for 5+ years. I nearly went through with a horrible surgery for it.\n\nI am sorry to let you do not like this, but as of yet there is no cure for rumination syndrome. There is not a special pill of surgery because RS is a subconscious habit of the body, so you have to train your body out of it. To do this, we learn diaphragmatic breathing. It helps us relax and control the muscles that we subconsciously tense to cause rumination. I have been doing it for years and I am very good at it, so I can speak for it is efficacy:\n\nMost of the time, if I do not want to ruminate I can start diaphragmatic breathing and I can just about keep my food down. I can do DB for ages on end whether sitting or standing or laying down, so it is really useful for social events like parties and dinners out. It reduces my anxiety around it because I know I can keep it down.\nSometimes though, DB does not work as well, for example if I am distressed. When I am stressed I ruminate a lot more often, and when I am upset I cannot keep it down. Still, the fact that rumination is far less common for me and can be controlled makes it worth it. DB can be hard to get a grip on at first, but with practice it becomes second nature and it is really easy, and you can get a lot more air in. I really recommend learning it. You could try YouTube videos but I had a friend who was into mindfulness and yoga who taught me.\n\nGood luck, we are here for you :) I just found out about this place this is epic", "My doctor has certified I do not have bulimia. I voluntarily and sometimes involuntarily bring up food, chew it and eat it again. I do not binge eat or throw up and hence, I have been not diagnosed as bulimic. But while regurgitating food, often my heart flutters, shortness of breath happens and chest and shoulder pain happens.\nIs it due to the acid coming up? Also, since my doctor told that bulimics only have heart issues if they throw up due to loss of electrolytes but since I do not throw up and the esophagus and the regurgitation is part of the digestive system, it should not affect the heart right? Get a bloody diagnosis you do not have RS. You are forcefully making yourself regurgitate. That is not RS. That is a step away from bulimia as I said in the multiple threads you have posted and deleted here. U r not a doctor\nMy doctoe said I do not have bulimia so Ps I cannot see you posted but I blocked you but I can see the first line as a notification came up. You do not have rumination syndrome. You are right I am not a doctor, I never said you had bulimia either I said you are a step away from it and likely have EDNOS/OSFED. I am a scientist, I studied nutrition in large detail in University and was one of the 7 people out of 150 people in the class who got an A, I studied it in much more than my friends who were doing their medical training/are now doctors. R.S is an involuntary action, what you do is voluntary and is putting strain on your heart forcing food up when it does not come up. Freshly eaten food will not be too acidic. Go to an ED page for EDNOS they are more likely to resonate with your condition than people here.\n\nYou span this forum when you do not even have R.S and your symptoms do not align with RS.", "Hi So here I am. I never realized this was a rare thing. I thought I just did it because it tastes good. TIL it is called RS. I think I have always done this. My teeth are okay ( my dentist asked if I like eating citrus but says there is nothing seriously wrong with my teeth), I do not have heartburn (I did when I was a teenager). Today I was looking for causes of Eustachian tube disfunction and this came up. Anybody else here have Eustachian tube disfunction?\n\nI always thought this was a voluntary thing. Can I stop? \"I always thought this was a voluntary thing. Can I stop?\"\n\nTry it and you will discover the answer soon enough. Not easy then? Do people ever just stop? It varies per person. Some people have voluntary control over it, many do not. Only one way to find out which group you are in: do not do it, and see if you belly obeys. If you have perfect control, you do not have rumination syndrome. After one slice of toast and a bowel of fruit it is a little hard to stop. I want to burp and if I do the food comes up too. I see. What if you resist the urge to burp? How does your belly feel? d/p I have had a few big meals now and I have to make a conscious effort not to throw up for a couple of hours after eating. It feels like there is pressure under my diaphragm, and a kind of acidic feeling. I threw up a little after eating fried rice and stir fry for dinner. For my whole life I have mostly just let happen. I am trying to stop because there is a chance it is leading to chronic middle ear infections. Interesting! Good to hear you have it somewhat under control. Most people do not. The feeling of pressure thing seems very common:\n\n(\n\nA theory is that it is an unconscious strategy to relief excessive tension from the stomach/belly area. What causes that tension is a mystery, although for many people it seems related to stress/anxiety/eating disorders. Thanks. I need to explain this to my ENT doctor so the image you posted helps.\nI did used to throw up into the toilet when I was a teenager and I felt it was a disorder but eventually I went back to just swallowing. I developed a dysfunctional Eustachian tube in early childhood and read that that can be caused by GERD, which made me think it might have been caused by my throwing up every meal, and a little research led me here. I do not actually mind throwing up other than the social awkwardness of being caught out chewing pizza half an hour after the meal has finished. I do mind having middle ear infections so I want to try controlling the RS and see if that helps preventing me getting sick.", "I voluntary regurgitate food, chew and swallow it again. Like I suffer from rumination syndrome. Food comes up, I chew it and swallow it again\nAt that time, obviously acid comes up and my heart flutters and I have a fast rate.\nVibrations and fluttering occurs too.\nSo I wanted to know if its just the acid that is causing it, the pain and fluttering and palpitations or it is anything to do with the heart valves and blood flow or any heart disease?", "So, how long do you generally regurgitate food after a meal. Also how many meals and times a day?  Over 2 hours. Way more if I do not spit it out. The one benefit is that I can eat a shit ton and not gain much weight so I do eat pretty often tbh. But if I fall asleep before I am done regurgitating I wake up horrendously bloated and feeling like utter crap and start regurgitating again, so like the half digested chicken or sushi from last night starts coming back up at 8 am, it will not fully come up so I end up uncomfortably bloated all day. After I finish eating, I voluntarily regurgitate my food. But that often leads to me getting out of breath and chest pain. Also, that increases my heart rate and causes bloating? Why is that so? My thing is completely involuntary. You could be doing bad damage to your heart perhaps, I k ow it is common enough for bulimics to end up with heart problems, the loss of electrolytes is not good. Tbh if you are doing this voluntarily I do not think this is rumination syndrome. I do not throw up\nI chew and swallow again\nI am not bulimic though Also rumination syndrome is supposed to be voluntary Bulimics voluntarily purge themselves of food (via purging mostly) that is why I made the reference. Rumination syndrome is an involuntary reaction. It depends, maybe 1 or two hours. It depends mostly if I am with people or not. I regurgitate every meal. It is really not. As told by by my doctors and the many many many scientific articles I have read about it. Have you been diagnosed by a specialist? But I do not throw up so no loss of electrolytes. So if I do not throw up and purge and swallow and eat it again, that will not lead to heart issues? You are putting strain on your heart just by forcing your body to do that. So even if it is not a loss of electrolytes it is exactly a healthy behavior. I would say if you are having chest pains to go see a doctor to rule out anything serious. Chest pain can be due to acid coming up right?\nI am just yanking whether it is damaging the heart or no?\nI mean, I do not vomit it out, i bring it up  chew and swallow again Go to a doctor. This is not healthy. You only get one heart: cardiac tissue does not replicate like the other tissues in your body, the heart you have at 18 is the same heart you have at 80, damage is permanent. It is like the enamel on your teeth, you only get one heart so you better look after it. Anything related to chest pain should be seen by a medical professional, and also I doubt it is acid if it is freshly eaten. GO. TO. A. DOCTOR. Tell them everything they need to know everything to make a diagnosis and not give you an incorrect diagnosis.\n\nEDIT; I see you posted a question about heart rate on the forum. Dude, you do not have RS. You have what seems to be EDNOS/OSFED. Forcing your body to fight it is natural instincts is going to put strain on your heart. Youll end up weakening your muscles and giving yourself arrhythmia. Go to a doctor, any chest pain should be investigated by a medical professional. Sincerely someone who has had multiple family members DIE from unknown/undiagnosed heart problems. I used to work for many years with a company that specialises in cardiac health, damage to your heart is permanent. Go. To. A. Doctor. Reddit is not where you should be getting your medical information from.

We cannot diagnose you here so I would suggest going to a GP or gastroenterologist explaining these symptoms and pointing out you think it is RS. ", "I have had rumination syndrome for over 15 years I am 25 years old now &amp; I have had rumination syndrome for at least since I was about 7 or 8.  I do not know how it happened or exactly when but I just remember being in school &amp; thinking God somehow made me wrong.  I had very bad anxiety &amp; depression before the symptoms started and that just made it even worst.  When I went to the doctor when I was younger I did not know what it was and when I explained it to the doctor he gave me a bucket to throw up in... but it did not happen.  At that time I did not know that I had to eat first, so I went there on an empty stomach and he just looked at the 7 year old me &amp; insinuated I was faking it.  Even my mother thought at a point in time that I was doing it for attention but yet I did not understand why it was happening.  Why did I have to force my food down for about an hour or 2 after every meal.  It is kind of like experiencing a burp or sneeze, that uncomfortable feeling if you do not release that tension in your body.  Even now when I explain it to people I let them know that I force the food down but really the majority of the time I still rechew it and swallow it.  I lie because it is gross.  Most people do not know this about me but those who do I tend to try to not gross them out.  I want help and if I talked to a doctor I of course would tell them the truth but I heard it is very expensive to fix.  I found myself drinking a lot more than I should because for some odd reason when I am drunk and I eat, the rumination stops with the anxiety.  I just recently stopped drinking because I do not want to use it as a crutch and have to be drunk on a daily basis... not what I want for myself.  But I just wanted to give my story with people who experience this problem.  To this day I still need help &amp; just want people to know that you are not alone. Thanks for telling your story. I am sorry it is causing you so much shame and anxiety.", "Need some help in diagnosis Hi, 19M here having rumination syndrome. What i have is clearly rumination and not acid reflux.\n I have recently discovered this term and started to practice diaphragmic breathing. I have noticed that my stomach just does not clear quickly. The liquid from the day before can stay in my stomach until the next morning where i just regurgigate it up, my stomach just feels very full as if there is something blocking water from flowing into my small intestine. anyone else experience this? Why is this happening? \n\nI did a gastroscope/colonoscopy half a year ago and both turned out fine. No one on this sub can diagnose you, but if you think you have rumination then you are probably right- we always get misdiagnosed. I was also diagnosed with acid reflux (despite insisting I get little to no acid) and I had a colonoscopy which came up with nothing.\n\nI do find that I can bring food up from a couple hours before, but I do not think a whole day. I do not always pay attention though. \n\nOther than that, I cannot really relate to the small intestine thing. The only time I feel really full is when I have eaten a bit too much haha.", "Diaphragmatic Breathing Not Working; What Next BTW I live n a shitty country where NO ONE not even the specialists have heard of RS-no one could direct me to anyone who could show me how to do diaphragmatic breathing so I learned online. Anyways no improvement later, where do I go from here-my 'road to recovery' is 100% self directed. I regurgitate up to 6L  a day so its A LOT. My GF suffers from RS as well, and getting help from the medical world has been completely useless so far.\n\nWhat does work temporarily is cold showers, as the cold shock overwhelms the system and relieves the tension in the stomach somewhat. \n\nWeed &amp; alcohol also bring tension down, making it easier to swallow stuff back.\n\nWe are experimenting with everything there is to see what helps, I will make a larger post later. Try Amitriptyline for 3 months that is what I was prescribed by my GI and it has helped a lot. I am from the U.S., Massachusetts.", "Have some questions This sounds so gross, but I have been ruminating after meals for almost 6 months now. I am 18 (in high school) and live with my parents and they are really worried about me and get upset with me after making messes. Ruminating does not hurt, and the food does not taste like acid, but it is the inconvenience that is really causing problems for me. Because I am losing the food that I eat I have been eating really large amounts of too compensate for the lost calories, but it is making it worse. I am also a competitive athlete and it is getting in the way, so when I am practicing I try not to eat before. Does eating smaller meals help? Do you have any advice for not making such a mess? I also cannot get myself to stop eating so much because I have lost weight and I am now accustomed to eating 3,000- 4,000 (not normal I am 115 pounds). The breathing helps a little bit but once I stop breathing I feel it coming back. When is a good time to drink water? Sometimes I even ruminate water which is really weird. Do you spit out everything you ruminate?If you do I am not sure what you can do about that part of the problem? ^((I am use to never spitting out something unless it changes to a texture that makes re-eating it unappealing. Most food I eat never get to that point.))\n\nYou might want to stick to foods you know do not trigger your rumination as much as others, and make that the majority of the foods you eat if possible?\n\nSmaller meal size does not effects things for mine, everyone is different though, so might be worth a try for you!\n\nYou might want to try eating your food with something bitter that you cannot stand on your tongue with your meals and see if that can help.For me if I take a Cayenne Pepper Capsule (says you can take them 3 times a day but not to take them more then that.), almost always prevents the cycle for me. (It will start, but it is like when the capsule has disintegrated enough, and the contents come up, I cannot stand that on my tongue, so usually it stops the rumination without trying.)But if you do not mind spicy things, I am sure there is got to be something that comes in a capsule that you cannot tolerate.\\~\n\nHope you find something that works for you!\n\nReally think you should be seeing a doctor to get everything checked out though and almost wonder if maybe you should see about getting a feeding tube? Might be simpler then eating that many calories everyday, and then I think it would take away the mess issue? Not sure as I do not know about how those work.\\~ I think this sounds like it may be bulimia. Source: am bulimic with rumination syndrome. I do not think it is bulimia. The difference is bringing up food because of RS and not being able to control it vs using RS to encourage it to come up. Source: was bullimic with rumination syndrome. \n\nReally OP is the only one who knows if it is bulimia, or bulimia and RS, or just RS. I do not think they would be asking for help though if they wanted to be bringing up their food. When you say making messes, do you mean it comes out of your mouth and you cannot stop it? RS can be more forceful sometimes but generally (as far as I know with the little information available) it just comes up and the person either re-swallows or spits it out.\n\nI have tried smaller meals before, for me it does not actually stop regurgitation, but it can be easier to keep my food down when I have eaten a smaller amount. Breathing helps but of course is only a solution in that very moment, definitely not a cure unfortunately. I have heard muscle relaxers suggested but they do not sound particularly effective. \n\nI really do not encourage eating excessively as this will only make it worse. I always find I ruminate much more frequently and strongly when I have over-eaten. You do need to try to stay healthy though. To do this I would recommend eating meals high in energy but small in size. Something jam-packed with energy. Like tofu or some kind of good meat. Also a protein powder could be mixed into smoothies. I know liquid also comes up which is really random, but it is just a way you could squeeze those calories in without filling up too much.\n\nAlso, if you have just been ruminating and you really feel like you need another meal, do some breathing and wait a little bit. There is no science behind this but I have found that the body will chuck up food faster if I eat after just spitting out all my regurgitation. Almost as if the body is still in the habit. I am not sure if that makes any sense at all but that is what I have gathered from experience.\n\nApart from that, welcome to the gang! We are always here if you need us and not just for advice, but support too. :) Yes, I see your point. Op is asking for help. I assumed it was bulimia when I read OP was losing the food. I understood that with the rumination you rechew and swallow food. Is this not the case? I am just starting to learn about this as a syndrome even though I have done this behavior on and off since elementary school! I have not acted on my bulimia (not purged) in almost a year. However,  I have had a huge increase in how often I am  regurgitating and re-swallowing since I stopped purging. I noticed you used the past tense that you WERE a bulimic. Do you believe you are not anymore? I am genuinely curious because I feel like I will always be a bulimic, even if I am not getting rid of the food. I have had a pretty severe case and for a VERY long time though. How did you stop binging and purging? (I dont mean to take over OP's post here I am just curious. Well, rumination syndrome in itself is just the food coming back up into your mouth. It is up to the person what they do with it, depending on different situations, different people chose to deal with it differently. Some people chew and/or re-swallow, some spit it out and others could use that opportunity to encourage more to come up and get out as much as possible as I did. \n\nTo be honest, I did not really recover from bulimia as after that I was anorexic, but I got out form that by getting binge eating disorder. So never really cured as such but finally I have gotten my eating under control and am managing my weight in a healthy and positive way. It is about metal health just as much as physical health.\n\nYou describe RS as a \u201cbehaviour\u201d, which intrigues me. Yes in cases like bulimia regurgitation of food is voluntary, but with rumination syndrome it is not. One could go though periods of encouraging the food to come up or trying to stop it, but no matter what the person will always be ruminating. It is practically effortless.\n\nI am not bulimic anymore as I no longer run to the bathroom at the first feeling of food coming up and try to throw up as much as possible. I got quite good at encouraging the food to come up. For me, it was like once the first but of food came up I could catch the (metaphorical) string and keep pulling and pulling until it did not work anymore. I really do not recommend this as it is not healthy in any way. It is definitely not a long-term weight loss/management solution.\n\nCongratulations on not purging in so long. You should be really proud of yourself! I hope you can keep taking positive steps to help yourself. When i was reading that i even thought i wrote that (it sounds weird but i recently had pretty bad memory:D) \nI would say that you need to find some foods that you do not regurgitate (it is hard i know just eat various food now and you will find it) and also try not to consume too much heavy food like fat or protein but more carbs.   At least it helped me a little. It is sad bc as athlete you need them (maybe protein powder will be better? this came up just now to me, i will try it.) I think you should also not move after meals a lot and yes! you need to eat small portion but often. \nI would also recommend you get some psychotherapy if you can afford that. Interesting. I misunderstood. Are you saying that with Rumination syndrome the food just comes up all on its own without you expecting it? I do it over and over after I eat but I feel like I am causing it. I think I use my stomach muscles? I guess this is why I call it behavior. It is quite easy for me to do but I hate that I do it. I have assumed it it was due to   years of repetitive purging. I did it then also but now I refuse to spit it out. I say I am not active in my bulimia because I fon't get rid of the food but in all honesty it seems like a pretty fine line to me. Interesting.

I say I am not active in my bulimia because I do not get rid of the food but in all honesty it seems like a pretty fine line to me.\nI too have had a variety of disordered eating. I have restricted for a few years here and there, binged a few years at a time, and binged and purged. The latter has been (by far) the absolute most severe. So I am hoping that the fact I am at least swallowing the food again is a step in the right direction? Thanks for the congratulations! It is been a struggle. Yes, I see why it could be confusing. I find that sometimes I cannot feel it coming, but other times I do notice my stomach tensing. It makes sense that you may think this is your fault and therefore is a form of bullimia but RS is a subconscious habit of the body. I think this is clear when you think about it as with RS you do not have control of the tension in your stomach. You can ease it with various methods but it is never initially tensed by a conscious descision, if that makes sense. Your stomach just tenses and brings up food on it is own.\n\nI personally would not call it a fine line, because I think the difference is simply in mindset. Really, it does not matter if you spit some out sometimes or always swallow, if you are not doing it to purge then I would not class this as bullimia. If you are spitting out large amounts and encouraging more to come up (if you can do this) to get rid of as much as possible to lose weight or other related reasons then yes I would class this as bullimia.\n\nWhat you are doing is definitely a step in the right direction and it is great that you are doing it? For people who suffer/ have suffered from eating disorders, RS is almost more dangerous as there is always the temptation to use it to purge. When you are trying not to purge and the food jut comes up on its own, it is like that little part of your mind telling you to purge gets fuelled as you are already half way there, which is why it shows you are so strong to not give in and swallow it instead, or to spit it out in moderation.\n\nI think it is important to be proud of every step you make because it can feel like a long journey but it is so so important for your wellbeing. :) Thank you so much for sharing this info...and for your kind, encouraging words. :)", "Why and how did it start? I remember I used to eat whatever and never ever have this issue. I miss eating without the need to throw it back up or burp. I am trying to remember when exactly it started. I have no clue why. Just wondering about when it started for you? Trying to find what triggered it for me It was trauma and then a really bad stomach bug for me I had it since I was born but I have learnt to control it from a young age. However there was a huge gap and started resurfacing when I was facing a lot of stress. I try to avoid the toilets because it triggers my rumination, but some foods may also make you ruminate. It probably started just a bit for you and then gradually became more of a problem as it started to disrupt your life. Try to look at when you suddenly maintained or dropped weight, that should somehow give you a sense of when it started. Or you could find what food makes you ruminate most and when it started becoming part of your diet", "Dont hiccups suck guys Anyone else have those hiccups that just shake your whole body and you completely loose your control of your stomach contents.

This may be wrong but i have a feeling that when people find out about this it just all clicks in their heads and an entire previous life of misunderstanding is freed from their mind. I have control over it sometimes but it seems like it takes alot of conscious effort to keep it down. But it feels so nice to talk to people who arent grossed out about this!!

TBH I think the ED was what caused me to get RS as I used to be a bigger kid and did not have it, then ate restrictively, then as I came out of the ED I began ruminating, possibly due to my body not being suited to it. Problem is, I have been well out of my former malnutrition for many months and still seem to ruminate more than ever, so I think my rumination is due to the throat muscles or whatever being so used to letting stuff back out. that is interesting, i have never heard of RS being caused by anything in particular. i am glad you are out of your malnutrition / restriction pattern, that is not easy -- have you tried diaphragmatic breathing? it is supposed to be the one thing that can teach your body to stop ruminating Diaphragmatic Breathing actually has the opposite effect, causing things to come back up, however expelling as much air as possible and taking deep swallows when I feel rumination coming does work. Also, alot of DB tutorials suggest lying down, but I find it magnitudes easier to come when standing as you let gravity do the work", "I bring food up intentionally by force and on command, rechew it and swallow and eat it again. Why am I losing weight still even if I am not throwing up? Also, why is it not affecting my heart even though the heart rate increases and pain happens?  Why are you bringing up food intentionally? I think you are losing wait, because by rechewing and swallowing, you trick your mind into thinking you are eating and so you probably miss a hunger cue or two. We generally have strong hearts. If this is a recent occurrence, then it possibly has nothing to do with the heart but rather, the pain is the result of the food rushing up the esophagus, leaving chest burn and breathlessness, as it took an influx of energy to carry it out I throw some up and am still gaining.

I am desperate.", "Followup: 3 months post tele-medical diaphragmatic therapy. I am posting to update here after my daughter (12F) was diagnosed last Fall (2020) and then received about 12 weeks of therapy (once a week) with a clinical pediatric psych who specializes in rumination syndrome &amp; similar issues. The focus was on the triggers and using diaphragmatic control to stop the rumination events. \n\nMy daughter is not \u201ccured\u201d but is doing *much* better. People who never knew would never realize now what she is dealing with, which is great as she plans to return to school in-person this Fall. I think she was a fairly moderate RS case overall. (I am certainly not an expert by any means.) She was almost never forced to expel, but ruminating at *every meal* at least 5-6 events during/after eating. She could not ever drink while eating without expelling. \n\nShe is now able to control all the rumination \u201curges/warnings\u201d or she calls them \u201cfeelings\u201d at nearly all her meals. She still does not drink while eating as she finds it to be too distracting. \nIf she accidentally eats *very* spicy food or eats very quickly she has a harder time and has to pay special attention when \u201cdistracted\u201d while eating. Recent flare up example was at a restaurant meal with a friend of hers - she was too excited to be with her friend and was just not paying enough attention to her intake/breathing. \n\nI know medical intervention either to be formally diagnosed or treated with this type of therapy is not available to everyone, but I wanted to share our success with the diaphragmatic therapy after a short period of rumination (less than 1 year). I truly hope this helps others feel that there is a method that may also work for them. Health insurance \u201ccovered\u201d the diagnosis appointment + therapy sessions to the tune of leaving me with bills of about $1200 out of pocket (yay, America). Good for her :)\n\nCan you tell us more about the exact skills she learned? Thank you for sharing! How did you find this specialist? It does not feel like something I can go to a normal therapist for help with, and I do not know how to find a specialist. Our Pediatrician referred us to a pediatric gastroenterologist. The gastro was able to diagnose her nearly immediately (what a relief!) and they partner with the psych when they encounter these type of diagnoses.", "What is something we all have in common? I am looking for the one thing we all share. If we can find that surely they can find the cure. For example, I am depressed and have anxiety, am slightly on the obesity scale, sit and use the computer all day, and generally act like a depressed towel. Do you have anything in common with this? I used to be depressed, I had severe anxiety but now it is a lot better. It has been found that rumination syndrome patients tend to have one of these conditions. Depression/anxiety however are not the cause of RS, they are a symptom. RS occurs due to contractions of the abdominal muscles, so the best way to treat it is to make them relax. So far the best method is diaphragmatic breathing. There are also muscle relaxants but I have not heard they are as effective. I have found diaphragmatic breathing to be very effective after a lot of practice.\n\nThis is not something that can really be cured with a pill or injection, seeing as it is a subconscious habit of the body. The only thing is habit-reversal and removing day-to-day stresses which make rumination worse (in my experience).\n\nI am no doctor or scientist, but that is my take. However, just because there is no magic pill, it does not mean you should get disheartened or lose faith. You can work to change your body\u2019s habits and improve your condition. RS is not the end of the world :) I have OCD (pure o) some childhood trauma and everything that comes along that nice combo (anxiety, panic attacks sometimes).\n\nI am currently doing meditation and running in order to see if lowering my stress may have an effect on rumination. Problem is that ruminating often makes me really stressed so it is pretty difficult. hmmm, maybe this shit's anxiety related. I also experienced a lot of anxiety. I feel pretty bad for you. What are your compulsions? I think I read somewhere that it is very common that people with rumination are depressed/anxious. My ocd started out as harm ocd and since then I have dabbled in existential ocd a little bit. I pretty much never get anxious about those kinds of thoughts anymore. These days I mostly just have health anxiety and panic attack symptoms related to that. Basically since COVID hit I have been worrying more and more that sensations and symptoms that I get from rumination would be related to COVID and that I am going to die haha. It is basically all just ocd to me though, so the way to get better is always the same - exposure. I really wish this rumination bullshit could go away though, I also have IBS \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude02", "Any bulimics with RS struggling with feeling \"fake\"? I know that some bulimics also struggle with RS so I am wondering if anyone else can relate to this experience. I would like to add a trigger-warning since this is not an easy thing to discuss - especially not for people with/recovering from an ED. If this is too hard to talk about, definitely feel free to skip this one.\n\nCutting to the chase - I have had RS for as long as I can remember. Growing up, it would not happen at every meal, but certain foods or situations would trigger it. I was a chubby kid/teen, but went on an extreme diet in my early 20's. I ended up losing a lot of weight but then started having a hard time letting go of the diet again. Soon I realized I could take advantage of my RS by knowing what triggered it, and \"undo\" what I had eaten by doing just that. For example, I knew that eating large portions of food/drinking a lot of liquid would make me ruminate. So I started eating just one giant meal a day that I would eventually \"throw up\" through rumination. I knew that the carbonation in soda would help \"push\" the food back up, so I stopped drinking water and only drank diet coke. I found that rumination was much easier and more comfortable than conventional puking. In the beginning, things were pretty good - I could eat as much as I wanted and then relatively effortlessly get rid of it again. But the downside was that I would sometimes spend 1-2 hours slowly throwing up a meal. I would cancel social plans in the evening, because I would spent most of it spitting up food alone in my room. Eating became shameful, something I only did in private. The giant binge made me feel disgusting and spending hours afterwards slowly throwing up my meal felt even worse. Eventually I felt myself losing control of my body (ruminating without triggers or when burping/hiccupping) and realized I needed to start fixing things. \n\nI have spent the past 3 years trying to recover and it is actually going pretty ok. I still have bad days, but they are getting increasingly rare. I now actively avoid my trigger foods and try to space out my meals rather than having one giant one, which helps. However, I always felt like I was not a \"real\" bulimic because I never puked in a conventional way. I even went to see a doctor to discuss my ED and I felt like I was lying to her because I never stuck my fingers down my throat to puke. Calling myself a bulimic always felt like such a scam, but I never knew how else to define what I was going through. Did everyone else here experience something similar? I did the same thing as a teenager. During meals I would eat to my heart\u2019s content, then get nervous and vanish to the bathroom to bring as much as I could up. And I know exactly how you feel in regards to being a \u201cfake\u201d bulimic. I hear you. It is real.\n\nIn the end I did an exchange program and did not want to waste my host family\u2019s food so I forced myself to stop. That was the start of another difficult journey. As far as losing weight now I just try to identify things that I can cut out of my diet and not snack between meals. Just simple things like keeping milk out of coffee and eating dry toast etc. I felt and feel the exact same way. To say I have struggled with an ED makes me feel really guilty because I feel like I was not \u2018properly\u2019 bullemic or \u2018properly\u2019 anorexic, but at the end of the day I had disordered eating and an unhealthy habit with my body, and all our struggles are valid. Just because it does not fit the default mould does not mean it did not happen.\n\nI have a really good relationship with food now (eating what I want, but binge eating or starving myself, having regular meals that make me feel good etc) and my relationship with my body has also improved. For anyone stuck in a rut right now, you can get through it, and it will be okay :) Same. I have had RS for as long as I can remember, and in high school I developed some disordered eating problems. I starved all day until dinner and then drank a bunch of water and went for a run to get everything out.\n\nI did not really think about it then, but later when I started therapy and meds in college (for a whole bunch of other psych stuff), I just told everyone I had struggled with bulimia because it is so much easier to explain. I been looking for this... I know I have rumination, as a kid I always brought food back to chew it again, my breath would always smell bad, It was embarrassing. But recently I been using it to puke it whenever I felt stress over my weight. It is so easy to abuse, it takes no effort to do it. I feel stress, I binge, puke it 5 or more times. I been diagnosed with bulimia, I am now trying get help, but it really does feel like it is fake and I am lying.  \n\nI am getting surgery for my teeth next year, get my extra tooth and my wisdom teeth out, and I need braces. It really has ruin my teeth. I am like fuck, my life is scary rn... high anxiety and bad depression, I am like really trap. Just turn 17 scared to be an adult... scared to even drive. But I am still trying my best...", "Anyone else ever eat spicey food, and then ruminate and it goes up their nose? It is a bit of an odd post, but sometimes if I spit it out I lean forwards and it goes up my nose and OH DOES IT BURN! It is my fault for putting chillies in everything, really (T-T) Me with wasabi earlier today \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude02", "How to support a friend Hi everyone! A friend of mine's doctors suspect that she might have rumination syndrome. How can we support her at this time/if she gets a diagnosis? i am also in this situation, however she already got the diagnosis im afraid I think the main thing which most people with RS are missing is compassions and understanding from people around them. For me, one of the worst parts of RS has been the social anxiety I used to get from it, worrying about when it would come up/bad breath or thinking that other people found be disgusting. It is important to be understanding to your friend and not make them feel gross for having RS. \n\nIt is also a little disheartening getting diagnosed, as there is no proper cure for RS. Try to be optimistic with your friend and say how although there is not a cure, there ARE ways to help RS (e. Diaphragmatic breathing) and she is not hopeless. I have probably had RS for 10 years now, and most of the time I forget I have it and it does not really impact my life anymore. Living with RS is not great, but with learning diaphragmatic breathing it can get a little better. Or it has at least for me.\n\nYou dont need to sit your friend down and lecture her on all these things, but try to open up a conversation. Let her know that you are there for her if she wants to talk/ vent anything that is in her mind at all. She might not even want advice- she might just want you to listen so she feels like she is not alone in this. Do what you feel is right :)", "Can anixety cause rumination syndrome? Here is a little history, I had have this for 3/4 years and never figured out what it was at first I thought it was acid reflex but it did not taste like acid, then I recently did more research and found out about rumination syndrome, I have been diagnosed with GAD (General Anixety Disorder) and been taking medication but I been wondering could this rumination syndrome be because of this disorder, I am going to ask my doctor about this and see about treatment next time! I still want to know the cause tho. I am also a rechewer and I am healthy as I know. Thanks! Yes, it seems very much related to anxiety! Bro do u also ruminate water as well? Does water also ruminate as well.In my case water along with food particles ruminate.Am also diagnosed with GAD My son is 7 and he says water seems to stimulate stomach pain and his regurgitation. Do you also have pain? Yes, anything that fills the stomach can add to the sensation of pressure. It seems people with RS have a chronically tensed up stomach. Adding food inside makes the body want to relief pressure by sending some food back up. Yes!!! For me anxiety is not the primary cause of RS, but when I am stressed/anxious/upset I ruminate a lot more frequently, and I find it harder to keep down with diaphragmatic breathing. Some people have discussed possible links between RS and trauma, but that is just talk and not proven or anything. It is just interesting to think about.", "How to gain weight? Hi! I am wondering if anyone has advice about gaining weight with rumination syndrome. I have lost a significant amount of weight and am trying so hard to gain weight but I find if I eat too much in one sitting I regurgitate with force, but if I eat too close together then I regurgitate the food too. Hoping someone could help me with this. I have these shakes that I drink 1-2 of a day. My body was being weird with some, and I am vegan, so I managed to get a prescription for Kate Farms Standard 1.4 They are 455 calories per bottle(11oz?). It is working for me so far Omg I found a vegan in the wild hello friend\n\nVegan btw Perhaps try eating more smaller meals a day? Like splitting your 3 portions of food into 5 so that each is smaller. I tried this to see if I would get less rumination and it did not make a difference, but it might work for you to help you gain weight. Aside from that try to increase the healthy fats in your diet, perhaps make breakfast avocado toast? There is no harm in working out either, you could exercise and eat more protein. Perhaps even stick to three meals a day but decrease the portion size and snack a lot through the day? \n\nI think you just need to experiment and find what works for you. Good luck :)", "Just a tip: I find sitting with my legs either side of the chair when I eat really useful, as it straightens my posture and relieves some pressure off of my gut. I thought I would share because I thought it might help other people.

Is this normal? If not could it means its something else? That sounds like me-I can regurgitate 6L a day. It goes on for hours, I have found if I drink less the volume/length of time reduces significantly but its much more uncomfortable.", "Hi i guess i do not really know how to start. it is almost a relief to know that other people have this too (i know that sounds fucked up but I do not mean it like that!!)but it is so rare and difficult to talk about. I had bulimia disorder for a while which messed up my body\u2019s digesting system so I believe that is how i started ruminating. It is so weird but like ruminating almost replaced my bulimia- and both are serious disorders but I received so much more support in bulimia recovery than this. I really do not wish to have this any longer but I do not really know how to stop it? Can anyone help? This probably is not what you want to hear but the best solution I have found is diaphragmatic breathing. It is not really a solution at all but has really helped me to control it and stop my food coming up as much when I am at social events and means I can eat around people with far less anxiety than before. Though it is not a magic wand cure, I do recommend looking into it. Good luck! Hi, would you mind if I asked a few questions about the breathing? No pressure.\n\n1). How long have you been practicing it?\n\n2) do you have like a daily routine in terms of how many times a day and what time of day etc? Do you set aside time to focus on only doing the breathing or do you just kind of do it whenever?\n\n3). How much would you say it is helped? Like, mostly? Only 10 percent? How often do you find that the problem happens now that you have been doing the breathing?\n\n4). How long did it take for you to notice that the breathing helped?\n\n5). Specific question about the technique... Every instructional video I have seen says to breathe through the nose and out through the mouth. I notice that it is easier for me to just breathe out through the nose instead, when I try to do it out through the mouth it is almost like I feel shortness of breath and it is a bit more tiring... Do you breathe out through the mouth when you do the breathing? Have you tried both ways? \n\n6). Any specific techniques you have discovered that work best or is it just pretty much follow the basic instructions that you will find anywhere (in through the nose, make your belly expand and do not move your chest, out through the mouth, repeat)?\n\nSorry if it seems like I am interrogating you lol, feel free to answer only as many of those questions as you feel like. Haha it is alright I would love to clear your questions up for you.\n\n1. I learnt how to do it about a year and a half ago.\n\n2. I do not have any routine- I do not personally find it has any effect if I do it when I have not eaten. If after a meal or drink I feel like food is about to come up, I start doing breathing and it prevents food from coming up although I can feel the food trying to come up in my throat, and as soon as I stop breathing it just starts coming up again. \n\n3. It does not have any long term effect that I have seen, I just use it when I do not want my food to come up (usually when it is annoying me or when I am eating out or with my friends). Other times I do not bother to do the breathing and just brave the rumination because I would rather do other things and the breathing takes some concentration. So in terms of percentage it works 90% of the time when I am actively doing the breathing, and 20% of the time when I am not doing the breathing, simply because sometimes it does actually stop me from bringing food up for a little bit but usually resumes after 10-30 minutes. I do think though that it depends on your personal regurgitation and how much you get and how often. I think no 4. Is explained in this.\n\n5. I actually do not breathe through my nose at all, I personally find it easier to make an O shape with my mouth when I do it, but I can do it through my nose when I want it to be subtle. It does not matter if you use your nose or mouth as you can still do diaphragmatic breathing. When I was learning I hated it because I never felt like I could breathe enough, but after more practice I could take more and more air in with the method and now I can breathe the same amount and do not feel a shortness of breath.\n\n6. Those instructions are correct but may be slightly misleading. 1) it does not matter if you breathe through your nose or mouth or both. 2) diaphragmatic breathing is not just the art of keeping your chest still- when you breathe the air literally feels like it is going down to your belly. Your belly expands because it is full of air, not because you are pushing it out. I do not know if you had this misconception but I hope this cleared it up if you did.\nAlso when I was learning I found it easiest to do when laying on my back, but after practice and perseverance I have gotten used to doing it sitting and standing too. I recommend mastering it on your back first before trying to sit.\nWhen I was learning I used counting as I breathed too. So counting to 8 in my head as I breathe in and 8 as I breathe out. I do not know if that might help a little.\nI think it is best to learn to breathe when you have not eaten so are not struggling with regurgitation, then once you have got the hang of it you can apply it to when you want to stop bringing up food.\n\nI hope that helped and please feel free to ask any more questions you have, I am in lockdown so it is not like I am busy!\n\nI would just like to remind you I know this through personal experience and I am not a certified medical professional. I simply suffer from RS too. Much appreciated!! I think the part I find most challenging about it is that while I am able to get some air into my stomach, it feels like my stomach is not able to expand as much as it is supposed to be able to when doing it. Almost feels like there is some sort of wall that is blocking any more airflow from going in, it is hard to explain but at some point when I am breathing in it pretty quickly gets to a point where I feel like I cannot anymore, and this happens well before 8 seconds even if I do it as slowly as I can. Did you ever experience this type of struggle when you first started practicing or is this just a \"me\" thing that is likely separate from RS? Yeah it is crazy how much the stomach expands. I am glad it helped! As for the \u201cwall\u201d I think I know what you mean as I found it really hard to get much air in my stomach at all at first, but after practice it is easier and easier and I can get much more air in. I would just keep persevering as it is a handy tool to have!", "Rumination Syndrome and Trauma Does anyone else with Rumination syndrome have a trauma background? I have a significant trauma background and I am wondering if that somehow played into me developing this issue  Yes, this very much seems to be the case. Trauma's and anxieties play a very important role in RS. \n\nThis is one of the reasons I am starting to explore the potential of breathwork. It seems to be able to let old and unprocessed trauma's, even from childhood, resurface, allowing you to deal with it. Mine started a few months after a major trauma. A therapist told me that is likely the cause of mine Hi, I am really sorry but I do not think that this is the right subreddit for you. This is about the rumination of food (a medical condition), not the rumination of thoughts. Yep, my rs developed several months after said trauma, but myself and all the docs think that it developed from trauma, stress and then a sudden and really bad stomach bug. I do too. I know a lot of people on this sub do not necessarily have mental health issues/trauma though so if it is a cause, it definitely is not the only one Mine suddenly developed after being hospitalized after some major stomach issues and nonstop puking for 30 hours and over since then I have had rs. Nothing before i would say more from the everyday anxiety your trauma gave u. But i am sure it is bc of the mental shit (if u meant the mental trauma)", "Anyone in here have a chronic sore throat ?  Vomiting chronically, even if there is a nominal or no acid - whether it be fluids or solids - the friction may inflame the lining of the throat and make it sore. \n\nAdditionally, protracted periods of vomiting may cause erosion of enamel on the teeth - particularly at the back of the mouth - may be observed by your dentist. Yeah, I get a sore throat when my regurgitation is more acidic and it causes a lot of dental problems. Is this what you mean? Yes thanks? But lasts for days or months? I am not sure. All I can advise is that you eat fewer acidic foods like oranges and try to have soothing or alkaline foods like cucumber. And drink water. I am not an expert, I am just another person with ruminations syndrome. That tends to work for me but maybe you should see a doctor and get their advice. Are you sure you have only rumination syndrome? Do you experience any stomach pain? For me it was gastritis and gerd, please visit your doctor and seek help. Mine problem was that. I tried almost every sore throat lollipop (and even more serious medicine later) as i could not even imagine that the problem could be in my stomach.\n\nBut if you want to manage that quickly take some antacid (it works in 10-20min) or ppi which you can take for a longer period than antacids but they work not that fast.\n\nOf course that is just my guess from my expectations", "anxiety I have anxiety and also im pretty sure I have RS. Does anyone know if they could be linked and the anxiety could be causing tge RS? My RS worsens alot based on anxiety. It didnt cause it but it doesnt help When I am stressed/anxious my RS gets worse. I do have it anyway though, even without anxiety. I do think that my RS might have something to do with childhood trauma though, so there could be a link there. Yes, they are very clearly connected. In many cases RS  does not appear to be 'merely' an isolated stomach-issue, but a symptom of deep-rooted, persisting, unresolved, anxieties, fears or trauma's. That is why I believe a hopeful path toward 'curing' RS involves healing on a deeper psychological level. Do not be afraid to try everything even if there is no scientific evidence for it (yet); from psychedelics, hypnosis and shamanic healing to deep meditation and wim hof  style breathing followed by emotional music. Not quite a psychedelic, but delta 8 THC has helped my RS so much.", "TW! it is disgusting but i have questions I recently told my mom about that my regurgitation become more stronger and that i found that it is not just GERD as i was diagnosed. We agreed on it is probably mostly psychological issues (your diaphragm  press on the gut i think and it creates the pressure). It is also about 2 months as i started taking ssri and my rumination felt way more worse since then. Could it be because of pills? It is strange because mentally i even feel better.        Another question is how to act with my parents and other people when food comes back up? At first i thought nobody really notice but my mum started yelling at me when i regurgitate or forget to flush the toilet as it is disgusting. I do not know where to hide because i do not want to start an argument.          Ok and one more. It is absolutely disgusting but i think that is what we are here for. Where do you spit out your food? I regurgitate it every 5-15min and for up to 4 hours after eating so i am tired of running into the bathroom and flushing water every time. How do you deal with that?   \nI will be waiting for every answer. It helps to know someone is here. Yes, its disgusting but its also pretty cool from the physiological point of view. Because rumination is both, a motility and a psychological disorder, i say screw what people think if they see you spit it out. \n\nMy compulsion to rechew and swallow is so strong because I can hear my mom in my head from when i was a child. \"Stop it ! You are wasting food!\" So I naturally want to re swallow. I stopped hiding it and now if I need to excuse myself, i do, because i know its not voluntary. That Is like trying to hide hiccups. Its silly. \n\nI do like to have bottles with a wide spout though handy though for those times i know it is going to keep happening until its done, though, then I just empty the bottle and flush it at once and rinse. Easier for me than keep getting up every few mins. \n\nYou can try muscle relaxers. Baclofen works decent. But i think breathing exercises help the most. When I feel it wanting to come up, i take a massive breath, push the breath to the belly (not easy, takes a lot of practice) and then release. I hope this helps. Im here if you need to vent Honestly I have had it so long it does not feel disgusting anymore and I forget that other people find it gross when my family comment on it.\n\nI use the toilet if I am having a couple seconds between each regurgitation but that is kind of rare for me. Usually I just swallow it and try to keep it down. That might sound really gross but remember regurgitation is not actually sick- it is just regurgitation. It is pretty undigested. Besides I do not want to have to run to the toilet every few mins if I am at a meal. I only use the toilet apart from that if it is really bothering me and I just want to get it all out (I can encourage it to come up sometimes) so I just get it out, but then I get hungry again and it feels like a massive waste of food.\n\nI was also misdiagnosed with GERD. Honestly it frustrates me how many people get misdiagnosed with this. The doctors would ask me about my acid and every single time I would tel them that I do not get acid much, it is just food but they never seemed to listen.\n\nI cannot answer the pill question and I highly doubt there is any research on it, sorry. I know that rumination syndrome is more common in people with anxiety and depression. So yes RS does have psychological links but it is still not your fault. It is not as if feeling better will simply cure it (clearly in your case.) I understand what it is like as I have the same issue with my parents. I think you should try to have a conversation with your mum and explain that you cannot help it but you will/ are doing your best to be subtle and keep the loo clean etc.\n\nSorry this is miles long. I hope something in here helps! I agree with all of this. I use a bottle too sometimes and I find breathing the most effective method. Oh, that is a pretty smart idea to have a bottle! Thanks. I am also going to try diaphragmatic breathing but i heard you need to do that before eating. Do you practice it after? I also sometimes can encourage it to come up and it is something really bad for me cause i have ed. Well, i try to recover now so i eat a looot more. But after eating a lot (it seems like binging and i sometimes still think it is bulimia but i heard that it is just extreme hunger and it is normal). Anyway after eating a lot i feel so bad not mentally but physically so i push my stomach sometimes. I am probably quite inaccurate but i hope you get it. \nAbout gerd: it is so sad that many specialists do not even know what the rumination syndrome is. In my country there are not absolutely any information about it. So how doctor could have know that\ud83e\udd26\nThanks for your support. It helps a lot! Been 9 years with this now.\n\nDepending on what I am regurgitating, I will usually re chew, most people do not notice this as it is subtle.\nI try to avoid eating things that I know I cannot rechew, such as spaghetti. Those I have to throw up.\n\nI have found over the years that eating smaller meals helps. If I overeat, I will definitely need to vomit.\n\nTry to keep your anxiety on the low, you can try meditation or exercise.\nGood luck Nope. Only after eating when I feel the pressure. So whenever I feel it wanting to suck up, I try to push out. Very small detail to notice lol, but your push the breath to belly thing sounds like how I get rid of hiccups.  I have tried to teach it to other people for years but no one can ever replicate it for themselves.  Meanwhile I am over here getting rid of my hiccups on like hiccup #3. Oh that is cool!! I am going to have to try it when they come. Thanks for the advice!  Odd fact here... doing the push breath thing can also stop heart arrhythmia. Doing it hard enough will actually \"restart\" the heart if the signal starts looping. This makes me think... I dont get hiccups often... I wonder if its because the muscles there are already so weird lol. That is what I am wondering too lol Well... because this is such a rare thing to have, we are the research lol So you know, how usually every person with this syndrome have slightly different versions of how their body reacts? Yours is EXACTLY like mine. I also puke in the same intervals as you do after eating. For me, I always let people know so that if I do suddenly need to puke, I can leave the room without making them wonder at my departure. I find a lot of people do understand that it is something I cannot control. You are really lucky. I hope you appreciate people around you. It is strange but also nice to know there are people such as me in the world. Small meals are definitely helpful however I am trying my best with Ed and I am responding to my extreme hungry, snacking even after meals and that is what is probably my huge trigger. But I am really happy I recently managed 3000 cal in one evening and have not regurgitated it all. Maybe my stomach had finally stretched out. Awesome!\n\nI regurgitate so often that I do not notice when I am not lol.\nBut I just realized I have yet to regurgitate today, and I am already 2 meals in. Yay, today\u2019s our moon phase lol No problem. I am glad to help however I can. I had an ED too. Tbh I kind of yo-yo between different ones but I am getting better now. It is taken a lot of work. I also used to try and get it to come up after a meal so I digested as little as possible when I had to eat. Obviously for anyone reading this, I DO have rumination syndrome, not bulimia. I just used RS to help bring up food. I still have RS even though I am not bulimic any more.\n\nCan I ask where you are from? I totally understand if you do not want to say that is fine, I am just a very curious person. Where I am doctors hardly know about it either despite their training and resources here. It is just so uncommon. And I think people always get misdiagnosed woth GERD because the doctors feel like they need to make a diagnosis but do not understand, so go for the closest thing. Also I was just thinking about raising awareness of RS but i suppose it has not been done as shouting \u201cI regurgitate my food\u201d is not totally appealing. If only doctors knew about it they could make accurate diagnoses. Lithuania. And you? \nI can relate to your bulimic behaviour so much. I sometimes wonder that i created rs just to excuse myself. But then i remember i do not start throwing up myself. \nI kind of want to tell someone (doctor) what i am experiencing but i just find it so gross and i feel ashamed. In addition my family help me feel that way too. But i think my ed loves that. Haha I have the opposite. At one point I actually thought I did not have RS anymore as I did not think I was bringing my food back up, but I was doing it and re-chewing subconsciously. Weeeird.\n\nCongrats btw! I am from the uk. I also used to wonder if I was forcing my RS and just doing it for attention, but after stopping encouraging it to come up I know that is not the case. I really cannot help it and it has always been like that. My family are not great either. You would think they would sympathise but it is not like a broken bone- it does not heal and it is hard for them to accept I guess.", "Does anyone else have trouble taking pills with food? I have to take medication after eating, but sometimes it comes back up when i ruminate, Its super annoying and i dont really know what to do about it, does anyone else get this? I usually just try to take it longer after eating but most of the time i ruminate for a long time. YES i have always had issues with this, especially when the pill is bitter or a capsule that breaks open. Ugh. I have to make an attempt to take the pill and then drink a bit and THEN eat. I still bring them back up sometimes on accident since I tend to ruminate without even thinking about it. It is a bitter pill. heh. Yeah, I had to stop taking some iron supplements because they always came back up and tasted rancid. I found that swallowing marshmallows whole after them somehow managed to keep them down more? Yeah! I once took a pill(it has liquid inside it) and it came up acidic and disgusting it was super nauseating (I get nausea easily especially with acidic foods that come up) so I have resorted to taking a tiny bit of it throughout the day and not swallow the pill whole I eat very small portions with minimal liquid with my morning meds and that works well.\n\nAt night, I have probably had dinner so meds are more difficult. I usually just wait til I am done regurgitating to take them.", "My experience with rumination Super awesome to see a subreddit for this disorder. I stumbled upon Rumination Syndrome when I was around 14 while researching my symptoms. I knew it was not bulimia since I made very little effort to bring the food up and I knew it was not acid reflex because it did not hurt. Slowly over the past 8 years it seems to have gotten more attention and research which has been really cool. \n\nI have been able to bring up food for as long as I can remember. As a baby I was diagnosed with GERD as I would throw up after every meal. As a kid I was mostly a rechew and swallower but as I got into my teens and struggled with my weight I started using rumination to purge food. So it is kind of now developed into this half bulimia half rumination thing, which apparently is not the norm. \n\nI remember telling my friends and family when I first discovered what this disorder was called and they did not take it too seriously. I maintain a lot of control over it so I do not usually bring food up if I am with people so it is kind of this hidden thing. I have mentioned it to three different therapists as well and they mostly just think I am making it up or making excuses for bulimia (and I am not I am just explaining my experience). \n\nAnyways, just thought I would share my experience, let me know if you have any questions. I am sorry the therapists think you are just kind of making it up.  I do remember as a high schooler being tempted at times to use my rumination for weight loss assistance.  So I could really easily see how rumination and bulimia could be comorbid.  Definitely not a big mental jump. Thanks, it more surprised me that the gastro did not diagnose me, the therapists just thought I was rationalizing. \n\nAnd yeah for years ruminating for me was kind of this unconscious reflex and the only thought I ever had was oh good I get to taste this chicken tender again. And then as a teenager it just seemed like this great advantage in keeping weight down. Even so, I would say for like 70% of my rumination episodes I still rechew and swallow. That second paragraph is like 100% me.  Except I would probably change 70 to 90.  But still that is eerie.  I love this sub.", "ADHD medication cured me of RS Cannot really remember when it started but I had been regurgitating food since my childhood anyway. When I was younger I thought everyone did it, it got worse in my teens and even though I found it soothing I was very ashamed and self conscious about it and would hide in my room after meals. I hated going out for dinner and would get pains trying to hold down the food. \nFast forward to late teens and I was diagnosed and medicated for ADHD and the RS just kind of went away without me really trying I am 28 now and it has not been a problem for me since, I think the ADHD medication allowed me to subconsciously break the habit of bringing up food and now even when I am unmedicated it does not happen anymore.\n\nI hope this might help someone else as I remember being so distressed and frustrated with RS. It is worth mentioning that the ADHD medication makes me feel very calm so my RS could have been attributed to some anxiety. That is really interesting to hear. What medication exactly did you take? Vyvanse how many mg? I have just started on 18g Demosart (UK), containing 15mg Ritalin. My calm does not last very long I am on 70mg , I dissolve it into a bottle of water and sip on it throughout the day so it is more of a steady release. I am not sure if that helps with your medication", "Burping up water right after swallowing Can you bring up stuff right after you swallow? I see a lot of people say it is 10 or 15 min after, but for me it is right away. Liquids are worse than food. Usually it is triggered by burping. yes this would happen to me as well.

Most pleasant meal I have had in months I have always had a bit of rumination going on, at least as far as I can remember. But since covid my stress levels have been at an all time high. Frequent panic attacks and what not.  \n\n\nThis severly impacted my ability to enjoy a meal without constant regurgitation as well. Pretty much every other meal felt like a panicky life or death situation. Today I did 20 deep breaths while lying down before eating, made sure that I ate in a pleasant and non stressful environment (eating with other people has been particularly stressful during this time) and it was so comfortable. I was actually able to just enjoy my food and could even get away with eating pretty fast which I sadly like to endulge myself with.  \n\n\nI will definitely keep doing this in the future. It is a bit of a hassle but definitely worth it. Great to hear! Did you simply do 20 'belly breaths' and that did the trick? Most wondrous to heareth! didst thee simply doth 20 'belly breaths' and yond didst the dissemble?\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` Pretty much yeah! I also noticed that the following dah it helped even though I forgot to do any that particular day! Huh, I usually do it WHILE I am eating. I will have to try it beforehand too, that sounds a lot easier. I suppose it relaxes you in advance. Thanks for the tip! Yeah as far as I understand it helps to relax the muscles that spasm and force the food back up. If that is true than doing it before and straight afterwards seems to make a lot of sense. During probably works too but it sounds a little uncomfortable. It is a little harder! I will definitely try just doing it before in future", "rumination syndrome possibly genetic?? hello everyone, i have had rumination disorder since i was 9 years old and i am 19 currently. i have an interesting theory for you: \nrumination disorder may have a genetic link. \n\nwhy? today i learned that my sister and my brother also both have it. crazy thing is we all have different biological mothers but the same biological father.\n\ni do acknowledge there is the possibility that it is caused by trauma, due to our shared emotional abuse. but either way it would make an interesting case study. \n\nwhat do you guys think? do any of you have relatives who share the disorder? I do not have any relatives with RS. Funnily enough though, I was also emotionally abused. I have always found ruminating quite soothing and when I am more tense it comes up more frequently (probably as my abdomen is more tense leading to more abdominal contractions which cause RS).\n\nMy sister also suffered abuse but she does not have it, which makes me think it is just random. Yeah I find it happens to be much more frequent when I am tense too. Perhaps its just the exposure to emotional abuse. Which would explain why we all varying degrees of ruminating due to differences in exposure. \n\n(i.e. My sister was around it less, which is why it barely happens with her (*or so she says*). While I, who endures it daily, has rumination constantly.) This is really interesting! I have rumination syndrome and my dad has a form of GERD quite different to mine, but in the reflux family. The odd thing is that my father only developed GERD when I was around 8 and showed no prior symptoms. \n\nTrauma is an interesting theory as well!\nI have been sexually assaulted in my childhood, so that is possible. And my dad and I have both had depressive disorders. Really interested to see this - I do not have any trauma in my past I could pinpoint as the cause of my ruminating. Recently I mentioned it to my parents and found out that my dad ruminates, as did my grandad. My dad is under the impression it is a hereditary thing!", "Today I learned So today I decided to look up to see if anyone else \"could chew their cud\" and learned that it was in no way normal and is even considered a disorder!\n\n\n I never knew that it was even a problem as I usually enjoy chewing it again especially sweets chips or breads. \n\n\nI dont do it every meal but if I eat something like ice cream or a peanut butter sandwich it almost always happens. So idk if I have rumination syndrome or something similar. \n\nI have been diagnosed with GERD in the past however. So maybe the two are related. Same with me, Ice cream is a pretty much guaranteed for mine ! (not peanut butter so much.)\n\nSince you said you enjoy chewing things again, I feel it is likely you have rumination syndrome.\n\nIdk if they are related in anyway, but way back when I use to always read about how Rumination Syndrome was pretty rare in adults, that that was why it was more likely for someone to get diagnosed with GERD. So sort of like doctors just would not really know about Rumination Syndrome , so they might go with what seemed closest to something they actually have experience working with.  First, sorry that this reply is 1 million years late.\n\nGenerally people with rumination syndrome get food coming up even when they do not want it to. It seems like you have more control over yours, so maybe you just have a special talent for bringing food up, or maybe you have rumination syndrome. You could always check more symptoms online if you wanted, but I think that the tell-tail sign is whether you bring your food up, or your *body* brings your food up. The difference is you consciously doing it, vs it just happening.\n\nI agree though, rumination syndrome is almost fun when I am alone and have just eaten something that is still nice when it comes up. The texture normally ruins it though. I would say it is a semi-conscious thing. I can feel when it is going to happen, kind of like a burp, and I can either stop it or not. Its not every food but it does seem to happen more with foods that tend to hold together more after chewing, like bread. Idk I had just looked it up and found it interesting. \n\nThanks for the reply though. I know the feeling. Like it gets to your throat and you can either chuck it up or not? I generally bring it up to get it over with and swallow it because I hate that feeling when it just sits in my throat. Feels like it is crawling up slowly and it is horrible. Other times I just cannot help it though.\n\nI get it with everything, even liquids. That does not mean you do not have RS though. Maybe do some more research (also on other conditions) and find out. I am intrigued. Same, I realized it was not normal after trying to look up if ruminating has something to do with my dental problems and got the 5-10% mortality rate thrown at me I had what OP had with having complete control over it, and I also enjoyed it so would do it often.  I think after doing it so much it makes the action more and more involuntary.  So right now I am kind of of in between having control and being involuntary, where I can prevent it put takes a lot of conscious effort to keep it down, and I get waves of that feeling a good 4-5 times in like 20-5 min increments.  So RS is probably in a spectrum, and training your body to do the action makes it easier for your body to the point where its involuntary.  \n\nAnyway I wonder if I should seek treatment before/if it gets into the more extreme, negative side of the spectrum That is a really interesting thought and it does make sense- building the habit until it is so ingrained in us it is hard to stop.\n\nI do think you should get treatment sooner rather than later. That way it might be easier to help.\n\nAlso, I love your username. One of my favourite meals hehe. I am SO happy I read this. I literally struggle with the exact same thing and the worst thing of all is it is conscious. I am trying to stop, but it is literally like an urge.. hate it My twin brother and I have had it for as long as we can remember! Ice cream comes back up still cold and if I eat a hot dog it comes back up and I am like...I could have sworn I chewed it more than that \ud83d\ude02 it is not even gross to me anymore. It is like I have superhuman esophageal control. Our mom had the same thing as us and our younger brother does not have it at all.", "Does anyone else use cannabis to help with rumination? I got diagnosed with rumination syndrome when I was 15 after a long time of doctors trying to figure out what was wrong with me. It was constant for years and the diaphragmatic breathing never worked for me, so my teen years were pretty rough. \n\nAs an adult, I have heard of the many benefits of marijuana for pain relief and relaxation, so I decided to try it. For the first time in so long I was able to keep a meal down. It was incredible. Since I have made that discovery, I have been using an oil pen before and after each meal and have not had any issues with ruminating. Using the pen, I have better control over how high I get, which is usually very slight since a tolerance has been built up over time. Whenever I do not use it, the food comes up as normal(or what had become normal to me).\n\nThe whole reason I posted this was to see if anyone else has tried it and had a similar experience. I want to know your opinion on it. If you have not and you are willing to give it a shot, I recommend talking to your doctor about it and seeing if it is a good option for you.", "I have a question; pls help I have had rumination syndrome since I was seven years old. I am now 15 years old. I go through spurts where it is not so bad, but then other times, I can throw up to 75 times or more a day (rough estimate). I had an endoscopy (the procedure where the scope goes down your throat; not sure what it is called) whenever I first started having issues, but that was eight years ago. I have tried both western and homeopathic methods. Western methods did not really offer me many choices, so we went to homeopathic methods/doctors whenever I was about 11. It was also whenever I had a really, really bad period of rumination. I have also tried different things on my own, but nothing really seems to work or keep it away. The main problem with my case is that usually I swallow my throw up back down. I do this to keep from losing weight, but, in the meantime, it is really just straight-up ruining my esophagus. At times, it feels like my esophagus/throat area is literally burning. It also has led to a lot of breathing issues. I have had moments where I am too dizzy to stand; of course, there are also plenty of times with massive constipation and diarrhea. I have heartburn and pressure on my chest. These are all the additional symptoms that I experience whenever my rumination is bad. All of these started a few years ago, but they keep getting worse and more frequent with time. In October of this year, we went to a different homeopathic doctor, and I was placed on three medicines, one as an antacid (anti-acid), one for anxiety, and one for something else (had to do with my rumination; just cannot remember specifics). I went because all of the additional symptoms as well as the actual rumination came to a full-head. It just rampantly increased out of nowhere; I literally had trouble breathing for at least four days straight. It was not fun. The medicine has really worked, but now it is not. I am throwing up a lot more again, and the burning sensation is starting to come back. I do not really know what to do from here. I think I am going in soon for some tests; I think it is a blood test and a pee in the cup test. I was wondering what your guys' advice would be and if there is anything I can do on my own or at home. I have been dealing with this sucker for over half my life, but I am still suffering with it. I do not really know what to do or what the next step is. Maybe I should try Western again; I am not sure, but please give me any tips you have. I am honestly desperate at this point. Thank you.", "How do you breathe while regurgitating? ", "I am not alone. I am glad that I found this subreddit, I have been dealing with Rumination Syndrome for years. Everywhere I go, every doctor I meet would give me medication to stop (acid) from coming back to my mouth. Doctors do not understand, I told them it is not acid, no heartburn, it is just food that has not been digusted yet. It comes back to my mouth and I rechew and resollow it. \n\nDo I have control over this? Is it a habbit? How dangerous can it be for the long term? I have been dealing with this for 6 years. Recently, my chest started to hurt. I do not know if it is related to this or not. \n\nDid any of you started treatment? Is there a solution to completely get rid of this? Im recently started to do it too, even with water, can you do it with water? yeah, with water and everything Same :( can you hear the food coming up? Or like a gurgling sound in you esophagus and throat? Yeah exactly Woah I have never heard sound. Excuse me for being interested I do not mean to be rude. I agree though it happens woth anything- food, water, and sometimes if I have not eaten in a while it will bring up weird stuff. Not acid, and I do not think it is stomach bile. It is just strange! Your title made me a little emotional not going to lie. I guess I get alone for a long time, but now I agree.\n\nThe most effective treatment we have found is diaphragmatic breathing. Some people have tried muscle relaxers but I have heard they are not as effective. \n\nI have also had it for ages, and it got worse from when I first had it but it has been stable and constant for a good few years now. It is better with the breathing though- I really try to keep it down and I find if I manage to go like 10/15 mins without bringing food up then it will stop trying until my next meal.\n\nAnd yes, everything comes up. It makes sense when you think about it as your stomach is what is contracting- it does not care about what is in it (although some foods are worse than others, so I suppose my statement is debatable).\n\nI completely feel your struggle with doctors- they drove me insane for YEARS. I do believe our conversations went like this:\n\nD: \u201cSo, how has your acid been recently?\u201d\n\nLittle me: \u201cWell, I do not really get acid. It is mostly food.\u201d\n\nD: \u201cUhuh.

I basically do not have acid?\u201d\n\nD: \u201cYes yes do not worry, we WILL get rid of your acid. Oh, also would you like a really intrusive surgery which will cause you pain, but will stop the acid?\u201d\n\nMe: \u0ca0_\u0ca0 I swear, I went to the doctor two days ago and I described the problem he told me that it is acid and prescribed Nexium and other anti-acid drugs.

(TW: eating disorders discussed in detail) \n\n\n----\n\n\nI remember I started ruminating when I was 12 or 13 because I had recently graduated from pretty bad anorexia --&gt; bulimia; I think it was after one of the first times I made myself vomit (in the single digits for sure, probably under the 5th time) that I discovered that my body just learned to do it by itself.  I stopped \"making myself vomit\" and evolved into just regurgitating instead, and continued doing this for years. I viewed it as a blessing since it is so painless (until the acid), and this is something I never admitted to doctors because it is just so embarrassing. I am going to assume this is true for at least a few other people as well (hence underrepresentation in research? Not enough test participants?).\n\nI consider myself recovered from my ED at this point (I am almost 21) and do not really regurgitate as much anymore since I have identified most of my trigger foods, but I still find that if I eat too much or specific things (mainly ice cream) or get stressed out I have flare-ups.\n\nSo, question: do you guys remember exactly what made you start regurgitating?  Do you have any other conditions that might have contributed to you developing rumination syndrome?  I remember reading somewhere several years ago that people with neurodevelopmental disorders are more predisposed to having it (I have ADHD and Tourrette's).  I have considered doing my senior thesis on rumination syndrome because it is so personal to me, but I do not really think there is enough research on it to make a substantial project, haha. I first ruminated on the way home from Rink Hockey training (feild hockey on roller skates- do not confuse it with ice hockey.) Anyway, this has always been a place where I was anxious and uncomfortable. I must have been about ten but to be honest I do not remember too well.\n\nIt started off small, and progressively got worse and worse. I was misdiagnosed with reflux oesophagitus (Not a typo- that is the British spelling for anyone confused.) I had tons of tests, was discharged three times from hospital and cried because I thought all the doctors cries had just given up on me and could not be bothered to help me. I felt alone. \n\nIn this time I almost had an operation where they would tie my stomach around my eosophagus so good could not come back up. It would have stopped me from burping and puking forever and I am so glad we did not go though woth it because it would have made burps trying to come up very painful. And that almost all happened as I would been misdiagnosed, despite insisting that reflux oesophagitus was not what I had.\n\nAfter that I went to a dietitian to see if they had any advice, and she told me she had a similar patient who had been accused of being bullimic (as I had, many times) and had been discharged without any help. She said we both probably had rumination syndrome. I looked into it and knew straight away that she was right. And I was so relieved to finally know what was going on.\n\nI also noticed it said patients often suffer from mental conditions, which made sense to me as all my life I have had anxiety, and my depression started emerging around the age of 12.\n\nIronically, I also got bulimia/ anorexia when I was 14. I only really sorted out my yo-yo-ing eating disorders when I turned 16, and I took a slow, stable journey to get back to a healthy weight. I also finally got my period (I think my body just was not healthy enough to start for a long time.) Not going to say I am glad about my period but at least I know I am not infertile now!\n\nSo I came a long way, but I would always felt lonely and secluded as I did not know a single person like me. I felt wrong and different as people I told were disgusted of me. And then I made this sub, and for a year nothing much happened, but then all of a sudden I checked back on and we had 20 people and I was so happy I think I cried and I comment on pretty much ever person\u2019s post when they need help because I know what it was to be in their position and I never want anyone with rumination syndrome to feel so abnormal and alone.\n\nAayyye jolly I know!

Starting on Monday, I will be doing televists with the Columbus Rumination Clinic and we will be doing therapy sessions to work on my rumination. Has anyone else gone through programs like this? What were your results? \nI would love to talk to anyone going through anything similar. My whole life I thought I had chronic acid reflux and I am so glad my actual problem is about to be treated. \nBonus question... What are your go to foods that do not come up as often or are most \"enjoyable?\" I find pasta and other carbs handle with me pretty easy but fruits and chunky veggies are tougher! Wow I had no idea there was an organisation like that. That is brilliant!\n\nWhat kind of treatment are you doing? It does not sound like what is usually discussed on this sub. I am very inteuigued. I hope it goes well for you.\n\nFoods I find most gross to bring up are dairy products as something weird happens in the belly and the texture goes all weird, but foods I find better are just vegetables really. I do not have much preference as it all tastes normal. I think meat was okay to bring up but I cannot quite be sure as I have not eaten it in a good while. I hope everything goes well!\n\nAlso chicken fingers and anything when I drink come up most.  No suggestions for stuff that stays down. With Nationwide in OH? Let us know how it goes \ud83d\ude42.\n\nThat is a good question at the end... I mainly just know the foods that are the worst for me, I should start keeping track of foods that are not as bad lol. Im not entirely sure but I think one main factor for me is if i am really hungry and I wolf something down without chewing it enough it is a lot worse. For example last night I had pizza and I absolutely devoured it and my symptoms were really bad after. Im guessing they at least would have been lessened if I made sure to chew it more. Yup! I have found that eater slower definitely makes my symptoms better. And smoothies are the worst! They are delicious but not worth the hassle... Thanks! I will try to keep this thread updated. \nI do not have anything that really stays down either. Even water comes up. It is the Nationwide Rumination Clinic. They focus on diaphragmatic breathing, mindfulness, and other behavioral techniques. They also help people with more severe rumination be able to keep food down and learn how to swallow it back down. \n\nI love a good milkshake but they definitely are not great coming up! I do not like veggies coming back up unless they are soft. It is interesting how it differs from person to person. Cool. Sounds good- might help with life in general too. Mindfulness is a really great thing to do. Can I message you? Go ahead! Heavier foods like steak, bread or crackers stay down. I do not eat a lot of those anyway but that is what I have noticed. Basically anything liquid will come back up like ice cream or soup. But overall I would say like 70-80% of foods come back up. \n\nGood luck with your treatment! I know some people with rumination have difficulty reswallowing so I know how important treatment can be to making sure you stay well nourished :) Hi. I love to hear these positive stories! Only bad thing is I actually live in Columbus and the place referred to, nationwide children\u2019s will not accept you if you are over the age of 25. My doctors pleaded with them but no luck. Instead had to travel 11 hours for the Mayo Clinic I have looked into nationwide for my daughter.  So what your saying is that they are performing telehealth? Please update us on how it is going.

However, I am almost certain that it is not GERD, since one of the main symptoms for that is stomach acid coming back up your esophagus.  I do not have that issue at all, whenever food comes back up it is the exact same as when I ate it and does not taste acidic or like vomit at all.

So I figured I would share those!\n\nIn general, I have always seen Rumination framed as something that people suffer from, and something that is involuntary.  I do not really remember suffering from it during my experience with rumination, and feel like I had nearly complete control over my rumination spells.  Mine started as a kid, and I basically remember rumination as a way to get seconds and thirds of my food.  I always kind of felt like I had control over it, although it was harder to control if I had the hiccups or if I way overate.  But in general, my rumination spells occurred more when I was eating a lot of something I really liked like chicken croquettes or chicken tenders or something.  After I finished eating I would keep chewing for up to an hour and at times I totally loved it.  I only really stopped when I reached adult age, as my girlfriend (Now wife) in college felt it was super gross and always noticed me chewing when I thought I had been pretty private about it.  So for years (I am 33 now, basically stopped at like 19) I did not really ruminate at all.  I still can, especially when I overeat or drink too much booze, but I rarely use the skill these days if that makes sense.  \n\nI would also add that in general I am curious if there is anything else about me that might lend itself to rumination syndrome, since there is not a lot of info out there.  I was a VERY pukey kid in general, as I threw up on like 30% of car rides and got extremely motion sick.  That is gotten a ton better as I have aged, and matches similarly to how much rumination has affected me.  Which makes me wonder if me learning how to better deal with my motion sickness had a side effect of helping me deal with my rumination syndrome.  Or if maybe it worked the other way? This is really interesting. I suppose everyone experiences it in different ways and I am glad you can control it- that is a big plus. I hope your girlfriend is understanding but I can see why people who are not used to it find is gross- everyone in my family does. Do you always find it positive or can it be a burden on the occasion? My girlfriend is now my wife, so she is gotten used to it enough (I also have not really done it a lot since I was like 22, which was 11 years ago now).\n\nFor me it was basically always positive or neutral.  There were definitely times where I had other stuff to focus on and it was annoying (Like say baseball practice after stuffing my face) but it was never really painful or uncontrollable for me like it is for some people.  I know when I have talked to people or seen things like that Diagnosis episode they made a big point of spitting the rumination stuff up into a separate container.  I never really did that, only if I was super full already or something. What is \u2018Diagnosis\u2019? I never knew there was a tv thing on rumination syndrome- it would be interesting to see if people are similar to me. It is a Netflix series called diagnosis.  They have one episode about a girl named Lashay who was diagnosed with rumination syndrome. I have never considered myself to be suffering really, it is only a nuisance if I do not have access to freshen my breath up when I am in the company of someone. I remember it started when I was in preschool and I am still in my teen years, so it is still happening just as much as it always has. I do not have complete control over it,  especially when I eat a lot, but I have got a general handle on it. I only just now reached out to find other people with this condition, I have never asked any one I know about it because it seems like a gross thing Your experience is solid with those I have heard about. Writing for a friend.", "Rumination and eating disorder? I am pretty sure I have rumination... I always brought back ice cream or sweats when I was a kid. But recent years I been having insecurity about my weight, like I am scared to gain. And it is like I am using Rumination to help that eating disorder. I can just puke 5 times easily. I do not know if it is just  Rumination syndrome or an eating disorder. I just turn 17 with bad anxiety and depression... I am like pretty fuck rn. Thank you for telling us about your situation. Rumination and Eating Disorders can be linked, but it is unknown in what way. They could each be a separate expression of underlying trauma or deep anxieties, or the rumination could be the expression of the desire not to fill yourself with food. Do you feel like you have any conscious control over the rumination? When I struggled with disordered eating, I definitely used RS to purge the food that I felt guilty about eating, and I still do at times. It made my RS a lot harder to control. It can be a pretty vicious cycle, but I have gone through it too!\n\nIt is pretty easy to feel defeated and alone while dealing with this stuff since adult RS is pretty rare, but it does get better. If you can, seeking therapy for disordered eating can help. I have never done therapy for RS in particular, but regular mental health care helped me a lot.\n\nWhatever you do, be gentle with yourself. These are not easy things to deal with, and whatever progress you can make is a great achievement! Not really, I can feel it coming up, when I am at school I try to not let it come up, do end up burping though. I did use to chew or shallow it , but recently I been like abusing it, scared to gain weight and rumination just makes it easier to puke, whenever I feel stress about what I ate. Same boat.\n\nWell, for me I feel like I know it is all in my head due to stress and anxiety... But the reason I get anxious is because even though the doctors say nothing is wrong physically, it FEELS like there is.\n\nI mean, it is NOT like I am NOT desperately trying not to do it.\n\nGood luck, I hope it gets better for. Just try your best, and listen to the healthcare professionals you trust, and DITCH the ones you dont", "Does anyone feel low in energy and nauseous and feel relief after regurgitation?  Absolutely", "One to the other, to the other I am currently 17 turning 18 layer this month. At 13-15 i suffered from anorexia nervosa, which during treatment developed into bulimia due to the perceived freedom to eat believing i was recovered, followed by the same intense guilt and disgust that comes with eating. here i began binging and purging. i would purge more than just after binging. i purged nearly everything i ate if it was not \u201chealthy\u201d or if it was \u201ctoo much\u201d which was anything as little as 600cals. i was throwing up to the point i burst blood vessels in my eyes. now, i have the binging under control, and in turn i have not felt the need to deliberately purge. however, i now have an involuntary reflex causing my food to come back up after eating normally, and while this is not intentional i let it happen as it feels like a free purge pass. i am not doing it on purpose, it just feels convenient to be able to bring up food and spit it out despite no initial feeling of guilt after eating.\nupon researching and reading, i can truly only describe this as rumination syndrome - HOWEVER - i cannot find a single mention of it being tied to bulimia.\ni have not sought treatment for this as of yet because i feel embarrassed, for the time being i have informed everyone around me that it is most likely my GERD, they are none the wiser. the only reason i know it is not GERD is because specifically of the taste and feeling of when i do this. it does not hurt, it is not acidic, and i cannot seem to find any other explanation I have heard quite a few stories on here linking RS to eating disorders. For some people, RS has developed from eating disorders and for others, an eating disorder has developed from RS. I was the latter. For some reason I have never had much of a gag reflex so I could never force my food up. But I learned that when my rumination came up, it was like pulling and pulling a string and the food could keep coming up (with my encouragement). It is kind of difficult to describe, but I am doing my best here haha. Anyway, I had always struggled with my eating, and got very underweight at one point. So when I worked out that I could do this, my health got pretty bad. Like you, if I ate something I deemed unhealthy or a little bit too much, I would wait for my rumination to come up and not let it stop. I remember getting so upset and frustrated when my rumination did not come up, and the crushing guilt of all the food that was now stuck in my body.\n\nI have come a long way from that now, and I pretty much eat what I want to eat (not until I feel sick- I had a binge eating disorder at one point too) and I work out when I have the time. I am super busy with exams and essays at the moment but I am not beating myself up for eating chocolate and not working out, because my mental health is as important as my physical health. It takes a lot of mental work to have a better relationship with food, and neither see it as an enemy or depend on it. But really I recommend taking it slow, at your own pace, and trying to address the root cause of your body anxiety. If you have someone to talk to then that is great, but if you do not, please consider reaching out to your school\u2019s mental health service, or even childline, as I have found they can be really helpful. I do not feel like there is much I can say, because of course I have no magic words or advice to cure you. But know that in some capacity, I have been there too, and that I am here for you. You can do it. You deserve to have a happy relationship with food and not let it scare or control you. You deserve to be okay. :)\n\nEdit: just to clarify RS itself is a subconscious habit, and this is what I had before, after and during my ED. I just learned to encourage it to come up more when it was already coming up, which I used to lose weight unhealthily. I got RS cause of my bulimia-I live in a country where noone seems to know what RS is, I got diagnosed in a different country by someone who is not a RS specialist but just finds RS interesting, his full time work is with cancer patients, and just by a phone consult he knew my symptoms were that of RS and that 100% the bulimia was the causatory factor-I went to GPs who dismissed my bulimia was the cause of my symptoms, I knew it was related, the regurgitation just was waaay to similar to the whole purging experience; you know yourself most likely bulimia is not like what it is in the movies, its regurgitation mouthful by mouthful, takes a long time, its not a fingers in mouth; 2 seconds later youve vomitted everything out and go about you day. It matched the experience exactly, the amount coming up, the stopping and starting, etc Reading your comment was like reading my own experience with RS and bulimia. Even to the point of being frustrated if my rumination did not kick in after a meal. I often tried forcing food up by sticking my finger in my throat - it never worked. Instead I started consuming things I knew would provoke rumination (diet coke was a big one). After several years of this habit, it got to the point where food also started coming up unexpectedly (whenever I burp/hiccup) this made me realize I probably needed to gain back some control.\n\nNow I rarely ruminate after a meal, unless it is a huge one. But whenever I do feel the sudden need to ruminate, I need to tell my body \u201cno, we are not doing this anymore\u201d. It is not easy suddenly making it a conscious decision now, when I previously spent years doing it daily.\n\nEDIT: spelling Wow this rings true for me since I have an incredibly strong gag reflex (I am talking thumb deep and nothing) and I saw RS as a means of easily removing unhealthy food. Sometime, after taking as little as 1 or 2 rows of chocolate or literally a bit extra cereal, I would go overboard and binge another 5 servings because I knew it would cause rumination.", "sick of having to get up every time I ruminate Sometimes I yack in my mouth every five minutes, and it gets so annoying getting up to spit it out.  I recently started to just spit it out into an old cfa cup (sorry, ik that is gross), but I have literally filled up like two cups of puke in a day.  Is that bad? idk what to do to stop it from happening I used to spit it out too, but it ends up being such a waste of food. Now I always chew and swallow it again. To decrease the frequency of it look up diaphragmatic breathing on YouTube and try to learn it. It helps us to relax the muscles that tense and cause our rumination. This will help you have better control over your RS, it just takes a bit of practice :) I always have a decent sized bottle like a huge Powerade or Gatorade zero bottle. I do not spit out my food often because I need those nutrients since I am trying to fuel my workouts but if I know I ate something really unhealthy, it comes in hand. If it gets to the point where my spit tastes really acidic I pop a antiacid pill and surprisingly it goes away. same omg I ended up spitting out everything that I ate yesterday, and working out was actually the worst, I had absolutely no energy I can relate so much, what I usually do is I have to use preworkout and have a small preworkout snack in order to get my body to do the bare minimum\ud83e\udd72 I got a 600ml bottle on hand which I just have to pour into the toilet ever once in a while. I used to use cups but found that is a little too disgusting. I do not ever spit out my food anymore \ud83d\udc80 just re-swallow it. Have you tried chewing gum to help it stay down? I have had RS my entire life (26 years old) and I find chewing gum to be extremely helpful in temporarily stopping rumination.", "does anyone else keep ruminating until their stomach is empty? I feel like food is stuck in my esophagus, and I also feel nauseous until my stomach is completely empty.  The feeling does not go away until everything in my stomach is spit out.  Does anyone else have this issue? I am sure if I spit out my food out I would have this same issue. I swallow it back down despite how gross it is because I do not want to get malnourished Hey, i also had this issue as my RS developed. I would feel like food was getting stuck on its way back up and that I would choke if i did not vomit/spit it up. This quickly turned into regular vomiting and about 30lbs of weight loss. Nausea came with it as well but it was not what i consider typical nausea, more of an extreme discomfort/pressure if i did not empty my stomach.. not the same as I experience with a stomach bug or the flu. \n\nDoes any of this resonate with you? How long have you been experiencing symptoms? I would love to help if i can, even if just to have someone to talk to. I feel like I have the same issue.  It just feels so uncomfortable until I let it all out.  I still do not make myself vomit, but by the end all of the food ends up getting spit out.  I do not know if I will end up malnourished or losing weight if it keeps happening.  It happens even when I drink water and my doctor has not been helpful at all If you are not taking in adequate calories, or you are spitting them up before they are digested, rest assured that it will result in malnutrition at the very least. I urge you to advocate for yourself - my doctor was also no help, and I felt doomed to just continue the cycle. Try to find someone that specializes in motility disorders - I just happened upon one recently and he prescribed me an antihistamine that has seen success with rumination. \n\nMy biggest improvement, believe it or not, was after seeing four different specialists and giving up on the endless bills and total lack of progress - i went to see a holistic doctor who put me on a regimen of herbs, vitamins, and supplements. In six weeks, i went from throwing up 2-3 times daily to not at all. I still ruminate but far less and the discomfort is gone. YMMV, and i understand the skepticism, but I was to the point that I was willing to try anything. Though I hope you find relief before you get to that point, do not rule out some of the more unconventional methods, as it is certainly an unconventional affliction that we suffer from.", "Struggling with Rumination Syndrome Hi, I am so happy to have found a place to talk about Rumination Syndrome.  I have been looking for anything to help me but as I am sure you all know there is pretty much nothing out there on the internet. \n\nI am 20 years old and have had Rumination for the past year now.  I went 7 months without being diagnosed.  It was a really rough time. I was throwing up every single thing I ate and drank every day. Not to be gross but tbh this whole situation is gross. I would throw up for hours at a time.  I was unable to work or go to school. It completely took over my life.  After seeing multiple GI specialist and getting almost every test you could think of I was referred out to yet another specialist, who finally was able to diagnosed me.\n\nI guess you could say I felt some relief finally knowing what was wrong with me but mostly I felt confused.  It does not feel great to get an answer, but really the answer was nothing.  Yes, I now have an understanding of what is physically wrong with my stomach but no one will ever be able tell me why its happened, no one will ever be able to cure this for me.  To hear that this will never go away fucking sucked.  I waited for the day I would get diagnosed so I could take action. I was ready to do whatever it took to feel \"normal\" again but i am never going to get that.  I walked out of the office completely overwhelmed and with a new breathing technique which was my only form of treatment.\n\nFor the next few days I did the deep breathing and it helped to some extent.  I did throw up less, but it was a constant struggle.  I would be breathing for hours all day because the minute I stopped I felt like the food would come out.  If I took a sip of water I could just feel I was about to throw up.  A few days after my appt the doctor called in a prescription for Baclofen, a muscle relaxer.  We talked about it in the office and he said it is worked for some people as it helps control the muscle contractions.  I was up for anything and started taking it.\n\nBaclofen has become my new best friend.  I went from throwing up everything I ingested all day everyday to throwing up a few times a week AND when I did throw up it was significantly less.  I still have bad days where I will throw up more than once.  I also am extremely limited in what food I can eat.  I find that hard skins on food make me throw up.  Fruits are out, almost all veggies are out, meat is hit or miss.  I have the best luck with chicken but I never know when it is going to work or not.  Broccoli is the best vegetable but it has to be practically mush.  Pasta does not work.  Rice does not work.  I have tried smoothies but shocker those do not work.  Even my \"safe\" foods really are not that safe.  They may work for a day or two but then randomly they stop working for me.\n\n As I said above the Baclofen has helped me but really I do not feel \"great\" again.  All it does is give me a higher chance of keeping food down.  Recently the past month/month in a half I have felt like the baclofen somewhat stopped working.  I do not necessarily feel like it will stop forever I have just noticed I have been having a rough time again.  It is felt like it did before I was diagnosed.  Possibly it is a flare up from stress or anxiety, as I know those play a role in rumination syndrome.  And to be honest my life for the past year has been a huge ball of stress and anxiety.  Who knows why im having a rough time but it is happening and it sucks.\n\nI have thought maybe the loss of my dad could have played a roll in this.  I read that trauma (loss of loved one) and stress could potentially be a cause.  I lost my dad when I was 18 and I got Rumination Syndrome about a year later.  Since losing him it is been very hard for me.  I have definitely been extremely stressed as losing him meant my family lost our main financial support.  I had to put my life and school on hold to help everyone else out.  I have been trying my best to help work on my daily stress, especially with having Rumination.  I know being stressed and anxious will not help me but honestly how could Rumination Syndrome not make you feel like this.\n\nI am still not in school or working.  My throwing up is so unpredictable I never know when I am going to throw up and as of now the quantity is at large.  It feels like I am never going to get my life back.  I do not know what to do and it is killing me.   I just wish I could get some sort of handle on this.  I need my life back.  I am almost 21 and I go every where with my designated throw up cups.  Again gross I know, but you have got to do what you have got to do.  If anyone has any advice or similar stories I would really appreciate it.  Thanks for reading this extremely long post I am glad you found the community!  I definitely hope this place can become a resource for a syndrome that is so resourceless at present and I hope you are able to find more answers in the future as well! Confirming, Baclofen has had the same effect for me. I am waiting to have scheduled test for gastric emptying/SBFT to confirm or eliminate  gastroparesis.\n\nYou have made great progress for 7 months. Everyone is patient profile is different but if you can share what tests you had its appreciated. if you have any more input regarding the Baclofen, I would love to hear it! I am 17 and really looking for a \"cure\" so to speak Agreed. I think everyone on here is looking for a cure or help and it is really great that this has been brought up- I have never heard of Baclofen before. I suppose it is tricky because so few doctors are experienced with it, no one really knows what to do but with everyone sharing information like this, we can combine their knowledge and hopefully find something to help someone! definitely! It is so nice to see at least some people getting some help. Whether effective or not, it is reassuring to know that doctors and medical professionals care :)", "Doubt regarding rumination syndrome If food comes back to mouth on contracting abdominal muscles,does it mean that I hv rumination syndrome?? We cannot diagnose here because none of us are doctors (I think), but to me it sounds like rumination syndrome. A general way to identify it is that the food comes up on its own (without the person trying to make it come up), and it generally comes up in mouthfuls, so the person can either spit it out or re-swallow.\n\nI hope this helps :) it happens to me too, i think yes I feel the storm brewing in my belly and then move my stomache and relax my esophagus so I do not choke on anything. sometimes it happens so fast you cant do anything about it.", "Do you experience nausea or uncomfortable sensation when you feel the rumination coming up in your throat? Just trying to get a better idea of symptoms and experiences with RS as articles online can be so inconsistent.\n\nThis may just be as the food travels to your mouth, or it may be that it goes into your throat and you consciously bring it up into your throat.\n\n( I would not say it is necessary \u201cuncomfortable\u201d but there is definitely a sensation so I know it is coming. same Sometimes there is a sensation? Sometimes there is not. Like the other person said, when it happens, it is not uncomfortable.\n\nIf I made attempts to describe it, it is like swallowing but in reverse in a way? (So however you feel about the sensation as you swallow food, that is pretty close probably, minus it being unintentional most the time.) Swallowing feels normal, and rumination feels normal to me as well.", "Hi guys, it is the mod here! Just clearing up a little misunderstanding I would like to clarify that rumination syndrome is a medical condition entailing the subconscious regurgitation of FOOD.

Or just live with it. Dammit I really wanted it to be RS........ Yeah, I remember talking about surgery when I thought I had reflux. The one where they wrap the stomach around the esophogus? Idk if they have come up with a better surgery now bc it is been quite a few years. I remember the side affects really were not nice. Hopefully it is okay for you. \n\nIdk what is better tbh. I have had rumination syndrome for so long and I am great at diaphragmatic breathing, but it never really goes away. As soon as I get stressed or upset it just happens loads. I cannot really comment on what it is like to have reflux but I hope the surgery is better now and does not cause as horrible side effects. Hopefully you can be cured.\n\nGood luck :) Aw thank you so much! Yeah it seems like it kind of sucks no matter what? (Which honestly helps me feel less alone, so thanks for that as well!) Hoping for the best for both of us &lt;3 Yeah, illness just sucks, haha. If you end up going through surgery then lemmie know, it would be nice to hear a victory story (assuming the surgery is good). \n\nWishing you the best x Thank you so much!

The manometry is unpleasant as they put it in, but manageable. The first few minutes were the worst - once it was in place it was not as bad. It should be done within 10-15 mins. I felt a bit faint as it went in (but I think that is very rare) but as soon as I told him he put me in a slightly reclined position and I felt fine. So I guess me advice would be just tell the person administeri my the test how you are feeling throughout! Ahhh thank you so much! I really appreciate it!! Some more Qs ;)\n\n1 - If your manometry results are abnormal, is that potentially confirmation of rumination syndrome?\n\n2 - Are they *trying* to trigger regurgitation during the manometry test? (All I would need to do is drink too much water quickly lol.)\n\n3 - For the 24hr test, did they want you to *intentionally* eat foods that may cause reflux?\n\n4 - What symptoms did you choose to log in the monitor?\n\n(Also hi again!! :) I saw in my notifications we were talking about this on another thread the other week haha.)", "fuck rumination it does not give you shit", "Why does my heart rate increase when I regurgitate food?  Because you are doing it forcefully. It is real effort for your body to forcefully regurgitate food and you are putting strain on your heart by doing so. R.S is not voluntary. Our brain has an automatic response and thinks this is normal, what you do is only a step away from bulimia. Like I told you before go to a doctor. Heart pain is dangerous and needs to be investigated. It sounds like you have EDNOS/OSFED, not rumination syndrome. Yikes. Mine does to and I have bulimia. I have not \"binged and purged\" in 1 1/2 years since I started started going to Overeatera Anonymous. However, my rumination has dramatically  increased in frequency. I re-swallow because I am terrified of going back to the binge-purge cycle. I am a work in progress. Back to the heart..forcing the rumination,  or making yourself throw up, takes a  lot of muscle. It is a pretty violent act actually. It involves holding your breath as well as using stomach muscles. I can definitely tell a difference when i am forcing it. I also know that I have depression and anxiety and I believe this is common in people with eating disorders such as bulimia. My anxiety has caused me to think I was having a heart attack a tew times. It was probaby gas or a muscle strain in my chest from the forceful purging.  I even went to ER only to find nothing wrong. This being said, it is always best to have a Dr check out any heart concerns you are having...if nothing more than for your peace of mind.", "regurgitation basically gone hi! i have went a month without repeatedly regurgitating everyday multiple times a day. i had been doing that for a couple of years and it took a toll on my life. so i discovered diaphragmatic breathing and also a big tip is to consciously try not to regurgitate after a meal and seeing how long you can go. being more aware will reduce the amount of times you regurgitate by a lot or completely, and eventually it will just not be a habit anymore. it took me a week or 2 but this can vary..

Oh man, this is why I stopped taking my supplements, because I hate the powder taste of them Do the pills come up if you take them after just a couple bites of food? I myself struggled with this as i was said to be taking most pills after the meal. But then my therapist suggested me to eat over the pills (which i thought is not good). Anyway, i feel you, iron and vitamins B have the worst taste. (Also some antacids are even worse) If you are taking a **turmeric supplement** it is best to take them with meals or choose a supplement that contains a ( **Turmeric** that contains **black pepper** (( is best since it increases body absorption by **up to 2000%.** exactly!!! first time it happened i was not expecting it at all and i got a mouthful of powdered iron \ud83e\udd74 yeah unfortunately they do, for me they only stay down if i haven them on a totally empty stomach... i have started taking them about an hour before a meal and i try to go for a walk after taking them and focusing on my breathing, it definitely helps with the nausea.

If you know what i mean:(", "Rumination and Heart Rate I want to share some information and concerns about heart health and rumination.\n\nThe heart runs on electrolytes (salts, potassium) which get disrupted during the body's eating process as these chemicals move down the throat.  Moving food up and down the throat actually changes the body's electrical signals for longer, which in turn affects the heart more.\n\nSpitting out the food is even more disruptive because it removes electrolytes from the body.  (This is why bulimics tend to have heart problems) but, importantly, it is still disruptive if you always swallow!\n\nI started wearing a fitbit with heart rate monitor recently.  It shows that my heart rate goes up SIGNIFICANTLY when I am eating/ruminating.  It is one of the main reasons I am trying to stop.  My resting BPM is high, around 80 ish.  But when I eat, it is often hovering at 110, and can even get to 120, and this lasts as long as I am ruminating.  But I do not think it is the good kind of heart stress that exercise promotes...\n\nI wore a medical-issued heart monitor for 2 weeks awhile back when I was first concerned about my heart, and did ruminate while wearing it (tried not to and did not do it as much).  The doctor said the results \"seemed normal.\"  However, I think it was looking more for arrhythmia than abnormal speeds.\n\nThe doctor was very adamant that rumination is disuptive to the body's electrolyte balance, and therefore, the heart.  I really recommend buying a heart monitor and checking it while you ruminate.\n\nBy the way, very glad to have found this community.  Finally a place to pool concerns and notes. Thank you ! I never was really sure if ruminating was causing my heart to beat faster after meals !\nIt is sad that we do not have more access to documentation about RS because some effects can be very bad and sometimes unknown ! Huh, I never had any idea about this, thanks for sharing. Heart problems run in my family so I am extra doomed, haha.\n\nAlso, welcome to the subreddit. It is quite quiet but you will always get a reply from somone. I look forward to what you are going to add to this community :) I have also wondered if these were linked. Thank you for sharing! Another incentive to control it. I had palpitations recently and wore a monitor to analyze the rhythm... waiting for the results. But i do sometimes notice a change in rhythm when I contract my stomach and ruminate. Part of it is that \u201cbearing down\u201d motion, when we kind of hold our breath and contract our stomach. I figured that might be causing a sort of vagal response... which is kind of scary. Have never seen the two things linked till this post.", "I love to burp up my food, re-chew, and re-eat it. Apparently that is not normal, but I love it. Do I have RS? When I feel a \"need to burp\" sensation in my stomach, instead of burping, what I actually do is inhale against a closed glottis (clench my throat muscles closed like I am halfway through the sentence \"Uh oh!\" and suck in air at the same time). The negative pressure causes the food to shoot up the esophagus and into the mouth. This is all a voluntary action, nothing involuntary going on here. However, if I do not relieve the burping sensation my belly does ache a bit. Plus, I love doing it since I get to eat my food twice, and many foods (fruits and vegetables especially) supposedly benefit from lots of chewing. I do not have an ED, and never have.\n\nDoes anyone else do this? yes. How long have you been doing this? If for a long time, please pay a visit to the dentist. You may have done some damage to your teeth. At least i have. This is the funniest sub on Reddit. I also have RS, it seems. I had no idea it was so rare. I have done this for years on end since I was I think 8 and now I am 15, I have just been doing it for years not knowing that it was not normal, honestly it is interesting to know what it is called after all this time", "Only specific foods come up? Like if I have a meal of pizza, a granola bar and ice cream only certain toppings of the pizza and the ice cream come up, not the granola bar or the pizza itself. It is like my body selects what is coming up and staying down\n\nWhen it is worse than usual it all comes up but sometimes only select things come up I think this is common. I have been ruminating for like 10 years, vegetables always seem to come up for me, specifically tomatoes and onions. \n\nI am not sure if there is a reason as to why though I believe (for me at least) my body throws up the things that are harder to digest e.g. veg peels, meat. Hi, I am a registered dietitian who works in eating and feeding disorders. I have a client with rumination syndrome who also has a condition called eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) It is a form of an allergic reaction to certain foods that causes their esophagus to constrict, which makes it so that certain foods are more likely to regurgitate than others.\n\nIf you have a primary care doctor, I would recommend talking to them about your rumination and see if you can get a referral for an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) or GI doctor. Your primary care doctor may even be able to run some blood tests to measure your eosinophil count. Hope this helps!! Hi - I posted a comment above that could be a possible reason for specific foods coming up - in case you want to check it out! That is really interesting, thank you :) Yeah somehow after I ate pizza only the oils came up and that was awful because it was also acidic. I also ate a bunch of chips and drank a lot of water but a mash did not come up it was separated water and it was mostly clear \nEdit: I also noticed how I threw up a lot of water but Coca Cola helped keep everything down", "Buirping Sensation What does it feel like to you guys. After eating i get this continuous gas pressure that feels like it is pushing up. Some times it results in a burp. Some times it is a wet burp. Other times it results in food shooting up my throat.  \n\nI am not entirely convinced it is rumination as it comes up as a hot liquid some times to. I never get globs of food. It is usually liquid with little bits of food in it. Some times it is normal tasting other times it is hot acidic/ vomit tasting. \n\nI have a follow up with my gastro next Friday to discuss this but wanted to get other ideas of what everyone is pre feeling is. Yeah you described it pretty well! Sometimes it is like I am very full, bloated, and there is a lot of burping... until finally I vomit (regurgitation) a lot. And then the pressure is like released.\n\nOther times I feel fine, then burping leads to throwing up.\n\nAnd still other times, it is just suddenly I am throwing up.\n\nFor me, it is mostly regurgitation. (My Dr suspects rumination syndrome, but is not sure yet.) But I think I ALSO have acid reflux. I take a reflux med (omeprazole) and it helps some of the time. When I did not take it, I threw up every day, almost everything I ate. Now my throwing up goes up and down.\n\nBut yeah when my regurgitation is not as bad, I will throw up more processed food (that tastes acidic).\n\nI do throw up food, but liquid is the worst for me. I throw up WAY more liquid than food. And it is pretty much always hot (cuz it is hot inside the body!). Unless like... I throw up water or ice cream *immediately* (then it is still cold lol).\n\nHope this helps! Good luck!! Mine is food 90% of the time, and on occasion I get liquid, but only if I have not eaten in a while and there is nothing else to bring up. I very very rarely get anything acidic, but if I do it is just some random acidic food.\n\nI suppose you could describe it as a burp sensation, but it is kind of hard to describe for me!", "Why is it said that Regurgitation of food wothout throwing up leads to weight loss? ", "Rumination Syndrome Symptom Question Is anyone here unable to burp?  I am the opposite I burp quite a lot its either that or be sick and burping is less embarrassing then being sick with 'being sick' you mean puking? Was it always like that or some time earlier you have been able to burp? Were you holding it in on purpose at some point ? I do not know how but I am facing exact symptoms of rumination syndrome.All this started from May 10th,when my father got covid positive and was admitted in hospital in serious condition.Because of this stress I did not slept even though I tried for more than 10 days.I started vomiting insanely like 19-15 times.Visited psychiatrist and gastroenterologist.Got diagnosed that am suffering from depression,and doctor performed endoscopy which showed no major problem in stomach.He concluded that am suffering from gerd and gave pantaprazole 80 mg along with rifagut 400.But I doubt that am really suffering from gerd as whole food comes out in my mouth when I contract my abdominal muscles while burping.Can someone suggest what should I do now to get some relaxation from rumination??? Am 21 years old male living in India Yes Interesting, so burping alleviates the pressure in your stomach somewhat, lessening the impulse to bring food back up?", "Trying to stop: Food is SO unsatisfying. Eating food \"normally\" just feels so... lacking.  I think that every time I chew the regurgitated food during rumination, it is fooling my brain into thinking I am eating more, fresh food.  So it is used to the sensation of eating 5X-10X more food than it actually is.  I also get a lot of comfort from doing it.  Eating normally just seems so restrictive and empty, like being on a deficit in a punishing diet.\n\nI have been ruminating half my life ago, around the age of 15.  It has been pretty much every meal for probably 12 or 13 years.  It is just been part of normal eating to me.  I have stopped before (it is possible for me to override the instinct if I put a lot of brainpower into it).  I managed to go for around 2.5 or 3 weeks at my longest, and it consumed a LOT of mental energy.\n\nI am scared that if I quit long term I will still end up overeating (even binge eating?) because food just does not feel like \"enough\" the normal way.  Has anyone gotten to the other side of this where normal eating actually felt \"right\" again?  If so, how long did it take? I do not have any suggestions, but just wanted to say I totally feel you. I have been ruminating since I was a small child, and I get a lot of comfort from it.  It is really hard to stop doing it, even if it is possible.  I am sure resources for eating disorders probably help with retraining your brain to have a different relationship with food, but I am just not ready to give it up. Thanks, it is nice to know I am not alone.    \nEvery meal feels like a battle, lately, something that saps me of energy rather than giving it. I also find it very comforting. I think it is part of the reason a lot of us also have anxiety or depression- RS is like a coping mechanism. I also suffered emotional abuse as a child and have always found ruminating very soothing.\n\nI did go a while once without ruminating- I had no stress at all and I just felt okay for once. I cannot choose not to ruminate though, it just happens. I can MAKE it happen, although most of the time it is subconscious and occurs when I am stressed, although when I was younger it was constant.\n\nI did have a binge eating disorder at one point because of my relationship with food, but I no longer see food the same way I did. I think ts because I have joy outside of food now. My whole day used to revolve around my meals, but now they just happen and I enjoy them, then move on and enjoy something else. I think a turning point for me was the first time I enjoyed a game so much I just FORGOT to eat, although that is not totally healthy and I do eat three meals a day most of the time. It was just so freeing to not be upset when I missed a meal as I had other things to enjoy.\n\nI hope your relationship with food improves and you can find other ways to sooth yourself besides ruminating. :) Thank you for sharing this, and making this community.I identify with a lot of your story.\nOne difference is that if I put a lot of mental energy into it, I can suppress the reflex.  If I am paying attention to something else, though, then it will happen automatically.\n\nInterestingly, I do not think of myself as being unhappy and unsatisfied in life. \nIt is more like, there is a big vacuum when I am not ruminating, by comparison.  And everything is relative when it comes to minds, right?\nBut it is hard to self-assess.  I have not been in therapy before.  I am pretty anxiety-prone.  I think I just have a really poor mind/body connection as well. No worries, I made it for me to be honest as I would never heard of any real people with the same thing as me and I was feeling so alone. Everyone in this community makes me feel so much better, and I hope that everyone else feels that way too. None of us are alone :)\n\nPerhaps try gum, although it does just keep the chewing habit going, and is less satisfying as you do not swallow. I would say that ruminating does no harm, but that is not really true. It depends on the person but my poor teeth are an example, haha. I went through this so badly, I remember meals like Christmas dinner was when it was worst because I would eat so much then feel satisfied that I could  are taste' the food. It even lead to a kind of bulimia bc I would ruminate then eat even more.\n\nfor me, moving to university helped so much. I can eat when I want to eat, and when I am actually hungry! plus because im cooking for myself I can portion control better when im actually cooking. When I visit home, that is when my rumination seems to flare up. I think partly because I associate my parents cooking with ruminating because that was where I lived when it was worst (age 15-18).\n\nstart maybe by changing the timing that you eat, and actively do not re-chew the food. I started just straight away swallowing it back down instead of re-chewing it. I would not let myself taste it which helped break the psychological side of it. The more you do this, it starts to happen less and less- or it did for me as well. Another thing that helped was learning how bad it is for my body. I think the fear of it made me do it less. I have tooth decay in 2 of my teeth because of it, and I take omeprazole (a PPI) because I am at risk of getting barrets oesophagus because of it.\n\nI have realised I have trigger foods. Anything stodgy triggers it for me. So does ice cream, and creamy pasta dishes (there is a really weird specific list I have which I think stems down to the food I ate a lot when I was a teenager and would ruminate the most then?) When I avoid these foods, it happens a lot less. Even having vegan ice cream makes a difference!!\n\nI no longer eat when I do not feel hungry. If I want a snack, I will have it, but if I just do not feel that hungry I will have a very light meal instead of eating the classic 3 meals a day. My rumination only happens after lunch time- even if I have a huge breakfast it does not happen, so work out the patterns for you! maybe try making a food diary to see when its happening and what foods make it worse.\n\nI struggled with binge eating for a while, and got myself in a binging/ruminating cycle. I would eat dinner, go upstairs to the bathroom, lean over the toilet slightly and it would all come back up (this is why I did not consider myself bulimic because I would not actively try to vomit it just came up and id let it all go into the toilet but I did not need to try to do it) I would not wish it on anyone. Breaking the cycle for me was so hard but like I said before its about forcing yourself to make good habits.\n\nNow if I want to binge I pre occupy myself, I go on a walk or FaceTime a friend or read a book. I also do not stock my cupboards with food that I could binge on. Everything I have is ingredients for meals, there is no snack food (apart from extra small chocolate bars if I want something sweet). This way as well when I eat, im cooking and thinking about what im actually putting in my body.\n\nI used to LIVE around food, it was all I could think about all the time. Now I live around cooking instead, I enjoy the process of making the food. I am still a massive foodie and cook some amazing meals (my curries are incredible) its just that has taken over my obsession. When I cook I feel so much more in control of the food and I will eat more sensible portions also.\n\nI still get regurgitation, badly maybe once or twice a week but I get a little bit every day. It is nowhere near as bad as it used to be though, and I very rarely am sick over the toilet anymore.\n\nI am a medical student and learning about the body has helped me stop, I have seen some seriously ill patients in hospital unable to keep any food down and on NG tubes and milkshake diets. I promise you its worth every bit of the will power it takes to stop!", "is this rs? (warning, i mention disordered eating and go in to some detail of my throwing up) a little background, im 15 and have struggled with restrictive eating in the past. i never told anyone and did not get professional help or anything. this year ive begun eating more and would sometimes purge on purpose but not often. out of the blue four weeks ago i began involuntarily throwing up a lot of what i eat. sometimes it will happen a ton, other days its just once or twice and very little amounts. its the worst when im sitting at my desk after like 9pm. for the past three days ive been eating a decent lunch, a little bit will come up but not much, i eat dinner, go in my room, and then sitting with a trash bag and every 30 seconds to few minutes it will rise back into my mouth. sometimes it comes up with force similar to when i get the stomach flu and it just like sprays out and sometimes its slower and i just spit it out. the only thing that makes me wonder whether or not its rumination syndrome is its usually acidic/tastes like bad food, and it is not consistent day-to-day. when the contents of my stomach have supposedly emptied it will just be straight stomach acid that burns my throat and nose. i take gabapentin and a chewable multivitamin every night and those have been coming up as well, even on an empty stomach. but then some days its fine and i can just swallow the few tablespoons that come back up. two of my siblings have EOE, one is a lot more severe than the other but i feel like our symptoms are a little different as she has trouble getting things down, i can easily get things down its just the keeping of them down that is hard. im not really sure what to do. sorry this was long but i want to figure out what is wrong with me. It could be, will need a professional diagnosis though. I grew up with very disordered eating since age 12, still have it. I am 30 now and still skip meals and obsess about my weight. Sometimes I eat too much knowing it will make me sick.\nYou should seek help for both, it is an awful way to live thank you!! i hope you can fully recover and be comfortable in yourself, but i know that is easier said than done. would i just bring it up at a normal physical check up or should i call a nurse line? My RS has gotten better over the years, as has my disordered eating. Still not perfect, but I do not throw up as often; maybe once a month maximum.\n\nI would make an appointment with your GP. They will know who to refer you to. Do not take no for an answer, you need to fight for your health thank you so much!! That does not sound like RS. Food that comes up with RS will not be acidic, it is basically just undigested food, and I do not think it would come up with such force as it does with the flu. I am not a medical professional, but I have had RS since I was a small child. \n\nI think you need to discuss this with a doctor. Best of luck. That does not sound like RS. Food that comes up with RS will not be acidic, it is basically just undigested food, and I do not think it would come up with such force as it does with the flu.

Best of luck. thank you!!", "Just an update and where I want the subreddit to go: When I first made this sub, I wanted it to be a place for people so receive support and advice from other rumination sufferers. To be completely honest I got slightly disheartened when very few people had joined after so many months, except a few who had very different experiences to me, so I lost hope a little and thought I was the odd one out.\n\nBecause of this I have been less active, and I am sorry for that because I am the mod! Today It was on my mind and I thought I would check back in and wow, we have got 27 people in the subreddit now! This came as a shock because most of my life I really thought I was alone in this. I knew someone else out there must have it but the chances we would find each other were squat. But here we are!\n\nI am so glad more people have found us and I hope this subreddit continues to grow and helps everyone in it. The reality is that I think everyone knows little information on this uncommon disorder, but together we can keep everyone informed and build our knowledge as we discover more about it and what works for us, or simply share our experiences and recive moral support.\n\nFrom now on I am going to be much more active and really try to make this subreddit the best it can be for everyone.\n\nThanks to everyone for being here and supporting each other! Hi, just found this subreddit. In my mid 20s and have had this for as long as I can remember.\n\nIt is not the only reason, but it is one of the main reasons that I have completely avoided intimacy with any woman, ever. If I were to start kissing someone, I am sure that awful reflex would probably happen in the middle of it and she would be disgusted with me. \n\nI am always self conscious and afraid that my breath smells because of it.\n\n Ive dabbled in diaphragmic breathing a bit but never really took it seriously.. I am trying to take it seriously to see if it can help. So far it has not helped much but I will try to stick with it to see if it does eventually... I am going to bed thinking about how it is going to be yet another year where I never kissed anyone. I hate having this problem. I am so glad you have found us. I have had it since I was 10 and there are a lot of other people here who can relate and support you with this.\n\nI totally get where you are coming from with that anxiety- I have really struggled with it but have recently gotten in a relationship and I just avoid eating when I her and I have had no problems. She knows about it and is really understanding. I let my anxieties get in my way for a long time but taking the risk is so worth it. I know there is someone out there who will love and accept you for who you are and you RS. So I have had these symptoms since at least my early high school years (23 now). When I was younger I told my parents about it and I got some stomach test done but they did not find anything wrong with me so nothing came of it. I have not seen a doctor about it or looked into it much since then, it is easy to forget about as it is so normal for me and I think I hide it fairly well from people close to me so it never comes up. I decided to look up the symptoms again and found out about this rumination syndrome, which I do not think I have heard of before. I would love to go to a doctor and bring this up so I could maybe get some behavioural therapy, but in the current circumstances of COVID-19 I am not sure it is worth visiting a doctor, as I live with my not young (but not elderly) parents.\n\nI am glad there is actually a name for this and that, while uncommon, there is other people out there going through the same thing! \n\nDoes anyone know of any behavioural therapy techniques, like diaphragm breathing, that I could try on my own? I suppose I could guess the diaphragm breathing strategy but it would be good if there was a structure to follow.\n\nThanks in advance! I have seen videos online which can help you to practice but I found it very difficult at first so having an actual person teach me was invaluable.\n\nAgreed go to the doctors after COVID had blown over a little- it is not like RS is life threatening so it should be okay. \n\nI have not heard of any other methods so far but muscle relaxers have been spoken about. Therapy can help just as much as these and provide a more long term solution from what I know as anxiety and depression can cause RS. Or life stresses in general.\n\nGood luck and we are here for you! Ok I will have a look online but will definitely visit a doctor when I can.\n\nI suppose medication would be good if it is been known to help but I would probably rather do therapy anyway, as you said it is more long term and I feel like it would probably get to the root of the problem more than muscle relaxers and such.\n\nThank you! And thanks for your help! I can make it stop only if I practice diaphragmatic breathing after each meal. This was impossible before the virus lockdown as I could not simply lie down in school.\n\nIf you practice diaphragmatic breathing for long enough does the reflex weaken? I do not want to have to diaphragmatically breathe in the future. Sorry but no I have not noticed any overall change in how much I regurgitate or the strength of it coming up but I do recommend it still as a useful tool for emergencies. Say you are in a post lunch work meeting/ job interview. When you are not speaking the breathing could be invaluable. Or on a date.\n\nI had the same problem when I was in school which is why it is good to practice so you can eventually do it when sitting or standing. Then you can use it in school and other social situations and it helps at the time.", "Potentially Have Rumination Syndrome Over this whole quarantine, things have been stressful. About 2 months ago, after eating, I would start to feel anything I just ate reenter my throat but I would just swallow once I did. A couple weeks after, it started making it is way all the way up. It is nothing digested, no acid. Whenever it come back up, I just rechew and swallow. I have thought it to be unusual but nothing alarming. \n\nFollowing this, I learned that I can essentially do it on command too. However, it keeps getting worse and worse because it is constantly happening for the hour or two after I eat. It only seems to stop once I start to taste any acidity. It is becoming really annoying...\n\nNo idea what this is or why its happening. It seems so sudden. I looked into it today and this disorder is what I found and it sounds spot on.\n\nNevertheless, I think I have this disorder. Now, how do I go about stopping this? If I really put my mind to it, I can kind of prevent it. I can still feel it wanting to come up. However, I cannot keep my mind on it all day.\n\nBackground info: 19 y/o male, started to feel this happen when on a cutting diet (started lifting weights 6 months ago and I take diet and training very seriously). I also eat extremely high volumes of low-calorie dense foods so when I am full, I mean I look like I am in my third trimester. Perhaps this is a result of trying to get shredded with some diet guilt I sometimes wanted to act on, as well as COVID stress.\n\nSorry for the disorganized post lol. Thank you for reading. Obviously I cannot diagnose, but I agree what you have described sounds like rumination syndrome.\n\nRumination syndrome is caused by contractions of the abdomen. I find when I am stressed/ uncomfortable my abdomen tenses more, so perhaps this has something to do woth it starting for you.\n\nBecause of this, the best way to help RS is to learn diaphragmatic breathing, which helps to better relax the abdomen and makes it easier to keep food down. It is not a cure, but it is the best tool we know of. Some people opt for muscle relaxers but the effectiveness is debatable. Diaphragmatic breathing seems to be the best option. You can find tutorials on YouTube and it can be hard at first but the more you practice the better you will get and the easier you will find it.\n\nHave you started eating larger amounts of food recently? I was thinking that this also could have helped to trigger RS as it is DEFINITELY harder to keep food down when you have eaten too much.\n\nIf you have any more questions feel free to ask, and welcome to the sub! Yeah, I began eating a lot more volume wise but it would still occur when I was down to 1,950 calories per day with a much lower volume of food. Me I know if you can make \"esophageal burps on command? Yes I know it sound strangrs but I dont ruminiate food, but air , like when i take a deep breath , a gurglind soubds from my stomach comes sometimes with acidity Yeah, I am sure lots of people here can relate to the second bit. Unfortunately aside from diaphragmatic breathing there is not much we know that helps, but keep an eye on the sub and see if anyone comes out with anything. \n\nRumination syndrome can be tricky to deal with because of its impact on social situations, but this subreddit is here to help and support you. If you do worry about these things I promise good friends are more understanding than you would expect.\n\nJust learn diaphragmatic breathing and this will help you to control it at family dinners or dates etc. Good luck!", "I just found this sub, and I feel so validated! I have had this my entire life, my doctor's always said it was just Gerd, but now I know better!\n\nThe breathing exercises work so well! I am gald I can get this part of my life under control.", "Spitting blood So I have had rumination syndrome for as long as I can remember (I am 20 now). I know for some people they cannot control when they bring the food up but because I have had it for so long it is basically voluntary and I can control it. For the most part I do keep it down but I do not have the healthiest of relationships with food and sometimes do throw it up when I am feeling guilty or over indulged, this does not happen often though only every couple of months and for the most part I am fine. Never was diagnosed with anything but I had a bit of an eating disorder when I was 13/14 and used the rumination syndrome to my advantage.\n\nAnyway, last night was one of those occasions after I ate too much and threw up the food as I felt uncomfortable. I am not sure if the two are related but this morning I spat up a large amount of blood that was in my phlegm, I also had some blood in my nose too but not enough for it to be a nose bleed. The roof of my mouth also feels a bit dry and strange, almost like there is a film over it? My throats been very dry too. \n\nI am wondering if the two are related or if anyone else has experienced something similar? Might not even be related for all I know. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. I have contacted my gp and I have a phone appointment on Monday. Joined reddit specifically to post on this subreddit. Obviously rumination syndrome is very unheard of and doctors usually try to pin it down to acid reflux (as I am sure you all know) so I am not sure whether it is even worse mentioning to them on Monday. Any help would be appreciated thanks :) I am assuming from the lack of comments that no one relates to the whole blood-thing, and I certainly do not. Sorry about that, and I hope you are okay.\n\nAside from the blood, I relate to your post so much. I have dealt with al the things you have described through various points in my life, although I do not have AS much control over my rumination as you do. Sometimes it is just nice to know you are not alone. Welcome to the community.\n\nAlso, I recommend r/funny and various meme subreddits based on your interests. Reddit can be a great place, go explore! Definitely see a doctor. Seeing blood is no joke. The doctor said it was probably due to some sort of trauma to the throat such as a scratch when eating crisps? It has happened one more time since then but was not nearly as bad as the first time and this was over a month ago now so I am presuming the doctor was right and I am fine. \n\nAnd it is nice to find other people to relate to, especially when it seems to be a fairly new discovery that most doctors dont even know about. Thanks for the reply!", "Applying for Disability Hi all. I am going to apply for disability Allowance. I have had RS for 18 months and it has been impossible to get a diagnosis or treatment, I live in a small country and that tbh has a very slow medical system even before Covid, now it is basically at a halt. Nobody has really heard of this condition and there seems to be no one who specializes or knows how to treat it. I regurgitate 4 to 6 L a day, I had to quit my permanent job in engineering due to this condition. It is extremely difficult to get disability Allowance in this country. All applications are denied on initial submission; that is the genuine protocol. Only appeals are actually processed. Even for incurable diseases or disabilities applications are denied on the basis of 'disability not expected to last more than 1 year'.\n\nHas anyone applied for Disability before and do you have any advice? Does anyone have any scientific or medical documents stating that this is a chronic condition that lasts years. I understand diaphragmatic breathing is used to manage the condition which I have been attempting myself to no avail, on top of this I developed RS due to bulimia (yeah I know booo, hiss hiss) which I know has a really poor prognosis in comparison to most with RS. NAD but no one knows about it probably because you were to talking to gastroenterologist etc. As i found out till now it is a mental disorder which cannot be seen as organs fail or something visible. Only the consequences of this shit can be visible. The cause is in the brain. I suggest you try to talk with psychologist/psychotherapist. I see you have already found your previous disorder so you probably know/tried therapy as somehow you overcame it (yes?), i just recommend to talk about existing problem now. \n\nI know how bad it can be. 4-6l a day is a huge number (same for me sometimes:\u2019) ). And i feel you. But it feels like you are trying to \u201cremove your problem\u201d quickly to just not to fight anymore. I know you are tired of all of this but please DO NOT GIVE UP. You have come so far and now gained a lot of experience which is probably the best you can have now. And as sad as it may sound, i do not think you may get disability allowence for this mental shit. \n\nBut still - keep goin:)", "Wow discovered this community today! Have any of you kind of started to aspirate some of the regurgitation?  No?? I have not Umm I am not sure I know what you mean, but sometimes if I am leaning over the toilet my rumination accidentally goes out my nostrils which really is not fun. Haha It is like vomiting except you can control it a bit better. I can do it in sets where I take a deep breath because I can feel it coming up. This helps me breathe but during the more difficult ones I struggle to breathe when I was younger omg happened to me recently and i was shocked. not nice do u mean forcing it? Yeah it is really surprising and not very comfortable. It is a little funny looking back on it though yeees:Dd i actually do remember you (nicname) as youre active here and now i wonder what is more we have similar as this RS :D bc i did relate to what youre saying before too Yes, I am the mod! I made the sub a couple of years ago and I am not on Reddit as often anymore but I always come by to check on the sub. I remember you were one of the first people who joined the sub and it made me so happy because I finally found other people who had RS like me! Thanks for sticking around :) oh wow i didnt know that youre the mod. That Is amazing. I think this sub is actually important to most of us here. Tbh i also mostly check reddit for this group. Thanks for that No worries, I am glad you appreciate the sub! It is pretty quiet but I just feel so much better knowing there are others out there going through the same thing, and now I am so used to it I hope I can help newcomers. Thanks for how active you are too- whenever I see you comment it is always nice :)", "Im a teen boy with this ED I am a 15 yr old teen boy. I have had a few eating issues. When I was a kid at ablut 8-12 yrs old I was overweight and very chubby. I used food as a stress reliever. Then I turned my life around and lost weight went through puberty and became a nice looking boy. Then I was called \"too skinny\" for a while. \"I wasnt..\" Then I got into working out and as soon as covid hit i became a little depressed. That and my gf made me feel awful. I started binge eating and night eating. It was followed by fasting and exercise to keep from gaining weight. Sometime I started to develop a strange disorder called rumination syndrome. This is where i usually overeat or eat a lot at once. Then the food comes back up the throat and I rechew/reswallow it. I did it because it comforted me. It is something i cant stop. Its just like my body is used to it. It causes me to sometimes throw up too. I once threw up in a store. It was a small piece of food and I had to quickly pick it up and throw it away to avoid being seen. I feel so alone. It is a rare disorder. No one will take it seriously. I feel embarrassed. \"Am I mistake....?\" Someone please explain why this happens and what I can do to help quit this.. Also I eat alot at night. I get up and eat multiple times. My family also seems to bug me about it. They encourage disordered eating unknowingly. I then wake up so full and bloated. That I have to fast until dinner or else I will gain weight since I ate so many calories the night before. Please help I feel alone.. DW you are not alone, this is exactly my story minus the gf. I was a chubby kid, then nearly malnourished, and began ruminating as I got out of it. I am sorry but it is very very unlikely anyone will understand and/or sympathize with you, I have not told anyone because they would think it is an ED which is is not, it is purely involuntary and you are as much at fault as a man born blind is for not being able to see.\n\nThere are treatments online like breathing techniques that could aid, but I would suggest just eating more at the beginning of the day, and taking walks afterwards in quiet areas so if you truly have to spit it out you can.\n\nAlso I cannot stress this enough there is a pandemic, the economy's in shambles, dictatorships practically run the world, and our planet's climate is totally screwed. No one cares if you are fat, and if they do then that is their problem, just enjoy life. Hi there, I first got RS when I was around 10 and I have struggled with my eating. I know how you feel and can relate to you in some respects.\n\nI used to find ruminating pretty comforting too, just because I have always used eating as a coping mechanism. I have been anorexic, then I had a binge eating disorder where I would just eat until I felt sick. It was not something I could help- I had nothing in my life except food. It filled my time and gave me comfort. My therapist described it as me filling an emotional hole in my body with food. So yeah, I get you. It is hard.\n\nPersonally, I do not view RS as an ED, just because for me EDs have always been something I had control over/wanted to do at the time (e.g starve myself) and had more to do with my mental health, whereas RS is an involuntary habit of the body. To phrase it better, EDs have always been a \u2018mind\u2019 thing for me, whereas RS is a \u2018body\u2019 thing. I am not really involved. But either way they are not great.\n\nYou can work on your disordered eating by working on your mental health, self-worth and relationship with food. That is easier said than done, but you can do it :)\n\nRS is a habit of your body, so you cannot just magically stop, unfortunately. To deal with RS we use diaphragmatic breathing, which is a type of breathing which helps to relax the abdominal muscles and gain some control over our rumination. You can look up tutorials on YouTube.\n\nPerhaps you could consider seeing a therapist, because they could help to guide you and aid you with your body struggles.\n\nThat is all the advice I have, I hope you are okay and I hope things get better for you.", "Crying helps Rumination syndrome? Just thought I would share this. On a train ride a few weeks earlier I had a really difficult time with RS. I was throwing up in my mouth for two hours straight amongst a bunch of people. Spitting in a bottle.\n\nWhen arriving I had a small panic attack and broke down crying for a while. Anyway after getting done with some business after that, me and my partner had to eat lunch. We decided to eat outside in a nice and calm environment.\n\nI did not regurgitate food once. I felt so amazing and relieved. I was literally walking on clouds considering I had such a bad experience just a few hours before.\n\nI know that crying activates the parasympathetic nervous system so it might be that all my usual spasms stopped temporarily after my breakdown.\n\nI am obviously not suggesting anyone tries to cry before every meal but it made me curious.\n\nHas anyone else had any similar experiences with the body finally calming after a particularly stressful event in the context of RS? Interesting!\n\nHow have your meals gone since? Oh the next meal was a trainwreck as usual lol. But I think for an hour or two my nerves connected to whatever makes my regurgitate were completely relaxed. Yes it does seem logical in a way. Rumination appears to be related to stress and anxiety and tension somehow building up in the stomach muscles. It figures that everything that relaxes the stomach in whatever way seems to alleviate the symptoms. People are reporting that various anti-anxiety meds have an effect too. (just as weed and alcohol seem to have some positive effect)\n\nWith so little research out there, it is up to us to try every possible lifehack out there :) I personally think we deserve regular stress-relieving massages and facials under the NHS. Just saying. For health. i have definitely noticed this too. but only for, like, sobbing &amp; bawling -type of crying... definitely not something i could muster up on purpose.", "Anybody have certain foods that are worse for them? I am a 39M who is been dealing with RS for about 6 years now and I have decent days and bad days. Over the last couple years beef has been the worst thing I can eat. Feels like it is stuck in my throat and I have to wretch to get it out. Anyone else have this happen to them?  Constantly i struggle with beef also greasy foods heavy foods and stodgy foods fruits &amp; veggies are tough for me. they always are the first thing to come up after a meal and it only takes one or two cycles of RS before they start tasting absolutely awful. especially leafy greens like cooked spinach Perhaps you should try to chew your food a little more thoroughly, so that it is easier when it comes up. I do remember meat being a little tricky to bring up though, and it is kind of attached by fibres? (Sorry I have not had meat in a while)\n\nFor me foods I find weird to bring up are fried eggs and ice cream. And if I have t chewed noodles properly and they half-come up it is awful. Oh and mange-tout. Mange-tout is horribly stringy I wish we could pinpoint why! Raw veggies, anything too salty or greasy. Some cooked veggies (peppers, sweet potatoes, etc.) are the worst for me, I try to avoid them at all costs Minced beef, spaghetti, vegetables (those these are always disgusting), and pretty much anything in small pieces is best for me since it can come up in whatever volumes it fancies, but anything dense like bread, clumpy cereal, or donuts (my favourite food) feel like heck because I feel the need to bring them up but often they just get lodged in my throat. Oath, if there is one thing that is ok about this disgusting thing it is getting to retaste ice-cream and fish, but vegetables always just taste soft and icky. Soup, curries, stews, and anything with meat - guaranteed to come up again. Minced meat, sushi, and basically anything in large portions are also huge triggers to me. for me it seems like generally anything can possibly come up. However food like ice cream and chocolate DEFINITELY always come up and i hate that cause i love those two foods. creamy stodgy foods are generally quite bad for me. Another one is fish - which tastes especially gross after regurgitation. But I recently read this book and it was talking about how the way we think really affects what actually happens. I am beginning to wonder if it is more of me expecting it to come up when I eat those foods that encourages it. I am not really sure tho. Not a good but chocolate milk is my worst enemy since when I ruminate it, I just cannot because of how acidic and disgusting it tastes in my mouth", "What is your favourite and least favourite food? I love spam cuz its salty and the taste just gets better and better.  \n\n\nBut I hate coke because of the weird texture and it makes my teeth gritty.", "What Is the worst food you have regurgitated? I hate coke because of the weird texture and it also makes ur teeth weird. ", "How do I stop? This is starting to get irritating. I just want to be able to eat normally. Try learning to breathe through your abdomin there are tutorials on YouTube I think. For me I avoided trigger foods and I also learned how to keep it down by clenching all my throat muscles so that it cannot come out, let me know if it works! try distracting yourself with something; try reading something out loud to use your diaphragm muscles to prevent food from coming up; try chewing gum to promote digestion, chewing, and swallowing the food There are breathing exercises but if it is linked to anxiety being on meds or seeing a psychiatrist might help. That is what I am doing. Just being overall less stressed and confident helps heaps Idk if this is allowed, but cannabis, specifically delta 8 has helped me so much.\n\nStudies have shown that it is an antiemetic, but it really helps me with the regurgitating.\n\nI am in my early 20s and have dealt with this daily, and THC and delta 8 have been life changing. I know a lot of people say a lot of things about cannabis, but I cannot overstate the improvement I have had with it.

", "Does ruminating prevent you from losing weight? I have been observing my body and have noticed that even though I am eating more, my body tends to stay around the same weight. Could that be because ruminating forces you to further break down your food?  A symptom included in many RS information sources is weight loss. \n\nBut if you are just reswallowing the food you have, it might take longer to digest because of the trips up and down your esophagus, but at the end of the day, you are getting the same number of calories from it, so I do not think it would affect weight.\n\nIf you spit out what you regurgitate and do not replace it, then yeah, you are probably not actually getting more calories even though you have started to eat more.\n\nHope this answered your question!", "Do I lose the calories when I ruminate? When I ruminate does it prevent the absorbtion of calories? I do feel large bits for example from veggies I had today. Its a mix of some mid/large pieces and also kind of liquidy it always worries me too! my mum once said calories absorption starts in the mouth so did not cared to eat more but why then you can loose or maintain weight when overeating and throwing up? Are you wanting that? That kind of thinking is frightening for me, a recovering bulimic, to hear. Bulimia is HELL. I think i have had this type of ED in the past. The good thing is that I have therapy in 2 weeks, but yesterday I struggled quite badly with my mental health. Only if you spit the food out. If you swallow it the food will be digested eventually and you will intake all the calories from it.", "How long do you regurgitate and how bloated do you feel afterwards? ", "Rumination Syndrome and Weight Loss A while ago I was on the verge of malnourishment with a BMI of about 18, and I have been able to get out of it to a healthy weight, but I am afraid RS will cause me to plummet back to those cold, weak times. A lot of the time it is too toxic to re-swallow so I have to spit it out, then I compensate with more food in a desperate attempt to get necessary sustenance, often resorting to more calorie dense items like chocolate or biscuits as they are lower volume and veggies will be easily brought up.\n\nWhat have been your experiences with RS and Weight Loss? Are there any foods you find are both healthy and will not often come up? Very familiar story, my GF is struggling with the exact same situation. She ends up eating TONS of chocolate at night in the hope something stays in. Very tough situation.\n\nDo not be afraid to experiment with healthy high-fat &amp; high-calorie foods such as greek yoghurt, nuts, coconut oil, avocado, which at least will increase the chance you will not lose weight.\n\nAlso experiment if anything helps before or after eating: breathing techniques, exercise, masturbation, vaping weed, taking a hot bath or cold shower. Everything that helps you keep inside 100 cals a day more, could be the long term difference between a healthy weight and a dangerous low weight. It is actually quite the opposite, I lost a lot of weight, I went from being obese to being in quite good shape, now with RS I am afraid that if I eat more food, I will get fat again but I am also afraid I am not eating enough for my workouts to be effective i am in the hospital as i write this actually and i am having a really bad experience with losing too much weight as a result of rs and i am at a bmi of 14 with low glucose levels and other malnourishment issues. nearly every time i eat, i eat way past fullness to try and keep some calories in but it is been extremely difficult and nothing sticks", "I think I have Rumination syndrome Ok so I have been doing some research cuz I have always just been able to throw up, I never thought much of it and only went to the doctors once they just told me to stop. I have always been able to do it, it is almost always willingly cuz I just like re eating things. I never thought of it as a bad thing cuz as a kid the other kids thought it was cool and wanted to see and I told them I did not eat anything so I got free food out of it. I just found out it was what has been causing my heartburn and like I do not know what to do with this information. It is not something serious for me and no one knows about it cuz I guess they just forgot.. plus I moved in with my grandpa and he is never known of it but other the rotting my teeth and heartburn I am totally fine... I have issues with my teeth too, especially as I have weak enamel anyway. The only thing that helps is higher fluoride content toothpaste which helps protect really bad teeth.\n\nHave you tried heartburn medications like gaviscon? It even tastes kind of nice if you get the tablets, though I hear the liquid is more effective.\n\nWe get you with the whole re-eating thing. It is not like the food tastes bad as it has not been digested  fully.\n\nIf you want to confirm you have RS, I think that the key signs are that you usually bring up about a mouthful of food, and it still tastes like the food even if the texture has gone weird. I am not a doctor though so I cannot diagnose you. I can definitely relate to the re-eating portion. I used to think when I was younger I get to eat things twice but for for half the calories! But that is kind of a fucked up mindset so lol. \n\nI think I have had some teeth issues, mostly with enamel. My dentist has not said anything about it in years though so I assume it is not to damaging. If you have not already, get a dental check up. \n\nI also suffer with acid reflux that is worsened by rumination though and I take Tums when it is acting up. If it is more serious for you, ask your doctor for a Prevacid prescription. This is the same thing that me and my twin brother have had since as long as we can remember. Ice cream comes back up still cold and chips still crunchy... our mom had it as well. It is like we have full control of our esophagus muscles!", "cannot keep water down either ", "I Just Got Diagnosed. What is Your Experience? So I am in my mid 20s. Ive had this going on since October 2019. I ruminate everything, even my medicines on an empty stomach sometimes. I eventually had to quit my job and go on benefits cause it was just too disruptive to my life. Even if I swallow the food keeps coming back up only with weirder textures and tastes and more acidic and prolongs the episodes by hours. Has anyone else had to give up working with this condition? I used to faint with it or when covid started I was able to work from home so I would eat, it would end up by the time I was finished a regurgitation episode I would just collapse from the tiredness-thisbput me behind target and I would end up working till the early hours of the morning trying to catch up. Everything I regurgitated used to be super acidic but I think that is because my first doctor prescribed me medicine to enhance acid production-if I drank a cup of milk it would come up a minute later curdled. I have changed doctor and some time has passed, I had to go off my PPIs for a week and it was nowhere near as acidic. It is normal mostly. Has anyone else here had to give up work with this condition? If not how do you get around it. I figured between commutes if I had back my full time job there would be a 13 hour gap between waking up and my first meal of the day (I would have to avoid food completely as my episodes can end up being 2 hours long so I would have to miss breakfast and not eat any snacks or food or drinks during breaks). I stopped eating spaghetti and only eat apples after a meal. The spaghetti tastes awful when ruminated. The apples give everything the worst texture ever. I do not find it that distuptive to my workflow, I just ruminate and work and chew and work. I do not notice I am ruminating half the time. I do avoid foods that are acidic for me when they come up, like orange juice and weetabix. I think this varies from person to person. I had omeprazole (I think) for a while to lower my stomach pH so that my rumination and ASMR as acidic. I do not take it anymore though as I do not have any issues with acidic regurgitation.\n\nIf you are constantly over a toilet spitting it out then I would imagine it is extremely disruptive, but I re-chew for ease. Sometimes if it is something too spicey or I hate the texture then I will keep a cup by me and keep spitting it out into there (if I am alone) then I just empty it when the episode is over.\n\nI have never experienced any dizziness or fainting from this condition, and have never heard of anyone who does aside from you. I used to struggle with acid reflux for the longest time (I thought it was normal ig), and then as my eating habits got worse and I started bingeing/overeating I became familiar with the regurgitation aspect of it lol. I can tell when I eat too much since I will spend the next 1-2 hours just  reprocessing my meal, which is like fine if its cereal or some shit but not so fun if it is super spicy korean instant noodles.", "Unknown cause regurgitation So I have bad non acid regurgitation dozens times a day per testing but they do not know why.  It makes my asthma much much worse, and deep breathing makes me more nauseous not less.  It happens the worst with exercise or after large meals, and only reaches my mouth maybe once a day.  The doctors are not very helpful and will not say what is.  Does this sound like your experiences with rumination? I can feel my rumination coming up, though most of the time I do not notice it. It starts coming up a couple mins after I have finished eating and can last up to 7 hours afterwards, but  usually lasts 3. I rarely feel it coming up and have it NOT reach my mouth. The amount is small enough that I can keep it in my mouth and re-swallow it. It is only acidic on occasion when I have really acidic foods. I am just so used to it that I do not realise I ruminate most of the time. I have had this for like 7 years now. I do know that it comes up more strongly if I overeat, but it will still come up even if I just have a small portion of food. Exercise does not make it worse I do not think, for me at least. I do not get any nausea with it, it just comes up and gets swallowed again.\n\nThat is my experience, I hope that helps :) Try chewing your food for a longer time than you normally would, mashing it completely before chewing. \nIn my case i have developed a habit of gulping food without chewing it properly. Over the period of last one year i have practised over chewing and that makes it impossible for me to regurgitate food. \nException is salty or non vegetarian food, wherein the chicken chunks will still comeup.\n\nI dont mind regurgitation or rumination, but, im afraid it is gradually creating a problem in my food tract. Hence I decided to consciously alter my eating habits to stop this habit. I recently started working out again and I also feel like it makes my rumination syndrome worse.  Even though I had eaten hours before working out the second I got to my car I started spitting up and it was the worse feeling ever.  I also feel like deep breathing makes me even more nauseous and idk how to fix it.", "celebrating a whole day without regurgitation after a good 2 years of constant and daily regurgitation of my meals, i have decided to try and stop it as whole on my own. yesterday was hard as i was consciously stopping myself, but i find that every meal i go without regurgitation makes me feel a sense of accomplishment. i have been practicing diaphragmatic breathing and when i feel a discomfort i will have some peptac liquid. a big tip is to burp rather than regurgitate. my mouth feels cleaner and i feel better and i know i can do this!! good luck That Is really great. We al know how hard it can be to stay motivated. I hope it is still going well. You can do this! thank you so much!! its so hard to explain to others what the issue actually is cos i get the usual \u2018it will be acid reflux\u2019 and yeah its been fine i nearly did it the other day but recognised and stopped so its been good. again thank you for your kind words :) Wow I am so proud of you for coming this far! I normally would have given up by now. Congrats :)", "Did regurgitation stop for anyone I find this so annoying I regurgitate everything even orange juice in the morning :( No. I am trying diaphamic breathing and it only sort of helps. I also found that distracting myself/physically moving or talking after I eat helps mitigate it but does not completely stop it. Gum is another thing that sort of helps, but getting food stuck in it is icky so maybe try one of the other things and when it lessens try Gum? These are just things I do, I have not managed to stop it completely yet. For a while when I was on 10mg Lexapro, I am having a problem where medicine is getting less effective over time. Not altogether, but it happens MUCH less frequently now. I can go weeks without regurgitating, I just have to be mindful of how much I eat/what I eat (definitely have trigger foods). That, and diaphragmatic breathing as others have mentioned.", "Not sure? Probably for more than 4 years now I have had issues with my food that keeps coming up after I have eaten it, and it can be hours after I have eaten. When the food comes back up I usually chew it again (because I like too), and I know how messed up that is. When I feel the urge to burp knowing that food will come up, I will do it. It is like a subconscious thing, and I am too ashamed to tell anyone. Even I think it is messed up, knowing that I regurgitate my food and chew it again? I do not know what to do. I feel like anyone I tell will just be disgusted in me. That is exactly how mine works. There is no reason to be ashamed, it is my impression that for most people it works this way. Maybe I have just gotten so used to it but I do not really see it as gross anymore. It is not really vomit since it is undigested and not acidic at all (at least at first). I have had it for as long as I can remember so I never went through a stage I thought it was gross, but I realized upon reading more about it that others might find it gross, so I have never felt compelled to tell others about it.\n\nIf you want a potential preventative, personally I have found if I take a cayenne pepper capsule or a multivitamin capsule, a lot of the time that will prevent the rumination.   \nOnce you have ruminated and the contents of one of those capsules touch my mouth, it is not a good taste and discourages the cycle from continuing for that particular meal. (I only take them like once a day though, and just something I noticed from doing such.) I have had the same anxieties with telling people, and it can sound gross but it is nothing to be done shamed of. It is not your fault. And I agree- when I was younger especially I found bringing up sweets and things really fun.\n\nI do not think you should feel guilty about enjoying chewing it either. What other people do not realise is that when people with RS regurgitate food it is not sick- it is usually got its original flavour. From my perspective, you enjoying it is making the best of the situation. It is far better than the opposite.\n\nWhen telling people they may be shocked at first but just explain to them and I am sure they will understand. They are definitely but going to outcast you for it or anything and if they do then you are better off without them. My partner knows about my RS and loves me no less, same with my friends. Do not lose hope :) Oh but if you have eaten something what takes longer to digest (idk if i am right, i just think that way) for example, for me it is always an apple, after ~3-4h it comes back with a pretty disgusting taste.\n\nWhen i was reading last sentence i wanted to somehow attack you immediately, (sorry for that even if it was only the thought) but then i saw \u201cat least at first\u201d and omg it is so true to me. I just always have it and i hate it. No problem my dude you are totally right if like more than an hour passes it can be really acidic. I usually have the most ~episodes~ between 5-30 minutes after a meal so the majority of the time it is not acidic for me.", "Happy to find this sub! I have perused the sub and am checking all the boxes to most of what you say.\nI have not found the one sensation that I am currently having amongst the sub.\n\nSo, does anyone tummy have a constant rumbling feeling in their tummy around meal times? Even after. It does not hurt or anything. It is just confusing because it feels like it is going to start hurting. No, I cannot say that I do.\n\nRS is where we subconsciously bring up our food by habit of the body. Basically our abdominal muscles contract outside of our control, causing indigestes food to come up. This food is pretty much the same as it was when we swallowed it. We do not do it on purpose and do not have much.\n\nI hope that helped. If you agree with all of the above then maybe the tummy rumbling is a seperate issue?", "Just fucking cannot with this SHIT anymore :(. I am 16 (M). I have had rumination syndrome every single day since around thanksgiving in 2020. The doctors think it might have been caused by some very stressful stuff I went through in July 2020, and did not pop up until around thanksgiving. I started ruminating, then I went down with a stomach bug, it got really bad, and has never gotten better. It fucking sucks. I love cooking and I am good at it, and I like eating too, but I can only enjoy good food that I make myself or that people make for me for a while, before I am ruminating every couple minutes for hours. It is Fourth of July and every one is eating food and having a good time and I am not eating because I am still ruminating from the food I ate 7 hours ago. The only time I do not feel sick is if I have not eaten, but if I do not eat for too long I get really bad stomach pain. I am depressed as fuck most of the time because of this shit. I have had almost no success with diet change, diaphragmatic breathing, and other treatments I have read about. Weed works, calms me down and in turn helps my stomach settle, but I do not enjoy getting stupid high after every meal, because it ends up with me depressed and/or unmotivated. Im pretty desperate for some kind of treatment. There are only a couple things that make me happy anymore. All I want is to get better.. A lot of this post is just a vent I guess. But if someone knows of something that might help with this god awful condition, please dm me or comment. Thanks \ud83d\ude4f I heard someone say once that unexpectedly, their anxiety meds helped with their RS? I suppose it helped them relax? That is all I can sugggst apart from diaphragmatic breathing to be honest. Good luck, I am sure you will find something that works for you! Do you feel sick or are you just grossed out by yourself for ruminating? I have had rumination syndrome for literally as long as I can remember, and at 26 years old, I am past the point of it disgusting me LOL. But I figure if it had started recently for me, I would feel somewhat upset over having it come up out of nowhere, so I am sorry you have to deal with that :(\nI also personally do not notice any negative effects with it (as in, I do not feel nauseated with RS. The food regurgitation just... happens.)\n\nHave you tried chewing gum? I have chewed gum for years and years and it is one of the number one things that I find helpful. I do not know if it would be helpful for you or not, but it is worth a shot. Go for a sugar free gum (I like anything sweetened with xylitol, as it is actually GOOD for your teeth) and see how it works for you. I think the chewing motion/having something in your mouth helps prevent rumination because you do not usually bring food back up while eating, right?\n\nGood luck, hope you try it and it works for you as it does for me! The best way to describe the \u201csick\u201d feeling is a sort of pressure buildup in my stomach, which is only relieved by my body ruminating. It is very uncomfortable and gross. I will try gum too. Thanks \ud83d\ude4f Edit: forgot to say that if you are a minor, probably do not take my advice since you have to be a certain age to buy delta 8. Although if you are already smoking weed, I do not see the harm in suggesting a more legal, less psychotropic, less motivation-sucking alternative.\n\n\nDelta 8 is what helps me the most. It is a powerful antiemetic like Delta 9 in ~traditional weed~ but it is federally legal in the US and never gets me more than pleasantly buzzed and relaxed. No anxiety or paranoia either. \n\nPretty much a miracle drug for me, though you have got to make sure to get the good stuff, not the sketchy head shop stuff. Idk weed works for me and I am allowed to smoke, on the way to get my med card. Never found it to be \u201cmotivation-sucking.\u201d I have tried delta 8 and I did not like the way it made me feel, got me paranoid and stuff.
