["CMT or CIDP or both? I was recently diagnosed with severe sensory-motor demyelinating polyneuropathy.  The differential diagnosis was CMT and CIDP.  The neurologist diagnosed me with CMT based on having high-arched feet and family members with the same feet/lack of coordination.  I am not sure whether this is the right diagnosis or not.  My symptoms are mostly sensory nerve pain in my feet and legs and muscle tightness.  They have come on over the last nine+ months.  I can still walk and stand on my toes but my balance does feel less steady subjectively.  I am seeking a second opinion.  What is the best way to distinguish these two conditions? Genetic testing? I have also read of cases where people had both CMT and CIDP--how is this discovered?\nThanks in advance. I am pretty overwhelmed by this new information.", "Wife pregnant with X-linked Male We are expecting our first child, which is obviously very exciting! In the recommended testing after pregnancy, my wife was diagnosed with CMTX, which was the first we would ever heard of the disease. Luckily, my wife only suffers very minor symptoms, which have gone unnoticed to this point. Through additional tests, we have just discovered our baby boy will carry the mutated gene. We have heard that CMTX is generally more severe with men, but we are curious to understand more so that we can be prepared. Thank you!! Congrats on your pregnancy! I have CMTX as does my father, my uncle, my aunt, and several female and male cousins. It varies in how it affects each person. However, no one in our family had any real issues until we became adults. But I think we all rolled our ankles a lot as teenagers. \n\nMy one male cousin with it has pretty bad foot drop which he is had since his late 20s or early 30s. He showed signs the earliest of anyone in our family. One of my female cousins has worse symptoms than my dad had at her age. In fact, my dad is less affected than his sister. For some perspective, my aunt is in her 80s and has been in a wheelchair for a few years. My dad can barely walk at 78, but he also has a host of other issues that cause that as well. He had no signs of anything until his mid 30s or 40s. Back then, the doctors told him not to exercise, but he ignored them and I think that is why he fared better than his siblings.\n\nDo not get too worried. CMTX does not affect kids the way some other variations of CMT do. And all the affected men in my family have lived happy, productive lives. No one has let CMT stand in their way. Your son will live a happy life. \n\nI have a newborn daughter and go back and forth on whether to get her tested. I was told they could not test until after she was born, but maybe that was just from non-invasive testing since I made it clear I would not do any invasive testing. I am curious, did you find out through CVS? Or amnio? Also, did your wife find out through doing that standard attery of genetic tests?  There are over 200 variations of CMT, and my cousin paid about $10,000 about 5 years ago to identify which variation we had. I am curious if/how testing has changed in such a short time.

I am wondering whether stresam (etifoxine) could potentially Increase neuropathy as i read that it increases progesterone? please correct me if i am wrong That is a good question. \n\nI am assuming you are asking for type 1A specifically?  \n\n  \nMy quick search of the literature has not turned up anything specifically addressing this question. It is not listed on the CMTA's drug list, but you might want to see if you can email them. They have access to CMT researchers who might be able to give an educated guess at least.\n\nIf you find an answer, I would love to hear about it. I am not sure which type i have thus far as i am awaiting genetic testing but its obvious that it is CMT as my mother and her brother has it. I have sent them an email now and hoping for a reply :) have you tried piracetam? No, I had never even heard of piracetam.", "Invitea Genetic Testing question I got my invitea test results back and saw my neurologist.  I have taken her up on the offer to see a genetic counselor because I am still confused. CMT runs in family on my dad's side. Everyone with it did not get symptoms until middle age. For my dad it was age 50. My neurologist has told me I definitely have small fiber sensory neuropathy. My EMG nerve velocity tests are all normal. I have also previously been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. \nMy Invitea results show  5 variants I have that are not associated with any disease on the main page. But further down it talks about 5 individual mutations and what they are associated with. \nI dont understand if that means I have those 5 variants but I dont have CMT because everything else is normal now and I may end up with it later or if it means I dont have the variants.   I dont even have an appointment with the genetic counselor scheduled yet. Still waiting on the referral to go thru.\nWondering if anyone had any knowledge about this or similar experiences that can help shed light on my situation. Thank you Oh man, it sounds like they presented those results in a very confusing fashion. You will probably have to wait for a genetic counselor to sort it all out, but do you know what type of CMT runs in your family? A normal nerve conduction velocity test usually indicates that you do not have CMT1A but it does not rule out all of the other types of CMT. And something must be causing the small fiber sensory neuropathy, so if not CMT then what? \n\nYour 5 variants... I am going to guess at what those are about, but it is only a guess. They may have looked at certain genes that they know could cause CMT or be other causes of your small fiber sensory neuropathy or be associated with some other issue, fibromyalgia or something. They may have looked at a lot of such genes, and they found something in 5 of those genes that was not what they would normally expect to see but which is also not a variant which is known to be a problem. So they flagged those genes because they are different than expected, unknown. Are they a problem? Or are they perfectly fine variations that just have not really been seen before because our knowledge of human genetics is still limited? Maybe they do not know for sure. Maybe they can look at your clinical results with that list of 5 variants in hand and say \"oh, if this gene is not working right, that would totally explain your symptoms, so that is likely the problem, this variant #3 (or whichever) is not OK\" but making that kind of determination is complicated. Hopefully there is enough evidence that points the same way for a firm diagnosis that explains both your genetic results and your symptoms, but there might not be. Was this one of those over the counter genetic tests? A lot of those are not recomended by heath professionals as they give misleading results or information.CBC, a newsgroup in Canada did a whole episode about these tests and their flaws. At home kits with saliva are not the standard in the medical profession. The genetic counselor will probably have you do a blood test. From there they look at the PMP 22 gene. These results are better and comprehensive. No, it was not. I used Invitae and the genetic counselor was able to tell me my specific \u201ctype\u201d of CMT\u20262A.  They then tested my children for cheap\u2026so glad. \n\nIn short, the genetic counselor &amp; neurologist will hopefully be able to get it into easy to understand language for you", "My mom has CMT My mom has CMT, I am only 23 years old and I do not know how to help. She has been dealing with it for about 2 years. Originally she was just walking slower. Now she needs a walker and braces to walk and has trouble cooking; showering; almost everything. It is been hard to watch her go through this, Staying home during the pandemic has made it worse. I feel lost, alone, and do not know how to help. She sees a PT twice a week and that is the only thing she does. But I feel as if there are other options out there for help but I do not know where to look. Does anyone have any words of advice or suggestions on what has made their lives better? I feel like we are out here doing nothing and I just want to make her life easier. I am sorry you and your mom are going through this. PT twice a week is very helpful (depends on the therapists of course.)\nIf you are not connected to the many CMT groups out there, that can be good too. There are several on Facebook. I personally like the Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation (\nGood luck. There is a lot of help and resources out there. What type does she have? How old is she? One thing to look for would be an occupational therapist that has experience with CMT. They can recommend tactics and devices to help with every day life tasks. I am unsure of the type and mid 50s The type is very important. If you have not done a blood test yet I recommend to do it. You should also test yourself and any siblings as it has a 50% chance to carry down in genes. She had genetic testing and they said technically cannot diagnose her because she does not have one of the confirmed genes but every neurologist says she definitely has it so I do not know if they can determine which type. And i know I should get tested but i do not know if it would even help because my moms technically does not prove it.  It all feels so overwhelming on top of school and a pandemic I do not have a known mutation either.  My Dad has the same thing.  The neurologist did EMGs and said it is \"axonal\" and not primarily myelin.  That means it is not CMT1.  CMT2 is axonal, but our is late onset and not typical CMT2.   I had whole genome sequencing done, along with my Dad and siblings.  I now have 5 different theories about our neuropathy, based on our mutations.\n\nMy latest theory is a rare genetic defect in the \"Urea cycle\", possibly causing a ( which can cause neuropathy (and psych disorders ;)   Neither the gene nor the mutation is in the standard \"Neurological Panel\" that the doctor did.   I am currently experimenting with amino-acid supplements used by body builders:  Arginine, Citrulline, and Ornithine.  I am finding the Arginine instantly eliminates the \"pins and needles\" in my feet, but the effect only lasts a few hours (half-life of Arginine is only 90 minutes).  I am not sure, but I think it might be reversing it.\n\nIt is also possible that the Arginine only works because it is a vasodialtor.\n\nIt is unlikely that your Mom has the same thing -- but the point is -- there is lots of stuff you can do, and the advances in genetic analysis are accelerating ;)\n\nTell us more.  Keep us up-to-date.  Good Luck and Best Wishes! Sorry, but I had not heard of ( until now, and you admit that it is one of \"many CMT groups out there\".  It seems like they all have the same generic content, uplifting stock photos, a big \"Donate\" button, and very limited patient participation.\n\nCould someone please tell me which is for real ?   They all seem phony to me.   I really dislike anything that is primarily Facebook.   So far, reddit serves me just fine -- I do not join any of them. wow thank you for sharing! I think my main struggle is getting her to look into things and open to seeing more doctors or doing our own research, just trying to do something. i cant force her yaknow.\n\nI have been trying to find support groups for people in my situation but its been difficult.", " Friday Feelings - Small Celebrations Little things that went right this week. \n\nTimes when CMT could not stand in your way.\n\nVictories that you want to share.

I am down nearly 30 lbs of fat since Jan 1.  200-173. \n\nI have also been putting on a surprising amount of calf muscle with all the stationary biking I have been doing.  \n\nI feel like I am making good progress, I can actually balance on one foot for about 5 seconds haha.  \n\nThis disease can make the fight more difficult, but that just means I will become a stronger fighter.  I hope anyone who reads this may find some motivation from my progress.  Im happy to answer any questions about my workout/ diet for those curious.  I am not a trainer or anything, but have some tips about working out with CMT I can share for sure.  Anyway I tend to ramble on haha. 30 lbs is 13.62 kg Great job!  I love stationary bikes.  \n\nDo not be afraid to take some rest days, maybe 40 min for 3 days and then a rest day, and repeat.  Up to you though on your goals of course.  Anyway I am always happy to see people enjoying cycling, they are one of the greatest inventions.  Keep it up! Being able to balance on one foot for 5 seconds is great! That is a really hard task for us, with all the small muscle corrections involved. The elevator is broken. I have class on the 5th floor. I did not skip class. Good for you!", "Quick question I have been having trouble swallowing food, liquids, etc. It is difficult and almost painful, with it becoming more and more difficult, to the point where I throw up my food because I cannot get it down.\n\nHas anyone else had or have this problem? Any advice? I have difficulty swallowing sometimes. I have read it is a symptom of CMT but unfortunately still trying to figure out what will help. My mother has the same problem. For her the issue started when a certain medication messed with her CMT muscles.\n\nAre you on any statins? I am going to say no because I do not know what that is. Do you know what the medication that worsened her symptoms is called? It was a statin for cholesterol. It took a few weeks, but once the damage was done she never recovered. She now has to watch everything she eats to make sure she can swallow. This is a very serious \"see a doctor\" kind of question. Anything related to breathing should be treated extremely seriously I am sorry that happened, my prayers to her. That will be something to keep in mind if I need it someday. As of right now, I am not on anything. I do not remember when it really started, just within the last year. It is gotten more noticeable these past few months, but I am thinking it is just weakening from my pregnancy. A&amp;E now!\nIt could be a number of serious issues and little chance bring y related to CMT I have had this for months now, and I have been in the hospital twice in the last month-separate issue-but they never said anything about it. I have seen it related to cmt because of weakness, which has progressed since pregnancy. CMT \"should\" only affect the distal nerves, hence the main issues being in the hands and feet. You are throat would not fall into this category so I would suspect it is something else eg extreme allergies as hormones can really mess up your immune system. \nBut regardless, go back to the doctor's and chase them for a diagnosis. I truly hope you are able to reverse the problem. It might not even be CMT related, but then again, CMT is such a tough disability to hammer down... \ud83d\ude22 My mom &amp; brother who both have CMT have this issue. Bro has choked before, and mom throws up her food sometimes. For my bro it seems worse with chicken/bread Did it happen gradually or anything trigger it? Thank you. And true but everything is just coming on at the same time. Just trying to see what I can do while I got time. Every cmt listing has swallowing as a symtom as well. I am seeing a neurologist soon, hopefully. If they give me anything that helps, I will go with it and post here for an update. Good luck! Although the issue with CMT is that they list many issues but they do not know the cause and if its directly or indirectly caused by CMT. It is the same thing with CMT causing muscle wastage. It started happening over the last 5-10 yrs as they have aged. Mom is 60 bro is 40. They think it is CMT related Thank you. Hopefully, it is all related. I do not want something else wrong with me on top of everything, that would be shit. Sensitive question, how is there severity of cmt? Nothing with breathing, that is a different issue all together. Just eating.", "Diagnosis with CMT on Tuesday...... Hi all \n\nI found out on Tuesday I have CMT (DNA testing is happening to confirm with type I have). \n\nI am 32 and only found out I have it from going to my doctor about possibly carpal tunnel which lead her to have a nerve test done on me. We are unaware of any family members with it, but my grandmother might have had it, we have the same feet and my father and I run \"oddly\".\n\nI have mild symptoms some lose of feeling in my feet, pins and needles, a bit of fumbling with my keys and then the high arched feet and hammer toes (at least my siblings cannot poke fun at me feet anymore, suckers! Haha). I was a \"floppy baby\" but met all the benchmarks as a child. I have been fairly active the last 6 years of my life, took up rugby (I am pretty rubbish though, poor hand eye condition) and have been doing crossfit for 2ish years now. I definitely gain muscle slower then others and I cannot seem to squat as much as I used to, that might just be related to covid though.  I am super prone to injury and have bad ankles, knees and hips, I am wondering if this all has to do with CMT. I also had \"growing pains\" in my hips growing up to the point I could not sit and lying on my stomach was the only comfortable position. I still get thenm so they obviously are not growing pains, anyone experience this?\n\nI guess I am just trying to come to terms with all of this and was wondering if anyone is going through or has gone through a similar story as mine? Were you able to keep up they gym or does CMT eventually  catch up to you? \n\nI am also considering starting a family soon, is this something that has made anyone consider adoption instead? I know that is a very personal question so please do not feel like anyone needs to answer. \n\nThanks in advance,\n\nRen if you are heterozygous for the CMT (ie. one good copy and one bad copy of the gene) you could have kids by IVF and 'preimplantation diagnosis' - where they can screen the embryo to see which copy of the gene it got A lot is going to depend on what type you have. Not all can be identified via genetic testing - I have \"unknown type\". Hummm, I did not even know that was a possibility.  I was really hoping funding out the type would give me some more answers. I started having symptoms in my 30s. This disease is slowly progressive. I hope you will not spend too much time worrying. The slowness of the progression will give you time to adjust along the way. I hope you will continue to go to the gym. Keep up? I do not know. There are personal trainers with CMT on Instagram who definitely keep up but we are all different. Exercise is your best tool for staying strong. You can read about family planning options here  Thanks for comment, mind me asking how old you are now and how much it have progressed? Hey Ren!\n\nI am sorry to hear that you have joined the club! Please accept a warm welcome and an Internet hug from me nonetheless, though!\n\nYour story sounds very similar to mine. I had a pretty normal childhood. I only found out two years ago at age 29. I thought I had carpal tunnel, as well. So I went to my family doctor and told her assistant that my Dad has CMT. About a minute later, she barges in, skipping all the pleasantries and starts with trying to find out more about my Dad's symptoms and whatnot. Her words after hearing and thinking for a while were \"I would not even know where to send you...\" But she ended up finding a Dr. that could do an EMG on me. So I went to see the doctor and they did a EMG. I knew that my Dad had CMT, but never thought about it. It was always just \"something Dad had\" and not something for me to worry about. So I told the doctor this and he immediately wrote down **CMT** with three underlines on his notepad. Which was very concerning to me. When he went through with the shocks, he was just going \"oh... tsk tsk tsk\" the whole time. Which, as you can imagine was quite concerning. I suspect that I was the first CMT patient he had ever seen. He told me what I could expect results from my Dr. in the next few days, but I eventually coaxed out of him \"Yes. You have it.\" I was devastated!\n\nNeedless to say, I had a good long cry as soon as I got back in my car. I had driven myself to the Dr.'s office, so it was just me alone with the sudden realization that I had a disease that there was nothing I could do to stop.\n\nI know that it sucks right now. I know it is going to suck for a while. But the tears will eventually dry, you will continue on with your life, and you will be all the stronger for it (even if your muscles have something else to say about it)!\n\nEveryone is different with how their CMT progresses over time, but I can tell you that mine has been (at least thus far) minimally impactful on my life. My forearms are skinnier than they were a couple years ago, sometimes if I type for a really long time my fingers will get tired, my grip strength is weaker, and I have noticed that my calves are skinnier. But I am able to walk without leg braces, and I am able to do everything that I could do before I found out. I actually only rolled my ankle for the first time in recent memory mowing grass a few weeks ago!\n\nAs for having a family, that is a tough one. It is a coin-flip if you pass it on or not (save for the advice in the link that /u/Alphacatpower provided). So you need to think long and hard and talk seriously with your partner about whether or not you want to risk passing it on. Your presentation/progression does not necessarily imply how any children you may have will experience CMT if they get it. They might get it worse, they might go their whole lives never knowing they have it. That is all up to you and your partner to decide if you want to go for it.\n\nI would highly recommend that you find a neurologist (if you have not already) that specializes in CMT. You might also be interested to talk to a Physical Therapist that specializes in neuromuscular diseases. They will give you some exercises and stretches you can do to help slow down progression a little. You will have the best results with going to a (\n\nAnd, of course, your new friends on Reddit are here for you, as well! I am 52 with CMT2A. I have kind of an unusual presentation. I do not have typical foot drop but weakness in planterflextion and bad balance. I wear AFOs and they help loads with that. I did have to give up my extremely physical job as a preschool teacher and move to something more desk based. I am a musician and am still able to play in bands, though. I have two gigs this weekend and two next weekend. I try work out at least every other day with a short high intensity workout to stay strong. I am 31 and have been diagnosed with CMT my whole life. Mine has progressed much faster and more aggressively than my dad\u2019s, and his faster than his mother\u2019s. It seems there is no guarantee that just because one case is milder that the child\u2019s will be too. For my wife and I, my case is severe enough that we do not want to risk passing it on, and our intention is to go through IVF to pick an embryo that is healthy/unaffected.  It is expensive, but that is what seems right to us. Hey, thanks for the response and the warm welcome!\n\nThere has been a fair share of crying some bad some in humorous situations (at the gym on a bike) and I am sure it is going to take a while to get used to. \n\nI have been lucky and my doctor sent me to a specialist at the Toronto General Hospital for a second opinion. This Hospital is also taking part in a medical trial for CMT1a (I think) so if I have that type I can participate.  \n\nI guess the hardest part of this diagnosis is not knowing how it will effect you in the future and how it is now, there has been a lot of connecting the dots for me this past week. \n\nThe family thing is super stressful!\n\nAnyways I will keep everyone posted if I get I to this trial!\n\nCheers Sounds like our situations are similar in terms of fitness capability and goals.\n\nThe physical symptoms you describe are experienced by many people with CMT, but each person's journey, so to speak, is unique to them. It might help to think of it more as a house built with slightly wonky wiring. Issues will manifest in slightly different ways for each \"house\" depending on environment, diet, fitness, etc.\n\nDefinitely encourage you to enjoy the gym as much as possible. I found it freeing to not have to worry about why my lower lifting ability seemed to lag behind, or why I was not nearly as flexible as everyone in the basic lean forward while sitting flexibility test in school.\n\nBeing able to workout my lower body enough to be ok with it and then really go nuts with an upper body workout is great. I am in my 40's now and still like doing pull-ups on random objects just for fun.\n\nI hope your doctors are considerate of your situation, too. I am lucky that mine totally understand I have a wife and two kids. They recommend procedures that *might* help, or I can deal with it as is and let them know when I am ready for another year or more of recovery time. Easy decision right now lol\n\nSpeaking of kids, it definitely helps to know what type you have for no other reason than knowing the transmission probabilities that vary from type to type. My wife and I talked about it early on. We definitely talked about adoption but then had our first kid so the decision was kind of made for us lol\n\nHappy to answer any other questions. Feel free to PM me. Welcome to the club, such as it is!", "When the doctor tells you it is not Carpal Tunnel...  That is very similar to my diagnosis - we thought I had an ulnar nerve entrapment and discovered quite the surprise with my CMT. Five years out, I can definitively say it gets better (not necessarily the symptoms, but the acceptance). Certain things are still challenging, but honestly, life has been great overall since! But I am thinking of you, I remember how hard the beginning was. Always feel free to reach out if you need someone to process with!", "What to expect Hello, my daughter of 14 was diagnosed with Cmt 1a this week. We are completely in shock because there is no one else in our family that shows any signs of CMT. My daughter only shows very light symptoms,, she does not stand straight in her shoes (this started around 3 years ago) and has never been the greatest athlete (she has always gotten tired of longer walks since she could walk) but walks and dances and skis and really enjoys her life. But the EMG indicates that she had already had signs of loss of power in her feet and a little in her hands. Her blood will now be used to tell us more about where she has got it from, what side of the family I mean. \nShe has for now decided that this diagnosis is not going to affect her and I think it is best to let her be. But as her mother I am wondering what she can expect. I have done a lot of reading and I know that every case of CMT 1a is different. (Also I do not wish to imply that being able to do sports is the solid definition for enjoying life but we are new to this and I just try to have an idea of what may come when) . Can she expect to keep walking, can she expect to work with her hands? \nAlso, I know there is no cure yet but are there any medical trials or medicines that people have good experiences with or are hopeful about? I do not wish to sound ignorant to all the pain and efforts everybody here is going through by asking these maybe silly questions it is just that I am trying to put it all into perspective as I am feeling completely overwhelmed\n.Best wishes to all of you\ud83c\udf38. I have CMT of a still-unknown type, but my family has no symptoms at all. I have had symptoms since I was 12, but I was 17 before I was diagnosed. I also pretty much chose to ignore the diagnosis and keep on keeping on. I was never very good at sports or running, but I love being outside, camping, hiking, biking, etc.\n\nMy progression has been fairly slow &amp; steady. In my 20s I lived abroad without a car and still walked everwhere (if a bit slowly). I did not have hand symptoms until I was 26 or 27, and at 28 I decided it was time for AFOs (leg brace orthodics) and that has been great. I am 32 now and still walking, hiking, biking. (A couple years ago I even did a couple overnight hikes through Glacier NP wearing my AFOs which was exhilarating.)\n\nI am a bookbinder, which involves very detailed sewing. Sometimes I have trouble gripping things, so I use an array of grip tools now. Sometimes I have issues with earrings or necklaces, so I replace all the clips with easy fasteners. It is sometimes frustrating and inconvenient, but I do not think that it had limited me in a substantial way. That is not to say her progression will be the same, but for me it has not really stopped me at all. I actually think CMT has ensured I stay more active than I would otherwise. I make sure I use the muscle I have to prevent losing it. \n\nI will say, admitting you need AFOs or help is hard for me, but so, so worth it. Do not let shame or pride stop her from seeking the accommodations she needs. I wish I had gotten AFOs earlier, but that is one of my only regrets. She can still live a happy, active, independent life, it just might look a little different than you planned. CMT has recently revealed itself in my life and I wanted to let you know that your comment has really helped ease my worries. Best wishes to you. I think these are all very normal questions to be asking when you are trying to figure out how this will impact your daughter's life. Every case of CMT1A is different, yes, but one can generally get an idea of how one will progress based on what one looks like at a given time. Her doctors or a good physical therapist who specializes in neurological disorders may be able to give you a more solid idea but it sounds like she will still be walking for decades to come, possibly with minor assistance from AFOs (ankle-foot orthotics, which support the feet if the ankles are too weak). \n\nIt can be harder to predict how much one's hands may be impacted. My hands are basically fine (I am in my mid 40s) except that they tremble slightly. I actually had my hand strength tested a few years ago as part of something else I was doing and they were on the low side of normal, but still within the normal range. Some people do develop significant hand symptoms, but it is rarely something that develops early. \n\nThere are some medical trials going on. There is PXT3003 which is supposed to be doing a Phase 3 clinical trial now, but that has been delayed a couple of times. There are other, earlier stage ideas being explored, from nanoparticles bound to curcumin, to siRNA therapy, gene therapy and more. It will probably be some time yet before there is a real treatment but there are a number of research groups around the world actively working on different approaches to find one right now.\n\nOverall I think her idea to mostly ignore this and remain active is probably a solid approach to where she is at right now. As long as she is not injuring herself, the best advice is to stay active and maintain muscle. She might want to consider also doing some stretches to maintain flexibility if she is not already. \n\nBest wishes to your family as you sort out the path forward for your daughter. I am 56 years old &amp; have CMT2A\n\nChildhood I did athletics, but was slower than most.  Entering HS I stopped sports with lots of ankle twisting. Still played casual sports with friends. \n\nWent to lots of doctor appointments trying to figure out what was going on...years of docs questioning about Polio (nope)\n\nBroke an ankle playing intramural football in college and surgery asst suggested CMT. \n\nWent to a neurologist who diagnosed as CMT, but not specific type. \n\nJust a few years back, I had genetic testing to diagnose 2A (Invitae did the testing). They then tested my children for cheap (both negative woohoo!)\n\nIn recent years I am showing increased weakening in my arms, but still able to do most things.   I cannot run and have declining balance, but AFO\u2019s have helped some. \n\nAnkle reconstructions in 1984, 2009, &amp; 2020\n\nIt impacts people differently, so get informed, keep moving, and protect yourself.

(\n\n***\n\n^(Even if I do not reply to your comment, I am still listening for votes. Check the webpage to see if your vote registered!) It is an automated response built into Reddit from a cluster of bots that try to detect things, such as URLs, haikus and other things. In this case, it was off the mark by a fair bit! What he is doing here is actually \"talking\" to the bot. The command \"bad bot\" is used to tell the bot that it did something wrong, like interpreting a text string in a user commet without understanding the context. By doing this hopefully the bot maker can learn from the incident and make the bot software better.\n\nBots like these scan posts for certain key words and try to post helpful links, but sometimes they fail miserably. We have not as far as I know tried to ban any bots from /r/CMT and I am not even sure if you can except for on a bot by bot basis. iIncidents like these are fortunately very rare though. We have a strong family history of CMT 1a. I have it, two of my children have it and waiting for my youngest to be tested as well. \n\nMy eldest daughter has more issues with her legs, constantly in and out of splints and casting. My son has more issues with his hands than his legs, struggles with writing among other things. I manage well, some pain but I am a nail technician and work constantly with my hands. It shows how much it can vary, even in a family.\n\nStaying active and doing what she normally does will benefit her in the long run. I have always been told by Physiotherapists in the past that if you do not use it (the muscles) you lose it. So keeping nice, low impact exercise in a routine is great. Also look up the spoon theory, this is a great way to describe energy management to people. 38 years old yesterday.  Diagnosed at 8.  \n\nI have CMT 1A, about 4 years ago had the genetic testing to get the type. \n\nI have high arches and hammer toes, but am stubborn and will not get afo yet. I do have custom shoe inserts. I go on short, under 2mi, walks and do some yoga to work on joints.  \n\nMy primary symptoms are balance (heavy footsteps with a kind of penguin waddle), lack of reflexes, lack of fine motor control, and long delay when touching hot objects.\n\nI am a programmer, so I sit at a desk all day.  I have a 90min timer to remind me to get up and move. \n\nLight symptoms are good to have. Exercise is important. Working on strength and stamina will keep what she has from atrophy longer. I was diagnosed around 14 as well. Nobody else in my family has a confirmed case. \n\nI am almost 30 now and can function just fine. I have had a few surgeries to help with pain but I do not wear any braces or anything. I will not ever be a marathon runner, but I am able to work out and exercise often which is important.\n\nYou and your daughter should look into Camp Footprint! It is a free camp in PA for kids with CMT. I am a counselor and have met so many great people with different CMT stories. It would have helped me as a kid to go to this camp. Thank you so much for your story. I read about the Footprint camp but the thing is we live in Holland. And here there is not a big association as you have in the USA. Also my girl would not want to know any of it for now. She has pushed the diagnosis away like it is not there. The truth is I am the one laying awake at night like we have had a dead sentence that she as of now does not comprehend. I have no idea what the future is like for her, when to expect what. Did you find out because you had symptoms if I may ask and does the fact that you where diagnosed comparatively late has to do with you milder progression? We still have to have the results of her blood testing though I do not really understand what more that can tell us. It is all very confusing I have to say and I feel like such a rouky not knowing any of these things. But I must say I am happy to hear that some of your pain was taken away with surgery. That is good to know. You all seem like such strong and brave people. My daughter is too, always dancing and singing. I just want her to live the best life possible. \ud83c\udf38 We have international kids come to this camp too! Also, you can always volunteer as a parent too if you would like. It is very laid back and just gets a bunch of people with CMT together and we have a good time. Growing up, I did not know anyone with CMT, so this camp is just a way for kids (mainly teens) to be able to be surrounded by others with a similar thing going on. \n\nI pushed away my diagnosis too when I was in high school. My first surgery was when I was 14 and right after I was diagnosed. I had high arches and this was to flatten them out. It was just hard for me to walk long distances, but the surgery helped tremendously. \n\nI know you are worried as a parent (I am now a parent of two young kids), but I would definitely not think of CMT as a death sentence. She will not die early because of CMT and there is a high likelihood a cure or medicine will be developed in her lifetime to slow the symptoms. \n\nMy symptoms are actually not all that mild from what I have learned. CMT is common, and most people do not even notice differences until later in life. Even with the things CMT has done to me, I cannot complain. Sure it is been frustrating and as a teen, it is hard to understand..but it is shaped me into who I am today and I honestly do not feel like it slows me down like I was worried it would when I was first diagnosed. \n\nFeel free to reach out anytime and ask me as many questions you want! Hello, I wanted to thank you for your reply, I actually have read it may tines when I find myself waking up at night in a state of shock or grieve. I struggle with the uncertainty of not knowing what will come next. It brakes my heart that my daughter has made up this story to reassure herself where CMT is something that maybe will be a little problem when she is in her seventies. I so wish that would be the case. Sometimes she is angry with me for I was the one that suggested going to the doctor with her minor foot problem, not even a problem just something I taught would be good to look at before she developed back problemsike I have because back ik the eighties when I grew up parents were very loose about everything and did not bother to send you to the doctor.\nDo you have any idea about how this develops? I have an appointment with her neurologist next week but I find these people are so without any hope. When I asked about possible treatment or medical trials she sort of dismissed all of that saying they would not be fit/suited for CMT1a. I do not know if this is the case. I am curious how people with CMT look at those trials, is it fair to expect some kind of remedie within the next 10 years? I am sorry for all my questions but am just looking for a way to incorporate all this into our lives where I can work and be the positive person she needs right now.\nThank you so much for taking the time to respond. Great reply I have a 7r old that was diagnosed at 3yr old, he is now progressively worse. My wife and I are of the opinion not to get it diagnosed because we do not want it labelling and giving him a limiting belief. Would you agree with this or do you have different. Advice?\n\nOh what is the AFO abbreviation stand for?\n\nMany thanks I would not hold off on diagnosis. I wish I had a diagnosis sooner - it is was a relief, and a valuable explanation for my experiences. It also opens the door for possible trials, physical therapy, and advice on management. Diagnosis is not what limits a person's belief in themselves - it is how your respond to being diagnosed. Do it sooner, do not wait.\n\nAFOs are ankle-foot orthodics- braces that stabilize the foot and ankle so you walk with stability. My wife  on Instagram) has 1A and would be happy to hear the research you put into your daughter's diagnosis. Each case is pretty unique, but she would stress the importance of staying active to keep muscles strong. Also finding a knowledgeable physician. She had a physician/surgeon who was overly confident in treating her CMT that he knew nothing about. It is cost her a lot fixing the mistakes he did. Find a doctor that listens. That is so neat! I have never heard of this but I have a big big family with cmt and a few children plus myself and a number of my adult family members have it!that is really awesome!", "If you could buy what you wanted at the orthotist, what would you get? I have found myself in a lucky situation. I live in a welfare state and has been referred to an orthotist. It works like this: you get a piece of paper that pays for everything and I can choose between any orthotist. Together with a professional I will chose what to get and what I need.\n\nI have CMTX, am 26 years old and have a light-medium severity. Drop foot, very little muscle on calves, generally weak ankles, bad balance.\n\nI have never used inlays, AFO\u2019s, dictus bands or any orthopedic footwear.\n\nI am wondering if you guys have some tips on what to get and what to look for. Are some things better than other? Are some things normally very expensive making people opt out even though it is great?\n\nIt would be great for me to know what you guys would pick if you could chose anything? (Even though I know that it is very individual what you would need.) That is the exact age I started wearing AFO\u2019s. It is hard to say what I would \u201cpick\u201d as there is *so* many AFO\u2019s out there. I have had two brands, two different styles by one manufacturer. I saw an orthotist and they gave me their rec. I am pretty happy with the one I have now, it is called \u201cThe Noodle\u201d by Kinetic Research. If you look at it, it will Isley appear like many other AFO\u2019s. Mine were custom made, they took a mold, reinforced or modified from the last pair that were cracking. Insurance covered mine, otherwise they run around $2k USD.\n\n\nI would say your orthotist will likely recommend something good for you, they are not there to *sell* you a certain AFO, at least not here, but you could always go in with a model in mind and ask if they have heard of it and what they think. A consultation with the orthotist. Your individual situation will impact this too much to just take random recommendations. My wife just recently got diagnosed and received AFOs. I am not sure what they are called, but they are the hard ones that go up to an inch or so under her knees. She has only worn them once because she does not like the look or feel. Her mother is 60+ and has the same kind, but a thicker material, and it helps her to get around the house/store/hiking etc.", " On My Nerves - Small Irritations  Weekly thread for the little CMT things bugging you this week. Plugs. I hate dealing with trying to hold a plug straight and put it in the wall. Bending over and trying to keep a grip on a thin cord that is constantly twisting to get away. Aaaargh! Professional shoes for women. I am dreading hunting for new dress shoes that work with my cmt body. The arch on my right foot is just killing me lately at the end of the day. Ugh, that sucks. I hope you can find a good arch support or something that can help. I do it to myself...I live in San Diego and like to wear flip flops. I end up paying the price for it but that is just one of those things this disease makes us choose. A well maintained pair of women's ankle boots can work quite well for work. (  \n\n\nAnything like this available near you? Only pair of thongs I have been able to safely wear, variable arch support and tighter band so you do not have to sorta  scrunch and hold it on. I have never heard of these, thanks for the info!", "Has anyone had an EMG? I just started visiting a new neurologist and he recommended that I get an EMG. It is not for diagnostic purposes, since I have had genetic testing done to confirm that I have CMT 1a, but he said that it could be used as a baseline for comparison later on down the road.\n\nI have never had a needle EMG, and have previously only done the nerve conduction studies with the electrodes taped to the skin.\n\nHas anyone here had an EMG? Can you describe the experience? I have heard they can be pretty painful, and if so I do not think I want to subject myself to one just to get a data point to measure disease progression.", "My doctor said it looks like I could have cmt based on my arch. I am not sure if I should seem a diagnosis or if I have symptoms. I am a 28 year old male.  Seek an official diagnosis I plan to. Do your feet look like mine? People have always been blown away by my arches but I never really thought it could actually be something. Oh yes. My feet are like that You certainly do have high arches, and CMT is one potential cause of those. Please be aware that there are other potential causes. You should look into whether CMT is the cause of your high arches, but I would encourage you not to assume that it is until you have been assessed by a neurologist and/or had a genetic test. Those look very CMT-ish to me! But definitely get a confirmation when you can. The arch is very high, your toes are very straight though.  Cannot really diagnose anything on the picture of course, but I can see where the doc is coming from. High arches dont mean CMT. There is also Charcot foot and just plain that is what I have.If no symptoms I would be careful about heading into the rabbit hole of ideas, doctors, neuro, testing. They can make a patient out of you. Been there and its not fun. 75 yrs and still no answer although I have been looked at from all directions. Brain, spine,genetics,  AFOs, never ( attention to yourself, balance, pain,gait and keep moving. I keep searching and keep extremely active . I have had high arches since I was young (now 46) and it could be cmt. But I have plenty of people in my family with cmt wiho do not have high arches. So, it could be cmt but there is other possibilities so get tested. How are the reflexes in your legs when the doc hits your knees with the rubber hammer? They are normal That is a plus. My earliest symptoms were degradation of my peripheral reflexes , only related to later as a symptom of my then undiagnosed late onset cmt. What other symptoms do you have if you do not mind me asking? Hammer toes, bottom of my feet and toes numb, a wide variety of nerve sensations ranging from mildly irritating to excruciatingly painful in my calves, ankles, Achilles\u2019 tendon area. Feet feel hot, itchy, tingly. Later on, muscle atrophy in calves, and feet and the fat part of my thumb on my left palm.  Mild but concerning loss of coordination and balance. Loss of strength and sensation in hands and forearms. I am 70 and did not have serious attributable symptoms until my late 50\u2019s but noticed progressive loss of reflexes in my 30s. Always had high arches and weak ankles. A little clumsy sometimes. Like my father, I had tired, sore feet and legs in mid and late adulthood. After years of complaining to several doctors and my family practitioner, I finally found an orthopedic surgeon who diagnosed me after a bunch of nerve tests and based on my family history (cmt was never mentioned growing up but my father showed symptoms in retrospect) My symptoms were textbook Wikipedia after hearing his diagnosis. The relative progress of my disease at my age is thankfully slow , but steady. Yes, doctors get poor education about neuromuscular disorders, unless they are specialist neurologists. The high arch type is a stereotype. People with flat feet get CMT too. Even curled toes are a stereotype. People like me who separate my toes and stretch them every day have less of a hammer-toed look. Contractures are unlikely also when people separate and stretch CMT toes. Here are some red flag signs your might have CMT: Your feet and calves naturally end up in unusual positions, because of uneven muscle wasting. You will lose tolerance for standing long or exercise, because it wipes you out with fatigue, due to lower body weakness. My feet still look good, but my legs are twisted unnaturally, making walking awkward. I have 2 forms of cmt. One axonal and one demylanating. I also have flat feet when standing.

I was diagnosed at 5 or 6 years old and have been in leg braces since then. I am getting my first ever pair of KAFO\u2019s in a few weeks and was wondering how anyone\u2019s experiences have been going from AFO to KAFO. Also, has anybody been able to lose weight in a healthy way? Diets have not worked much for me since I am not supposed to consume less (it total) and I am limited in how often I can go to the gym.  To reduce the fat percentage on our bodies we need to be in a calorie deficit, and unfortunately the way our bodies work means that any time we are in a calorie deficit we do not just loose body fat but also muscle mass. With CMT it is very important to try and maintain as much muscle mass as we can so we can manage our daily activities, and therefore it is generally not advisable to enter into a calorie deficit if you have CMT. However, obesity should be avoided so in many cases it is becomes necessary to find a balance between the risks and benefits of a calorie deficit.\n\nA healthy person can minimize the muscle loss during a calorie deficit by performing resistance exercise, but even when doing so there will be a net loss of muscle for the duration of the deficit. The ratio of fat loss to muscle loss is not 1:1, generally more fat is lost than muscle mass, and this ratio can be optimized by careful planning of the severity of the calorie deficit and the accompanying exercise routine. The only way to build muscle is to perform resistance exercise while being in a calorie surplus. That is why many fitness people exercise hard while eating more than they need to maintain homeostasis (\"bulking\") and then after having built a lot of muscle (and fat) switch to a calorie deficit while contusing to exercise (\"cutting\"). Over time they lose the fat faster than the muscle, so that when they have lost the excess fat they will still have some muscle left.\n\nIf you want to loose body fat my advice is to talk to your neurologist about it and if it the risk is worth it then a careful plan should be made so that you can keep the muscle loss to an absolute minimum. Good planning, supervision and follow up is advisable, ideally involving a dietitian, a physiatrist if needed, and a physical therapist. In general, slow and carefully planned change is the best way to go about it, the worst thing one can do is to start with drastic reductions in calorie intake and overambitious exercise attempts, though I am sure many of us can relate to having considered or tried something like that at some point.", "EMG test &amp;#x200B;\n\n I have found this test annoying but not incredibly painful", "Strongman Saturday ", "18 m with cmt Anyone else just have major depression and basically given up on life this shit is fucked up wish I could be normal would not wish this on anyone I walk funny without a brace and really thinking about i just wish there was a cure Same man I am 19yo dude with cmt and it pretty much affects every part of your life. Especially in making friends and relationships :( The way I look at it, life is not fair, but it could be worse, way worse. You could have amputations, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, aids, and so on. A lot of people have non visual to the eye disabilities of various kinds. A lot of people also have mental disorders. So try to have an optimistic outlook on life. \n\nYou will not die from CMT. The quality of your life will be impacted, but you still have control over how to improve it. Find ways to live with the disorder. Keep being active in any way. Find a career path that accommodates your disorder. \n\nThe advancement in orthotics are always improving. Studies are being worked on for cures and treatments. There is also Physical Therapy and local groups you may be able to speak with. You can always speak here as well. Find the joys to life, it is there. I am 55 with CMT2A...noticed in childhood, diagnosed vaguely in college, confirmed by neurologist in 30\u2019s, and genetically tested last year. I am currently recovering from my 6th foot surgery. 2 in early 80\u2019s. 2 in 2009. 2 in 2020.  These have all been reconstructions &amp; this last round had a toe amputation on each foot. \n\nI have always walked funny, had braces a couple of times, and really limited by weakness and terrain. \n\nI understand your despair and if you are like me, it goes up and down. \n\nThere is lots I have missed out on and plenty I wish I could do, but I have been married 30 years and have 2 grown children (who thankfully both tested negative when I was genetically tested)\n\nThere is plenty of life to experience and enjoy, I am praying for you now. I was diagnosed when I was 31. I am now 39. I had issues with CMT at an early age that I did not realize until after I was diagnosed. I will save you from a lengthy description, we all know for the most part. I have never really connected CMT with my depression and anxiety when I was a kid, but I have always dealt with it. Even when I was like four years old I remember anxiety and depression. In my early 20s I tried many medications and none of them worked. If they did work, I just felt like a zombie and did not want to do anything. \n\nI did start going to see a therapist about three years ago. It has helped more than any of the medications I took. It is something that I look forward to. Sometimes it is once a month and sometimes twice. It is really a great thing to have someone that you can talk to about anything.   \n\nDo not feel like you are alone and do not be afraid to seek help. It is something that I wish I would have done years ago. If you want to chat, feel free to send me a PM. Appreciate it hope there is hope for me in the future for a significant other and friends CMT has affected most aspects of my life either directly or indirectly. What I have learned so far is that there are many paths to achieving your goals. Sometimes I have been forced to do things a bit differently than everyone else, but there have usually been a way even if it has not always been exactly what I had in mind or what I had planned. In addition to all the bad things, life is also full of pleasure and joy and satisfaction and adventure and everything else that is good. I want to experience more of those things and that is what gets me out of the bed in the morning. My strategy is to try and try again, then adapt, compensate, and try again. And along the way I have found that it is been helpful to try to not let my pride get too much in the way. \n\nWhen I was 18 I was looking forward to a cure or at least something to stop the progression of the disease. It has taken a lot longer than I had hoped, but now it really seems like we are close to the first treatments for some of the genotypes of CMT. We have every right to be angry and sad about what CMT is doing to us, and I think it is good to share out experience and frustration with others who understand. But at the same time I think there are more reasons than ever to stay optimistic and keep going. There will come a day when we can get some relief, and the younger you are the more reason to be hopeful there is.\n\n( I have had symptoms since I was a baby, so maybe that is not as bad as getting it later in life and losing abilities you had previously taken for granted. But I know that CMT was absolutely harder for me in childhood than in adulthood. Simple things like:\n\n* Not being able to run and play normal sports\n* Not being able to ride a bicycle/skateboard/dirtbike with your friends\n* Struggling to walk at all in the dark without losing balance\n* Just having a visibly abnormal gait\n\nAs an adult, that stuff does not really matter to me anymore. But as a kid, it is a huge deal. I think it does get better eventually. Maybe not the physical limitations, but the emotional impact those limitations have. My biggest struggles now are having to go through huge airports or stand for long periods of time.\n\nAnd like another poster said, it could definitely be worse. Horrible diseases like spinal muscular atrophy or muscular dystrophy that can significantly shorten your lifespan. That is always one thing it could be worse Yeah man, you are not alone, fucked me up pretty good. Have not been the same since diagnosis. Former cellist, athlete, restaurant server, dreamer of *so many* jobs no longer viable, even had a dad use it as leverage in convincing his daughter to break up with me. How far along are you? Have you been able to talk to a specialist or physio at all? Just wondering if you have bad contractures or if there is anything that can be done on your end to improve your situation. This is a great reply and very true. When I visit my neurologist, I cannot help but notice the people around me with significantly more disabling conditions. While I am lucky  and have CMT that is considered relatively mild  e.g. I do not need ankle braces, hands are not yet impacted, I see people with Tourettes, restless leg syndrome and a whole host of other, significantly more disabling conditions. CMT sucks, but it could be a lot worse, and it is a condition that some of the times you can actively work on to improve in some ways. I think the thing is not to be a downer but CMT is arguably worse than a lot of those issues, I would personally rather have them. Say for example your an amputee depending on the severity you know what you will deal with, say having no arm for the rest of your life you can still do whatever you can without an arm, its not like an amputee will get worse overtime by like losing other body parts. And a lot of the problems you mentioned also can be treated through meds and have little limit in the things you can do. CMT is a disease that starts off pretty bad in my experience missing out on a lot of activities already that \"normal\" people experience, and may or may not get worse where some things you love may get taken away from you because you cannot do them anymore as it progresses. I am not trying to downplay the significance of many of the other problems but those do not have you missing out on so much that CMT does to certain people (obviously if they kill you that is different). I get where your coming from and optimism is always the best thing to do and think about the bright side but I just wanted to say how I feel. I got 1A.\n\nI am really into working out / body building. But unfortunately that shit are not easy with cmt. We just got to do our best. That is all we can do.\n\nI recommend going to the gym 3 times a week and really push yourself (be careful though with thinks that require balance, like squats, deadlift or running) it will really improve your quality of life in the future. Nope I think just having a brace that is it really Happy Cake Day jelloapcalysp! I hope you will have a wonderful year, that you will dream dangerously and outrageously, that you will make something that did not exist before you made it, that you will be loved and that you will be liked, and that you will have people to love and to like in return. I also agree that you can definitely be worse. CAN I REALLY????\n I am currently in Cambodia and I see a lot of people who have lost their limbs because of land mines.\n\nMy intellect tells me that there are people out there in way worse situations that I am. \n\nMy body tells me otherwise.\n\n\nHowever, I myself, almost gave up on life a couple of years ago. After eight years, more than a dozen doctors, ( majority labeled me as an opiod seeker/addict,) denying MRI's for two years until I finally offered to pay out of picket, overlooking my EMG report from 2014 clearly indicating that I was diagnosed with CMT  and refusing to believe that I had aquired a new pain...... Myofascia Pain Syndrome. \n\nI already had my anxiety-depression-imsomnia under control. But adding pain from CMT, Myofascia pain, having to commute a three hour round trip to and from work, 9 hour days, tutoring my nieces  and the vicious cycle that both of each fuel in an unique fashion, has been the most monumental challenge  for me EVER!!!!!\n\nI have historically had a rare high pain tolerance. It was apparent since my early years. \nSo it takes a lot for me to complain when it comes to pain and \"suffering\" I avoid this word because it has never been my intention to seek for pitty. In lieu, I rather say \"challenge/es\" \n\nI have had HUGE AND VARIOUS challenges since 2010. All due to the lack of due diligence and lack to attention to detail by MANY doctors. \n\nRecently, I put together all of my medical records for the past 10 years and with the help of Google, my best friend who holds a PhD in neurophysiology,  an open minded pain management  doctor, and luckily being \"stucked\" in Cambodia during Corona where there is no mandatory distancing, lockdown,  mask wearing .........Free Yoga classes, access to a pool that stays at the same temperature regardless of the time of day and a very special fellow Backpacker, now my partner, who for the past three months since we met, has given me her unconditional  100% love and  support.......I feel much much much better..  Pain is not gone, but in between yoga, pool excercises, and a well deserved prolonged vacation due to borders closing , has lessen my pain. \n\nI am greatful for this......\n\n It is not my intention to brag but to ONLY illustrate my now 10 year challenge and that I totally understand when it comes to almost giving up in life.....I ALMOST DID. I WAS VERY VERY CLOSE TO PUT AN END TO IT.\n\nSo, in conclusion.... I really cannot say that it could be worse . We simply do not know. We are all wired diffetently. Regardless of the nature of your pain, it DOES change your perception on life, you may lose friends and family. I did. Stay away from ignorant people to your pain. that is my best advice for you. That is what hurts me the most. I truly wish you the best of luck. \u201cIt could be worse ..\u201d is one of the most common replies I hear that I absolutely hate. I do not care if it could be worse I just want to be normal. I knew at a very young age that I was \u201cdifferent\u201d not being able to do things other kids could and would become extremely frustrated.", "Anyone with CMTx have stroke like episodes I have CMTx and have stroke like symptoms that go on and off for hours at a time for a couple days straight, it is quite a rare side effect of CMTx and so I have had trouble finding more info about it, but was wondering if anyone here has had similar thing happen. I had one when I was 9 years old where I could not walk, lift my arms, or move my mouth to speak, and this went on and off for 2-3 days. Similar thing happened when I was 13, although It was not as bad, as I could move much better, this is when I was diagnosed with CMTx. And once when I was 16 and could not move my left side of my face, and had slight weakness in my hand for a couple days on and off. Has anyone had similar events caused by CMT, and did they get better with age, or stop happening with age? Not quite the same but with high levels of stress my left hip freezes and I cannot walk without crutches. It can happen in the middle of wherever. Weird things happening to our bodies... Stress is one of the things that was mentioned as being a possible trigger for me too, also if I am sick and altitude for some reason... and with my past experiences they happened like out of no where, one minute I can talk, next minute I sound drunk. The first time I was in the movie theater when I realized I could not move my legs, and I could not talk. The last time it happened I was at a high school swim team practice when I started to slur my words, made it really hard to explain what was happening when no one could understand me. Just to let you know, never felt stroke like symptoms. That sounds tough though, wish you the best. \n28 year old CMT Xer here I am 26yo with cmtx. I had stroke like symptoms happen to me at almost circadian times (would start in the AM and easy up towards the end of the day) when I was 12, for a period of about a week. At the time I was living in a high altitude area, and from my research, high altitude can trigger CNS symptoms. After a week I made a full recovery and I was discharged, a genetic test later confirmed cmtx.\n I am actually curious about this, I have a snowboarding trip coming up this weekend that I might pass on because of the high altitude. I have not had any such events since then but the possibility is still concerning. Thanks for sharing your experience. I have gone snowboarding in the mountains many times and have not had problems. I have stayed up there a few days 3 times and did not have any issues, but the time when I was 13 it was after coming back from the mountains, so hard to say. Based on what research I have done most of the stoke symptoms happen to younger kids and teens, and seem to tapper off. Online I can find a few studies on mostly teens (I actually found a study based off my self), but only found 1 instant of someone older than like 25 having symptoms, and it was a women who had stroke symptoms after giving birth. Most seem to happen to kids 7-18. My episodes seemed to get progressively less server as I shared in my post, so I am hoping that it just effects younger kids and teens, and I will be fine at this point. It is really rare but it sounds like you definitely have CNS involvement. I have had one episode where I could not feel my face or right arm, nor could I move my arm or half my face, they suspected a stroke, then MS, then told me I had a pinched nerve. It lasted for about a day. I assumed it was stress or something but in retrospect I doubt it. According to literature if you have an mri they may be able to detected changes in your white master during these times. The time when I was 13 I was in the hospital for a couple days, they thought I had Bell\u2019s palsy and treated me for Lyme disease, then I could not move my right arm too so the thought I was having a stroke, but then after a day or two one doctor mentioned it could be cmt, so they tested my moms reflex\u2019s and things with the hammer on a knee(not me because I could not move) , and then decided to get a mri. Had two white spots in my brain, so that pretty much confirmed that is what it was, I also had genetic testing later. The first time I had it happen no one knew what it was and they concluded it was probably the flu in my brain and that is what we believed until 4 years later when it happened again. Had a MRI again when I was 16 when it happened again because they wanted to make sure I was not having a stroke and had the same thing. Was really scary the first two times cause I did not know what was happening, but the last time it was not that bad. Sounds like you had the same thing happen. Yeah it really sucked. I am sure you just had to have been terrified. What a horrible way to find out lol.", "Incontinence with uti/medicines Has anyone else experienced incontinence when they take AZO  uti medication? Or maybe it is just because I have a bad uti I am not sure. I have never really dealt with it but this morning I woke up to go to the bathroom and could not even hold it at all, I did not feel myself pee but I felt the wet spot and it was horrible. I had absolutely no control. The only time I have kind of had incontinence was after doing hard leg workouts but I could control it somewhat I have never taken AZO but last time I had a bad UTI I also peed myself. As far as I know it is pretty common with UTIs Thank you! I was not sure, I talked to my doctors office and they said it might just be related with cmt. I was hoping it was just the uti and the cmt is not worsening I am not a doctor but with me it was definitely not my cmt  as I have rather a mild case and was doing pretty well then\n\nEdit: Quickly googled and found this  Thank you!  First, you must address the root cause of your issues, UTI. Have you heard of the microbiome being the culprit of your UTI? Some would have recurring UTI for years.

I am a 22M with CMT and I am in this community to read some tips, learn how to deal with CMT and to read feedbacks.\n\nI want to know why you are here? What do you want from this group? The support and understanding are great. And there is such a wide variety of feedback, opinions and info that is it is very insightful When I was first diagnosed, nearly 25 years ago, there were no internet support groups. I knew that CMT ran in my family, but I knew it because my sibling's case is a very bad one while I have a rather light case. So having a sibling with CMT was not a good guide for what to expect myself. I had other relatives with CMT, but for various reasons I was not close with them or in some cases I did not realize at the time they were also CMT'ers, so I did not really have anyone who could give me answers. If I had gotten good, practical advice when I was diagnosed, my 20s and 30s might have been somewhat easier. \n\nI was a university student studying science when I got my diagnosis and I tried reading up on the exact mechanism underlying my own genetic condition. I got fascinated by all the workings of the body on a cellular level to the extent that I ended up changing my major and getting a degree in that sort of thing. \n\nCMT is a highly variable disorder and people's approaches to dealing with it are just as varied. I come here to talk to other people navigating modern life with CMT, to learn from other's experiences and to offer advice where I can. It is the nature of groups such as this that the majority of the questions tend to come from those just diagnosed or facing a change of some sort (like looking in to getting AFOs or surgery) and I know from experience that a bit of good advice at such a time can be very helpful. And just knowing you are not alone can be very powerful as well.   Thought someone here would have the cure!\ud83d\ude02 I am a 64F. Never knew of cmt and no one in my family has it. Where I got both an axonal and demylanating forms of it, no one knows. They knew I had something, but mostly waved me off as being a lying, faking, lazy girl. Did not get dna tested until age 60 and was shocked at results. Could not understand how I could have such pain with it and my brother in law says he has never had any, just numbness. (Do not know what type he has)\nI like seeing what people do to care for themselves and what helps them.\nI have gone years without medical care and it has been hell. But starting in Oct, I finally am old enough for medicare and hopefully can find a Dr that I can talk to.\nYou younger ones that knew what was wrong are SO lucky to not have gone thru what I did and can get a better quality of life and people that understand you have actual health issues. I really want to have children one day and I mostly joined as growing up I knew know one with the condition at all. I would like to be more socially aware of the differences in those with the condition prior to conceiving and also befriend those who would like to know each other to not feel so isolated when my symptoms are stronger. I am in the opposite camp, not wanting to pass this along to my children. A friend of mine with CMT actually went through a long process and had a healthy son who does not have CMT. I know it was expensive, since they had her eggs all tested and picked one without the gene expressed for the disease. Maybe that is something you could look into? Ii just HAVE TO SAY..    my mom has CMT..   since she was around 13\u2026.    And she is the best mom I could ever have ..   even now that she is 64ish and not walking.    I would not change a thing about my life and think it made me a better person if I need to be honest.  Also.   If I end up with CMT. ..    I would never hold it against her.  Just had to get that out.  :) Thanks so much for taking the time out to write that reply. I can only imagine how much it would mean to your mum knowing you are so thoughtful and love her so. The guilt of passing it on (and them having worse symptoms) is mainly why I am hesitating to go the natural route so it means a lot to know you would not feel angry if you did have it. I have been looking into IVF but I am still on the fence. Your comment is really reassuring though, as it is something I was worried about so thank-you :) I was diagnosed at age 5 (24 now) with 1A and being able to be in a group with others who relate and can give advice/support is always great.", "Question re: Lumbar Puncture Hi /CMT.

Plus, I have read horror stories about days-long headaches, fever, infection, etc.", "CMT update: Hammertoes!! I have late-onset CMT (37), even though I have always had high arches. Most of my symptoms so far are sensory, a lot of numbness and tingling and tightness and twitching.  I am on gabapentin to help with the pain.  I am still walking normally, though I feel better with a walking stick and my tennis shoes.  However, I do not know if I am proud or horrified to say that my toes are definitely curling a bit more in their natural resting state.  It does help me truly accept the diagnosis.  Now I need to add CMT1A to my flair (for that is indeed the family mutation).", "Is this footdrop? My son has been diagnosed with CMT1A via genetic testing.  So my son did not walk until he was 2.5. He is 3.5 now. He trips over his toes a lot. He had his genetic test done and it showed duplication of the 17th chromosome and he is been officially diagnosed with CMT. Due to Covid19, this is as far as we have got. Our dr appointment to discuss it further is in December. The paediatrician did not know anything about CMT but read off the website that it should not effect him until he hits 12, but I really think we are seeing it right now. My son had not walked far when I took this video, he would been walking for about five minutes. Any help is very welcome. Xx Sorry it took so long, but I just found that this had been flagged as spam and automatically removed by a bot so I pushed it through. \n\nIMO, this is indeed foot drop and general CMT-related gait instability. It definitely does not always take until one reaches 12 or any other particular age to manifest such symptoms. My own sibling had a similar walk around 10 years of age, I think. \n\nCatching your toes on the ground as you try to step forward is classic foot drop. I think he will be able to walk much better with some minor interventions: properly fitted insoles, physical therapy, and possibly AFOs (ankle-foot orthotics) are all things a professional may consider to help him. Thank you so much for this. X I have CMT and walked similar to this when I was little.  Just to second the other comment, it definitely looks CMT related and I would also say that some AFOs will have him stomping around for hours. I know everyone is CMT experience is different, but my son cannot really talk and our doctor appointments are not until December. When you were little, did you have any pain? Is there a chance he is in pain? And do you know what the best approach is when we go for walks? Should we be picking him up when he tires or should we be encouraging him to push on a little further? I am a soft touch and the second he does not want to walk anymore I am picking him up. But my husband encourages him to keep walking and after a bit of a grizzle he keeps going and seems happy. \n\nHowever, along with his inability to communicate, comes with some kind of inappropriate response to pain. For example he once walked through a nettle patch and did not seem to notice. One walk, afterwards we found that the top of one of his wellies had rubbed on his leg and created like a very nasty burn. But because he did not cry or let us know, we had no idea.\n\nSo I need to know, if he grizzles for a minute, is it because he is three and he cannot be bothered to walk, or because he is in pain? And if pushing him to walk further is helping to strengthen his legs or making them deteriorate?\n\nAny suggestions or memories you have would be really really appreciated. Out appointment is in December but that is just with the geneticist. It is still not with actual medical help like physio or someone who can get him special shoes or braces. And I am worried sick here.\n\nThank you xx. Hi,  I think you should post your submission again afresh, as the mod said it kind of got lost down the bottom and I would think more people (maybe not all useful) would be happy to comment.\nI was never in pain no, I would not think he is in pain either looking how he motors along on the video there is no stopping the lad! If he was hurting he would let you know, he is grizzling because he is three.\n\n\nThe welly burn thing is not as out there as you think, it is because the welly has gradually worn the skin off bit by bit, that does not immediately hurt like scraping your knee, it is like when you take new shoes off and discover you have a blister - it is unlikely to be because of CMT, but it is easy to see it in every little thing and do be careful of that.\nWalking will not cause muscles to deteriorate - no way, it will build muscles in different areas to accommodate the different walking style.\nIt is very difficult not to start ascribing everything to CMT, most times it is just life.  He obviously is not aware of CMT or anything so just let him do what he can do and be happy doing it.\nCan your GP refer you to a physio?  Or ask the geneticist to.  \n\nIt really gladdened my heart looking at your little lad motor along.\n\nAsk anything, happy to give my personal perspective - but as you say it is an individual experience. Thank you so much for taking the time to answer. Your response made me very hopeful. He loves walking and running and jumping and he can walk miles, so I makes me happy that we are not doing him any damage. He is getting stronger all the time. About four months ago I used to make him wear knee pads because he tripped so often and now he does not need them and can catch himself when he stumbles. \n\nYou are right that I see it everywhere. My daughter has shown no signs but I am convinced she has it too and will start showing when she is 12 or older. She is always had her father\u2019s feet and dodgy balance and bent little fingers. My husband is starting to fall and really struggle with his feet and ankles when he gets out of bed in the morning too and my brain is screaming CMT!! CMT!!\n\nI need to get him some help, maybe some stretching exercises or something for it, while treading carefully. I do not want to hurt his feelings. He is strong and fit and I know he will not want me pointing out his weaknesses.\n\nSo yes, I need to find peace with it. The diagnosis is still fresh. I will get there. Right now I am worried that showing up so young in my son will mean that he will have it more severely than is common. Is this something you have noticed? Is your life impacted badly by it?\n\nSorry for the essay. It is just you know, when it is your kids, your precious shining little children, it is just very stressful. My mum is having heart issues right now too, so I cannot tell her. My husband does not want to talk about it until the appointment (he is a good guy it is just a sensitive issue and just me wildly speculating and panicking lol). So I am just panicking in my head and absolutely seeing it everywhere. I am on a whole bunch of meds because it is made me so I will. I know I will get my act together. I am already improving. It is just going to take me a little while. \n\nWow that was an essay, sorry xxx Do not apologise, it is what this sub is for and I am happy to give my two penneth!  I do not think you have not got your act together at all, it is a lot to deal with and a lot to mentally digest.  In answer to your questions:\n\nNo, your son showing early signs does not mean he has it severely and will get it worse, there is no rule book or fits all measure for cmt (which is both annoying and a relief) but by and large it progresses slowly if it does progress.  You are not against any clock and there is no panic unless you make it, he has CMT  - nothing's on fire and you are doing the right thing by finding out about it.\n\nI wear AFOs and have done for 5 or so years (now 40) and they are incredibly helpful. I walked 'funny' always but got on with everything alright, I was no footballer (soccer) but that is not the end of the world.  I had little support from the age of about 16 - 35 for various reasons and could have done with more and accepting it earlier.  I have just got back from walking round the park for 2+ hours so I can do that and I am perfectly healthy.\n\nYour husband might feel unwarrantedly guilty if he feels it is an affliction, which it is easy to see as, so your right to tread carefully, CMT is an odd thing to have that is difficult to explain.\n\nRemember to look after yourself with all this, no good you going down in sympathy :).  Again, feel free to ask anything. I just wanted to say, if you want someone to talk to, I have CMT1A and a toddler son. I am very conflicted about doing testing. Also I am a single parent, his dad\u2019s a jerk, and I could not feel more guilty about everything if I tried. Sending love. Thank you. I will take you up on that offer! I hope your son escapes it. I was so worried about my kids getting my asthma(they did not thank goodness), I had no idea my husband had CMT. We did not even know what it was. Although now I do, I can see that it is rife in his family. They all explain it away as broken toes that have not healed properly and \u2018that weird thing grandpa had with his hands\u2019.\n\nWe only got my son tested because he was extremely slow to walk and because he had some kind of learning difficulties. I think the dr, who did not know my son at all, was wondering if it was something like Fragile X. And then suddenly we had the CMT diagnosis. I have not really slept properly since.\n\nSorry your son\u2019s dad is a jerk. I hope you guys are doing ok. Xx", "As requested, pictures of my foot before, during, after, and x-ray. Diagnosed in 2002, left foot done in 2012, right foot done in 2018. Best decision I have ever made, but it was a lot of work.  It is interesting and helpful to be able to see the result of surgery like this. My feet are getting worse and I can see the progression year over year. I hope I will not have to undergo surgery but it is kind of worrying to see how relentlessly this disease progresses. I had this surgery done on both legs in '90 &amp; '91 and it bought me 20 years of great mobility. Unfortunately since then it is been going downhill as the effects of the surgery have worn off. But it is one of the best things you can do if you are feet are in bad shape like mine were. It is actually a really good surgery to have as it can drastically improve your quality of life for several decades. :-) My daughter\u2019s had this done\u2014Her big toe is shaped the same way; they straightened it and she had a giant pin sticking straight out from the front of her toe while it healed.  It was fun watching them pull that out lol. I had this surgery when I was a young teen. The docs said if I didnt, I would likely be in a wheel chair by my 30th birthday.\n\n37 now and still walking decently.\n\nGood luck with your recovery and post physio work :) I have done both feet at this point, while broken ankles and metatarsals were also being repaired. All my left toes have been straightened, my left big toe pinned, and the tendon removed from it. I have had both heal bones cut and shifted as well.

What can you say to prepare someone less \"progressed\" than you are to help them cope and prepare them? Hi, I am a 23 year old male from Houston, Texas.  I was diagnosed with CMT at 15 years old.  It runs deep in my family, my great grandfather and 5 of his 8 children had CMT.  We lost my grandfather (he was the last of his generation) to a stroke a year ago.  I am mostly able at this point in time due to overwhelming amounts of surgery and will power but I am coming to terms with my own mortality and fate.  The pain is my absolute worst problem followed closely by fatigue.  I can spend a few hours on activities but it feels like I got beat up whenever I get done.\n\n\nAnyway, my question to you is.. What was the most difficult point in your life where you had the most trouble coping and what can you say to prepare someone who has not reached that point so that they can cope with what is happening to them?", "MRI Terrors! Surely, I can not be the only one? Claustrophobia has always been an issue for me whether it be small places, tight clothing, closed spaces with little air movement,  and MRI's! Open or closed, it does not matter. In the past, when my legs worked, I could barely  tolerate, barely, short-term scans. When the burning pain in my legs and feet began to get really bad around 2009, MRI's became even more nightmarish. The pain, the burn, the involuntary muscle spasms, ... and the MRI's got longer and longer. When I needed L4/5 decompression surgery December 2019, the scans became intolerable. When the MRI techs put a 'cage' on my head to hold the scan the head and neck, normal procedure, I all but lost it. When they raised the table I was on so my nose was but millimeters from the roof the MRI chamber, I did lose it!  \n\nI would literally have  night terrors, panic attacks while asleep. Weeks, months, after the MRI's, with no more on the horizon, I would continue to be troubled with night terrors and panic attacks for no obvious reason. Even now, well over a year since the last MRI, I can vividly recall the non- existent situations, locations, fear,  terrors 'feelings' of being forced, herded, by some unknown force pushing me through a solid red brick wall, the walls getting bigger, closer, the hole I am being forced through smaller and smaller and smaller.  \n\nFinally, after trying all most the entire year of 2020, I ***FINALLY*** have an appointment with a Johns Hopkins neurologist that specializes in CMT as well as the 2 other inherited neuropathies the genetic test revealed AND she also specializes in spinal stenosis. At 65 I walked in to back surgery on 12/19/20. Five months later I as asking my pain management MD for a script for a walker. I do not think the back surgeon did anything wrong. BUT, I do think the surgery itself changed something. Something that sped up or 'opened the flood gates that would result in losing my legs in less than 5 months after having 'use' of them for 65 years. Hmm. I have trouble breathing when actually doing the MRI's because of how confined the space is. Getting them has become a bit nightmarish for me. My first experience with MRIs scarred me. I had the whole shebang done when I was 11? 12? At the Shriners. Head cage and all. They are supposed to play music in a set of headphones to help drown some of the noise, but mine were not working and I absolutely had a panic attack. I still cry if I ever need MRIs I cannot stand them What a horrible experience, especially for a child! Especially in an all ready terrifying environment where a child has even less control than an adult. I am sorry you had to endure such an experience at such a young age. As far as playing the music, and the 'fan' they tell you is on the entire time, what a joke! And, those techs that act like YOU are the problem - sheesh! I am not a violent person but there have been times I have wanted to tie them down, encase their head, and stick them in the MRI and dial it up to the very top! Thank you for validating my nightmares! The fan they *'allegedly'* turn on to keep the air moving, is a joke. I always get hotter and hotter. I have tried telling the techs the burning in my legs and feet is exothermic and I actually get hotter inside the coffin and they tell me, \"No one gets hotter inside the tube.\"vI do not believe them for a second. Luckily they got it fixed but the damage was already done. I feel you on giving them a taste of it! I have literally never felt or heard a fan it gets so stuffy and cramped in those things. You mentioned your surgery above. I have heard that anesthesia can mess with our condition. I hope your appointment with the new doctor does great wonders for you sudden decline always sucks. Good luck out there! Had one today. Never had a problem before until this one. The slight shaking of it made my hands go completely numb to the point I could not even squeeze the panic button (which made me panic). Fortunately the tech was really good and noticed and got me out for a break. \n\nHave you ever asked to be sedated? Wonder if that would help all around. Thank You! My hopes are high, I am trying to temper them. I have pretty much decided that if this appointment is a repeat of the disastrous Uni of Penn CMT Center of Excellence, I am going to stop looking. Stop trying to find the 'right' M.D.. Not only is it an extremely arduous grind with all the phone calls, emails, this MD sending info to that MD. All new test. And of course, the incessant - WAITING! There is no energy left to keep looking.\n\nSo, I am hoping to win the POWERBALL TONIGHT! Then, MAYBE, I can find the resources I, and others here, need! I can feel your panic and see it in my minds eye. In the past I could 'barely tolerate' them. That was when my legs worked. If all else fails. at least I could use my legs to 'scoocch' my out of the  coffin. Now, with my lower legs and feet pretty much useless, I always feel even more trapped than ever.\n\nI have taken some prescription medication to sedate me prior to and immediately before entering the tube. But it is just not enough. The fight or flight response overpowers any medication so far. Especially when I can 'feel' my nose a hair away from the top. Even with the blindfold, the music, the sedative, .... I feel as if I am buried alive in a tight casket and can not move a millimeter in any direction but my mind is wide awake and I am trapped. \n\nI wonder if the MD's would consider putting me totally OUT! and not wake up until I am out of the tube????? I really hope you win! You could be like me and bulldoze whatever doctor seems willing to work on the situation with CMT information. Going to be keeping you in my thoughts and wishing for the best outcome!", "Carpal Tunnel Surgery Hi! I am 27 and have CMT. I have always had more issues with my hands than feet and have considered pursuing carpal tunnel surgery to see if it would help. I love to bake, but recently have had a harder time due to numbness and weakness in my fingers/hands. Has anyone here that has had this issue had a carpal tunnel release and felt it helped their symptoms? Just looking for people's experience with it, thanks! Carpal tunnel surgery helped me a LOT. My girlfriend got the carpal tunnel surgery for her CMT progression, she says it barely improved, but everyone is different. Her neurologist seemed surprised it didnt help, so she could just be a weird case. Good luck! Hey! Hopefully I can help here. I am an Australian Physical Therapy who is interested in trying to get to the bottom of why common musculoskeletal issues occur and I have put together a short video on Carpal Tunnel. ( Basically, CT has a lot to do with what is going on in your neck and upper back, so any efforts to fix it up need to focus on treating your symptoms but also looking at improving the health and function of your neck, upper back, and general postures/positions. Hopefully the video is helpful and I am more than happy to answer any questions! Just watched your video. Thank you for sharing! I could feel sensation in my fingers when I did the ball on my spine at the base of my neck, which is pretty cool! I was about to resort to carpel tunnel surgery and I am so glad that I am finding other ways to hopefully fix this issue on my own. Great to hear!

Both the ( and the ( have published a list of drugs that are known to, or is believed to be, neurotoxic to people with CMT.\n\nI am making this post **because these lists have recently been updated with several new medications.** Most notably is the recent addition of Taxols (paclitaxel, docetaxel, cabazitaxel) which are a type of medication that is used in the treatment of certain cancers. These, along with Vincristine sulfate (also used in cancer treatment) are definite high risk medications for people with CMT.\n\nThe list of medication with a moderate to significant risk for CMT patients have also been updated. I urge everyone to always consult these lists before taking any new medication. And make sure to also always ask your doctor if he/she have made sure any drug/anesthesia you are about to take is safe for people with CMT. Even though doctors are usually aware of the concept of contraindications when it comes to medicine, there is always a chance that they may fail to consider your CMT, or consult deprecated sources, or even neglect to check all together.\n\nOne risk that may be easily overlooked by many is the use of nitrous oxide (laughing gas, N2O) for pain management during labor or for anesthesia. In someone with a vitamin B12 deficiency, nitrous oxide can cause severe neurological degeneration. Also keep in mind that when nitrous oxide is inhaled, the concentration in the air in the room can become quite high due to exhalation. So even standing next to someone using it can expose you to the gas. So if you have CMT and you know you may be exposed to nitrous oxide, try to avoid it if you can and if that is not possible at least get your vitamin B12 levels checked before exposure and try to minimize the exposure as much as possible.\n\nAlso keep in mind that these lists are not complete, so if you use a printed out version to compare new drugs against, make sure you check for updates regularly.\n\nTLDR: Some medication is toxic to CMT patients, always ask your doctor if the medicine/anesthesia is safe for people with CMT. If possible, always check if new drugs/anesthesia you are about to use are on the above lists. Thanks, this is really good information to know!", "CMTX vaccine Anybody here with CMTX got vaccinated? If so, what was your experience, any complications? Zero complications other than feeling like shit for 12 hours Same here. Moderna.  No issues From what others have said when this came up before, there is nothing to suggest we would react any differently to the rest of the population. Nothing neurotoxic about these shots. Sorry for late reply. When I was younger I had transient stroke like symptoms the trigger of which is unclear. I had a cocktail of vaccines administered to me close to that time because I moved countries and I have also lived in a high altitude place at the time. Allergic reaction to the vaccines was the prime suspect but genetic test later revealed that I had cmtx. No definitive answer was given so I have not had a vaccine since. So I am not worried about the neurotoxicity but more conserved with the cns problems. I might get the JJ vaccine. As someone with CMTx who had 3 episodes of transient stroke like symptoms, none were linked to vaccines. I have been told altitude, stress, and sickness are likely the main triggers. They have also gotten progressively less severe as I got older, although no one has been able to tell me if they stop with age, it seems like they might as almost every case online is about teenagers, so you might be fine at this point. I got vaccinated a few months ago with no problems, plus I have had countless vaccines other than Covid vaccines over the years and never had a episode after or repeated to getting one.", "High Arch not only in foot but palm of hand as well I have not been diagnosed with CMT but my symptoms make sense with it. I found out about CMT when researching high arches in my feet. Last night I was comparing my hand to my husbands and realized I have a high arch in my palm if that makes sense. Is this part of this diease? I have a doctors appointment on Friday as the rest of the symptoms fit me to a T. ", "My mom has gotten these made from a professional (something like an orthotist). She walks almost like a normal person with these, and with sneakers she has a really bad walk. Seriously, get them! They are not pretty, but damn I am impressed with the job they do!! CMTX1  What are they called? Please can you show us where you got them? Do they sell them online? X Hi. They are not sold online. They are custom made by professionals for her specific feet. Nothing else will work. I believe they cost around 1000$ if you do not have universal health care. If you do, contact your doctor to get an appointment with an orthotist. I do not think they are any brand. Completely custom made by a professional. Go though your doctor What do they assist her with? Does she have drop foot? Can you/ will you, please ask your mother for the name / contact info of the orthotist that made these for her? Obviously, there is great interest, as well as need, for something that we all struggle with daily. I seriously believe the orthotist that made these for your mom would most definitely share what he could.\n\nIf that is not possible, MODS, would it be possible to set up an IAMA interview with the orthotist if he/she were amenable? No offence, but this shows us nothing more than some low boots. Nothing useful for anyone to 'get them' Do you mean orthopedic shoemaker? Yes. You are completely right. Sorry about that, I know there is no quick fix for this condition. What im trying to say here is - if you maybe are a bit like me and think good running sneakers are a good fit - you may get much better result with custom made shoes made specifically for your feet. My moms walking is significantly improved because of the inlay soles, sturdynes of the back of the shoes and the arch support. So yes - you cant just 'get them' - but you can reach out to a professional to get something similar. She has drop foot yes, but mainly I think it is helping her walk flat on the feet instead of at the very 'side' of her feet. It has come to the point for her where i have suggested her getting surgery to get the feet/ankle \"realigned\" which is something she has been offered. But these shoes makes it much better for her. Hi.\n\nI am from Denmark, and the orthotist (something like a special footware maker) is not a private company. She has gotten it from our health care system. I am thinking the US or elsewhere is probably even more advanced in these type of shoes, so this was just a tip to reach out to a doctor or professional if you can. These shoes help my mom walk 'flat' on her feet and not on the very 'everted/outside' side of her feet. They are expensive though if you do not have health care covering. I believe these had a 100$ co-pay and the rest (around an additional 900$) was paid by the government. Thanks again, /u/dicktwister1 if  you do not mind, I will send your pics to a physiatrists I have been working with, perhaps she may be able to shed some light on these shoes. Feel free to do so", " On My Nerves - Small Irritations  Weekly thread for the little CMT things bugging you this week. Thighs are still weak after covid and shots. Has anyone had an increase in symptoms with covid and did it get better, or is this the new normal?.\nI have type 2b1/4c1 and 3/dejerine sottas. This week I have been feeling weaker than before, but today I am better. I still do not understand this condition, because somedays it looks like I cannot barely walk and the other day I am feeling \"ok\". My right foot were a little swollen, it was more noticeable in the ankle, but today it is a little less. My energy was really low, could not even watch a full movie, I just wanted to sleep all day (but I was awake).  \nI am still \"new\" to this life, I have been diagnosed couple years ago, but had only 3 or 4 appointments for CMT itself, and the whole covid made it harder to get those appointments. So I am not sure, but I think my type is 2M. Is it a thing? I guess that is what their report says... I will ask them the next appointment. btw, I am from Brazil I forgot to mention, the swollen ankle with some burning in the ankles and the calves. Type 2M is a rare form of an already rare disease. It looks like it is caused by a mutation in the DNM2 gene but I do not know much more about it. \n\nYou should expect to have more in common with the Type 2 folks in general than the Type 1 folks (like myself) but your symptoms may differ from other type 2s because you have a different genetic basis for your disease than most of them.", "Locating car pedals while wearing an AFO My wife has CMT and wears Noodle AFOs from Kinetic Research on both feet.  On the weekends we race our car in autocross competitions.  Here is a run from the event this weekend:\n\n\n\nDue to the combination of the rigid foot plate on the AFO and CMT related feeling loss, she has some trouble switching from the gas to brake pedal quickly.  This is bad for autocross because you want to be at full throttle for as long as possible before braking.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with a device to help locate your feet while driving?  The gas pedal is easy because it is up against the center console.  In our Mini, the brake pedal and clutch pedals are exactly the same size and about 2 inches apart.  Any ideas? Hi! Kudos to your wife!! I also have CMT, though I have type 2 with increased nerve activity, and I wear Noodle/Richie style braces on both feet. My husband and I own Panic Motorsports, LLC, and since my dad is a former rally driver, I grew up around the track! I do not autocross anymore, but I have been driving competitively since I was 18. Love it! \n\nAnyhow, my husband built a pedal extension on the gas pedal of my \"fun car\" so I can better distinguish between the gas and brake pedals, and I do not have to try to pivot my foot as much to reach them. The extension also changes the angle of the pedal so I can more easily press it with my forefoot, whereas before, I was having to use the middle of my foot or heel. He built the extension using rigid foam and another pedal pad on top of that. This has helped tremendously! While I realize you are looking to resolve issues between the brake and clutch pedals, perhaps this will still work...bringing one farther forward so her leg is at a different angle and therefore she can distinguish between which pedal she is on.\n\nIf your wife gets to the point where working the clutch pedal is difficult, you can also look at a Duck Clutch conversion. This is the best, true-to-action (meaning it reacts like a manual car, rather than a sportronic auto) servo driven clutch we have found.\n\nI just joined Reddit so I could answer your question this morning. I friend forwarded me your post, knowing that we had some experience with CMT and competitive driving. :) I also have a manual hand control for the gas pedal for really sucky foot days, but that would be tough to use in an autocross situation.  Best wishes! Thanks so much for your reply! A pedal extension might help a lot. I think we have a pretty clear picture from your description. Would it be possible to see a picture of the extension? I think this would help me with other cars as well as autocross. There are some cars I just have not been able to drive due to the angle of the pedals and my AFOs keeping my feet at 90 degrees. I am Danielle by the way (my husband is the one who posted). \n\nI am loving autocross! My husband got me into it almost a year ago. I have had a bit more trouble since switching to a slightly more rigid AFO that offers more ankle stability on my left leg this last month. It is a lot of fun though, and I think good exercise (and low impact on joints). Thank you again for the detailed description! Glad to have something to try and nice to meet a driver who is used to making similar adjustments! How do I get a picture to you? haha! I am new to Reddit, and I do not see where I can upload one. Sorry!   \n\nI am in my mid-30's now, but I started autocrossing when I was 18. My feet were reconstructed at 20 y/o, and I have not driven a manual since then, except for track days and Spec Miata races, because my left foot is so weak.  My new braces allow some ankle movement, but my previous brace, which I only wore on the left foot, was a rigid AFO, so there was no change of pedal work at all. I am loving having some ankle motion!  I will private message you and give you my email address. Yes, more ankle motion feels so much better! It sounds like we are sort of similar since my left foot and ankle have more challenges. The first brace I received for my left leg was VERY rigid. I did not like it at all. I ended up working with my physical therapist and orthotist to try a less rigid one. It did not go very well. Still could not adjust it to secure my ankle enough to avoid walking on the edge of my foot after a year (and walking very much on the edge of my foot is painful). The one I just got is supposed to be moderately flexible, but does not feel very flexible at all.  Done! I just emailed you a picture of the pedal extension. Hope that helps! Here is my wife's fastest run from the autocross this weekend.  The raw time was good but she hit a cone somewhere. \n \n\nAnd here is her final banzai run.  I was in the car for this one.  It went well until the very end.  \n\n Fun! She definitely had more speed in the final run, if not also less control. haha! Been there done that. :) I autocrossed a Mini at the BMW Black Lake facility in Greer, SC when they first came out. Fun cars! My dad used to rally an original Clubman, then he got a Cooper S when they came out again from BMW. Great little cars! If you get a chance, look us up online and on Facebook.  We started with a group of autocrossers and course marshals in 2000, just goofing off, but Panic became a business in 2006. No time for autocrossing now, but we spend plenty of weekends at the track! I found and \"followed\" you guys on Facebook. Panic Motorsports looks awesome!  \n\nThe original clubman must have been a blast! We love our mini. I find that BMW pedals work really well for me, btw. I have a hard time with Subarus due to the angle and positioning of pedals, but maybe I could even make those work now that we are playing with pedal extension/modifications. We also rallycross (though not as much as autocross) and had considered a Suburu for that at one point. \n Awesome, thank you! Somedays, owning your own business is a nightmare, and somedays, it is a lot of fun. :) I will keep the BMW pedals in mind for future fun car selections! The pedal extension my hubby built is on my 2006 SLK55. I love my Mercedes, but the pedal set up is awful with my AFO. My daily driver is a Mazda 3, and it is really good in that car. It is weird how that works. You do not notice how different the pedal alignments are until you have a problem with them. :)  I have not Rallycrossed before, but it is definitely growing in our area, and there are a good number of events. It looks like a blast!  Send some event pics via email or facebook, if you would like, and we will share them to Panic.", "How can I (as a family member) help with CMT depression? I know that every person is different in how they deal with disability but I do find that the stressors from certain disabilities cause different mental challenges.\n\nMy father has CMT and he is 60yo. He is always been a happy-go lucky-kind of person, has an amazing job working in IT and gets on with life. But as the disease progresses which impacts lung function and likely to put him a wheelchair in the next months, he is loosing his joie de vivre. I know it is not easy for you guys but I am a big believer of accepting your condition and making the best out of it. However, I feel like i cannot guide him to this state as I do not think i can truly understand what CMTers go through.\n\nWhat can I do to lift his spirits? Is there anything practical I can do... like get electronic hedge cutters so he can do gardening\n\nIs there anything you found helpful from your family members? Do you have hobbies that give you some fun in life? Depression is depression, so the treatment is going to be the same. \n\nThe person has to know they are depressed and then want to get better. Sounds easy, but this is one of the hardest parts. It is not easy to recognize depression in yourself and then Once you do, the depression tells you it is never going to be better so nothing will help. \n\nIt is possible to help, and by talking about it to him, tell him you think he is depressed and should get help. Once they are willing to try and get some help, lots of options.\n\nTherapy would be my first recommendation. Group, individual, grief or maybe there is a coping group for people living with diseases.\n\nTwo things that really help depression are meaningful human contact and physical exercise. The trouble with these two things are that they are incredibly difficult for someone suffering from depression. That is where therapy helps. \n\nRegular sleeping pattern and sunlight also have been proven to help. The use of a sun lamp in the morning after sleeping no more than 7-8 hours is helpful. \n\nPsychiatrist who can prescribe antidepressants. Some people are very averse to taking meds, but they can be a lifesaver. Convincing someone who is depressed to try them might be hard, but once they do and they work, their life will definitely change. It is not going be quick fix, and they still have to work at getting and staying better. \n\nLots and lots of other things out there that can help. Just got to be willing to try. This is what has helped me. I am no professional, but I have suffered from severe depression.", "Question About Body Building Hello everyone. I have a  very mild form of CMT and while it does still noticeably impact me, I have not let it hold me back in life. Knowing CMT is progressive, I have always lived a very active lifestyle and am currently in the armed forces. However I struggle putting on muscle, while I am making gains, progress is very slow. I understand this is something many of us will have to accept depending on our severity of CMT. However I was wondering if anyone found certain supplements or tips they could share that has helped them put on more muscle. Hey, nothing to add here but would love to hear any responses because I am in a similar situation. \n\nAvoided working out most of my life, but my cmt is relatively mild and I am now starting to try putting on more muscle. Yeah more info and research into this area would be nice, here is my anecdotes/unsourced notes (will vary wildy based on cmt type, think this is mostly 1a):\n\nWhole body exercise short of extremes is very beneficial for both muscle and nerves even with cmt. While a \"dead\" axon and it is associated muscle fibers can never be recovered the remaining can be strengthened and atrophy slowed by good diet and exercise. Yes exercise can effectively improve the function of nerves, but mostly on the brain side I think. Personally I find our recovery to be severely slowed/dampened, when a normie goes all out till they cannot anymore they usually end up stronger in a week where I might not even be back at 60% in a much longer period. So I avoid anything that I do not recover from in 48hrs, or try to at least. Any injury that puts you out of commission is incredibly detrimental.\n\nSupplements: creatine, glutamine, and enough protein in your diet will definitely help extend that \"last mile\" of energy and should help a bit with recovery but more does not help more and effectiveness is moderate at best.\n\nSARMs and steroids are both effective to an extent but their use is controversial depending on who you ask and they require active management and close monitoring.\n\nCardio cardio cardio, I do not know if this applies to many but anaerobic exercises (specifically reaching anerobic HR) put me out like no tomorrow. Cardio has helped me expand my aerobic window and the endurance is critical for enabling less intense exercise for a longer period which has given me more results.\n\nI have no idea why our muscles do not effectively kick in to repair like they should or of any way to fix that. Nor do I have much experience with body building (mostly targeting overall functionally at this point) so ymmv.\n\nNintendo switch ring fit is a highly flexible tool for those who can use it, it is all cardio and body weight exercises for any level of experience/fitness.\nVR is also great for active recovery but most (but not all) games do not provide a ton in the way of actual exercise. After years of going to a gym and trying every diet and training regime possible, I found it was practically impossible to gain muscle. Why? No one really knows, but this is a common occurrence in people with CMT. I have it mildly, but even so, going to a gym was about as useful as a candle underwater. \n\nThen, after a lot of research, a friend with the same condition came across SARMs. You can read his experience here: (\n\nWith his ongoing success, I dipped my toes into the world of SARMs and for the first time in my life I was able to gain muscle size and strength. I have tried MK-2866 and LGD-4033 and have to say both are effective, although this can vary significantly person to person, and LGD raised my ALT to mid-400's after 4 weeks, which was a bit too high for my liking, whereas MK-2866 after 10 weeks raised my ALT to the high-200's, which I think is personally more sustainable for a cycle. My next research avenue is to look into MK677 and it increases IGF-1 which can have a noticeable impact on nerve health and regeneration; I will make a running diary of my experience with it as it is safe to be on it all year round. \n\nFor yourself, I would check to see if you are allowed to take any of the above or if you would fail a drug test as all the above compounds are banned by WADA. If so, talk to a doctor about alternatives; oxandrolone has some evidence of being beneficial for people with CMT and can be prescribed though a doctor. \n\nWith regards to creatine, diet etc, none of this I found made a difference. The issue with limited hypertrophy runs far more deeply than diet or creatine. But, once you have a useful base compound to start with (an AAS, GH or SARM), then creatine and a calorie controlled diet are good additions, but are just essentially polish. Which would you recommend that would have the least amount of impact on my health? I am also concerned about hair loss and the need for constant blood work. Are these avoidable at all? So the safest route would be to get a prescription for oxandralone from a doctor who would monitor your bloodwork and there should not be hair loss if used at a reasonable dose - it is been given to children with no adverse side effects. \n\nSARMs and MK677 are trickier. The industry is full of vendors selling fake supplements, either accidentally or knowingly, which can be substituted with something completely useless e.g. rice flour or something significantly more dangerous e.g. a cheap prohormone. Now, if you find a good SARM vendor (there are a few), Mk-2866 is relatively mild in terms of liver toxicity and testosterone suppression, with few people reporting hair loss. LGD is stronger and I have found it to be slightly more liver toxic, suppressive and increased hair loss. Though, it is worth noting hair loss will stop once you come off of SARMs and will regrow, and testosterone will go back to normal after a few weeks. If you want to make sure hairloss is not an issue when on cycle, then a tried and tested combination of regain and finasteride or RU58841 will prevent and even reverse any hairloss. \n\nMK677 lies on its own. While the issue of legitimate vendors remains an issue just as much as with SARMs, it has a lot more studies on it (over 1200 people, some up to 2 yr trials) and so far has shown no adverse side effects. It is not liver toxic and will not impact natural testosterone production in any way so it is a safer compound in that aspect. \n\nThough, when starting anything new, even if it is through a doctor, getting blood work pre and post cycle, and even a few weeks into a cycle, are worth doing just because everyone is body can react differently. An example is that I had bloodwork done for an issue that coincided with me taking some antibiotics. Turns out, my body does not react so well to them and I had mild liver inflammation from antibiotics...If it was not for the blood test, no one would have known! \n\nMy takeaway would be - talk to a doctor, see if they can help you out. If not, mk-2866 and/or mk677 are worth looking into. Take things slowly and safely as with biology, few things are certain. I heard recently about peptide treatment which is non-hormone.

If you did not see my last post (idk how to link it) I am participating in the PXT3003 study. They are developing a drug to stop progression for type 1A. A little about my history with CMT: I (28,f) got diagnosed by genetic testing when I was 5. I had some symptoms early on, lots of falling, walking abnormal, weird hand grip... I did PT weekly until 7th grade, wore night braces, Other than not being able to run the mile in gym class, CMT did not have much affect on my life. I was very lucky. It flipped like a light switch in May, idk what happened that just immediately start to affect my daily life. Now, I am on my feet all day at work full-time, I also have plantar fasciitis so I have really intense pain in the morning. \n\nNow onto the study: Neither the doctor nor myself know if I am on the placebo or the real drug. It is a liquid, comes in a packet like crystal light but I just drink it straight. It smells like banana (which is the \"flavor\") but it taste like melted banana boat sunscreen. I take it 2x/day and will soon go to 2 packets 2x/day. I cannot drink because one of the ingredients is the drug vivitrol which is for alcoholism and will make you violently sick if you have alcohol. (Which I guess could be a way to see if I am on the placebo \ud83d\ude05 (I am not going to.)) I was not sure if I would feel any changes currently since its for the progression. So far I do not notice any difference. I am still in a lot of pain but that is mostly the plantar fasciitis. I am getting some shocks in my feet again, I cannot remember if they started coming back just before I started taking the med or after. So maybe its counteracting the Gabapentin I am on? I have a call with the team next week which is when I will increase the dosage. \n\n\nTldr; CMT did not affect me much until recently, started taking this gross medication/placebo, do not think I am noticing any changes. \n\nI can post another update after the call or just if something happens, but otherwise it is pretty boring. Not much to report. If you are also doing the study or have any questions I would love to hear from you! I would imagine it is probably going to take some time for it to have an effect. But keep us updated if you notice any changes! Hopefully if can help with your pain Thanks for sharing your experience! I love your description of the flavor.\n\nI am in a drug trial for a completely different thing (PSC), and the study administrator emails me the results of the testing done for it. Well, on the test paperwork is \"**PLACEBO**\" in big bold letters. So they did not do a very good job of blinding either her or me. I was part of the trial and am continuing to take the medicine. The drug results for me were somewhat inconclusive, but I plan on continuing to take it in case it slows down the degeneration, even if only slightly. PSC the liver disease? Has anyone talked to you about Vancomyacin? If you are not already my sister in law, it has changed her life.

Just want to get to understanding my condition better Can I see your carbon fibre supports?  I get new AFOs next year, and that is what I am getting.\nWhen you say ways to manage, what do you mean? Pain management? Expectations? Body acceptance? CMT is a highly variable disease. Since you are already getting AFOs (ankle-foot orthotics, very common here) you must have known for a while that you had a problem. Hopefully, these will stabilize you and help you walk more easily. \n\nMy best advice, without knowing more about your situation, is to try to stay reasonably active, in whatever way that works for you. If you can walk well once you settle in to using the AFOs, get some walking in regularly. Consider seeing a physical therapist who specializes in neurological disorders if that option is available to you. \n\nYou have a neurological problem, but otherwise your body works just like everyone else's and in addition to trying to maintain what muscles you can for your legs, getting some cardio in some way is a healthy thing that will make your life easier in the long run. \n\nIf you are looking for tips on navigating specific situations, there are probably people who could offer better advice if you had more specific questions. Thank you for the response, I had suspicions something was wrong for years, but was misdiagnosed in early years so went untreated for years, this gave me a lot to look at I appreciate it greatly A lot of people get really into swimming, as you do not really need balance or stability. I would say get a neurologist that you trust and feel you can have open honest disscusions with. Dont be complacent if you start to experience pain or somethings off. CMT is a degenerative condtion so while it may not kill you the longer you go not addressing something the less likely or harder it will become to overcome or manage. Someone already mentioned physical therapy but also get an occupational therapist for your hands. Get a podiatrist to see regularly to help manage your feet. They can help cut your nails file callouses and detect problems with your feet later on. Do not let this disease get you depressed. Its extremely easy to become overwhelmed by the pain or weakness you feel. This is dangerous as it could lead to becoming seditary which is dangerous to stopping the pogression of the disease.

If you stop believing in yourself and loving yourself.\n\nStep one is accepting that you have cmt. And that it is okay. It is not going to kill you or make not unable to have kids or something. But yeah, your probably not going to walk as everybody else or have the same hand strength or something like that. I have come to accept that I am okay with that, and that I am proud of myself and all my other capabilities. Being a good person and a friend \u2026 that walks kind of funny \ud83d\ude04 I am okay with it, but it takes time. \n\nAlso, for me I still cannot help but think about what other people think.

Not that often, huh? I tend to be more self-aware than people are aware of me, and maybe that is a good reminder to just think about something else than what people might think. Even though it is hard.\n\nStep two is planning ahead. You are still young and you can chose to be almost everything you want. But maybe try and chose a path where you do not end up carrying heavy equipment or something like that. Like for myself, I am a journalist and that is probably a better path than being a camera man. Try to plan ahead. Get exercise, I like to ride a bike. Go to a physiotherapist, this will help you slow the cmt down and keep those other working muscles strong. \n\nI just tried AFOs myself two days ago. These are a bit scary to me as I have never used any aids or anything. But I honestly think I will be happy I got them this \u201csoon\u201d as they help A LOT for\nmy stability. And, you know, they can just hide under my jeans until I get comfortable with them.\n\nWell, hey. You are going to have a great life, it is just going to be a bit shaky sometimes. I am just happy my head is not sick, because there is no AFOs for that.\n\nHope you have a great day - and if you have questions, this sub is truly a great place!", "Covid Vaccine and CMT? Hey guys. Just wondering if anyone on here got the covid vaccine. I know that covid-19 itself has some major neurological side effects, so I was wondering if the vaccine would also have similar effects? Anyone have any experience with either? Here is a link to a discussion we had on the subject a few months ago. TLDR If you are not allergic to it, get vaccinated. \n This is amazing! I must have missed this thread. Thank you so much!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Also just to clarify, I am not anti-vax at all. I just wanted to be sure with this particular vaccine. Because people love personal stories - I have CMTX and am a health care worker, got both doses of Moderna. I feel absolutely fine, had minor transient arm soreness right after both doses. 10/10 recommend I have CMT2 (unknown variant) and I will be having my 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine this coming Monday. With the first dose I had a headache and fatigue the following day but that was it. Got Moderna shot 1. Feelin great. As a pharmacist, fellow CMTer (type 2 unknown), and someone who cleared it with her neurologist through a CMT Center of Excellence- I can guarantee it is completely safe. I have received both doses! I am so glad someone posted this here - I was really excited to one day get the vaccine when available to me but was concerned about how it may impact CMT. I am happy it is not impacted by it! Thanks so much for sharing your experience! This is good to know. Thanks! Amazing! Congratulations on being fully vaccinated. Thanks! Thank you! Me too! I am very relieved.", "What is something that happened today where you did not let your CMT get in the way?  I picked up a 30lb box without stumbling.  That is awesome :)  It is always embarrassing me when I do stumble. So I do not do it as much.  Yeah, I feel the same way. But now if I stumble, I am just like oh whatever. Whoever saw it, saw it, and good for them lol.  Yeah, I need to work on that and not worry about what others think.  It definitely helps. I think I stopped caring a while ago. There is not anything I can do about my stumbling so if I have to deal with it so will the people who see it happen lol :) Very good attitude to have! :)  Thank you!  Welcome :) I need to try and have more of an attitude like that.  Playing video games. Fingers and hand starts to get numb. Shake that shit out and keep on playing! (Took a break and gave hands some love)", "Build Your career as Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Best CFA Training Institute in India at Jaipur for CFA Course, CFA Program ", "Travelling Hey guys. Was wondering how other people felt about this. I have CMTX, 27yo, and as far as symptoms go, I think I count as one of the milder cases. I cannot walk for as long or as fast as the average person, if I walk long enough (&gt; 3 hours) I get some back pain(muscular I think). I twist my ankle maybe once a fortnight? Other than that and some grip issues, I am fairly 'fit' and have no issues with rowing, handstands and the like. I even did breakdancing for a few years, until some symptoms caught up with my hands, meaning I can no longer do (or never should have been doing) anything high impact.\n\nBut because of this, and my last experience travelling (with a friend, walking in cities in Germany) where I had to take a break for a whole day for my back to recover, I am totally put off from travelling. But at the same, I want to travel. I want to bump into interesting people abroad. I enjoy it. But everytime I think of that I remind myself that it will literally be a pain. It is a just bit depressing.\n\nThat last holiday was 4 years ago. I am bored. But it feels like looking for some holiday excitement will bring nothing but agro... fuck CMT.", "I  Hate Socks I wear tall, somewhat thick socks to help protect my legs and feet from my AFO's, but I despise trying to put them on. They always get caught half way up my leg, hanging half off my foot. At this point I have to pinch and grab and twist my socks with my fingers, which obviously takes forever, and I usually give up when I get too frustrated to continue and they are twisted sideways on my foot. Sometimes I just sit on my bed for 15 minutes with my socks in my hand, avoiding putting them on in anticipation of the struggle that lies ahead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSurely someone among us has figured out a better way. Are there socks that go on easy but still offer enough material to protect my legs and feet from abrasion? Or perhaps something akin to baby powder that I could apply beforehand makes putting socks on easier? My fingers are weak which is most of the reason that putting socks on is so difficult. I would love to hear if anyone else struggles with socks and if they have found something that works for them.  \n\n\n Thanks for hearing my rant. Have you tried rolling the top your socks down until just the toe is open, then unrolling them up your leg? Mm. Not a bad idea. I am sure rolling the socks up would still be challenging but maybe easier ultimately than fighting the sock up my leg. If you can get the sock on one arm sometimes it can be real easy to roll it down once it gets started. Hope it works for you though! I find hiking socks are easy to put on, comfortable, affordable, and are as tough as nails. I validate your rant and raise you slippers!\n\n\nSomewhere out there, there must exist comfortable, cozy, plushy soled slippers in size 13/14 4Wide, affordable, available and wont slip off after a few steps, trip me up, and reinforce the concept that a concrete slab foundation hurts when your face, or any part of the body is impacted.\n\nI await your suggestions! Ooh. That does sound promising. Thanks for the advice! Ooh that sounds painful. I have never tried wearing slippers but I gave up wearing flip flops long ago for the same reasons. Perhaps a slipper exists with a comfortable Velcro strap across the heel to keep it in place Thanks for the input! Any brands you like in particular? Excellent suggestion! I have not found one, yet. However, I have tried Velcroing my slippers and using a kind of Superglue to hold the makeshift strap in place. Let us just say, I was unsuccessful in my endeavors. Have you ever tried a sock aid tool? There are a couple of different designs but they are basically devices that hold the sock open so you can slide your foot into it. I have not ever used one myself so I do not know if they will work but you might want to consider it if you have not seen them. I havent heard of such a thing but I will do a google search. Thanks! I wear AFO\u2019s daily and my favorite socks ever are from Covert Threads. A little expensive, but great quality, fit, and comfort.  In the \u201cboot sock\u201d section I get Beast or Desert in black. Comfy and masks my leg gear. \nThey are fantastic! If you are a woman, I would suggest trying mens socks. They seem to be a bit more stretchy (and also more durable!).\n\nIf the above does not help, I have found bamboo socks and (as someone else said) hiking socks to be the best. Both are soft and pliable and bamboo socks in particular take longer to lose their softness wash after wash. Hiking socks have the added bonus of being designed to go up your legs over trousers, so they would also be super (but are usually thicker so would not work with some shoes/outfits). They are most commonly advertised towards older folks or for those using compression socks. Not a bad tool to use. I understand the weakness. Have you tried something like pantyhose? I struggle with sticking to my afo's and wearing long socks (curvy with big feet). I will wear leggings or tights and avoid wearing long socks. But my wardrobe is very relaxed.", "Scared I might have cmt \ud83d\ude29 advice would be welcome Hi guys.im 30F \nSo I am getting tested for cmt this week as ive been having symptoms and it runs rife in my family.\nI didnt think it could be CMT as i always believed it came out in puberty but ive been told it could be. What do you guys think. \nHere are my symptoms \nIve always been very clumsy, this has worsened in adulthood.\nWeak ankles.\nBurning feet.\nJoint pain. \nMuscle jerking in hands and feet.\nAchilles tendon pain when i walk.\nI do not believe I have any feet deformities.\nmy arches are normal to high.\nMy toes are beginning to curve upwards.\nStiffness and pain in toes.\n\nI dont know, i look at my aunt and see her feet and hands and feel like what I have going on is nothing compared to her.\nI guess what i want to know is what where the first signs you had to show that you had cmt\nThankyou guys Yes, you have CMT. Your symptoms are not as bad as your aunt\u2019s and may never be.  So, go live nice life anyway. \ud83d\ude42 Same symptoms here.  Muscle fatigue, weakness, drop-foot, hammer toes, etc.  I was diagnosed as a kid though (Around 3-ish) because I took too long to learn how to walk.  \n\nUnfortunately, it is not something that goes away with age.  It progresses, but it is not the end of the world.  With supportive people or family, and preparation for the eventual losses of function over time it is not as hard of a blow.\n\nBare in mind however, I have been in the know and preparing for over 25 years.  I do not envy your position of having to come to terms with CMT as an adult.  Just know, there is hundreds of folks living perfectly fine lives despite it.  At the end of the day, it is just another burden and everyone is lives have plenty of them, regardless of physical disability. Growing up, even though I showed signs of CMT I did not think I had it because my sibling's CMT was so much worse. \n\nSome days I would feel a little crazy: go to school, be the slowest runner, be a bit clumsy, feel like I must have some reason why I was slightly different from my peers... then go home and think \"oh but I am clearly not like my sibling, maybe I have something else\" because their symptoms were so much worse. \n\nIn the end, I got tested and diagnosed when I was 20. \n\nSeverity of symptoms varies quite a bit from person to person. Your symptoms are consistent with CMT. Since it runs in your family, it is likely that this is what you have. That does not mean you will progress to have symptoms as bad as your aunt does. \n\nNo one really knows why some people develop symptoms that are so much worse than others but generally--assuming CMT is what you have--you will stay on track with the same rate of progress you have experienced your whole life. Thank you, I have always viewed cmt as extreme, finding out it is on a spectrum of severity now has really helped me to understand it so much better. When you get tested, would you mind telling me if the test was just a simple blood test or what else is involved? I already am confirmed but need up to date testing for trying for a baby so slightly apprehensive about what the new tests will involve. The genetic test is a blood test. \n\nNeurologists may do other testing, but if you have already been diagnosed and are simply looking into the genetics for family planning, I do not really see why they would.", "Where to even start? Just over 5 months ago, it was mentioned to me that I might have something called Charcot Marie Tooth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n30 years old and it all started with a slight numbness every once in a while. It seems to slowly progress from my toes to foot, up the outward side of my shin. Fingertips beginning to feel the same. Fuzzy, blurry nerve signals like a CRT tuned to nothing. I have lost my balance. Standing still is tough and I walk \"drunk\" I am embarrassed and I have lost my ability to go hiking and camping, which were great joys in my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know of no others in my family with this disorder. I do not know anyone else with this, nor have I ever heard of it. Doctors I have been to gave me pressure ankle ASO for both ankles at 150$ apiece. Only later did I realize how badly I got ripped off after my insurance refused to pay for them. I have paid in well over 700$ just to go to different doctors and specialists who all have some canned speech about being hopeful, but just send me on to someone else who has no idea what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI may have found someone to help, so I jumped through two weeks of back and forth to get a reference and appointment....For the end of this year. Over 5 months from now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not even know what I am looking for here. I am listless and suffering with only more numbness in my future. Find a CMT regional clinic. My nearest one is in Iowa City, however, there are a bunch more in the US. You can meet w a TEAM of people who know what you are going thru and give you some care and know exactly what you are going thru. I just went to my clinic in my 30s so it isnt too late. Educate yourself and you will be much better off Have a look through the ( website, it is well written and straightforward.  ( \n\nI find navigating the website a bit hard work so persevere.  It is already been said by n3ttz but educating yourself and owning the disease is the best way to progress, it is strong medicine and a tough journey though so take it easy on yourself, seek help, and do not give up hiking just make it manageable - my thoughts are with you. Appreciate the link. The American equivalent is (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately there are no clinics within 100 miles on this site from me. 100 miles is 160.93 km I feel your pain. I inherited it from my mother. Upside is u know what I am dealing with (sorta, as CMT can affect each person slightly differently, even if they have the exact same type).\n\nIf you have recently felt a fast decline within the last several weeks, (but was feeling not to shabby just months before hand) you might have something similar to mine...\n\nMy CMT progresses slowly like most, but! I get slammed with all the same symptoms you just mentioned during seasonal allergy months. I might not show any other seasonal allergy symptoms like runny nose or itchy eyes, but my legs get numb, I feel dizzy, feel like my head's in a fog, and even have slight tremors.\n\nIf I take zertac, or flonase... Those symptoms greatly decrease and by July I am feeling my normal self.\n\nUnfortunately during the seasonal allergy stint, I lose muscle mass &amp; padding on my feet. So as soon as I am feeling better, it is gym time to try and get back any little muscle in my legs that I can. It sucks and I know is a losing battle, but then I see my mom still moving around with he braces, so I try not to complain.\n\nJust remember, (if you workout at the gym or do any activities) once you feel fatigued... STOP! You will do more damage if you push through, so just stop when you get tired and get the best sleep you can get.\n\nCMT makes it hard for me to get a deep sleep, I am not sure about you..., but it is one more thing we have to combat. Sleep &amp; rest is just as important as staying active.\n\nStay in touch..., we are going though rough the same stuff. I have had allergy problems in the past, but have not experienced the normal symptoms in a while. Everything here is light yellow from the layer of pollen this time of year though. Absolutely severe. This is definitely going on my list of things to try.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still have quite a bit of muscle mass on my legs from hiking and just being naturally a big mfer. I plan to lose a bit more weight to add to my mobility. 6'2 225Lbs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did not sleep well last night. Combination of the ( I have and tingling pain. Going for try 2 now. These braces seemed to help a lot with the morning stiffness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI appreciate your reply. Hit me up in a message with some contact information if you want to have a chat about it some time. I am just glad we have a non toxic community here that can chat about this stuff. PM me anytime, (or just reply to this post with any updates).\n\nI am not wearing any braces just yet, but I am really want to get fitted for the shoe inserts. If you have lots of muscle cramps at night, you might want to try a week of no caffeine and drink lots of water, (it helped me tons).\n\nI know we all have slightly different symptoms so what works for me may not work for you. But from what I have read from others..., Caffeine exacerbates our muscle cramping.\n\nIf you do not mind, please let me kniw if you start feeling any better after the season allergies pass ; I am interested to know.\n\nThank you! Wow! I have the same allergy symptoms, never once considered that CMT was at all involved. I found serious relief from a combo of Flonase, Zyrtec d and regular afrin. Last year my allergies were the worst they have ever been. Brutal year, head foggy etc like you mentioned, terrible ear infections etc. What type of CMT do you have - I am 1A myself. Also totally agree, moving around is hugely important!! Thanks for posting and confirming that I am not the only one. This was a really bad season for me, (disabling) and I had to add anti-anxiety that is also allergy medication into the mix so my chest would stop hurting, (I was shallow breathing due to being in pain... , causing me to panic and making the situation even worse).\n\nIf you are interested, ask for Hydroxyzine from toy doctor. I have zero side affects from it and I swear it helps with my CMT by lowering my anxiety.\n\nYes, I am A1 as well. I am usually feeling pretty good about 7 months out of the year, but it seems that each allergy season hits me harder. If you have any advice /suggestions I am all ears.\n\nThanks! As far as advice, I would say without a doubt keeping the windows shut and just running the AC in the summer may help. Im a windows open kind of guy so that is not always realistic. Also, the main thing w the allergy meds is to be proactive - I take a Zyrtec most everyday when it is spring/fall. If you 'need' that stuff due to major allergies episode, it is too late, you cannot play catch up with that stuff. The Flonase once a day with a few other times of regular afrin during the day was the x factor for me. My physician recommended that to me and I thought he was crazy but it was a lifesaver. I had the dizziness etc several times last year before I got consistent w that stuff. The nose spray keeps everything thinned out. \n\nI know for sure diet has to play a part as well, so it may be worth talking to someone about nutrition. I will say I have dealt with allergies and asthma my whole life and this stuff is cyclical. I went most of my 20s with no issues. Having the meds over the counter helps, I also use a singulair inhaler for maintenance when it is really bad, I will do that in the morning. Hoping for a better year this year! I have been better than last year thus far though, knock on wood! I could def lose a few lbs, I have had a few surgeries in recent years so I am a bit heavier than normal and I do not think it is a coincidence that I have felt a little worse during that time! Thanks so much for the detailed post.\nIt gives me hope, and let us me know I am on the right path.\n\nYou are right, I started my allergy meds to late this season and paid dearly. I will not let that happen again!\n\nI lost 30 pounds last year and lowered my blood pressure &amp; cholesterol, so I am good there, but I am thinking about starting a steroid to try and gain some muscle in my legs, (currently have chicken legs).\n\nI work my legs out often and stretch as often as possible.\n\nIf I did not mention it before. Check out CoQ10, ( ubiquinol). It is truly a inexpensive over the counter, (I order from Amazon) game changer.\nIt helps with so many things.\n\n1st, it gives you more energy (you will not see any changes until probably a month in of taking it).\n\n2nd, it helps circulation and muscles.\n\n3rd, it lowers your blood pressure slowly &amp; naturally.\n\n\nI guarantee you will notice a big difference after two months of taking it. Do not ever skip a day, (once a day pill). \n\nIf you want to know more. \n\n\n", "3rd shot Getting the 3rd maderna shot today. Got dog sick with the other 2. Great...... Good luck!

In Pharnext's previous interactions with FDA, the agency provided guidance that an additional Phase III study would be required. Based on our most recent interactions with FDA through a Type C meeting, FDA has now provided a very clear path to NDA submission for approval of our lead clinical program.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The FDA has agreed with the key elements of Pharnext's approach for the developmental pathway to approval for PXT3003. ***Specifically, the FDA has indicated that a single pivotal Phase III study in CMT1A delivering robust results could be sufficient for approval of PXT3003.*** This study design will be similar to the earlier Phase III study of PXT3003 that yielded encouraging top line results in October 2018. The FDA has agreed that the primary endpoint will again be Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS). Notably, the FDA has also agreed that the factorial study requirement for combination drugs can be carried out in a preclinical CMT1A disease animal model, and not in a human Phase III clinical trial as typically required. The animal factorial study, a requirement for NDA filing, will be done under GLP or GLP-like conditions and will have a similar study design and use the same CMT1A model as our previously successful preclinical factorial study.\n\nHere is a link to the original source (PDF) and also a non-pdf link (for anyone who wants to translate the text):\n\n(\n\n(\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLink(s) found via **CMTTreatmentReport.com**:\n\n( \\- a source of Charcot-Marie-Tooth treatment/cure news, updates, scientific research, clinical trials Excuse me if I sound ignorant, but what does this mean? Is PXT about to be approved for circulation, or another round of testing? And what does it do? It says treatment, so I am pretty sure it is more like to stop degeneration than to reverse it, but I am not very knowledgeable and just plenty confused. I appreciate you posting this though! Thank you! All new to this sub. What does this mean excatly? Are there some kind of timeframe? They are preparing to start another round of testing. The claim, as I recall, is that it not only stops progression but can **slightly** improve the existing degeneration.\n\nThe company that makes PXT had a full clinical trial but they made a technical error and got told to redo part of it. This is their redo. They say they will start in the first quarter of 2021 so maybe by 2022 they will have approval if they can show good results. This is the closest CMT1A type folks have come to a treatment yet. It is in continuing clinical trials and we probably will not know anything for at least 18 months or so. Oh my god that is wonderful! I honestly have no words for how much you just made my day, man. I did not want to get my hopes up years ago when they mentioned something like this in Nemour's, but it looks like they were aware that this was happening. Thank you again for the news! Just to keep the optimism going, if you have 1A, there is (in my opinion and in my doctor\u2019s opinion) an even more promising treatment on the horizon, take a look  \n\nThe PXT3003 is a cocktail of existing drugs that may help symptoms, the antisense treatment I linked looks a lot more like a \u201ccure\u201d. There are definitely problems to be worked through before human clinical trials can start, but, my doctor is optimistic we will see something in the next 5-10 years. Bless you for these news, brother. I will be honest, my doctors have never mentioned any of this. I only ever knew about the PXT as an offhand comment from a surgeon when I was getting my stuff done, so even though he was an excellent doctor, this stuff was never breached. I guess I need to bring this up to my current one or find a better one because holy crap I cannot believe I did not know this stuff existed. Thank you for giving me hope, man Of course! For what it is worth, most Neurologists are likely not in tune with this, I live in Colorado but fly to California once a year to see a specialist who is up to date, I have been to my state\u2019s university hospital neurology department and even they are uninformed on CMT. I am worried I will have to do the same. I do not know if I can make trips of that kind, what do you recommend? Will it be enough to tell my doctors about these possible treatments? Maybe not necessary if you feel like you are getting good care now. I go to Stanford and the only thing I feel like I am missing out on is their PT program which is specifically designed for CMT... but otherwise the appointment is really just to hear about research and get some measurements on how my symptoms are professing. I post here after my appointments with whatever I learn and I am happy to keep you in the loop.

I am 25 yers old. I have been diagnosed with CMT type 1 for 3 years. I have moderate symptoms(skinny legs and hands,weakness).  I have gone to doctors twice. They advised me take B-group vitamins. There are so few people who are suffered from CMT in my area. As a result doctors do not have vast experience with working with this deasise. Could you share some general advice which you got from your doctors? Sorry for my English))) I have known about CMT all my life and also have mild symptoms compared to other family members with it.

For context I am Type 1A, 27 years old, about the same.   \n\n\nI do not do a great job of managing it, but what is helped me is getting high shoes with ankle support, staying relatively thin (being obese makes all the feet issues much worse) , and stretching every day. \n\nI also went to a physical therapist about a year ago, and he gave me some instructions on stretches to do every day. That might be a good place to get some better advice. \n\nThe CMTUSA website also has some videos on stretches you can do at home. Might be worth checking out.\n\n( Thanks so much! I checked it out,there are so many useful info for us) I will definitely use this resource. You  are right about weight. We should control it to relieve the pressure on our feet.

B6 is neurotoxic to people with CMT in large doses. In general, be aware of where your fingers are at all times. Especially in the kitchen. Keep yourself active as much as you can. Stretching, going for walks, core exercises, easy stuff. Look up tools to make things around the house easier, such as jar openers, non slip bath mat, hand grip workout squeezers, etc. if you use AFO braces, take care of them. Wash the pads frequently. Look up wholesale Velcro that stretches. Get a comfortable insole pad. And shoes that work best for your situation. &gt;Velcro that stretches\n\nThat is a thing for afos? I have had really strict velcro to keep everything in place. Stretching it would just mean toe walking with more rubbing. I think it is called velstretch. Probably not called that. Both work, for my blue rockers at least. It is not too stretchy where it gives while walking. But gives a slight stretch while fastening to the Velcro on the AFO for a more secured and tighter fit with less wiggle space. Where to begin really;\n\n* Stay active. Join a gym as that is one of the only exercises you will be able to do\n* Stretch every day. You will have shortened calves and tight quads, hamstrings, and glutes\n* If walking hurts then get insoles that help distribute the pressure of your foot better\n* You might have an issue developing muscle. This is harder to resolve as the solution is to use PEDs\n* Look out for hip pain. osteoarthritis of the hip is common in people with CMT. No one knows why, but it is. I had my right hip replaced at 26\n* Your sleep might be poor. If you suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness then you will need to undergo a sleep study.

Just trying to see how I have progressed over the last few months.  I could just pick this rock up, its about 80kg (about 176lbs).  Feeling like there has been some progress ! I have seen this post before. Do not remember if it was here or elsewhere. Are you demonstrating/measuring the strength in your arms or your legs or your ability to walk? A bit of everything.   Mainly strength training and to see what i can do and to have some fun.  Never know when my wife will need the rocks moved in the garden \ud83d\ude00 Just a quick reminder, always lift with a straight back (i meam really straight!) and  out of ur legs, otherwise its verhy unhelaty for ur spine and can cause damage in the in the future (: Thanks. I ask for a few reasons. I have been told by a neuromuscular specialist that I have CMT. However, she has also told me I DO NOT have CMT. I have had all the standard testing, several EMG's, all the imaging studies, physical examination, ... As well as a nerve biopsy, conclusion = inconclusive. Genetic testing. Three different genetic anomalies identified. One is significant according to the genetic counselor but she could not go beyond that point and say conclusively I have CMT let alone CMT type.\n\nSo, after several years of ungodly pain, the perpetual decline of abilities and strength in my legs, enough testing to be the national gross revenue of a small country, the best I get is, you have CMT - Maybe, Maybe not.\n\nI was trying to look at your gait as you staggered with the bolder. For the most part, without the boulder, your gait is close to mimicking mine. Legs and knees bent at an awkward position, the waddling rocking back and forth as you propel one leg in front of the other.\n\nI have been looking for videos of those affected, afflicted with CMT of the legs that shows them walking unaided by any supporters.\nI want to compare their walking, gait, jesters, .... to mine.\n\nThanks for the response. and Keep moving them rocks! Sounds horrible to be left in such a crappy yes / no / maybe / sure answer.  I got diagnosed when i was 12 or something and found most sport to be shit.  I could lift things so i just stuck with it.  \n\nI do have other clips of my walk i can upload if you want and to be honest, i cracked up withe waddle comment.  That made my day, That is how I describe my ambulation to others, I waddle. Seems to be the best visual most can identify with.\n\nIf you would not mind, yes, I would like to see your normal gait as you 'walk' Yea!!

AFAIK I am the only CMT mutant there, most of the members are para- or quadriplegic or have other kinds of super powers.\nWe meet once a week to do some popular sports like hockey, basketball or smolball (hitting a foamed plastic ball really hard with something like a badminton rack and trying to score a goal) just for fun.\nNow, while I am an okayish player (for our standards, haha...) with those sports that do not require holding any kind of equipment in one hand, I am terrible at those that do. As I cannot oppose my thumb to the other fingies and those also being very weak, it is quite frustrating for me. I cannot get control or power in my clownesque brandishing of rackets or sticks. I thought about taping the hockey stick to my forearm, but it encumbers my handling of the wheelchair.\nHave you found a way to cope with this problem?\n\ntl;dr: how do you hold your sports equipment?

Drinks were flowing and we were getting a bit silly. Well our friends have a couple of dogs that they recently bought shock collars for (for the record, they just use the vibrate and sound function to reduce barking, they do not shock the dogs). A couple of the guys were trying out the shock function on their arms. The scale goes from 1-99 and I think they were at about a 15 and they looked to be in a significant amount of pain. Have you figured out where this is going? \n\nNow my friends know I have a disorder that causes loss of muscle and bad balance, but they really do not know the specifics. I bet them that I could take a higher shock from the collar than they could. My husband of course knew I could, but played along and laughed and called me a wimp, etc. So they put the collar on my arm. Leave 5... nothing, 10.... nothing, 15.... nothing, 30.... a bit of a tickle. By 99 my hand felt a bit tingly, but my husband and I were smiling while everyone else were scraping their jaws off the floor thinking I was some kind of superwoman. I love this! I had a similar trick a couple years back. I had a fake shocking lighter, my friends know my hands are not great and will always help me out. I would pretend to not be able to light my lighter, and when they would take it to light it for me, they would get shocked :p\n\nWe would all laugh and I would get to struggle next time I had actual trouble because they did not trust me anymore lmao.\n\nWorth. Oh man this was a great story to read before bed.", "Anyone else here with unknown-type \"CMT\" and mild chronic kidney issues ? I have a theory that might explain some of the \"unknown\" CMT cases, like me and my Dad.  First a little history.\n\nMy Dad, and now I, started noticing neuropathy in our feet at around 45-50 years old.  For years they told Dad it was diabetic neuropathy, he had type 2 diabetes, but he lost weight, etc and his A1C is now normal.  I do not have diabetes.  Dad finally saw a real neurologist \\~3 years ago, and he did an EMG and immediately diagnosed CMT.  We saw Dr. Shy at the CMT Clinic at U of Iowa.  He said we do not have any known type of CMT.  Confirmed with genetic tests -- no known CMT genes.\n\nI am getting worse, went to see another neurologist -- did an EMG -- \"looks like CMT\".  My genetic test shows only one gene of \"undetermined significance\", but I inherited it from my Mom -- Dad does not have it, and the neurologist says that we are exactly alike.\n\nNow, Dad and I have \\*another\\* shared genetic issue that affects the kidneys.  Its called Alport Syndrome type 3.  It is a mild form of Alport Syndrome sometimes called \"Thin Basement Membrane Disease\".  The only symptom that most people have is microscopic blood in 3 of 4 urine samples.   Many people go through life not knowing about it.  The only way I figured it out is by getting a Whole Genome Sequencing done, which flagged the mutation on COL4A3.  My Dad, sister, cousin same thing.   My brother, without the mutation -- no sign of neuropathy.\n\nDoctors admit that neuropathy and kidney issues often go hand-in-hand, but they fully understand it.  I finally have a theory.  My neurologist is intrigued, but unconvinced.   So, if any of you have something similar, you might be able to help figure this out.\n\nMy Dad finally had a test done that showed a fairly high level of \"Beta2 Microglobulin\".  On a hunch, I got the same test, and it is at the very top of the \"normal\" range.  High \"B2M\" has gotten a lot of research, because people with kidney failure who are on dialysis get very high B2M.   After 8 to 10 years on dialysis almost everyone was getting peripheral neuropathy, joint problems and some heart problems caused by something called \"B2M Amyloidosis\".\n\nSo my theory is that our medium-high level of B2M for \\~40-50 years is causing a similar Amyloidosis.  That causes CMT-like neuropathy.  My Dad also has unexplained heart problems and a pacemaker.  I have joint problems in my ankle and knee that the Rheumatologists cannot explain.  I could go on, but do not want to make this to technical.\n\nSo, if any of you have this type of late-onset CMT of unknown type, you might be able to help.  Even if you do not know of mild-kidney issues, you could ask your Doctor to test your \"Beta2 Microglobulin\", and post your result ;)\n\nThanks.\n\nBTW.  There \\*might\\* be a treatment, but it would be ugly.  The problem has been solved for dialysis patients by adding a special filter to remove B2M.  I am not sure anyone would want to endure dialysis in an attempt to stop neuropathy ;( It is incredibly frustrating not to really know what is going on with your own body. I wish you the best of luck in getting a firm explanation and treatment. I (38 M) have CMT. My mom had it as well. I started showing symptoms at about 24 and my mom at 8. I am not sure what type, I have never asked but 2 neurologists and many doctors have confirmed that wet both have/had it. My mom had a kidney transplant in 1993 due to kidneys failing from a condition FSGS (focal segmental glumarial sclerosis). The kidney lasted until 2005 so she went on dialysis then died later that year from heart issues. She was 43.\n\nWhen I was 18 I found out I had the same kidney condition. I got a transplant, lasted a year (long story why only a year) did dialysis for 6 years. Got second transplant that lasted 9 years. Which was not bad for that kidney in me due to it is condition when I got it and antibodies I had. I am now on dialysis again but this time only a live donor will do for a transplant. \n\nSo that is 2 more of us with CMT and ESRD. I feel for you who have severe kidney disease and lose your family so young.\n\nI am guessing that since you are on dialysis, they are monitoring your \u201cBeta2 Microglobulin\u201d level ?  Hopefully they are using the special dialysis filter that reduces it ?  Did they ever test you or your Mom (or you) for \u201cB2M Amyloidosis\u201d ?  That might have contributed to her heart failure.  B2M is the connection that I am looking for.\n\nSupposedly, kidney transplants do solve the B2M problems when they succeed.  Wishing you luck to get one. No I have never even heard of that level. But now I will find out. First of all let me just say that this post is written based on a very limited and brief sampling of the literature, so it is by no means a thorough examination of your hypothesis. But perhaps these thoughts can be of interest to you somehow, I certainly found it an interesting topic to look into.\n\nSo according to your post, both you and your dad have neurologic symptoms. Both of you also have a mutation in the COL4A3 gene which is the cause of Alport syndrome. Your dad has elevated \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin (serum, not urinary I assume?) levels above the reference range and you are within the reference range but just barely.\n\nYour hypothesis is that the mutation in the COL4A3 gene is causing elevated serum levels of \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin, and that the elevated serums levels is then indicative of \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin amyloidosis which through some mechanism (aggregation into Axons/Schwann cells beeing the obvious candidate) is causing a peripheral neuropathy similar to what is seen in CMT.\n\nBreaking the hypothesis down should make it easier to assess it is validity, so I am going to make an attempt:\n\n\n&gt;A mutation in the COL4A3 gene is causing elevated serum levels of \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin\n\nMutations in COL4A3 typically cause nephritis which could explain elevated serum levels of \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin, however I have tried to find studies that demonstrates a link between mutations in the COL4A3 gene and elevated serum levels of \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin without success. Do you know of any such papers?\n\n\n\n&gt;Elevated \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin serums levels is indicative of \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin amyloidosis\n\nAssuming that this is true, then according to the study \"( *\"b2m-amyloidosis is only seen in patients that experience sustained grossly elevated concentrations of circulating b2m in the blood for longer periods of time (years).\"* \n\nThe fact that your levels were measured to be within the reference value would suggest that you do not have \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin amyloidosis. Since you have neurological symptoms, this would suggest that in your case \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin amyloidosis is not the cause. Some newer studies suggest that elevation of circulating \u03b22M levels may not be the only cause of \u03b22M-derived amyloid however. And although unlikely, it could also be that your serum levels fluctuate and that they happened to be low on the day of testing. If we assume that \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin amyloidosis is occurring in you, then:\n\n\n\n&gt;There must be a link between \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin amyloidosis and peripheral neuropathy.\n\nAccording to the study \"( the clinical findings associated with \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin amyloidosis are mostly related to deposits in osseoarticular tissues, i.e. bones and joints, followed to a lesser degree by deposits in visceral organs (kidneys, heart, etc). Deposits in peripheral nerves are mentioned, however neuropathies of any kind following such deposits are not. The fact that you have joint problems is interesting, but joint problems are also really common.\n\nI have tried to find studies that show a link between \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin amyloidosis and peripheral neuropathy without success, do you know of any such papers?\n\n\nAt least 12 cases with (supposed) Alport syndrome and some form of polyneuropathy has been reported in the literature. Most of these studies were &gt;30 years old however and the accuracy of the diagnosis of Alport syndrome in some of these cases are a bit questionable. Peripheral neuropathy does not seem to be mentioned in studies with genetically confirmed COL4A3 mutations. According to the most recent (2020) clinical review of COL4A3 mutations, \"( neuropathy is not mentioned as a clinical feature in any of the 48 papers that met the inclusion criteria.\n \nThere is also a link between nephropathy and CMT, however from what I gather most of them seem to be caused by mutations in INF2 and does not involve \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin in the pathophysiology.\n\nThere are some recent studies that suggest that collagen IV seems to be involved in peripheral nerve myelination. COL4A3 code for collagen IV, so I suppose there is a non-zero chance that there could be a link there, but that would be wild speculation on my part.\n\nAs for uremic polyneuropathy, according to ( *\"The cause of uremic polyneuropathy is not known. Factors that have been suggested to contribute include deficiencies of thiamine, zinc, and biotin and decreased transketolase activity. Increases in phenols, myoinositol, beta2-microglobulin and other middle-molecular-weight substances, and hyperparathyroidism have also been suggested to contribute.\"* I have not been able to find any study that propose a mechanisms for how \u03b2\u2082-microglobulin might contribute to uremic polyneuropathy. That does not mean it it does not exist, and I would love to see it if it does.\n\nIn summary my impression is that it is unlikely that a COL4A3 mutation is the cause of a CMT like neuropathy. I could be wrong however, and I will keep an extra eye on future papers about nephropathy and CMT in case something interesting shows up.", "Looking for help and clarification Hello all...I am some what new to posting on reddit so please forgive any errors I may make.\n\nSo as the title says I am looking for help and clarification. I was diagnosed with CMT many years ago and kind of closed myself off to it....I did not care did not want to care did not want to know anything and live in blissful ignorance...that being said I was always under the impression it was a form of Muscular Dystrophy is this not correct?\n\nAlso I was under the impression that this was genetic and usually passed through the dna of the mother. Is this correct?\n\nAssuming the passing of CMT is genetic through the mother what are the odds of getting it when neither parent has it? Further more what are the odds of that happening to two children?\n\nMy brother is 4 years older then me and about 2 years after I was diagnosed with CMT (at the age of 15) it was discovered he had brain cancer (medulloblastoma strange thing is that is a \"childhood\" cancer) which would make him 21 at the time. Well he had surgery and the removed almost all of the tumor but in the process they nicked his brain resulting in him having some adverse side effects...he completed chemo and radiation and has thankfully been cancer free for a good long while now. I am 31 and he is 35. His doctors are now thinking he has CMT. Things just do not add up for me right now.\n\n\nThanks for reading I hope I was clear and concise in my rambling, and I hate to admit it but my emotions are at an all time high right now. I think I need to start being more mature and taking this more seriously. I cannot answer all of your questions, but it can be passed from either parent. There is also the chance of a spontaneous appearance of CMT without family history. Have you had genetic testing? I am 99% sure that Both my parents and I have had the testing but I am not sure who to contact to confirm this Most types of CMT can be passed from either parent but there are variations. Here are the details. The pattern of inheritance varies with the type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. CMT1, most cases of CMT2, and most intermediate forms are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This pattern of inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one affected parent. Each of the children of an affected parent has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disorder.\n\nCMT4, a few CMT2 subtypes, and some intermediate forms are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Children of affected individuals are not affected unless the other parent also passes down a mutation in the same gene.\n\nCMTX is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome. The inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the condition. In most cases, affected males, who have the alteration on their only copy of the X chromosome, experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than affected females, who have the alteration on one of their two X chromosomes. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. All daughters of affected men will have one altered X chromosome, but they may have only mild symptoms of the disorder. That is fascinating information I am going to have to delve deeper into for a better understanding...I am leaving work now so you have given me food for thought I am female, was told I have 50:50 chance of having a child with it and if it does not it would likely be a carrier re their child may have it. The muscular dystrophy part is tricky. So it is not that but falls under the umbrella I think. It depends on the health professional in my experience as to whether they include that when labelling it or not. I have a medical card stating Charcot Marie tooth muscular dystrophy. In my experience those with muscular dystrophy have it a lot harder. &gt;I was always under the impression it was a form of Muscular Dystrophy is this not correct?\n\nCMT is not a form of muscular dystrophy, but in terms of symptoms there is often much overlap because both cause a gradual weakening and eventually breakdown of muscles. The cause of CMT and the cause of muscular dystrophy however is very different, with CMT being a disease that affect the nerves first, which eventually lead to the muscle problems.\n\nThere is a pretty good and quick rundown on the cause of CMT (both the axonal and demyelinating types) in ( CMT is not technically a form of muscular dystrophy though the symptoms can look similar at a glance. Since muscular dystrophy is more widely known CMT is sometimes described in terms of muscular dystrophy and it is very possible that someone explained it to you that way years ago even though it is not technically correct. \n\nCMT is genetic. How it is inherited varies depending on the specific type. The most common forms are inherited through either parent, a 50-50 chance regardless of the gender of the parent or the child. There are more complicated possibilities for other types. \n\nIf neither parent has it, it is either a recessive form (Type 4 is, I believe) or a de novo mutation, which means that it originated with the child and was not inherited. Either one is rare but not unheard of. If two siblings both have CMT and neither parent does a recessive form would be far more likely than that each had a de novo mutation. It is also possible that one parent does have CMT but such mild symptoms that they were never diagnosed.\n\nIt is entirely possible for two siblings to have CMT yet for their CMT to be of very different levels of severity. My own sibling has a far worse case than my own, for instance. It is certainly possible for a more mild case to escape notice until one's 30s. \n\nI hope this helps a bit. Thank you so much I understand a lot better now Yeah agreed, when I first went under my diagnoses it was labeled with MD also and because of that I did meet some people with different forms of MD and it is a rough life. Found out one of the guys in my high school had it, he was wheel chair bound since like 8, he was a cool dude It should be in your medical records. Your current doctor should have access to the information (in America anyway, and as long as nothing has happened to your old records). I believe your right I am in the states so I hope so. I am just not sure so I will be getting in touch with them after the holidays So this is a very convoluted answer, but CMT is not technically a form of muscular dystrophy. However, our symptoms are very similar to many types of MD, so we are supported under the funding umbrella of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. The difference, as I understand it, is that MD diseases are diseases of the muscle cells themselves, while CMT is a disease of our nerve cells (whether it is the myelin or the axon depends on your subtype). It is a small, but somewhat important difference! \n\nIn MD, there is something called overwork weakness where exercise can actually hurt patients because it damages the muscle cells. For a long time, people assumed the same was true for CMT. Research now shows that it is not true ( and that CMT patients who exercise have better outcomes ( Yes I also went to school someone wheelchair bound from young with it. Some people with cmt use wheelchairs as well of course but it is far more common with muscular dystrophy especially at an earlier age. Also in some cases sadly can impact their life expectancy to mid 30\u2019s which is a really crushing thought. Yeah the boy I knew with it, also was such a kind soul. Life seems very unfair at times.", "Combination of drugs shows mild promise in early clinical trial ", "New to everything Hello everyone I got diagnosed with cmt after volunteering for my friends science fair experiment in 7th grade, (about 6years ago). It was on nerve conductivity, his dad ran the machine. Had a formal follow up to confirm the irregularities. We never paid for the full typing, is there much benefit to it? How many of you also needed surgeries on your feet and or suffer any form of deformations? It is definitely worth the genetic tests to determine  type.  CMT1A is most researched and actually has a drug cocktail that has shown potential in stopping progression and improving some aspects (pxt3003).\n\nEach form of CMT has different issues you need to be aware of. So definitely find your type!! Solid copy, thank you! I just did an ancestry.com to try to find my birth parents and medical history, do you think I would have the same type as them? Most people inherit, which means the same type as one of the parents.\n\nI am a mutant.  My biological parents do not carry the gene I have. *Shrug* I am curious to find out When I got my gene test results, I felt like I finally had an answer. I always knew I likely had CMT 1A based on the results from the nerve conduction tests, but the uncertainty still left room for doubts in my mind. These days, with treatments for 1A and possibly others on the way, knowing the exact genotype is more relevant than ever.  I was recently diagnosed with CMT 1A X-linked, which does not surprise me because my dad has it. If I was you I would get the generic tests, because no one took me seriously until the neurologist who finally got me tested. Also, my dad got the reconstructive surgery and it did not help at all, but you should get as much info about it from your doctor as you can before making a decision about that. I had three surgeries when I was a kid. First one was bilateral other two were on my right foot. Left foot held just fine after round one. I was just curious if others had deformations in the feet How does the treatment work? I phrased it rather badly, there is no (official) treatment, but there are several underway. The ones that are coming work by either lowing pmp22 protein levels in Schwann cells or by increasing the activity of the repair mechanisms in related cells.", "Back pain when doing ironing or cutting vegetables. What is the reason for this? Hello, \n\nI am wondering what could be the reason for back pain when doing something like cutting vegatables on the table in standing position even for 5 minutes.\n\nIn that specific position are not we the same as non-cmt people? Where are you feeling the pain? Lower back? There can definitely be an impact on the back from poor standing posture which could be a result of weakened leg muscles. I am not an expert here but maybe you have got some chronic pain that just takes a few minutes to get triggered when you are standing in such a way that your back is impacted. Yes I am feeling it in the lower back. \n\nIt is interesting because I do not have that pain when I am walking or exercising. Just when I am standing. I am seeing my clothes stacking up because I am dreading the ironing because of this lol I have a short leg! I went in because I randomly would get back spasms that would cause me to literally not be able to get out of bed. This has happened maybe three times total. I just turned 30 so it was kind of odd that was happening at such an early age. Turns out - my right leg is 5mm shorter which causes lower back pain. Not sure how old you are but over the years, my wonky gait (even with afos) has caused my pelvis to be misaligned, which translates to lower back pain, and even shoulder pain if it gets bad enough. I found an amazing physical therapist who finally figured it out and taught me how to realign my pelvis. It is goes out of alignment all the time, but if I do the exercises, the pain is a lot more manageable. I used to have a lot of lower back pain when doing dishes or cutting veggies as well, so much to the point of having to stop and take a break because the pain was so bad. Someone suggested a gel pad to stand on that supports your feet. I got one the next day and it has made an incredible difference. \n\nNot saying it will completely take away the pain, but it will at least support your feet more, and help to keep your leg muscles engaged a bit as well :) it made a world of difference to me, so thought I would share :) Hi, I never thought of that.

Ive done a brain&amp; c-spine mri, spinal tap, blood tests, got tested for lupus, myasthenia gravis, arthritis etc and everything came out normal. My neurologist said she is lost and has no idea of what i could have. It started around 2018 with constant face/throat pain, burning feet &amp; fatigue then got worse.. then this year around i developped weakness in my left legs, weakness in my fingers, pins&amp; needles in my limbs, heat intolerance, temperature regulation issues, tremors, spasms, chronic fatigue, numbness in feets &amp; hands, eyelids spasms, weird sensations(like bugs) in my back &amp; ribcage, orthostatic hypotension etcc. Some of my symptoms get worse when its hot: weakness, fatigue, mobility. Since August 2021 i noticed that my ring,pinky finger, &amp; thumb became clawed on both of my hands. I also have a big bulging vein on both of my hand and its slightly painful. I never thought it could be cmt bc i feel like my symptoms are all over the place and also bc everyone has been trying to convince me everything is in my head. But the more i read about it the more i realize it could be that also bc ive had two hammer toes on each foot and high arches my whole life. Ive been begging doctors for an emg ( not necessarily for cmt, literally just to prove that im not crazy and that i actually have muscke weakness) for months  but they have said no bc apparently emg are prescribed when there are specific muscle groups affected. My next appointment with my neurologist is in november. Do you guys think my symptoms are worth looking into for cmt? \n\nI also want to add that ive lost muscles in my hands and my weak leg. Now that the weather is colder have a lot less weakness in my hands. If you want to get tested for CMT, it is a blood test. Expensive though. Your symptoms sound more like a small fiber neuropathy than CMT, not that CMT is impossible. Maybe a neurological skin biopsy would be a better spend of money if you had the means. Yeah, this reads more like a central nervous system issue. A genetic (blood) test can test for a few types of CMT but not all of them. It cannot rule out CMT even if it is negative for the types tested. I am sorry you have to deal with this. It is a lot to manage and not having even a name for your symptoms adds to the burden of dealing with them. \n\nI am not a doctor and cannot diagnose you but my feeling from what you have said is that CMT is probably not what you are dealing with. \n\nCMT has very little facial involvement. Some of the facial nerves are actually part of the CNS (central nervous system) and CMT only affects the PNS (peripheral nervous system). Further, CMT has first and greatest impact on the most peripheral parts of the body, typically manifesting first in feet and then gradually impacting higher up the body.  \n\nAlso, you mention orthostatic hypotension, and basic autonomic functions like that are not involved in most forms of CMT. \n\nI would not see any harm in doing a genetic test for CMT if you have a chance, but I think if I were you I would focus my attention elsewhere. Good luck in finding some answers. I could not figure out what was going on with my Dad and I, until I got a WGS (whole genome sequencing done).  Mine was done by Dante Labs, but I think Nebula is a better choice today.  Insurance does not typically cover it, but it is only $99 to get started now:\n\n(\n\nFor me and my Dad, it made it clear that we did NOT have a \"known\" gene for CMT.   That is not definitive, since many people diagnosed with CMT do not have a known gene.\n\nWe did get a giant red flag for ANOTHER rare (1/20,000) genetic issue that explains our kidney hematuria and mild auto-immune issues.   I am still not sure if it explains our neuropathy, but kidney and nerve issues often overlap.\n\nThere are genetic tests being widely advertised by ( right now, but I believe that those are all \"chip-based\" tests that only look for more common problems.  None of the current chip based tests would have found the mutation that my Dad and I have, so I am glad that we did WGS.  On the other side, WGS brings up a lot of \"uncertain\" genetic issues that can be confusing and even frightening.  If you get the Invitae tests, insurance may cover it, and your doctor can help you interpret their meaning. I am so sorry you have been feeling unwell. I am not medical professional by any means, but being on my own what the heck is wrong with me journey, combined with insomnia and my love to learn, I have been reading, researching, and attempting to build my medical knowledge. \n\nHave you or your doctors considered or crossed off multiple sclerosis at all? It is an auto immune disorder, known as the Grest Masquerader, because its symptoms mimic many others and its very often misdiagnosed as something else. Though that is the case, there are also some symptoms that are less relevant to a wide variety of ills and are more MS relevant. Specifically, both the facial pain and muscle weakness are both significant, but early symptoms. Also, heat intolerance is definitely a very common complaint, and heat itself a very known trigger to worsening symptoms, as well as leaving one feeling terrible and very fatigued afterwards. \n\nThere are many other shared symptoms, but these stood out to me since they are more ms specific, and I felt I should at least make mention of it. I hope you are able to find some relief and a diagnosis soon. I know its tough without knowing what is going on, and without confirmation to both yourself and others that there IS something making you feel unwell. I always think, when dealing with mental, neuorlogical, or \"inside\" ills, it would be so much easier if the symptoms presented as a huge, gaping wound. Doctors, family, would see it and go \"ouch! That must hurt terribly!\" and they would understand. But unfortunately that is not the case, even though the internal symptoms are no less real, miserable, and debilitating.", "Lion's Mane + Niacin I want to precede everything I write with the disclaimer that I think the supplement market is largely full of BS and preys on people's perceived weaknesses, however, I have been taking 1.5g of Lion's Mane extract along with Niacin for about 3 weeks now after hearing Paul Stamet's talk about exploring this combination as a treatment for MS and muscular dystrophy.\n\nOver the years, I have tried dozens of supplements to try to treat CMT and to date I have not noticed any effects until now. I used to feel a burning sensation when I stretched by fingers/arms/achilles tendon, and that is completely gone now, stretching feels more effortless. It is hard to quantify anything else but I am very happy with the results, even if it is placebo. \n\nHas anyone else experimented with this? Would be curious to compare notes. I am going into a doctor in January to do another nerve conduction velocity test, last time I had this done was 5 years ago. If there is interest I will post my results. \n\nEdit: Just want to clarify I have CMT 1A with a genetic diagnosis.  I am intrigued. How much niacin do you take? I know that one study from 2016 found that giving niacin to mice promoted hypermyelination, and it had a positive effect on a pmp22 mouse model. There are no studies on Lion's Mane\u00a0and CMT as far as I am aware, but it seems to have interesting antiinflamatory effects. I am very interested in seeing your test results when you get them. Do you have the results from your prior test? To be able to draw any conclusions, they should be done on the same nerve, ideally with the same machine and testing procedure. If you do see an improvement, that would surely raise a few eye brows. Keep us posted! Could you share more specifics about your regimen? How much and how often?  Interesting note on the niacin. The idea that Stamets had was that Lion's Mane (which is known for neurogenesis and, I do not have a source on this and am going from memory, has some sort of remyelinating properties) could be spread out to the peripheral nerves by taking niacin to flush it out to the nerve endings. Sounds sort of wonky but I figured why not try it. I will try to remember to report back with the NCV test when it is done in January, if there are improvements I absolutely will. \n\nMy regimen is 100g of niacin taken with 3 x 500g lion's mane extract pills. I am getting mine from nootropics depot as they appear to have a well vetted extraction method. I have been trying this out at different times of day, with and without food.  My regimen is 100g of niacin taken with 3 x 500g lion's mane extract pills. I am getting mine from nootropics depot as they appear to have a well vetted extraction method. I have been trying this out at different times of day, with and without food. I take them daily. Do you possibly mean 100mg of niacin rather than 100g? Very unfortunate typo! Yes 100mg  From what I can see, at least some of the compounds in lion's mane are also known to stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis *in vitro*. I know there have been at least one study on the growth factor neurotrophin-3 in both animal models and patients with CMT1A that have shown a positive effect.\n\nHave you experienced any side effects? The down side to trying out things that are uncharted terrain is of course the risk that the compounds to have an negative impact. I have been trying to keep note of any side effects but have not noticed anything negative other than the niacin makes me slightly itchy right after i take it, I did take 200mg of niacin once and had a flush for an hour or so. It is worth nothing that my whole routine also includes other vitamins I would been taking previously (B2, B12, COQ10, Fish oil), I know vitamin B deficiency can exacerbate neuropathy but I am taking that combination to treat what I think are vestibular migraine's causing some vertigo and constant tinnitus I have been experiencing. The lion's mane and niacin are new additions. \n\nI am going to get a symptom log going and will report back with NCV numbers. \n\nIf anyone happens to see this and has some anecdotes on niacin alone or would be interested in trying lion's mane I am very curious to cross reference this with someone else's experience. I noticed results in ~5 days, maybe less.  Looking forward to seeing the results.\n\nJust out of curiosity, have you noticed any improvement with regards to the tinnitus? I think Stemets mentioned psilocybin as a necessary ingredient in this treatment formula.\n\nBy the way i have 500mg capsules of Niacin but i prefer taking about half to avoid the itching... do you think its OK to open the capsule and consume half of it? I cant see how it should not be but i want to ask for advice before doing this. No improvements to the tinnitus, I would do anything for relief. The vertigo/tinnitus I have been experiencing has really helped put into perspective how mild (at least for me) the CMT is  I do not see any reason why not but I am certainly not an expert. It is not like you would need a time release on the niacin  I did and it worked fine. =)\n\n I have been taking lions mane for 1-2 months after hearing Stamets talk about it as well. I have been using his own brand (host defense) in capsules.. I feel it is a bit early to say if it has had any effect on the CMT. My biggest problem have been my feet, and because of deformation it is hard to gain muscles as I am dependent on shoes that makes the feet very stuck. My hands have actually been getting better in strenght and co-ordination though. I have been playing guitar for 15 years so I guess that is helpful. But I do feel my playing has improved a bit lately (no idea if this is related to the mushroom).\n\nThe positive effects I belive I have had from Lions mane is more brain related. I feel it is a bit easier to articulate sentences, and going deeper when thinking about something. I have noticed this in conversations/discussions and when I am writing for my self.\n\nI have experienced a lot of \"brain fog\" which I have had less of lately. I am also pretty sure my dreams have been more intense when I have been taking them in the evening or before going to bed.\n\nI am planning on taking it long term and will read up on Niacin as well.  I am definitely interested in the results of your nerve conduction velocity test!\n\nI do not mind the tingle of niacin.  Pretty much all pre-workout mixes have beta alanine and niacin and I hit up the gym pretty much daily with a preworkout.\n\nMight as well up my dosage of niacin to something more than 300 mg supplement daily and see how things react. Did you do the NCV test yet?  Any improvement? I had the appointment but they actually did not do a NCV test this time around, so, unfortunately I do not have a lot to report. \n\nThey DID, however, mention there is testing being done on a full genetic cure that would completely halt symptom progression, and that animal tests have been done with very positive results. I wish I knew more so I could read about it but I have not gotten my notes from the appointment yet. ", "Night time cramps Hi, I have CMT type 1a and finding that I go through bursts of having really frequent and bad cramps overnight from my thighs to my toes. I have tried magnesium tablets, powder, effervescent drinks, and cream but anything digestible upsets my stomach and the cream just is not as effective. Is there anything else you have tried that works?", "Socks for AFOs? My mom recently got her AFOs, and the doctor recommended wearing diabetic socks. My mom is very big into cute socks which diabetic socks are not. I have found some crew length diabetic socks with patterns, but nothing high enough for her. Has anyone had any success finding cute knee high diabetic socks? At this point I would be happy with anything that is not white or black. While not answering with your direct question about cute diabetic socks except to say I have never seen any, I do have a suggestion.  Hopefully useful, even! \n\nFor work / social events / etc I have often worn either diabetic socks or knee length socks under my AFOs then placed a more desired looking sock over it.  To do this I simply use a sock large enough and remove the toe!  Well, okay, removed almost all the sock that would actually cover the foot.  Being male, this may be easier due to shoe styles but one could create a stirrup style sock (albeit with much practice) that should work for most situations.\n\nMay this help. So I am not 100% sure if you mean the double layered socks or the compression socks (Both can be used for diabetic patients.) However there is a wide range of them available on ( Oh my, that is a great idea! Especially in the winter when she would not mind the extra layer She has to wear socks without elastic tops, so almost the opposite of compression socks.  My girlfriend has CMT and always had trouble finding socks that were high enough for her AFOs as most socks are just too short, or rolled down too easy. I ended up finding \"derby socks\" that are used quite a bit in the roller derby world. She loves them and that is all she buys now. There are so many patterns and styles available, and you can find them online at amazon as well as other online stores. I hope that helps as it really helped us solve the \"Sock\" problem we we got her AFOs.", "Could my symptoms be CMT? Hi everyone, I just discovered that some of the neuromuscular symptoms I have lived with my whole life are very similar to what is described in CMT.  However, I only have symptoms in one leg.  Does anyone here only have one leg affected, or know if that is possible?  Thanks so much!", "Charity Truck pull and Static Monsters Hi All,\n\nThere was a charity truck pull this past weekend to raise money for some kids with leukemia.  Was good fun day I ended up with a time of 61secs but I also ended up in the newspaper and managed to talk a bit about CMT with the people in Darwin.  That was some fun :)  For those wondering it was a 12ton Mack.  It was as hard as it looks.\n\n!(1xyg2kgyb7y31)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!(ptrlxhy2c7y31)\n\n I also competed in the Static Monster worldwide comp a few weeks back and managed 64 in the masters division.  Not a bad start for a small training block, something to improve upon for next year.  I managed to do an 18\" deadlift of 320lbs.  Was a great day as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n!(ydm5luzgc7y31)\n\nI will say the next day was hard (for both events)  my feet ached and I took a few anti-inflammatory as well as pain killers.  By the afternoon things were good again.  Anyway, just wanted to show people the silly things i like to do while trying to not let CMT get in the way or slow me down.  Having a good support network and loving wife helps!\n\nthanks ! Great story. I have been trying to do the same but it is hard. Do you have any suggestions on how to find a good support group? Most of it is from the people down at the gym.  Everyone is supportive and encouraging in the strongman \"club\".  I find it good for my mental health and as a side benefit I do dumb stuff like pull trucks or carry heavy things.  But they also take into account my age and my limits, i do not get to miss out, I just get something a bit lighter or not as far.  Good happy people are a good start.  If everyone is rude or ignores you then they might not be a good bunch of people\n\nMy wife and family is always supportive and helpful.  Getting my tablets the next morning or listening to my boring stories makes it worth while", "Questions to ask at follow-up? I was diagnosed with CMT2 a few weeks ago, but have my follow up with my neurologist on Thursday. I have a few questions (E.g. would DNA testing be beneficial to determine which subtype I have?, what kind of treatment is availabile, what should I look out for in terms of worsening symptoms). \n\nI really do not want to miss anything. I am bringing my husband, who is a neuroscientist, but CMT is beyond his scope. Are there by questions you are glad you asked at your follow up? I really do not want to miss anything, so anything you throw out would be helpful!! Thank you. I was diagnosed by visual inspection in the 80\u2019s. And by genetic testing in 2019. I have CMT2A. \n\nNothing groundbreaking, but protect &amp; stabilize. Did PT &amp; OT for a summer to learn what do to for feet, balance, and hands. Currently recovering from 2nd foot surgery of COVID (both feet) so that I can wear AFO\u2019s\n\nThey are a real difference maker to my stability and my gait...I am 55 years old. The DNA testing is interesting and really is only good for potential future treatments or drug trials. Otherwise, it does not really mean much.\n\nAt this point you can look into leg braces if you need them. For me, they are a lifesaver. Allows me to walk long distances. Without them I would be lucky to make it a block.\n\nMaybe some physical therapy to strengthen some areas that could use it. And, if you need it, surgery. I had had triple arthrodesis done on both feet in the early 90's and that bought me about 20 years of much greater productivity. It eventually has worn down in terms of helping but for a long time it was fantastic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is no real treatments per se. Just managing it. And, you can go for long stretches of little progression and then short stretches of fast progression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWord of advice, do not overdo it. This is an unforgiving disease and if you overdo it you may lose strength and never regain that strength. I speak from experience. Safety is key. I take extra steps in making everything as safe as possible, as you do not know when your legs are going to randomly fail. Do not be embarrassed to ask for assistance. When acquiring accommodations,  do not settle for \u201cI will probably be fine without it.\u201d  Lastly, make sure you are mentally prepared for the future, as this ride only gets worse, so set up an appointment with a psychologist if the stress becomes overwhelming. \n\nI can still walk, but I use a crutch and AFOs. Wheelchairs are a good investment for long walks. A cellphone is very useful in the event that you fall and nobody is around, so keep one of those on you for safety. \n\nHands are probably going to get numb, so be mindful of avoiding nerve damage. Resting and applying weight to your elbows is usually a bad idea.\n\nYour feet will get numb too, so try make an effort to observe your feet for injuries every day. Keep your feet elevated if circulation problems arise. I sleep with my feet up every night, and I never hang my feet off anything if I do not have something to constrict blood flow. \n\nA second pair of shoes for inside safety, as the AFO is extremely dangerous without them. Never walk in them without footwear. \n\nLong socks for the AFO to prevent chafing, but I recommend just wearing them outside your pant legs if you decide to rock pants (tight jeans especially). \n\nMarijuana can help with pain or inflammation if conventional medicine is not your forte. Keep ibuprofen stocked. \n\nGood luck and try not to think about it. It is hard, it is going to suck, but keeping a positive attitude is probably the most important factor. I would recommend the DNA test.  I was diagnosed at 13 and the doctor was sure i had type 1 or 2a, but with the DNA test it turned out to be 4c witch can have slightly different complications, so for me its's easier to look out for early signs knowing what specific type I have!   \n\n\nOther than that how to work out to prevent muscle loss without over doing it as Alpiney said!  \nGood luck!", "UK CMTer saying hello! Just came across the sub and thought I would say hi.\nI have attended a few UK conferences and am sometimes involved in the charity \n\nIn a few weeks I get to help at the Kids weekend - we will be taking 11-18yr olds for an adventure activity week in a specialised centre in the lake District. It is the best thing about having CMT - I can show other people how much is possible with a little adaptation. Climbing, canoeing, caving, abseiling, etc regardless of whether you just have a wobble or use sticks or wheelchairs. I love it and if you have any questions I would be happy to hear from you.\n\nMe and my Wife did PIGD IVF and are expecting a happy non-CMT boy soon - again any questions, just ask. Welcome! The kids weekend sounds like a great use of energy. If you or other commenters have information on similar opportunities to volunteer in the US I would love to hear about it. We sent a group of Brits over to the Aussie kids weekend a few years ago, then they came to ours the next year - it was great to meet people with funny accents that had the same funny wobble!\nIf there is not one already you could volunteer to start one. My mum loves organising it each year and now would not let anyone else sort it all lol. I might have seen your website! We will probably be sending our son to you one day when he is older! You do great work! Oh I miss England and especially the Lake District. I spent many happy hours hiking there, which would not be possible for me now. Lucky kids to have you! I would love to hear more about any experience you have with canoeing/ kayaking.  I have been looking into getting into kayaking and would be happy to hear if someone else with CMT has similar experience they can share about good ways to get started for people with this condition.\n\nThank you and we are happy to have you join the sub! Sorry for the late reply... \nWe introduce people to canoeing at specialist centres that have amazing instructors and clever equipment.\n\n (\n\n(\n\nBut depending on how much support you will require, your local water park or canoe club will be able to help with most issues.

It started when I was 26, I am 35 now.  It came on very, very suddenly.  My main complaint at the time of onset were--stabbing pains, burning pains, some partial numbness in my little toes, occasional cramps and aches.  These are still the same complaints I have today.  I have experienced no notable weakness at time of onset or today. \n\nMy illness has followed what I would describe as a flare and remission pattern.  I will go through a few months of improve symptoms, sometimes to where I nearly feel absent of all symptoms.  This follows with more intense periods where symptoms are difficult to live with.  I have noticed that what I eat strongly impacts my symptoms.  Going gluten free and avoiding probiotics has greatly improved my symptoms.  \n\nI saw Dr. Shy at Wayne State in 2011, two years after this initially started.  My Nerve Conduction study results were deemed extremely rare.  As it was explained to me, the nerve damage measurements were mild, and the type of nerve damage they were seeing they had only seen anything like once or twice before.  This, combined with a CMTNS score of 0 and other factors, made Dr. Shy doubtful that I had CMT.  No genetic testing was recommended at the time.  He thought the cause was likely some other poorly understood process that we just do not understand at the time.  He made sure to note this was his best guess, not definitive.\n\nFast forward to today, I have the same chief complaints.  I have not progressed in terms of clinical symptoms.  The reason I am writing, and what has changed, is I am planning to marry in a few months.  We would like to have a family.  I would like to have the best information I can regarding my illness prior to making this decision.  My questions for everyone are:\n\n1) How did you go about getting tested?  What was the cost?  Do you need to go to a certain doctor?  I have read on Invitae that insurance generally covers the cost and if not, they have a patient payment that is based on \"clinical area\" in which CMT is it is only clinical area, so cost would be $250, if I am reading it right.  I would essentially be asking for the comprehensive panel as I have no idea what likely subtype I would have.\n\n2) What are the consequences of finding out?  I have read that insurance companies may deny you in the future based on an official CMT diagnosis.  Is this correct?\n\nI figure at a minimum, I would then know if I have a gene defect that is known to cause CMT.  This may help shape our decision to have children.\n\nPlease let me know of your thoughts on the situation.  Thanks for reading. I am not from the US, so I do not know much about the insurance side of testing. If I were in the same situation, I would talk to a neurologist again, perhaps Shy if you can get an apoitment. It might be possible to use your symptom profile to make educated guesses about where to look. Instead of testing for every possible CMT genotype, you could test a couple ones, as well as test for other non-CMT related candidates. It is important to realise that when the picture is not clear cut there could a lot of reasons, and testing for all of them would be far to costly to do. I have not looked into it, but it might be possible to do full exome sequencing of you and your family. \n\nAs for the consequences if you do get a genetic CMT diagnosis, they will differcbased on the genotype. For some, like 1A, it is now possible to do PGD and IVF, which guarantee that the baby do not get the defect.  Thanks for replying. I put in a request to meet with Dr. Shy, we will see if I can get an appointment. He indicated before he thought it was something other than CMT, but perhaps If pressed he would have some guesses on what to test for. \n\nWhat does full exome sequencing entail and what would it provide? I am not familiar with that Thanks for replying. I have a request in to see Dr. Shy. I will hope to see him and ask for his advice. Even though he thought it likely I did not have it, maybe he would have an idea of what to target on the chance that it is CMT. \n\nWhat is a exome sequencing of a whole family? What would that provide?\n\nThanks Hello, and welcome to reddit!\n\nWhat you describe really does not sound like any of the CMT variants.  Before trying for (possibly, depending on your particulars) expensive testing, I would recommend:\nDo a family tree history for this problem - Do your parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins have it?\nVisit your GP for a full blood panel - Preferably both during a flare up and a quiet period.  One should look for either a major issue with a nutrient such as niacin, or a pattern of minor issues with the 'B' group.\n Thank you for your detailed reply.  Based on my reading, the testing should be reasonable in cost.  I am going to talk to a genetic counselor and hopefully find out more.\n\n\\-No family history I can find at all.  Big family tree to look at, also.  Obviously, these folks have not been tested for CMT.  But there are just zero symptoms.  No one even within a neurological symptom.  But it could still be a new mutation I have, correct?\n\n\\-The whole thing has been vetted pretty heavily by the GP and other doctors.  Lots of blood work, glucose tolerance tests, etc.  One thing\\-\\-I have consistently had hypergammaglobulinemia.  Fancy word\\-\\-it was explained to me that means my immune system is active.  \n\n\\-I am extremely strict on diet and have been for the last couple of years.  It has helped my symptoms.  Probiotics and gluten are the big ones.  Basically, I noticed that when I ate things like yogurt or a bowl of whole grain cereal, my symptoms would increase substantially within a couple of hours and not calm down for days.  So I avoid them now at all costs.  I do not drink.  I am on a pretty hefty workout routine with weight lifting.  I try to listen to my body and rest more when needed, but do make a substantial effort to keep up with it.  I do not want to lose my muscle mass.  I have been able to build significant strength and mass over the last several years.  I do have a thin body type and bone structure.  My feet have what I would consider high arches.  Based on old photos, I think this has been since maybe 13 or 14.  I have very large feet, and the high arches seemed to develop during my major growth spurt.  Since then, my feet structurally look the same today as they did then.  No idea if that is relevant.  I read something like 1/5 people have high arches, so I am not sure that alone means much.  \n\n\\-I am suspicious of some type of auto immune disorder.  All of my ANA tests have always returned negative along with food allergy tests.  However, I have a number of strange reactions.  I cannot use shampoo, or I will breakout with a rash on my head.  I must bring my own sheets when I travel, or I will get a rash on my body from detergents.  If I were to drink a heavy probiotic drink right now, within 15 minutes I would barely be able to function.  Pain goes to a 10/10, dizzy, nauseous, headache, feel like I will pass out.  Pretty remarkable actually.  I do not do that experiment anymore.  Too hard to recover from.  \n\n\\-Despite the above, I recognize it still could be CMT, so I am just trying to do my diligence for my potential children's sake.  If I were not planning to have kids, I would not pursue testing.  \n\nThanks again, let me know your thoughts. YOU DO NOT HAVE CMT.\nPlease take your hypochondria to a mental health provider, both to better your life and for any children you might create. I will be honest\\-\\-this really saddens me.  I have been seen by 3 different neurologists, all of which confirmed peripheral neuropathy through nerve studies, 2 of which named CMT as their top differential diagnosis.  I do not understand why trying to investigate that further would make me a hypochondriac.  \n\nClearly, I am not welcome here.  I would like to take the time to apologize if I have offended anyone on this forum.  That was the opposite of my intent.  I am just a person trying to find my way and do what is best for my family.   You should test for something else, and I mean this as nice as possible.\n\nDr. Shy is the leading doctor for CMT in the US, and quite possibly the world. He is also well versed in other disease that could be hidden by or mistaken as CMT.\n\nIf he says you do not have it. You do not. You could get genetic testing to have a definitive answer, and that should not be hard to do.\n\nI would look into other neurological muscular diseases. But you definitely do not have CMT. Alot of your symtpoms do not fall in line with CMT. The leading expert on CMT says you do not have it. I am not the guy saying you are a hypochondriac, I believe you could really be sick. But it is not CMT. If you want to be sure, get genetic testing done, which should be easy to find/do.\n\nGo find a neurologist that specializes in autoimmune diseases. I am not saying that is what you have either, but it seems more likely with your wide range of symptoms. \n\nI understand wanting to get second or third opinions, but I am also telling you that it would be more worth your time to research other possible causes. Hey, SloanTheSloth, just a quick heads-up:  \n**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. Thank you so much for your reply and kindness.  Dr. Shy did indicated he thought it was pretty unlikely that I had CMT, but he did say it could be a variant they do not know about yet.  Given that was many years ago, I think the genetic testing is the route I will go as you mentioned to rule out as much as I can.\n\nI do know I am sick, even if not to trust how sick I feel, the nerve readings prove the neuropathy is there.  \n\nI like your suggestion of seeking out a neurologist that specializes in autoimmune disorders.  That is another angle that is worth trying.\n\nThanks again for your advice and comments. Instead of asking Dr. Shy what to Target in case it is CMT, I would ask him what else he thinks it could be.\n\nThe reason I say this is in like 2001, my mom, who is diagnosed with CMT, had a sudden onslaught of worse symptoms. All the neurologists were saying it was a sudden exasperation of CMT and there was nothing she could do (she lost use of her hands and had extreme numbness when she had little to no symptoms a week prior). She went to the CMT clinic and saw Dr. Shy who said she had CMT (we already knew from genetic testing) but that he thought an autoimmune disease was what was basically turning her into a vegetable. He recommended a treatment which reversed the worst of the symptoms within a week of starting.\n\nSadly the treatment is not a cure, so she is still dying to this day, but his diagnosis was correct, and that very treatment is keeping her alive. Of course. I really hope you figure out what it is and a treatment that works. I talked a little bit about my mom who has an autoimmune disease in a different reply to you, so I know how terrible it is to have a chronic illness, and, to not know what that illness is for sure.  Thank you for sharing your story of your mom.  That sounds like a really, really tough situation.  I am glad you were able to find some help, but am sad to hear she could not be cured.  I wish you both the very best. &gt;What is a exome sequencing of a whole family? What would that provide?\n\nWhole exome sequencing allows them to sequence all the protein-coding genes in your entire genome, as opposed to sequencing only single genes that are suspected culprits. This might increase the chance of finding the culprit provided it is a gene problem. Whole exome sequencing of both you and your family would allow them to compare what mutations you have that they do not. If the disease is caused by a new mutation that you have but they do not, then it should be among your unique mutations. I also agree with the advice of SloanTheSloth.  &gt;Clearly, I am not welcome here.\nI feel like everyone should feel welcome here, there is nothing wrong IMHO about looking for more information. Is there any chance you could post your NCV data?", "Today I learned that the lady that inspired the paining Christina\u2019s World suffered from CMT.  My friend made a shirt dance film about it. You can find it here  Art and CMT are two topics that rarely overlap, but when they do it is pretty interesting IMHO. I only know of one other ( in that case by Francisco Goya.\n\n\nThat case is detailed in the article \"(  \n\nI went down the rabbit hole to find the source of the diagnosis of the lady in Andrew Wyeths painting. The CMT diagnosis was made by  ( \\(Et al.\\), a well published Neurologist working at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.\n\nChristina Olson, the lady in the painting, was presented as a case at the ( held at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 2016. The historicalcpc website is a mess, and does not really go into any specific details about the diagnosis. \n\nHowever, Patterson has ( that was (presumably) presented at this conference. In the paper, through differential diagnosis they arrive at a mutation in the MFN2-gene as the most likely mutation affecting Christina Olson. Mutations in the MFN2-gene is the cause of CMT6 and CMT2A2, but CMT6 is characterized by optic atrophy and there are no reports of optic atrophy in Christina Olson. So that only leaves CMT2A2 or a novel mutation in the MFN2-gene. \n\nThey also did a fancy data-driven computer analysis based on Christina Olsons known symptoms which identified *\u201cCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease as the diagnosis most consistent with her neurological disorder.\"*.  \n\n\nThe paper is behind a paywall, but I will quote the most interesting part here:  \n\n*\"MFN2 mutations constitute the largest identifiable etiology for autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and are associated with a severe phenotype in children, characterized by loss of the ability to ambulate by age 20 in most patients.\nThis pattern of inheritance and phenotypic expression is most consistent with Christina\u2019s medical history. Thus, a mutation of MFN2 is the best explanation for Christina\u2019s progressive neurological disorder.\nAs an alternative to the traditional differential diagnostic approach to difficult cases such as this, Christina\u2019s clinical data were entered into the ORIGAMI (Oak Ridge Graph Analytics for Medical Innovation) system of the US Department of Energy supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The system utilizes 70 million predications (eg, influenza \u201cis an\u201d acute viral disease or influenza \u201ccauses\u201d upper respiratory symptoms) derived from 23.5 million PubMed articles in a combination of semantic, graph-theoretical and statistical data-driven reasoning. On analysis of Christina\u2019s clinical information, the system identified \u201cCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease\u201d as the diagnosis most consistent with her neurological disorder.\"* That is awesome! I will have to check it out. My wife originally showed me a YouTube video on the painting. That is really interesting about Goya and the possible first depiction of CMT. So we have got a possible on Goya, a 100% on Christina\u2019s World, and a 100% on Julie Newmar. CMT needs more representation!\n\nEdit: Julie Newmar has been found to not have had CMT!!", "Scholarships from CMT or MD? A little back story. I was diagnosed very young with CMT 1A. My father, grandfather and brother all have it. All of them seem to have worse symptoms than I do. I still have plenty of issues myself though. I went to college for building and tuning high performance cars. When I started college the pain was manageable and I was able to keep up for the most part with the other students physically. By the time I graduated, the pain became almost too much to get through the day sometimes. So needless to say I have not been able work in the field I went to school for. \n\nSince then I have just been getting by and I am wanting to change things up. I enrolled back in school this semester and want to get my Computer Science/Engineering degree. Something that I enjoy and will not take a huge toll on me physically. But I am having issues paying for school on top of a 3 year old and bills. I already have lots of student loans from my original run through college and also need a new laptop to keep up with what I am learning in IT. So I am curious if you guys know of any scholarships or programs that help people with CMT pay for school?   I do not really know any off hand but you can check out Lime Connect scholarship, they have a section for people with disabilities. \n\nAlso, I would check out your colleges disability / accessibility office. They usually have a list of scholarships you can apply to that I am sure you will fit some of their requirements.  Check with Vocational Rehabilitation. It is a department associated with the department of labor. They have education funds for people with disabilities. My CMT diagnosis was enough to get funds towards tuition in GA.\n\nI received some to pay for my last 2 years of undergrad... Turns out I qualified for it for all four years, but I did not know about it until I was a junior. This is awesome. Thanks so much I will check it out I will definitely look into it. Thanks!", "I feel lost \nI had my Cmt1a diagnosis a few years ago now and so far I have received no help from the NHS.

I work as a Butcher so have quite a physical job working in low temps and feel like it is probably not helping. Is everyone the same as me and have very little fatigue? I literally feel so lost.", "Deteriorating disc? So I got diagnosed in 6th grade. I have never had problems. Just bad knees and flat feet interestingly enough. But I have been dealing with back pain for months. I went to the doctor a couple of months ago thinking it was a strained muscle. Well i went to the hospital saturday might because my back hurt so much my whole body was shaking and hurt so much. They did a ct scan and an MRI. One of my discs was deteriorating and bulging while two of my vertebrae were pushing on each other. I got discharged and told to go to a rheumatologist recommended by my primary care doctor. I was going to go to my neurologist as well to see if this is cmt. I am 20 and too young for my back to deteriorate like this. My question was if this has happened to anyone else? How severe were the bulge and deterioration? I have some of the same in my cervical spine that are a little more than what you would expect for my age.

Interestingly enough i also have very mild cmt Cmt does not directly cause that, but sometimes due to how we walk or compensate due to muscle weakness we develop problems like that.so it is possible that is what is going on.

A lot has already been written about gene theraphy and CMT but gene theraphy research is moving incredibly fast these days. Just as interesting I think is the people behind the funding. It seems like they are setting them selves up for long term funding of CMT research and that is of course great news for us all. Hey, I have cmt 1a, I am from India and wanted to know if it is better to wait for Gene therapy or just take pxt3003 (combination of baclofen, naltrexone, and sorbitol) \nCurrently I am able to walk with ankle binder . I think gene theraphy for CMT is still a long way off from beeing a reality. My hope is that PXT3003 will at least be able to halt the disease progression so that we can take it while waiting for better future treatments. So far it seems like PXT3003 both halt the progression as well as cause a small improvement in symptoms. I do not recommend anyone take anything without talking with a doctor. That said I am looking into this for my self and I will share my thoughts  about it once I am done. It is still unclear to me if as easy as just buying the ingredients and taking them in the right amounts. The studies so far indicate little side efects, but individually they have some, especially naltrexone.

I call them weather cramps since it is easier to say lol. It is probably the most random and annoying pain connected to CMT I have experienced and little to nothing helps with it. Hm, I get cramps rather randomly and I have never noticed a correlation with weather changes but now I am going to be checking. I only get headaches Now that you mention it\u2026. Maybe. I grew up at sea level and feel like I cramped a lot when I camped and traveled. Always thought it was because I was more active those days though.

I have CMT1a and wear the carbon fiber Noodle on both legs. \n\nI have particularly liked Saucony's Echelon 5 (women's running shoe) for fit and style. It has some problems with the cushion in the heel ripping, but fits my AFOs really well and I like the women's color options.  \n\nI have owned three pairs of Aetrex shoes. I forget the style name. They were the women's shoe with a velcro heel. I had the most trouble with my AFOs squeaking in the Aetrex shoes, despite lots of baby powder (if you have not used that trick, baby powder can make your shoes stop squeaking if you apply where the AFO is rubbing).  The velcro strap also rubbed my heel unless my socks were thick enough.  \n\nI have heard from a lot of people who like New Balance, and I always wore New Balance before my AFOs. The ones I have tried with my AFOs did not fit quite right. I should probably give them another try.\n\nI am looking for other shoes (dress, walking, whatever). I thought I would post and ask what your experiences are?  I wear Brooks Glycerin shoes with my Otterbach walk on flex AFO's.. They have lots of cushion, support and come in different widths.  My orthotics fit in them too. They are definitely the best shoe I could find to fit my AFO's. I just looked those up. They look great! I LOVE my Glycerins!! I do not wear an AFO (yet) but shoes are a struggle with my exertion-worsened foot drop.  \n\nBrooks Glycerin shoes are my absolute favourite; Mizuno Wave Rider shoes come in second (had to stop wearing after their WR 17's narrowed the toe box; may have changed back, fans were angry).

I am not sure what direct application it may have for CMT research, but it is always good to have more tools. \n\nI think we have a pretty good idea of what the PMP22 protein involved in CMT1A looks like but this could confirm that structure or if it predicts something unexpected that would be something to look into. \n\nFor the less common forms of CMT there may be less detailed understanding of the proteins involved. Since there are dozens of kinds of CMT there is a good chance this can shed some light on how some of them cause the disease. \n\nBreakthroughs, by their nature, cannot really be predicted and the best we can do is have as many tools as we can get to chip away at different angles of the problem in hopes that we find just the right angle to crack the problem. Good find, and yes it will. It will also help it pretty much every area of medicine to.\n\nFolding proteins is one of the most complex calculations know to man and the traditional method was just \"throw more computers at it\".

I returned from work two weeks ago from a two week covid leave. My right foot only has been swollen for a week and a half.  I suspect it is because I am on them 40 hours a week again after not doing that for so long.  Is this something i should be concerned about?  Seeing a doctor worthy?  Or should I just ride it out? I would get this checked out. Covid is known to cause blood clots. I am not a doctor but I would expect that a small blood clot partially obstructing blood flow could cause that sort of swelling? Keep your feet propped up (level with your heart) to encourage the swelling to drain, but also do get it checked. See a doctor, that is not normal. I will have only one foot swell randomly, but I also have no clue what it may be from. I did not have anything that could have agitated it though. I would say see a doctor to be sure it is nothing. Mine usually goes away after a day or 2. After 3 days it is doctor time. If one foot is swollen then you need to go to a doctor. This is not cmt related. What about your calves? Are there the same size? I think they are about the same size but it is kind of hard to tell Do you have a tape measure? Can you use a string or tape measure to see if they are different sizes? I measured and my right calf is also about an inch and 1/4the bigger than my left. As someone else has stated, you could have dvt and that is definitely \u201cdoctors worthy\u201d. Really, any time something is swollen it means something is wrong. There could be an infection in your foot, you could have a benign lymph edema, or something else more nefarious.

I am a 17 year old who has been diagnosed with cmt 1a since I was a toddler as it runs in my family. I have always struggled gaining weight and building muscle so I am quite underweight. I also recently had surgery which has caused me to limit movement and eat less which has caused it to worsen. Does anyone here have advice on how to gain weight or specific exercises for cmt? Thank you! Hi,\n\nSo weight can be gained easy or hard.  If you want easy then pizza and burgers are your friend, if you want to gain the muscle type of weight then you need to eat for that.  You could work out your calorie needs and then bump it up by say 10% and see how thing go, i would not go crazy but eat to support your goals.\n\nAs for exercises, most will be of benefit.  What do you have access to? as in gym, home weights, a slab of bricks ?   Without any knowledge about you, a beginners 3 day full body split could be of use.  It also depends on how you want to work out.\n\nAs for CMT specific exercises, i will do some shameless self promotion and mention my very basic youtube channel for this very reason.  I have more stuff to upload, if you feel like it, please have a look.\n\n(\n\nI am not certified as a trainer, but I am in the process, so i can try and answer questions if you would like. In terms of building muscle, i am still working on that dream but I do not think I have done a bad job at it. Thank you so much I just subscribed! I watched this video and a few others for leg exercises for people with CMT. My partner's who has CMT already has almost no muscle left in his legs. I can wrap my thumb and middle finger around his legs almost all the way up to the knee. He can still walk and even run, and will soon have leg braces. I suppose it is already too late to get any muscle back, but I am wondering if there are things someone with his condition can do to strengthen his ankles and toothpick-thin legs. Thank you so much for sharing! I also have really skinny legs and wearing ankle and knee braces has helped me a lot with supporting my lower legs while walking/running/climbing stairs if you are interested in looking into that for your partner!

I also won, which is a really really weird feeling.  I have never won anything to do with sports and finally at the age of 45 I got a first place.  Very unusual territory that is for sure.  Anyway, I just wanted to share my lifts and if you are able to (safely) I have found strongman (and lifting in general) helps a lot mentally and hopefully physically.\n\n*Processing video vwsg0vtiacv51...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing video t17aqs5pacv51...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway thanks for having a look and stay strong and positive! Dude, all the best! That looks fun! This is incredible. Thanks for posting. A real inspiration. Rad! That is awesome stuff! How did you get into strong man training? How do you deal with balance when it comes to regular training for things like squats and deadlifts? That is sick.  Any other workarounds for standard lifts? Strangely I am ok with deadlifts standing but found it easier when raised and with a hex bar.  Squats are iffy so I prefer the hack squat or belt squat.  Belt squat feels safe as the one at the gym has a handle on it.  I got into strongman due to always watching it and figured I could do it.... And being stubborn here we are \u263a\ufe0f Machines are good. Smith machine helps for some movements.  YouTube slot and Google \"exercise alternative\".   I cannot do a lunge but found single leg press is kind of the same. Can you explain more about the exercise in the first video? Does that replicate a deadlift to some extent? Sure, it is a seated deadlift and is the weird cousin to a conventional deadlift.  Same muscles are used for the lift but less hamstring more back.  I use straps to hold on for obvious reasons.  It is a bit easier as you do not need to lift it as high so you can do a bit more.  \n\nI have only just tried it this way so I am yet to figure out which accessories will help. But cable rows, hyper extension and lower back stuff should be good.\n\nThe bench is meant to be 17 to 18 inches high. Keep your back tight, shoulder blades down locked and sit up straight.  Watch your lower back as a lot of strain will go in there if you are sitting to high and have to round over more to reach the bar. Work out what is the safe height for you Cool. Thanks!

As we are new I do not know much but feel free toch ask what little I know. Hello and take care! Welcome to the CMTX Club.", "Anyone here walk on their heels instead of their toes? After years of knowing I have CMT, I finally had someone show me how I walk. It was definitely enlightening. I know most people with CMT walk kind of on their toes so I am interested in the experiences of the occasional CMT, Charlie Chaplin-esque, heel walker. \n\nDo you experience soreness at the front of your calves from holding your toes up while walking? Do you wear braces, and if so, do they help re-adjust your walk/gait? I am assuming you do not have drop foot. It would be impossible for me to walk on my heels. That is part of the issue. It takes an insane amount of muscle work to hold my foot up to walk on my heels, even though I do it subconsciously, because I have foot drop otherwise (told it was a symptom in '09). And I struggle to hold my feet up while lying down.\n\nI think it is the subconscious attempt to avoid foot drop causing me to trip that is making my calves miserable. I am not a doctor.  I used to have braces though and I believe that would help relieve your pain. The only reason I do not wear half leg braces anymore is a long stupid story, but an ankle brace works wonders for me. If you have insurance or the means to get fitted properly for braces your pain and gate will be better. Not perfect but probably will help a bit. Most of my family wear various types of leg braces and it is not real noticeable as far as gates goes, comparatively to tripping on flat surfaces. are your calves insanely tight? because mine are and I especially struggle to hold my feet up while lying down. stretching them with a foam roller and rolling out my foot with a lacrosse ball helps immensely.  The front muscle in your calf allows you to pull your toes up when you walk, so it makes sense.  Yep. Saw a podiatrist after I posted this- it is overcompensation in using that muscle to avoid tripping from foot drop that gives me shin splints.  Do a ton of toe raises my man. Been doing them for years. Will usually watch a TV show and do them constantly throughout- still no help. Getting AFOs soon and hoping they help.", "Your help needed to pass Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015 (H.R. 209/S.139). Take Action Today to Ensure Access to Rare Disease Clinical Trials\n\nAs an organization created by families, for families, MDA believes that every person living with a neuromuscular disease should be able to access and participate in promising clinical trials that may improve and save their lives \u2014 without worrying about losing their health care coverage. That is why MDA has joined forces with more than 75 organizations\u2014together representing millions of individuals\u2014to urge Congress to pass the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015 (H.R. 209/S.139).\n\nThis bi-partisan legislation makes permanent a 2010 law called Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act (IACT), that allows people with neuromuscular and other diseases to receive up to $2,000 in compensation for participating in rare disease clinical trials without that compensation counting against their income eligibility limits for Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  This bill is critical as rare disease clinical trials are already challenging to fill--and any additional barriers to participation can have a significant negative impact on whether the trial can proceed.   \n\nThe U.S. Senate passed an identical version of the bill (S.139) in July by unanimous consent.  We need your help today to encourage the House to pass this important legislation before October 5, 2015--the date on which the current law providing this protection is set to expire.  \n\nOur lawmakers need to hear from you. Please let your member of Congress know that you want them to support the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act (H.R. 209/S. 139) to ensure MDA families\u2014and all people living with rare diseases\u2014have access to potential treatment options and new therapies and to accelerate the research development process.\n\n(\n\nThank you in advance for your time and for being an MDA advocate--your voice makes a difference!\n\n \n\nKristin Stephenson\nVice President Policy &amp; Advocacy\nMuscular Dystrophy Association\n\n\n", " Has anyone considered amputation? I often fantasize about just ending the pain, cutting my leg below the knee off, and getting a robotic prosthetic. But I know robotics is not mature enough for this to be significantly better... Yet. Does anyone else think about this? I almost get excited at the idea of getting a prosthetic and robotic prosthetics are advancing fast. ", "Dating group for people with CMT Hi all! I am posting this to hopefully find a Facebook group / online forum for dating other people with CMT.  I found a really small group on Facebook, but I am hopeful that their are some others that I can find. \n\nAny tips or links would be appreciated. \n\nThanks! \nRyan Great idea. Idk why this is not a thing All due respect here, why would not you just use a normal dating site? Is there a reason you would want to date someone else with CMT? Seeing as some of the genes responsible for some cmt variants are recessive, no thank you. Depending on the severity of symptoms, some people may have a hard time finding \u201cnormal\u201d partners. The reason for dating someone else with CMT would be to date someone who understands the problems that occur and does not judge them. \n\nAlthough anyone that judges you for physical attributes is not worth dating anyway. I understand your point . However, they now have gene therapies that can reduce the risk of your child to have cmt Gotcha. Judging from the small sizes of CMT groups I have found online, it would probably be a pretty small pool of hot CMT singles in your area. But it is something you could mention in your dating profile, I think lots of people would be understanding and could relate. Might also have a secondary benefit of raising awareness of CMT.", "Does anyone go to the gym or do some other form of exercise a few times a week?  I ride my bike. This has been a game changer for me.\n\nI ride a pedal bike and also an e-bike where pedaling is assisted by a battery &amp; electric motor. Have you seen any physical benefits in terms of your CMT? For about a year when I was 21/22 and could still walk I would go 3-5 times a week. 10km on the bike. 10 min row and half hour weights. Could not do that now, tho could still use the bike and do weights a little. I definitely noticed a difference when I went. I lost 2 stone and was more energised. It really depends on how bad your chronic fatigue is and what you think you could manage :)  I go 4-5 a week in the morning usually about an hour. I start with 20 min on the bike, and last 40min are weight lifting - either upper body or lower body depending on the day. It has helped out tremendously. I try to stretch daily as well but sometimes do not as much as I should. I work out 3x a week and have a varsity practice once a week. \n\nI notice a huge difference in terms of CMT symptoms, I am not sure if that is an actual evidence based thing or my person biases but idk. When I do not work out I feel like I have a lot more spasms and neuropathy especially in my hips/calves. If I do not take protein powder sometimes I feel like it takes days before my muscles are not sore after working out, so I would try and do that.  I hike every sunday in the mountains close to where I live. I used to go to a physiotheraphy gym 2 times a week from about age 14-20 but I quit when I started studying due to fatigue and nowadays I only have the enery to be active on sundays after spending the saturdays resting.. Massive. \n\n\\- higher general energy levels\n\n\\- mitigates all CMT effects, because muscles across the board are stronger, more responsive. The muscles that are not so impacted by CMT can especially support the ones that are. e.g. my upper leg / thigh muscles can take control of balance more effectively and with greater ease / less mental effort.\n\n\\- transformative for mental health\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe trick for me has been finding exercise that:\n\n\\- is balance friendly... the only two forms I know of are cycling and swimming, but swimming requires changing clothes which is a disincentive (I hate changing clothes because it is fiddly).\n\n\\- is fun! exercising out of duty will only get me so far. Recently buying an e-bike has made it especially fun!\n\n&amp;#x200B; Nice to see you are benefiting so much! I recently started working out a few months ago and I have noticed some small benefits as well. However, I need to do some more isolation exercises for my thighs and legs to help with balance.  cool! What sort of workout? I generally do an hour of cardio and then I will do another hour of leg or arms weightlifting.  Yes, for 10 years now, however I found I plateaued after 2 years and nothing would break it apart from PEDs. It was so disheartening seeing normal folks outpace me in gains within 18 months after I had been training for 5+ years.\n\nI go normally 3-5 times a week, do my cardio on a bike, and focus on strength and mass training. I find cables are better than free weights as you do not have as many issues with poor grip and wrist strength, and poor balance.\n\nWhat I find interesting is after a brutal leg day the stimulation in my feet is almost perfect. I suspect its due to the massive increase in blood flow but all the numb areas of my feet become sensitive and my feet actually become warm. However, this is with PEDs and huge amounts of other supps. If you have not tried creatine I would give that a shot. It probably cuts my recovery time in half vs. just protein. I am currently working with a physical trainer 3x per week. I swim about 30 laps 3x's a week. I use an elliptical machine, which is lovely because my feet stay in contact with the pedals so it imitates something like walking/running without a possible misstep--no twisting my ankles! I do about half an hour of cardio on that most days and some weightlifting/strength building exercises twice a week. \n\nIt took my a long time to get into exercise since in my early twenties when I was diagnosed I was told that exercise could not help and could only hurt me. My experience has been that this is completely untrue--though there is a lot of variability with this disease. If you are not sure how your body will react, start slow and consider seeing a physical therapist if you can, to learn how to properly build strength for your body. \n\nExercising has helped me a lot. I have regained strength and stamina well beyond my initial expectations, though it has taken years to do it. Trying to do too much too fast was a major problem for me until I learned what would work for me. I try to get to the gym at least 3x a week - I love the elliptical, it is the closest I can get to running and I enjoy the full-body cardio. I also do leg presses and try to keep my calves as stretched as I can. \n\nI do notice when I miss a week or so my balance goes all to hell and daily walking gets a lot harder. I also feel way more tired at the end of the day. I just have to get out of bed early enough to work out. That is the real struggle.", "What are you daily wear sneakers? Hi all, CMT1A here. I am looking for a pair of sneakers that offer supination support to prevent ankle rolling and comfort for long days on my feet to mitigate ankle/knee pain. I have tried New Balances (fresh foam roav), Brooks ghost 13, and nikes. I have insoles for high arches so arch support really is not an issue. What are your daily wear sneakers?", "Hip flexor stretching? Hey all, CMT1A checking in again. I understand why calf stretches are essential for those afflicted, but  cannot pinpoint the reason why hip flexor stretches are equally important for us, especially those with milder symptoms expected to remain ambulatory. How exactly do hip/trunk stretches improve gait or physical functioning as calf stretches do?\n\nThanks in advance! I am no doctor but everything is connected. I think it is good to stretch everything as much as possible. When one tendon is pulled tightly I figure all the rest of them are too. Good question for a physical therapist?", "Should I get tested? If so, how? Hello everyone. My mother has CMT, I am not sure what kind as I have not really asked her about it much. I have been noticing some odd things about myself that are starting to make me worried, mind you I have never had symptoms before. I am a 26 year old man if that helps. My symptoms include:\n\n-hands cramping up into claws if held in odd positions long enough \n-my back cramping up randomly and needing to hunch over till it goes away\n-very high arches \n-starting to trip and stumble noticeably more than previously\n-one of my thumb tips is now numb\n-sometimes my feet cramp up in odd positions as well\n\nNow I know reddit is not the place to get a medical diagnosis. I do not want a medical diagnosis, I just need advice from people who know more about the disease than my inner circle does. I am afraid of going to a doctor, because I am afraid of CMT. I have seen my mom suffer and I do not want to suffer. I need advice. Please help me.", "CMT? Or something else? Hey you all! I am sorry in advance, this is a very wordy post. If I am breaking any subreddit rules with this, please let me know and I will remove it.\n\nI found Charcot Marie Tooth quite by accident, but was slapped in the face pretty much when I read the symptoms list. I honestly feel a little ridiculous though, since it is a rare disorder and I am not aware of any family history. However, my dad has commented that I walk like my grandfather; either penguin like or with a lurch at times.\n\nI have been dealing with 'symptoms' since I was around 10, although I did not know that they were symptoms. I just could not jump as high or run as far or fast as my peers; and I tripped/ran into walls a lot, or dropped things I should not have.\n\nHere is a list of my symptoms, with an approximate time line:\n\n\u2022 walking on the sides of my feet - I first remember this around the time I was 11 or 12, because my mother started disciplining me for it\n\n\u2022 left foot rests visibly lower than right foot; both feet seem to rest lower than a regular persons. Left foot basically points down when sleeping, but not all the way (150\u00b0-160\u00b0, but not 180\u00b0)\n\n\u2022 super high arch- the bottom middle of my foot does not touch the ground if I walk 'normal' and I experience plantar fasciitis type pain. I was diagnosed with pes cavus/mild hammer toe when I was 18.\n\n\u2022 when I stand, my pinky toes are actually physically sideways, being pushed into the ground. They are mostly numb.\n\n\u2022 balance and coordination issues, which has led to a lot of tripping and running into walls. I sway when I stand still, even when I try not to. When I was in the fifth grade I wound up with a hairline fracture in my right wrist from tripping on nothing. It has also progressively gotten worse; I have had to lean on stuff to stand comfortably for more than 10-15 minutes since I was about 19, so 5 years or so now\n\n\u2022 ankles roll at random when walking, it is worse when running. I sprained my ankle twisting my foot on nothing a couple of times while I was in cross country\n\n\u2022 thin calves, that are seemingly impossibly to gain muscle on. They have been like this my whole life. I remember asking my cross country coach in the 10th grade how I could make my calves look like everyone else's. He was very kind about it, and showed me some calf building exercises. They have not helped, although I am not great at consistency these days. When I first started I did them pretty religiously for almost a year with no improvement.\n\n\u2022 hand tremors, mostly when holding objects. It happens fairly often now even when I am not holding anything, though. Pouring water is incredibly difficult now. First noticed at around 17, has gotten progressively worse.\n\n\u2022 my hands will sometimes 'forget' they are holding stuff and let go of it; even if I am actively trying not to drop it. This has always happened. I am afraid of it happening while I am driving.\n\n\u2022 foot cramps, with the second toe crossing over the big toe. They last between 5-60 minutes, generally. They are incredibly painful, and seemingly random.\n\n\u2022 burning, and tingling sensation in my feet; concentrated in the balls/heel. It is in the whole foot though, pretty constantly now; although it mostly goes away when I lay down, or hang my feet over the edge of the couch. If they are not burning, they are so cold it is uncomfortable. My toes are losing sensation.\n\n\u2022 hands have always been constantly cold. Have recently started to feel a light tingle on and off in finger tips\n\n\u2022 when I ran cross country from freshman to sophomore year, I could not run for more than 5 minutes at a time when I first joined the team. I never truly improved; past being able to slowly jog for 15 minutes. My coach eventually sent me to the doctor on suspicion of asthma, where I was diagnosed with 'exercise induced bronchial spasms' and prescribed an Albuterol inhaler for use 20 minutes before any exercise. It did not help, so I went back (again at my coach's request, my parents did not like taking me to doctors) and was prescribed a corticosteroid. That also did not help, and so when my mother wanted me to quit I just did it. I would like to note that I experience symptoms at times when I am not exercising as well, although it is never as bad.\n\n\u2022 random, shooting pain that makes my legs jerk. No real idea when it started. Does not last long, no known triggers. The pain originates in the bottom of the foot generally; although I have felt it in my calves before. This started at about 18, I believe\n\n\u2022 weak grip strength, pretty much as long as I can remember I have been physically weaker than everyone around me. I have trouble pulling the handle to fill up on gas these days\n\n\u2022 recent increase in calf fatigue going up stairs. My feet feel heavier than they used to be.\n\n\u2022 inability to gain weight. It rose by about 5lbs a grade school year, right up until my senior year where I pretty much stopped cold at 98-103. This could be from a thyroid issue though, they run on my mother's side of the family.\n\n\u2022 at one point my left arm muscles were incredibly weak for 2-3 days. It has not happened before or since, but I could barely lift my arm. I cannot tell if the arm is weaker now than it was before; it is not something I paid attention to back then.\n\nI set up an appointment with a neurologist, but it is not until the 23. Until I have my appointment, does anybody here have any insight? And, as a side question; if it is not CMT do you all think I should make an appointment with a podiatrist to discuss ankle bracing? The rolling has been getting worse, and I just know I am going to trip and sprain/break my ankle someday soon.\n\nObviously, this does not count as medical advice. But I would love to hear some other people's point of view. Seeing the doctor is the right move. Only thing I can tell you is it is not rare as you think. It is actually the most common neurological disease out there.  The disease is highly variable from case to case so your symptoms will differ from many others, but it does sound like it is possibility. Thank you for your response! It does sound like your symptoms are consistent with CMT. There are other possible explanations, so a diagnosis will have to wait on your doctor to run some tests. \n\nFrom a practical standpoint, yes, whether it is CMT or not some sort of ankle brace would probably help you. \n\nGood luck with your upcoming appointment. As others have said, symptoms are consistent with CMT but you definitely need to see a neurologist. As for your second question, your neurologist will likely recommend a physiotherapist and they will at the very least recommend custom orthotics. Orthotics really help with trips and falls related to weak ankles and tight heel cords and have helped me a lot with mobility issues including high arches. Yes definitely mention that you are interested in carbon fiber afo's. They are not cheap but they have given me so much more stability. I can walk without dragging my feet. I have a lot of your symptoms. I have spent 5 years and many thousands of dollars in tests looking for a answer but never got a diagnosis beyond 'heritary and idiopathic peripheral neuropathy'. That is with insurance. My hands are fine though. My feet feel like they have ankle weights especially climbing stairs. They used to always feel cold years ago, now I do not have that problem because I lost most feelings in my feet. I cannot stand on my toes. Ankle rolling. \n\nMy advice is that your family is a window into your future. Does any of your parents, grandparents, aunt's and uncles have anything odd about them? Do they stumble, are they in a walker, etc. Pay close attention to them. \n\nYour ball of feet pain... Are you lifting off your toes when running or walking? Or stomping the pavement with your entire foot? If it is the later, maybe it is just contact stress. Afo's might help.\n\nMy next advice is the cold hard truth that this will probably affect the rest of your life. You might want to get a desk job, not a job on your feet. Your future partner needs to be okay with this too, that you will probably never walk normally.\n\nI feel I met my wife 4 years too soon. I had hopes and dreams. We wanted babies. Now I have changed my mind because the kid can get it handed down. She still wants babies so this is really affecting my marriage now.\n\nIt is great to be optimistic and hopeful. But I think you should also be realistic. \n\nOrthotist is the specialist that can fit you\n\nThis is what I have been wearing for the past 11 months. My gait and stability is night and day. You might be able to run in them, but I think you might want to quit running. I would not take them hiking, it is best on solid ground. But I think something like this will give you so much needed stability. It was not cheap, after insurance it cost me $1700 for the pair. But it makes my walking job bearable now. Thank you for your advice.\n\nI am actually married, as it stands. He knows about my difficulty walking, although I never actually sat down with him and had a conversation about it. It is just come up here and there as it is gotten worse. \n\nIf I would had a diagnosis of anything, I definitely would have sat down with him and explained everything. However, I know that whatever the results of my appointment are he will have my back and support me as best he can.\n\nMy husband and I were staunchly child free before this, so it would not change anything in that regard thankfully. I know it is not so easy for a lot of others, and I am deeply sorry for what you and your wife have been going through. I have seen on this sub the topic of using IVF/PGD in combo to guarantee conception of healthy embryos; although it is costly and physically painful/draining.\n\nGood luck in whatever you do; I hope you and your wife can come to an agreement. Thank you! I will be sure to find a good podiatrist. &gt;and they will at the very least recommend custom orthotics.\n\nEvery physio I have met views an AFO as a last resort with CMT, and absolutely not \"the very least\" that would be done. Balance training and physio work has done wonders for trips and falls where AFOs really limited what surfaces were safe to walk on. Not AFO\u2019s. Orthotics. Orthotics are the small inserts that go in your shoes like insoles. I did also have AFO\u2019s for five years but I do not know how often they are used by adults. What do you think the o in afo is for?\nHad even fewer physios ever mention insoles. Not part of what that do. The o stands for Orthosis which, fun fact, is not the same thing as an orthotic. Anyways just sharing my experience and what I found helpful. Just looked it up. Ones a verb, ones a noun. Otherwise interchangeable.", "i dont want to do this anymore i am 18f and i got diagnosed with a neuropathy in 2020, they still dont know what kind they suspect cmt because of how my feet look. In all honesty the medical system is broken and i dont feel like a priority at all which is whatever i guess im not in critical condition. i am verg young and i physically feel like a senior my grandma who is 70 is more mobil than me, i cant run and i walk weird. the worst part is the unknown having no clear idea of what the future holds or if i will make it there, i want to be a normal teen and dance with friends and not be in a constant pain feeling like theres nothing to live for. this body is a prison and the only way out is \u2026 if there is anyone close to my age please reach out i have been to multiple support groups and its mortifying walking into that room when there is only old people around me. I am 28 and as you can tell from my last comment in this sub I have a very dark disposition at the moment. The only thing I can say is get your nerve induction tests done and start going to a pain clinic. It may not be the best advice but once you at least get the edge knocked off the pain you can start building your mental strength to access where your expectations should be in life. I try to remind myself although the hand I have been dealt may be bad at-least it is not terminal and you will have a life. Maybe not the one you want but hey in the grand scope everyone wishes there life was different to a degree. Just do the best you can. I am at the point of taking it an hour at a time and not looking any further. It may sound bleak but it gets me through the day. Doctors still tell me I am too young to hurt that much and there is no way until they see my nerve test then there tones change instantly. I should add I have been seeing a pain management doctor since I was 20. Many people may disagree with me but I stopped going to a neurologist all together because it is not treatable and all they will do is scare you more with there talk of how far it may progress. It is a progressive disease so I already know that I do not need to waste my time at a doctor who cannot treat me just say every years or so \u201cyep it is progressing\u201d just live in the moment and enjoy it. It may never progress any further mine has not changed much in 5 years so I do not need a neurologist telling me I should prepare for the inevitable one day of being in a wheelchair. He does not know that will happen any more than I do so I do not need those thoughts being brought back up at each visit My son (14m) and I have CMT1B and I hear you. The medical system is really frustrating for these sorts of things. The best advice I can give is to seek docs with neuropathy specialties; they will have a much better time answering your questions and will generally be able to recommend orthoticists and PTs that know how to help support and strengthen what you can. You are not wrong. I went to one where there was a 35 year age gap between me and the next youngest. Hearing them complain about getting modifications to the 2 story house or BMW was not exactly supporting. &gt;any people may disagree with me but I stopped going to a neurologist all together because it is not treatable and all they will do is scare you more with there talk of how far it may progress\n\nA local fb support group is currently arguing a lot about the neuro thing. The only benefits they have given for a regular neuro is the measuring (pointless imo), answering questions (in my experience, they did not), or handling referrals (do not need a neuro for that). I am not sure if your pain is more neurological or caused by your feet and walk, but I am 32 and just had my right foot operated on by Dr Pfeffer and it is a night and day difference, I am happy to answer some PMs but take a look here.  \n\nI did not know this was even an option until recently and I think more people (especially young) need to look into getting corrective work done because it is incredible what he can do for you. So....old people with a life time of experience with the disease are not worth being around? Good to know.\nBy the way, every elderly person was once a teenager like you. I do not believe they are saying anything negative about old people, just that they already feel different to ask their peers. Having no real peer in a support group is difficult.  \n\nI am very sorry for OP's pain. Was in my 30s before it got bad for me.  I am in my 40s now.  My neurologist listens and has worked with me to find medications that lessen my pain and fatigue. I am still disabled, but at least I have a reasonable quality of life. If you are neurologist is not helping you, please find a dr who will. Do not take it personally mate. I think the OP just needs someone she can relate to &amp; talk to. Im 33 &amp; im not exactly going to find common ground with a 60 yr old whos lived a different era that I have she might just want to talk about things that 18 yr olds talk about. As well as dealing with the shit we have to go through. Well, since I am one of those old people (I am 64) that are not worth talking to, I will not reply or bother anyone else. Did you not read what I just wrote to you. Im sorry you feel this way. \nI know the medical system can be frustrating but I would give the doctors one more shot and here is how I would do it- find the closest CMT center of excellence to you: \n\nIn my experience these doctors have been great. I see Dr. Day at Stanford and he is phenomenal, caring, intelligent, empathetic. I only see him once a year but I seriously look forward to it. These clinics also have physical therapists who can show you exercises to help maintain strength. They have occupational therapists who can give you real tools to help with everyday life. They can also discuss surgery with you which (as others here will tell you) can make a serious difference. \n\nI would push for a genetic diagnosis, I know these things take money and time but once you know what you have it will help you understand the range of potential outcomes and remove some of the uncertainty that is making you anxious. I got diagnosed by Dr Day at the age of 23, at the time the couple thousand dollars I spent on the appointment and test felt massive, looking back it was one of the best things I have ever spent money on. \n\nFinally- mental health is so so so important. Everybody is different but I benefited greatly from talk therapy, I am not a support group guy, much like you, they do not work for me. I also do meditation and breathing exercises daily, it calms me down, helps me step outside my own mind for a bit and gives me a good sense of perspective. Others do spiritual practices to achieve these same things. \n\nYou can do this, it will be hard work times but there ARE things you can do to greatly improve your condition. I am sorry you feel so defeated.  My biggest tip is to let go of that internalized ableism. This shit is hard, but we are fabulous, and so much more than our physical bodies.  And if you own it, you feel better about yourself.  Get comfortable talking about it, ask for your help, know your limits, dance anyway\u2026what other people think of you is none of your business, plus it only reflects on them &gt; I also do meditation and breathing exercises daily, it calms me down, helps me step outside my own mind for a bit and gives me a good sense of perspective.\n\nHi u/ToadInTheBox Nice to see you again. My fault, I have been laying low on r/cmt for some time now. The last 18 or so months had all become too much for me. Diagnosed at 65, then back surgery, then going from walking independently to requiring a cane and rollator in less than 5 months after surgery/ diagnosis, and now, pretty much house bound due to pain, weakness, physical distortions of legs and feet. \n\nCould you elaborate on your use of meditation and breathing exercises, please? How/where did you learn the techniques? Any links or videos you could share?\n\nI need to find something. This incessant day-in-day-out of nothingness, going only to medical appointments and basic grocery shopping, other than that, the same shit, different day, in the house is really pulled me to the precipice.\n\nThanks I was diagnosed at 15. And like you, most of the people in CMT groups were way, way older than me. I was still very mobile, and my CMT does not have pain, but I could not run or play sports or even keep up with friends when we were walking. Not being able to wear high heels always hurt me, and it still does sometimes. All I want some days is to dress up nice and go out without having to strap on braces or use a cane. I want to be able to walk out my front door and go places on my own two feet, and it is so much work it might as well be impossible. Feeling frustrated and trapped is real.\n\nI was angry for a really long time. It simply is not fair. But being angry at the world just hurt me, sent me into feeling sorry for myself and isolating myself - the anger isolated me more than the CMT itself. Therapy helped, and also reorienting my own life away from internalized abelism. I was angry cause I could not do the things society writ-large said I should be able to do. Especially when you are young and think you should be doing these carefree things. Clubbing and bars and shows where you should not have to worry about your body so much. Not being able to do that made feel like I was missing out on my entire life. I was left completely worthless, angry, and sad. But that idea of what life should be is a false perception of reality. Most people have some kind of disability, something that makes life frustrating and hard. We do not allow for that very well in society, but realizing no one fills that \"normal\" idea is the first step in reevaluating how you see yourself as compared to an imaginary \"normal.\"\n\nSo now I have set up both physical and emotional support systems that allow me to function with fewer frustrations. Small things that help me navigate my own home, my neighborhood, my work, my vacations, my dinner dates, etc. This includes handrails, AFOs, walking sticks, special shoes, heated blankets, etc. But also patience with myself, patience with my life, forgiveness for not being some imaginary perfect normal human, and most importantly; other people. Finding people in your life (disabled or not) who understand your limitations, and accept them, accommodate for them, and support you are invaluable. It is the hardest part and I am super lucky to have that, but there are CMT groups (yea, lots of older people) and other generalized support groups (some focused on younger people) with wonderful, gracious, and welcoming members where you can find connections that do not rely on being able to jog around the block.\n\nThe other thing that helps a lot is art. I love art and the physicality of using my body to make things - clay, woodworking, illustration, printing. Even though my hands are pretty weak, art allows this expansive freedom to find out ways of doing things that work for me. There is no wrong and right in a lot of art practice, there is just how it works *for you*. What I make might not be perfect, but I made it, so that is an accomplishment. Perfection is really unnecessary, it is just playtime, and where you can still enjoy yourself not despite, but maybe because of your limits. Finding some hobby like that might help.\n\nI am 33 now. I made it this far! I like my life and am way more confident in my abilities now than I was at 15, that is for sure. Your CMT might be different from mine, it might be worse, it might not be as bad, but I know that despair. I will not say it will get better, but you have the power to make it better by figuring out how to live in a way that works for you, and not in a way everything else tells you to. You can do this. ... exercise. look into getting turbomed afo's.  \nLook into the mcdougall diet and give it a try for 2 weeks and see if you improve.  \nI was diagnosed  with type 2 at age 2 or something, I do not know any better, I wish someone dragged me into activity like sports and exercise, no one did. It is peripheral, try not to lose strength in the upper legs, I have read from users that turbomed braces are good to keep those muscles working, and look into inlay soles that support the food arch, these thing I want to try myself too. I always got maximum support shoes without using upper leg muscles, now I need to relearn to walk but I do not feel like to. Do not give up. Your muscles are good, the periphery wiring is not good enough to use those muscles. Bad feet means bad mechanical base which means unstable mechanics of the whole body while standing, that is why you do not feel mobile I guess :). Fix the base. Look into these but they are expensive   \n You can do it! Would you look at someone, who is not you, who is disabled and think these things about them? Why would you say those things about yourself? I will not lie, chronic pain is challenging, but the other stuff? It is ok if you just accept it. And get tools! My leg braces are amazing and they look pretty cool too. I wear black braces with black leggings or tights and black booties and I look like I am from the future. Sometimes I use a wheelchair. I have fun. I play in 3 bands. I love to go to art events. I have an awesome, fulfilling relationship. Do not expect doctors to \"fix' you. There is, however, an amazing surgeon, Dr. Pfeffer. I am not a candidate for what he does but he reverses deformity in many and helps them walk without braces through the strategies he uses. Otherwise, doctors can offer you prescriptions for braces and/or a custom wheelchair. They can send you to physical therapy to help you learn how to stretch and strengthen your core to increase your balance. Please call this number for help if you are feeling desperate 800-273-8255. You only get one life. Live it to its fullest. Running is overrated. I mean, if there are zombies, we are screwed but otherwise I am getting by fine without it. I like my physical medicine doctor so much better. I have some problems with my left side glute and back because of a cascading effect of the difference in strength on both sides and she is the first person who has understood this and is actually doing things to help me. My neuro just seems like a check-in so I can continue to get meds. I am a super complicated case and it is so cool to finally feel understood. I have to say the art thing really resonates with me. When I am playing music, I am not thinking about my pain or weakness - even though CMT makes it more challenging. Like you say, I have the freedom to do it my own way and work around it. I have learned some things recently about pain that have been very helpful. Maybe I should create an independent post about it. I do use pain medications. But I am also working with a physical therapist who is teaching me lots of different ways to tamp my pain down - rollers, release balls, nerve flossing, cupping, massage - of course exercise. And none of this stuff is curative but it is so cool to be able to take my pain down a few points when I feel like I have had it. I sneak off at work with my foam roller at least once a day and it does make a difference. I am 26. My mom is 54 and has it too. She is been pretty stable for at least the last 15 years (maybe more I do not know). That is kind of my hope that I will be the same. \n\nI was diagnosed before I was born. Struggled a lot as a kid and a teenager. Now not so much. I learned to adapt my live to my needs. And found friends and an amazing boyfriend who do not care too much that I am physically disabled. (sorry up top for the long reply)\n\nHello! Good to see you around again. Isolation is awful, and the lack of mobility and pain on top of that... sorry to hear what you are going through. \n\nLet me caveat everything I am about to say with this- I do not intend at all to compare my situation to yours or anyone else's, so I do not want it to come off that way. \n\nFor breathing exercises, what I do is very straight forward, I try to follow this video once a day (( It is -sort of- a purposeful hyperventilation for 30 breaths, then a breath hold, which for me lasts for about 2 and a half minutes, then a brief period of rest, repeat 3 times. During the breath hold I feel pure serenity, I basically do it for that feeling, but afterwards I also just generally feel better. The more you practice it the easier it gets, and I am at the point where I will just do this if I am having a shitty day and about half the time it will improve my mood. The science behind it is somewhat dubious but for me the results are not.  \n\nThe meditation I think is more important, but also harder work. I suppose you could call what I do \"mindfulness meditation\". There is lots you can read about it but my technique is really just what I have found to work for me: I set a timer for however long I want to do it (minimum 5 minutes which is all I can handle some days). I sit on a yoga mat or sometimes upright in a chair, close my eyes, and try to focus only on physical sensations. I usually do a very slow 'scan' across my body, starting with the tip of my head and moving downward, just trying to recognize how each part of my body feels. It is important just to observe the feelings (or lack of feeling) but not to judge or try to correct them, or think about why they exist \\. The goal is just to acknowledge them. Through regular practice you can try to then use the same technique throughout your daily life when your body is getting you down. It does not work all the time, but some times it does, and that is worth it for me.\n\nA little bit of background on me- 5 years ago I developed some kind of vestibular nerve damage, I still have not figured out what it is, but it is screwed up my balance big time. I already have reduced physical sensation from the CMT but now my vestibular system is throwing out incorrect signals, so I rely almost entirely on my vision for balance. When i close my eyes for long enough I lose sense of direction and it feels like I am spinning off in outer space. \n\nI started the mindful meditation to combat that dizziness feeling, and for the first week (at least) of trying it, I found it so hard to move past my hatred for that dizziness feeling. All I could think about was how bad it sucks that I have to be dizzy 24/7. Slowly, though, I was able to make some progress to just acknowledge \"my body is dizzy right now, that is interesting\" and then move on to other sensations. Over time I have generally been moving closer and closer to actually feeling that way throughout my day. \n\nMy CMT is relatively mild, I have no pain from it, but I believe the same technique could be useful for pain or numbness which might otherwise consume your thoughts.\n\nOne last bit (god I am droning on)... both of these things only work for me if I do them regularly. My technique for habit forming is this- I print of a calendar of the month each month, and every day that I do my meditation I check mark that day on the calendar. If I do not do it I mark a X. At the end of the month I donate $10 to charity for each x, and each day that I do meditate, I let myself have a reward that I normally would not (a snack, stay up later to watch a TV show, a hit off the vape pen, etc.) Punishment for the behavior you do not want, rewards for the behavior you do want. Thank you so much for \"Droning on,\" so informatively! And thanks for sharing your personal touches &amp; experiences with both your meditation and breathing exercises and for the link. I look forward to doing and `working` both, incorporating them into my current mental &amp; emotional multi-daily Tapping exercises, which are also pretty new to me but apparently have been around for quite some time and have a great deal of science behind the practice of Tapping. (Lots of information about Tapping on goggle and youtube)\n\nI had to lookup the vestibular system and do some reading as I am unfamiliar with the system. I knew an inner ear \"mechanism\" was responsible for balance but little more than that. I know well the feeling of losing balance and feeling like you are falling as well as feeling like I have little control over any aspect of the event, often, not even the location or position as I am falling. Then again, I fall often anymore. Multiple times a day depending on how bad I am feeling or just due to CMT or the unintended missteps which can be attributed to CMT.\nBUT, to have your experience of careening about 24/7, I can only imagine what it must feel like when you close your eyes! Either standing or reclining! \nYou definitely have your share of `Challenges' as well. I will be including you and your Vestibular System in my daily mediations!\n\nAgain, thank you for your well thought, thorough, and informative response.\nPlease feel free to 'Drone On' anytime as far as I am concerned! I am close in age to you and the high heel comment rang true with me. The condition, the splints etc and even without all really chip away at our perceived feminine values, particularly in the teens and 20\u2019s. I have been very lucky compared to some, to not have many obvious symptoms but it is those little things that have made me feel \u2018behind\u2019 with socialising and feeling accepted. I will have to look into tapping, it is the first I have heard of it. Sounds interesting. \n\nIf there is anything positive that came out of the dizziness thing for me it is been the focus on mental health. It is a problem that is so intense it cannot be ignored so it forced me to find a way to be comfortable living with it and that has just been a useful skill in general but also for dealing with the mental health impacts of CMT. You are so correct about the mental impact, about the incessant nagging demands accumulated over a lifetime. Things we dealt with in what seems like eons ago have a way of resurfacing, niggling at ones resolve, and as the pain intensifies, for some, and the isolation increases as a result of the every progressing decline in abilities.\n\nWhen we wake up one more and discover all of a sudden, there is one more pain, one more loss of a motor or sensory nerve, one more thing we cannot do because the muscles all of a sudden no longer respond as they should, as the last motor nerve that animated a muscle no longer responds and now, you will never walk again, or walk with some kind of external aid.\n\nWhen you can no longer go to places because, even if you could get there, you could not do anything once you were there.\n\nYes, the mental health aspect is indeed a call that will not, should not be ignored.", "Nerve pain? Does anybody else get the occasional shooting nerve pain?   I Say occasional because it is not my typical pain. I will generally get a sharp, yet dull stabbing pain on what I can only assume to be my nerves because anything below that point will suffer a millisecond of weakness. It will happen repeatedly over the course of a day or two and then stop for months at a time\n\nIf you get this, what do you do to ease or control the pain? I called them \"hot poker pain\". Had them for years. Would make me scream. I was walking in a park behind an older gentleman when one struck. I screamed and nearly gave the poor man a heart attack! All I knew at the time was I had neuropathy.\nAs the nerves get dammaged it will increase. Then slack off. Now I rarely get them. Neurotin helped, but far from stopped them. I definitely get this. Honestly I try to distract myself. Nothing i do can physically make the pain go away. \n\nAlso sleep. If you can take something to relax you or take a bath. It helps. I do.\nLower legs, forearms, elbows, knees and back. \nI get it mostly in the evening and especially when i have had a bigger day.\nI also have deep aching burning in the same areas. My lower legs burn/ deep ach 24/7.\n\nI find the shooting fain feels like an electric shock physically twitching my body/ area and pain full enough to make me grit my teeth or swear.\n\nOnly massage in the area has helps me a bit. But i bruise the area i have to go that hard. Or a good old hot shower.\nMedication like gabapenton or lyrica. Endep. Have offered me some reduction but not much.  They alse gave me lots of brain fog and sedation. Pretty much nailed it. Though my big aches are not constant, but maybe 4/7 days", "Looking for vehicle recommendations So, my wife has CMT and we bought her a folding wheelchair for when we are going to be out on long outings and she is not really able to sit. Her father has CMT also and started using a powered wheelchair about 15 years ago. She is not quite ready to get a van yet ((even though I want one, so we could sticker bomb the hell out of it)) does anyone have any good recommendations for a good small or mid sized car for the occasional need of a wheelchair? Wagons or hatchbacks have been the go to in my family. I had a Caprice wagon that I got from my granddad that he would haul my grandma's wheelchair in the back. There are lots of hatchback and wagon options. The smaller SUV's are great. I just got a suzuki vitara last week and it is just a nice mid size. Fits my folded wheelchair in the boot/trunk nicely eith room to spare :) I have type 2A with some mobility problems and I absolutely LOVE my Mazda CX-5. I have the touring and it has an automated lift gate, so I am able to get my walker in and out by myself! And it is easy to get in and out of. Growing up, my family had one of those older wagons, with the rear facing seats. I have always wanted one of those. What is the leg room like? I am 6'0 and all leg, My boyfriend is 6\u20191 and he says that he has enough leg room when the seat is back!", "I am new would like to share and ask some questions :) Hey im a 21 guy and i have been recently diagnosed with cmt (I dont know the type yet). Also i am sorry if my english is terrible :D (I live in France) so im on Reddit because i didnt find a French internet community. \n\nIm kind of lost because i had no idea i had something that serious, i mean i have always been skinny (limbs mostly) and my foot \"arched ?\". I went to the doctor a year ago because i had tremors in my hands (im a med student so my doctor thought i was being overreacting because of what im studying, its called \"Medical students disease\"...), and a mouth ago i went to the neurologist by myself and then he told me i had cmt. \n\nWhat Is the standard medical follow-up for cmt ? Only physiotherapy ? And there is no hope for someone with cmt to gain weight ? I mean not asking too gain 20 kg of muscles but a minimum at least :P \n\nAlso while im waiting for the results of the genetic tests (yeah its really slow): is there any way i can know the severity of my cmt with the results ? Because i always read people saying \"mild type \" for example and im wondering how they can know that ? Im concerned about the fact that it can affect my studies and then me being a doctor with a neuropathy can or cannot be possible :/ \n\nIm glad i found this Reddit I cannot really help so I am not sure why I am posting. I have a mild form and an 42 years old. CMT is an ongoing inconvenience but unlikely to deteriorate much. My dad has it and is 72. He is rather worse but lives a pretty normal and active life. It is poor balance &amp; coordination, fine motor skills etc. I cycle for exercise which is very helpful.\n\nIf you got this far without pursuing a diagnosis then it must be mild for you too? Read literature, find further forums... and most of all, find a CMT specialist. We have one in here Sydney. They can test your DNA, identify the subtype, and give you clearer advice.\n\nThere is plenty of CMT Facebook groups although I have found there is a lot of quackery in them about vitamin regimes etc. Hey, and welcome! I am glad you found this subreddit!\n\nAt the moment there are no cure for CMT. There are several treatments that are in pre-clinical or phase 1 trials at the moment - pretty exciting stuff - but for now the only thing we can really do is to try to manage the symptoms.\n\nPhysiotherapy is recommended because it have been demonstrated to have a positive effect on physical function and quality of life in people with CMT. How much it helps depends on the type of CMT (CMT is a whole family of diseases) and also varies significantly between individuals, where some people benefit more than others. How much you will benefit from it is something you will have to figure out, but in general the effect tends to be modest and we are unable to build the same amount of muscle mass and strength as people without CMT. \n\nFor me, I experience fatigue long before I am even close to reaching the number of workouts and intensity needed to build serious muscle. But even if I could sustain such an intensity, I would not see much of an effect. Around the time I was diagnosed I made a serious attempt to build muscle to see if I really was unable to. I tracked all my activity rigorously, used a PT to set up a good diet and regimen, did compound movements and the whole nine yards. Initially I saw some progress but after a while it was pretty clear that something was wrong with the way my muscles responded. After not progressing for a couple months I gradually reduced my activity level to one which I could sustain without becoming too tired and struck with that for many years. It should be noted that a lot of other people in this subreddit have different experiences from mine though, with some being quite active as I understand it. So again this is varies significantly from each person with CMT.\n\nOther options are swimming, especially in a heated pool. I did that for many years and for me that kind of exercise was more agreeable with me, I felt less tired and it had a positive impact on my day to day function. I also like to hike in nature where the ground is uneven, it helps with my balance and it seems like my thigh muscles are not as affected by the CMT as others are, which means I am able to more or less keep up with non-CMT people while hiking.\n\nAs for severity, it is possible to predict the outcome to some degree. It is a bit technical but if you are interested you can look up some longitudinal studies on pubmed that deals with this issue. When you know your type you can complete a set of tests that you can then use to compute a \"score\" (CMTNS/CMTNS2) which tells you how affected you are. Based on this score and your age and CMT type you can find out with some degree of certainty what to expect in terms of progression over the next couple of decades. It is a bit of work though and probably more of an academic exercise. Another way is to look at how your parent and grandparent with CMT were affected. Most people with CMT inherit it, and although the severity of the symptoms can vary between family members you can get a rough idea of what the best and worst case scenarios are if you look at their case history. You can also read up on the disease progression for the CMT genotype you have, there are a lot of good studies on the most common types.\n\nWhen someone says \"mile type\", perhaps they refer to the different genotypes? CMT 1A for instance is a pretty mild type, whereas CMT3 or Dejerine-Sottas disease as it is more commonly called is a significantly more severe type.\n\nIf you have CMT 1A or another one of the milder ones, becoming a doctor should not be a problem. I would probably not go into surgery though if I were you.. That said, studying medicine gives you a good foundation for understanding your disease properly, which is undoubtedly beneficial when it comes to understanding and managing risks and taking care of your self in relation to CMT in the future. I know that most doctors work a lot though, and fatigue is a common symptom in CMT. That could potentially become an issue when you are older.\n\nFor reference, here is a chart of some of the most frequently reported issues patients with CMT report:\n\n Thank you :) I found a known center here in Paris where there is specialists of cmt but the delay of the appointments are really long (6 mouths to 1 year) so am i supposed to wait this much before i can see a specialist ?  Thank you for taking your time to answer with details :)\n\nAbout the severity in my family it is weird but my parents do not have it i mean its maybe from my mother but she has no signs of cmt (but again i guess it is all about genetics and the different transmission types?)\n\nSurgery seems not an option but im fine with that, as long as i can be a doctor... But im kind of disappointed in medecine for the lack of information about CMT in general and of course about the lack of research for a gene therapy, because i think cmt is one of the most common rare disease right ?\n\nAlso i forgot to ask but i didnt find tremors as a common symptom in cmt, do you think its a rare symptom that depends on the type ? Or are the tremors because the limbs muscles are weak (especially my hand's). \n\nMay i ask your age pmp22 ? :d \n\n\n All genotypes of CMT are hereditary, with most being autosomal except for the CMTX family which is X-linked. There are known cases of *de novo* CMT mutations but these are fairly rare. Because CMT can present so differently between each individual, even within families with the same genotype, it is entirely possible that some family members will not show any obvious symptoms despite having the disease. My great grandfather for instance had CMT 1A. He worked in a coal mine his entire life, and was, according to my grandfather, a very strong and resilient outdoorsman. He built a two story cabin using only manual hand tools and used to chop wood and carry water all the way up to the day he died. The only symptom he showed was that he had thin calves and mild foot-drop later in life. That is in contrast to his descendants including me who have experienced more noticeable symptoms. Gene expression as well as embryogenic effects is likely to be part of the explanation for why it presents to differently, but because the precise pathogenesis of CMT is not known yet it is still a bit of a mystery.\n\nIt might seem like there is not much information about CMT out there, but if you dig a little bit you will see that there is actually a lot of activity related to CMT, more so than ever before. A good place to start is the ( and ( Seeing as you are studying medicine, you could even do a search for \"Charcot Marie Tooth\" on pubmed to get an impression of what is going on in the world of CMT research. Currently there are over 4000 papers published on the topic, with some 200 new papers being published every year. When I studied biology I began to look into the CMT literature partly out of interest and to learn more about CMT but also as way to get a grasp on academic publishing. The more I have learned about CMT the more interesting I have found the topic to be. You being French even have the luxury of being able to read the original 1886 paper of Charcot and Marie in it is original language. :) I have had to make due with a poorly translated English version and Tooth's dissertation (which by all means is a good read as well) on the same topic.\n\nCMT is indeed one of the most common inherited neurological disorders, it affects roughly 1 in 2,500 people. It is also in most cases a single gene disease, which makes it an attractive target to future therapies.\n\nI do not know much about tremors and CMT, but I do know that some studies have found that there is a correlation between tremors and CMT and that there seems to be some family history in CMT tremor patients. I am 29.  Hey! \n\nSo one of the hard things is how much CMT can vary. I have CMT type x. I inherited it from my mom. My mom's sister and my grandma also have it.\n\nMy aunt and grandma have really bad effects. Walking is very hard for them, and my grandma's hands are just straight fucked.\n\nBut then my mom came around and she did not show ANY symptoms until she was 30, and she was an athlete. Then when she was 30, she got an autoimmune disease and then also started showing signs of CMT.\n\n\nI am 20 and my symptoms are mild. I have got really skinny feet, and foot drop. I had tremors for a while but it turned out it was from my antidepressants. I also am missing many deep tendon reflexes. \n\nOverall, it does not really affect me too much. I quit soccer a year earlier than I would have because my ankles roll, but that is the worst thing that is happened. Everything else is so minor like having to be orthopedic soles for my shoes to help with fatigue, and some issues with writing fatigue.\n\n\nBasically, it can be really hard to tell how it will affect you and how it will get worse. We have a CMT clinic in Iowa that is like the main source of CMT Research and the doctor there (Dr.Shy) does not predict me having any major issues, but it is always still a possibility.\n\n\nYou can definitely gain muscle, you just have to be careful. If you push it too hard, you could be doing more harm than good. CMT tends to make muscles atrophy faster, especially in the event of an injury like a broken bone or sprains. Basically you just have to listen to what your body is telling you.\n\nI am not sure if there are CMT clinics abroad, but I recommend finding one. The one in Iowa does extensive testing to get a better understanding of how it is personally affecting you, and you have consultations with several kinds of doctors there too (like physical therapists, occupational therapist, people who make leg braces, fertility/genetics doctor (in case you want children), neurologists, etc). Connecting some studies from pubmed might help finding some benefits ? Im not talking about gene therapy obviously but at least supplements that could reduce symptoms by interfering with intracellular pathways without danger of course (i had that thought while reading the Niacin topic and it is hypothetic benefits, on this subreddit) , im pretty familiar with pubmed and various pathways (not because i recently discovered i had cmt but because i have always been curious about biology and because i was in charge of writing biology exams for undergraduate students involving the use of articles from pubmed). I dont know you but from all the things i have been reading from you on this subreddit i know you did acquire many knowledge about cmt from scientific literature (starting with Charcot and Marie's papers :p ).\n\nAgain thank you for helping me understand more about it :) I just want to say that I really agree with the last point about doctors atributing CMT to new and (potentially unrelated) symptoms that you experience. I have experienced it as well, and it is something I think everyone with CMT should be wary about. Perhaps especially when it comes to pain, numbness, fatigue, and tremors as these could all have more serious causes that should be ruled out. Finding new pathways is certainly within the realm of possibility, the problem is testing it out. Unless you have a research lab you are left with experimenting with your own body. I know several people who have tried different things but it is difficult to quantify any results and there are always risk involved. Many pathways have been proposed in the literature and some of them have been tried, there have even been a high throughput screening on pmp22 regulation with several large compound libraries. Though the research is unconfirmed by third parties, PXT3003 supposedly work. The compounds are available right now so in theory anyone could mix them in the correct dosage and self administer. Personally I am waiting for their phase 2 results, but if they show good results I will discuss it with my neurologist. I do not reccomend anyone doing it though. Yep. Exactly this. My mom's more extreme because she also has an autoimmune disease but I cannot tell you how many times doctors say \"oh your x is because of the autoimmune disease\" then she does more research and demands a second opinion, tests are done, and it is actually a life threatening infection or other illness.\n\nJust because something can be caused by CMT does not mean it is, and I prefer to over-test to make sure it is not something else before defaulting to saying it is the CMT. In Norway we have the same kind of waiting times. Hey :) \n\nDo you know the gene involved in your cmt ? My genetician told me she is almost sure i have the type X but i have to wait for the test results. Also we have the same symptoms no more no less so maybe our types are \"close\" ? ^^\n\nAlso thank you (and pmp22 ;)) im a bit more reassured when i read that cmt wont be a big deal for my future job...\n\nAnd thanks for telling me about your tremors because i thought for sure it was due to cmt but now im thinking maybe it is not, i should investigate more :P \n\nThank you for sharing. Well it is the X chromosome (so you have to inherit it from a parent, although they might not know they have it). I do not remember the exact Gene number, but it is whatever Gene that affects the mylein of a nerve. \n\nIf you are a guy, CMT X can be a bit more severe for you, because you do not have an extra X Gene to help where the other one fails. Not to say you are going to get extremely worse, but it is always a possibility.\n\n\nSadly it really is hard to say how much it will affect you. In my original post I mentioned my family members. We all have the same type of CMT (X, inherited from parents) but all have differing severity. My grandma has a really hard time walking and her hands are really messed up. My aunt does not have much wrong with her hands, but has a terrible time walking as well. They both started showing signs when they were younger. My mom also has CMT but she did not show signs until 30, and her current signs might just be part of her auto immune disease (so, in other words, she might have never shown serious symptoms).\n\n\nPersonally, my CMT is so mild that I probably would not have known I had it if my mom was not so aware of the disease and had us all tested. I probably would have assumed the few issues I have with fatigue was normal for people or something.\n\nDefinitely look into those tremors! It could be the CMT but I would be sure to check for other more severe issues too. They also make medicine to help with tremors. Personally I was taking trazodone and it helped until I finally got another opinion and found it was my antidepressants. Obviously your neurologist would have some suggestions to the best course to take for that.\n\nI would also definitely see if you can find a neurologist that specifically lists CMT in their specialties if possible. They know the most about it, and are less likely to attribute every little thing to the CMT, as they know CMT can also mask more serious issues.\n\n\nHere is some more links to give you some more info. Some of the articles talk about symptoms that sound very severe, so do not let it scare you too much. You should know they are possible, but usually have a slow onset which gives you plenty of time to figure out ways to treat and manage if they do start to show. \n\n\n\n\n\n I just want to chime in to add that the majority of CMTX cases are caused by one out of more than 400 known mutations in a single gene (GJB1), which degrade the function of the expressed protein. This in turn means that the symptoms can vary greatly depending on which mutation one has. Also something to note is that there are known CNS involvement in some CMT X mutations, which for those affected cause symptoms that differ from the usual CMT presentation.\n\nYou can read more about CMTX here:\n\n\n\nSo although it is is possible to make make generalized assumptions, it is really important to know the exact genetic cause if you want to know how it is going to progress. I have very mild CMT and I have gained around 20 lbs of muscle this year.  Just dedicate yourself and hopefully you will be fine. I am a 22 year old with cmt1a and I have been dealing with cmt my whole life. I am the only one in my family with it (luck of the draw with a random gene mutation) so I have had to learn a lot about ways to live your life with cmt.\nAs far as working out goes, I am actually trying to put on some muscle weight right now as well. I have always worked out pretty frequently but struggled to put on mass. Having a light load on your joints is better for you in the long run, so I would not try to gain too much weight, but I would instead focus on the muscles that cmt weaken. It is easy to focus on the glamor muscle (chest, abs, arms) but I am really trying to focus on the muscles that are weakened from the cmt and causing and inbalance in my body. For me it is my mid and lower back which are weak (and of course my legs), causing my posture to go to shit. I would assess yourself and really focus on the little muscles that are degenerating. \nOnce you get fully diagnosed, I recommend searching for clinical trials to take part in. I am currently taking a medication from a trial started in France that has had promising results.\nSorry for the novel, but as I have said I have been living with cmt for my whole life and have a lot to say about it. Feel free to ask me more questions if any of this is helpful.  thank you :) the thing is that in very insecure about my skinny body and i really want to change that, so reading that gives me hope :) I will ask more hehe that is really nice from you ;) im just waiting for my appointment with the cmt specialist in may. \n\nAlso i have heard about that trial here, its about the tritherapy right ? (forget the name)   Not really sure what you mean by tritherapy, but the drug is composed of 3 already approved medications combined into an oral solution. \n\nHere is a link to the companies website describing their research: ", "SARMS and CMT Hello. Has anyone ever tried SARMS while trying to build some muscles? Any noticable and worthy gains in terms of strength/size/endurance?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd what type of SARMS did you use? I am interested in ostarine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShare your thoughts. Yup, I have mentioned my use of Swarms a few times on here. I have tried ostarine, lgd, and rad. LGD 4033 is my favourite and the difference is staggering. \nFirstly, you actually get gains (including calves and forearms!!!). No more random plateaus and being stuck looking like some prepubescent kid. \nYou have way more energy at the gym so you can easily do 1 1/2 hours or more. \nAlso it is now possible to get pumps which really help with good gains.\n\nHowever if you go down this route then do it properly eg get bloods taken prior and post cycle,  take oct and pct. Pct is tricky to get hold of (eg clomid) but if you go abroad to a less developed country then there is a good chance you can buy it over the counter at a pharmacy. Have you tried any steroids?  I am on nandrolone decanoate (prescribed) and really want to jump on a higher dose or cycle it ... Do a few months nandrolone (bulking up) and a few months on oxandrolone (leaning down).  I think doctor's fear prescribing steroids for growth purposes but with CMT1A we really do need the helping hand these drugs offer. I am currently having an ongoing argument with my CMT neuro consultant about being given nandrolone instead of taking SARMs. I have another appt with her at the start if next month where I am going argue my case again to be given steroids. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe and the entire dept (UCLH - so world leading in CMT.....apparently) are in denial about the need for CMT patients struggling to develop muscle mass. However seeing that I have managed to beef up my forearms and claves which she claimed would be \"impossible\", she is going to have a hard time arguing against a) CMT inhibiting muscle growth b) PEDs improving quality of life for CMT patients \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I doubt she will come to her senses as she seems not too smart and knows nothing about steroids and I do not even think the NHS has a single AAS on their list of approved drugs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow much nandrolone are you taking as the performance-enhancing dosage is normally 300-400mg per week? Also, did your doctor come up with the idea to prescribe it as I want to put my consultant in contact with someone who is not terrified of anabolics? I am on only 60 mg nandrolone decanoate a week and 150 testosterone cypionate.  If you jump on nandrolone as a guy, you need testosterone too.  As a woman you can do nandrolone without T.", "Does anyone play video games? Does the CMT affect how you use the remote ?   I find shooters and stuff that require reflexes I am very slightly disadvantaged, but I have always taken great pleasure in excelling at strategy and skill in order to outplay opponents. I play games like rainbow 6 siege which rely a great deal on tactics. Even CoD rewards players who play smart. Just wanted to contribute my experience. Have CMT pretty bad and still able to perform extremely well in shooters on PC. Anything involving my hands can hurt after awhile, but I do not personally feel very disadvantaged on PC. yes I am a big gamer! Not the best reflexes or accuracy but I hold my own with strategy &amp; tactics. I play a lot of Overwatch at the moment on PC. If I play too much and then use the computer too much for work then my fingers get sore and I have to cut back! I cannot really play shooters on console because my thumbs do not move as well as they used to. I shifted more towards pc gaming because of this because I can still use a mouse and keyboard  You betcha!  At my age my pinkies are too weak to use - with my ring fingers almost so - which means any console game that requires use of both triggers and / or shoulder buttons at the same time is unplayable.  Luckily, that is generally limited to the multiplayer FPS genre so I avoid it... actually I just avoid any multiplayer that is not turned based now.\n\nThe more annoying issue is when a game that has presented no problems (hello Dishonored) suddenly needs a 'thumb press + trigger + button' that my hands simply cannot do.  On more than one occasion I have actually used either my chin, a chair arm, or my leg to push one button so I could manage the rest of the combo.\n\nPC gaming /can/ be better as there are many gaming mice with customizable buttons, so you can put what you need where you can reach.  Mouse input does not tolerate hand twitches as easily though, so it can be an expensive balance to find.\n\nIn the past ( was a great starting point to locate the controllers that would work for you.   Yes! My PT encourages me to play up to half an hour a day to help with hand dexterity. (I play PS4)\n\nOn my very bad days I cannot play, hurts too much. But on good days... well, I play a lot more than that recommended thirty minutes, lol!\n\nI play any games I am interested in, and have a group of friends I play coop games with that know I have issues so I need to take breaks and (likely) will not be top kills/damage etc. \n\nIf you are beyond using the normal standard controller, there are adaptive handicapable controllers now for PlayStation and Xbox.  :)\n\n#gamersunite Overwatch is my choice too, because certain characters like Moira, Winston, etc do not require accuracy. A doctor's prescription for video games. That is the dream! yes I play Mercy &amp; Torb and I do pretty well! The only games I find I do not do well in are fighters and difficult rhythm games-- ones that require dexterity and precise timing. Other than that, it does not affect me much. Using handheld devices such as a DS or PS vita can cause my hand to cramp after a while, so for my Vita I got some cheap handles to put on it. Still a little uncomfortable after long periods but much more manageable I do not have CMT but my boyfriend does. He (and I) have noticed that when he plays games, depending on the game, he is at a disadvantage. \n\nGames like PUBG or Apex Legends is something that he has trouble with since it is largely dependent on fast reflects which he is lacking due to his CMT. He plays fighting games and that seems to help his hands and reflexes. He uses a stick (not a controller) because since he has larger hands, the controller stresses his hands to the point they cramp and start hurting. He also plays MOBAs (sometimes) but I have noticed that his hands shake a lot when he plays, but it does not seem to affect his speed. \n\nHis CMT does affect how he plays but at the same thing, playing games helps his hand muscles not atrophy or whatnot. It has its advantages and disadvantages. Might be a bit late to the conversation, I just found this sub ((only been on for a few days)) but my wife has cmt and her and I play eso almost daily. Sometimes she has issues putting down the controller and has to pry her fingers open, but as far as I know, she Does not have any issues actually playing the game", "Have you gotten a vasectomy/hysterectomy? If you have, what was the process like?\n\nF20, 1A. I have been deeply concisering getting a hysterectomy and I believe this damn disease is reason enough for a doctor to approve but we all know how doctors can be. I have a plethora of other illnesses that back getting it done as well. \n\nSo, as someone with CMT, how was the process? Was it easy or hard to get approved? How has it been?", "Fatigue and CMT - really a thing? Fatigue is such a common symptom to many maladies. Heck just aging causes it in general.\n\nHow do we distinguish it is cmt related? I feel so drained almost every day after work, with or without exercise. And the weekends I have to push myself to do things. \n\nCould be so many things...I just wonder with this disease how much of an uphill battle we are fighting. When my fatigue and gait got to its worst, I actually had continual DKA from autoimmune diabetes. I would have caught it months sooner if it did not just feel like having CMT. I believe the difference is in how easily it is to feel tired. Regular aging is more about maybe not being able to do as much of xyz vs cmt which is even the simple stuff is tiring. I would also look into if its a side effect from your pain/nerve medications. If it is maybe ask for a stimulant to offset this Most of my friends have still wanted to socialise after work or college and despite a full packed week of work will want to do high energy packed weekends like going clubbing or hiking. To me that is the difference. I could not hike personally anyway but my point is they can do the same hours and mostly still often be able to do something quite strenuous (even cleaning the house) while I would be recovering from just office hours sitting.\n\nI do get long bouts of fatigue (tired within a couple of hours of waking) and then short bursts of energy though where I feel more capable though but it is very short lived. It is also weather related as the colder months my cramps and circulation is just much more extreme which throws everything out as I do not sleep as well. It most definitely is. There are days where I am tired - I work full time, I am a parent, etc... And there are days where I am TIRED. Bone-deep, cannot really function well, tired. Foot drop is worse, drop things more easily, cannot think well. Today is one of those days, as was yesterday. Lifting my arms hurt. And I am on the mild end of the spectrum. Yeah I have a 4 yr old. I feel terrible saying no to playtime. But interesting the association with foot drop. I will have to see if I notice that. Dropping things too...I hate that. I get scared of picking up my hot coffee! I am 46. Fatigue has been been my worst symptom since I was a teenager. One of the biggest challenges for me has been learning what my limits are. It does not take much to wear me out. I cannot tell.  Like idk if it is CMT fatigue or Im tired exactly like everyone else. Yeah the last couple winters have been brutal as the disease has progressed.  Ive found that warm baths really help with the cramps. I have been thinking about getting a heated blanket too. Hope that helps! I am 58. Have cmt type 2k. Can no longer sit all day. I need a nap. My hands hurt more from typing than they used to.  I f I walk with afos and forearm crutches more than a few blocks, I am done.  Now I use a scooter outside. I have to pace myself on weekends. I am having a hard time working at a desk job.", "Has Anyone Used Custom Orthotics or Shoe Inserts Hey everyone. I am looking to get some advice from people in the same boat as me. I have CMT1C which only really affects my ability to use my heels when I walk. So I count my lucky stars that it has not affected me more.\n\nI have had 3 surgeries on my feet to try and correct the situation which has worked for my left leg, but not my right. I have had my Achilles tendon lengthened a couple of times and bone spurs removed. My right foot has not gotten much better with the last surgery that I had back in May.\n\nThat brings me to reddit. I have recently been reading about people getting custom shoe inserts that help when they walk. I have tried putting different things in the back of my shoe like dr. sholl's, but since they are more made for comfort rather than mechanical use they tend to slip.\n\nIf you have had custom shoe inserts or orthotic devices that go into the shoe, or maybe even had custom shoes made/fitted for you, I would love to hear how it went (good or bad).", "Any CMT warriors here that are (were) musicians? Good day/night everyone. I am back again, and was wondering for pieces of wisdom from fellow friends here.\n\nIf you have been following my post, my partner has been struggling with extreme sadness due to his CMT. Aside from its physical effect on the body, he struggles more in the mind.\n\nNow, we talked a lot, and I always respect and support him in everyway I can.\n\nHe is a great musician during his early life (Bassist), he was in an active band, mostly playing music all his life and due to CMT, he can no longer play the Bass (for more than decades now).  And it pains me, and I know it pains him more, because he misses it. \n\nHe misses playing the Bass, to the point that it breaks his heart. Last night, it broke him again and I stood by him like always, but sometimes I feel like I have to say or do more for him. (I know being there to support and love him is enough, but is it really? Enlighten me please).\n\nI need some advices, maybe a similar experiences from you all please. Something or things that made you get by.\n\nor things that I should not/should say or do for him to help him feel better. I love him so much, and I would love every piece of token of advice from all of you. \n\nThank you so much!! \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude47\ud83d\ude47\n\n**TLDR**: Need advice/support. My partner can no long play the Bass, he misses it to the point that it breaks his heart. Well, I started on clarinet/sax, and moved to bass clarinet when fine motor got harder. I guess the advice of \"move to bigger instrument with less emphasis on fast playing\" is out the window if he is a bassist. Not to be that asshole that keeps saying \"you can do it\" when you know you cannot, but there is almost certainly some form of music he can still do, even if it just means looking at the slower pieces. I totally sympathise with him I used to play thrash metal lead guitar but now I can barely play for 5 minutes.\n\nI have been playing around with doing more vocal work as in my music genre a clean singing voice is not the most important thing and I still get to be involved in making the music that I love...I dont know if that is something that would interest him but I understand if not, I would give anything to play how I used to be able for just 1 day.\n\nGood luck to him and I hope he is ok Thank you so much, and fighting!! \ud83d\ude4f Thank you so much, Fighting! \ud83d\ude4f I will keep on supporting him no matter what. What about a double bass?  They are huge and perhaps the strings are further apart so easier to play or twang - I do not know but maybe.  He might like a go on one(?) see if he can do it. I use to play violin growing up. Then guitar and piano once I was unable to open my hands enough for violin. Now not really anything; cannot move/open my fingers like I need to. \n\nI do not always hate myself, but some days really do get to me; not being able to play the songs in my head. I think overall, that is what makes it so hard - having that passion, and having put in years of effort; knowing so, so well what you need to do to get that note out; feeling it in your bones; hearing the music you had played before with little effort; and it just being trapped at your fingertips. \n\nI have been creative; so when I could not play, I drew. I paint, and draw, and create when I have time. It is an outlet I have been able to adapt, and it stretches my fingers a little, so minimal cramps. I sing too. Not good, but gets the music out. \n\nLosing the ability to do something you love slowly, that hurts the most. Finding a similar outlet is hard when that could be lost too. The balance between trying to keep the strength to be independent, and needing that one thing to feel anything close to peace, or accomplishment, it is a fine line. I cannot/will not speak for everyone with CMT, just myself. But as myself, I will never get over losing my ability to do (whatever I have done/am doing/will do). But I will never, ever lose that feeling of a bow in my hand, and the notes I know damn well I can play, if I only could. Having CMT has made me never take for granted what I have, will, or am doing. (Sorry for the rant, lots of feelings.) Thank you so much for sharing your experience in here. I hope you and everyone else finds healing in time. I am glad you found an outlet for your creativity! Fighting! I hope your husband does too. Thank you so much! I am a musician. And I have had to adapt. I am a multi instrumentalist and singer. Things are getting harder but fortunately I play in bands where I write my own parts so I can make adjustments for what I cannot do. I play drums/percussion in one band and have had to pass off the bass drum to the bassist because I cannot do it anymore. Singing is getting harder and I have to warm up LOTS longer. I cannot hold a pic to play anymore so I just strum with my hand. My flute playing is much harder especially because of the dexterity in my pinky fingers and just general slowness. I am not sure if I have advice but one of the things we have to do when we have a disability is to adapt. You get what you get in life and no amount of upset about it will change it. What are you going to do about it? Wallow? Or figure it out. Does he have any hand dexterity? They are getting way better with midi bass sounds. Does he enjoy recording? If he is not interested in that then he is not interested. If you think about it there are so many people with a passion for sports who cannot do it any more. They move on, yes? I am not saying that it is not okay to be sad about it. But at some point you got to figure your life out. You only get one. Ours is one with CMT. Wishing that it was not that way does not really get us anywhere. And right now, it is not CMT that is completely killing my musical life. It is Covid. I have not gigged or rehearsed with my bands since mid March. I once saw a double bass player with only one hand. It was pretty incredible. Thank you so much for sharing your experience! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude47", "Thinking about SARMs  Hi there, recently Im thinking more and more about what it would be to use SARMs to improve my strength. Especially the strength of my calves and forearms. I have been working out for more than 3 years and I consider myself very knowledgeable in the fitness and nutrition industry. I have a push/pull/legs split and I workout 6 times a week. I notice that my legs (mostly lower legs) and forearms are falling behind. My balance is getting worse so walking is becoming harder. I wonder if using SARMs will improve my strength and the way I walk. Is it possible that the use of SARMs could improve the quality of my life? So it is very complicated, especially when you are only 18 and SARMs really are just anabolic steroids but legal.\n\nI will not go into any detail of them here, but I will say that with **my experience of exercising over 15 years:**\n\n* You will start to struggle to gain mass in some areas, and then soon you will plateau\n* Get bloodwork done to make sure you are healthy e.g. Testosterone is optimal\n* 6 times a week is too much. Bring it down to 4 times\n* Spend this time working on your diet and knowing how much of a calorie surplus you need to gain weight, and how much of a deficit with cardio you need to drop fat I pretty much agree with TB\\_Infidel on this. I suspect that you may be pushing too hard and would see more benefit from letting your body get more rest.\n\nMy suggestion would be to try to find a physical therapist knowledgable in neurological disorders and see if they can give you advice on how to optimally build muscle. \n\nI am a big believer in exercise for folks with CMT. I have seen significant improvements over the years since I started exercising regularly, with a program based off what I learned from a physical therapist. Ultimately, there is only so much exercise can do for you, with or without drugs that may have other side effects. \n\nYou cannot exercise your way out of having CMT impact your body; you can exercise to limit the impact it has and compensate for weakness. SARMS would not restore nerve impulses. \n\nCMT impacts some people harder and faster than others. You cannot base a workout routine on guides written for how fast healthy people should be able to progress. You have to learn to listen to your own body and work with its unique capabilities. Because CMT is so variable no one else is quite the same. Thanks for your answers guys. I already count my macros and I do not think that I will bring back my frequency of training in the week, I like working out too much for that. And with a hood split I think it is definitely possible too have enough rest. I will ask my neurologist about the use of SARMs. A neurologist should not give the sign-off on SARMs given the fact that as they are not approved drugs (either in, or failed, trial stages) therefore it is impossible to get pharmaceutical-grade SARMs. Using anabolic compounds at a young age can result in some serious side effects such as stunted growth which cannot be reversed. As most of the neurological damage of CMT seems to be done prior to puberty, and then later on in life, there should not a rush into using such compounds.  You know what cmt and SARMs are sir?   Several sarms are more potent than test. People say side effects of taking sarms are also less than those of using test. This also depends on the individual itself. I expect that taking sarms will improve my quality of life. I dont see myself taking sarms before my 20s. But I want to gain more knowledge about it.   Soooooo I can actually confirm Test is far, far better and safer than SARMs. The amount of people who get serve liver inflammation from SARMs is much higher than recorded until you speak to hospitals who are seeing a surge in younger men with liver issues.\n\nTest just gives you man tits if you are unlucky, and that can be easily dealt with. Are not your hormones fucked after using test? Yep, but they are almost as bad as SARMs. The whole \"SARMs dont recquire PCT\" is just absolutely rubbish. So if you have PCT at hand then you can do Test.", "Currently on my second round of serial casting. I hope it works well.  I have never heard of this. What is the purpose? It is most commonly used to stretch tight tendons and ligaments and put the foot in a more appropriate position. A couple examples are to correct club feet in babies and to stretch tight heel cords. My daughter gets this done yearly so well versed with how uncomfortable it can get! Wishing you a good second round, hopefully it brings you some relief. Thank you! My siblings and I had this done when we were around 5-years-old. Helped a lot to stretch our heel cords to stop us from walking on our toes. Do you feel like it makes a big difference as an adult? Last time I had this done, I was 6 years old. It has been 8 years since then and I feel like within those 8 years it has made a difference. The only issue was that it started to tighten again. Good luck! Hope you have a swift recovery! X", "I was diagnosed at age 3 and I still do not know what type They told me it is a \u201cpreviously unseen genetic mutation\u201d, but my father had it. No one in his family before him did though. I am a part-time wheelchair user and in constant pain. I know it is stupid but I just want to know what type of cmt I have. I hate not knowing. Have you checked with your doctor to see if there are new types that they can test you for now? There have been new types discovered and I am not sure how many have made it into commercial tests but if it has been 20 (or however many) years since your testing, they might be able to do better for you now. Maybe. I have not seen a neurologist in a while. I will look into that.", "Weird vibration feel in one of my feet So this started like three days ago and now I am extra worried. I was diagnosed with CMT since forever but besides medium-scale muscle weakness there were no symptoms. Well now I feel that one of my feet (the right one to be precise) constantly vibrates, especially near the fingers, and ocasionally I feel it slightly numb (I can still use it, but it feels weaker than the other). It is especially worse during the night. I have no sensory loss.. At least not yet.. However, it freaks me out a big time. Anyone has an idea what this might be? Thanks in advance. It is common for me to have phantom vibrations, but they usually last seconds, minutes, or maybe a couple of hours; I cannot recall ever having one last days. When I have them they do seem more noticeable when I am resting. Sometimes they seem to come on randomly, though often they happen after I have done something to exert my muscles. \n\nI do not really know what causes them. The ones I have do not seem to have done me any harm and I have been experiencing them for 20+ years. That is really all I know about them though. That is a bit comforting, thanks a lot I get this feeling as well, so at least you are not alone", "history of CMT severity in family Wanting to hear how similar everyone is progressive symptoms have been throughout life compared to their affected parent, siblings, cousins or even grandparents/great grandparents.....hoping that makes sense. Hi,\n\nSo given that there is a vast difference in every bodies version of cmt I will add a quick run down of my familiy.\n\nMy Grandfather always had \"funny feet\" but worked in a lot of physical based employment.\n\nMy Dad passed it along, he is doing ok, but given he is over 70 its still probably ok.  His wrists and fore arms are very skinny and his feet are a bit bad.  Foot drop and really bad balacne. but he still does his things and enjoys life.\n\nMy brother has what people would likely call mild.  Its there but no where as bad as my dad or myself.  If you looked it would be called a high arch.\n\nMy sister was certain she didnt have it as she had no expression of any symptoms, until half her kids showed up with it.  She has a mild case in her arms but no real cmt foot happening.\n\nMe, i got the worse dose in the family.  Even after some cool operations and what not, things are back to how they were if not slightly worse.   Foot drop, high arches, weak ankles, weak wrists, tremors, drop shit all the time, bad balance etc etc. Fun fun !  But my 90 pointing up toes are more like 45 pointing up toes, so less raptor more chicken :) My grandmother with CMT was very mildly effected and could still walk, though sometimes with a walker, into her 90s. My parent with CMT was somewhat worse and using a wheelchair by age 60 or so. My sibling is worse, and started using a wheelchair before 30. I am more like my grandmother, in my mid-40s and still walking miles every day, no AFOs or anything. \n\nI also have various aunts/uncles/cousins with CMT. They mostly land somewhere between my parent and my grandmother in severity. My sibling is clearly an outlier. However, it does make it pretty much impossible to predict severity solely from one's family member's severity. \n\nYou did not ask what type of CMT you were interested in; I have CMT1A personally. CMTX has its own severity pattern where men generally have worse severity than women. Basically various people in my family might have some mild symptoms but not enough that they even care to get tested for it. \n\nMine is to the point that if I have one more bad fall then I will probably need to start using some sort of walker at 26. Basically, there does not seem to be a good pattern in my family to follow. None; first generation \ud83d\ude15\nAlso severity is 100% random. It could be unnoticeable in one family member and crippling in another. It is very weird and unique like that. Interesting question. My grandma had severe CMT1E, my dad moderate, and so far at age 35 I think mine is very mild. I do not know if either of my 2 kids have it although my youngest is toe walking at age 3 which scares me. He is very active though and was riding a bike on 2 wheels at age 2. Would I notice any more significant signs if he had it severely?", "Partner with CMT My partner of nearly two years (21M) always ignored his disease. He has pencil thin legs, high arches in his feet, a very noticeable limp, and falls constantly. He kept getting injured from his falls so I researched what I thought his disease might be. I came across this disease CMT and pushed him to get an MRI and find out for sure. Today it was confirmed. He was officially diagnosed with CMT, and now we are trying to figure out how to live with this degenerative condition. Neither of us are close to our families, and we are both foreigners in this country (and the two of us are from different countries). There is... a lot going on... but the thing I am least prepared for is taking care of someone with a disability. I guess I am just looking for a community and some advice. It is good to get a diagnosis and know what you are dealing with, so good job on getting this far. The two of you might want to start with some of the basic information on the CMT Association's website: ( \n\nCMT is a slowly progressive condition. Now that he knows what he is dealing with, some physical therapy and/or some ankle braces (AFO typically, Ankle Foot Orthotics) might help to stabilize his walk so he can get around more efficiently and without falling. I am going to second physical therapy.   Its not about strength building, but staying limber.  He is still young and getting in a good exercise routine can help long term. Thanks for your replies! He is extremely optimistic and fairly limber. We are registering with the state to get disability recognition so that he can get decent leg braces. We tried some on today and he walks so much better! I was so happy to see it! But they are still too expensive without disability insurance, same with physical therapy. Bureaucracy right now is our biggest enemy. The sad thing about this disease is that it impacts everyone differently. I am 34 now and still walk without braces fine, so it is really hard to know how his will progress. It seems you have done well pushing him to seek help. I know it is definitely hard to admit you have a problem, especially one that there is no current cure for. And I cannot imagine how hard it is for you thinking about if you can care for someone for the rest of your life. I wish you all the best! Thank you so much &lt;3", "Anyone with medical knowledge know if this could help treat CMT if it turns out to be viable?  The short answer is no, this particular vein of research is not directly relevant to CMT. The vast majority of MS research is not despite the focus on myelination.\n\nHere is some detail on why: the central nervous system (CNS) has a different mechanism for myelination than the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS system is disrupted in MS and the PNS system is disrupted in CMT. The CNS uses oligodendrocytes to serve the same role that Schwann cells serve in the PNS. Although there are some similarities this treatment is trying to target the \"retinoid X receptor gamma\" which is heavily expressed in oligodendrocytes but not Schwann cells. \n\nIt can be depressing to realize that all the MS research does not directly help CMT folks (though there is always a possibility that something will cross over). However, I take comfort in knowing that the same lack of similarity means CMT never touches brain function or harms our mental abilities. Good post, and well said!\n\nJust to nitpick a little bit, there are some CMT genotypes that directly affect the CNS, such as CMTX1 for instance. There is also low expression of PMP22 in oligodendrocytes, however as far as I have been able to glean it seems like it is not translated there which could explain why there is no clear CNS involvement in 1A. However, there are some case reports of 1A and multiple sclerosis, where one hypothesis is that in some 1A patients the demyelination process somehow triggers an autoimmune reaction against CNS myelin leading to MS.\n\nI also remember that someone posted an article in here some time ago that described IIRC a gene therapy treatment for a CMT type with CNS involvement where the vector was injected intrathecally. Someone asked why this same treatment could not be used for other CMT types, and the answer is that target cell specificity is an unsolved problem in gene therapy, which makes it very difficult to deliver the payload to the right cells outside of the CNS. I suppose the silver lining in all this is that CMT researchers seems to be very alert about developments which might be relevant to CMT. For CMT 1A alone, the number of different pathways that I have have seen been proposed as possible targets for therapies in the literature is a high double digit number, and the pace just seems to increase year over year. In general though I am more in favor of approaches that aim to rectify the underlying cause as opposed to approaches that aim to compensate for the damage, though beggars cannot be choosers I suppose. Oh yes, I do sometimes get tunnel vision and focus just on type 1A without realizing it. I try not to, but it happens. \nIt makes sense that CNS treatments have less to worry about with regards to cell specificity, since they only have to deal with the cells that occur inside the blood/brain barrier. \nI feel like drug treatments are closer than gene therapies and so I tend to watch drug development news more closely. I am perfectly willing to be proved wrong if someone pulls off a gene therapy solution, though :)", "Energy varies with cmt2a I have cmt2a, diagnosis with DNA test. My physical energy can vary drastically from day to day or week to week like a roller coaster. I have gotten used to calling my weak days \"flare ups. \" It is a real pain in the butt when I need to get stuff done. Does anyone else experience this? How do you deal with it? I have read that a part of cmt2a has to do with how energy is produced (or not) with mitochondria within neurons.  Hello fellow 2!\n\nThat roller coaster can be managed by you keeping a diary (physical, digital, mental) of your activity and diet.   I am not anywhere near a diabetic diagnosis, yet managing sugars and starches while being honest with myself about exercise / activity really helped to avoid \"flare ups\".  \n\n", "Spasticity, AFO's, &amp; 10's Units I have reached a point where the spasticity in my lower legs and feet has become excruciatingly unbearable -  to the point I am often gasping for breath from the sheer pain. No amount of drugs or cocktails, or burning off nerve endings, or botox, or epidurals has been successful for any significant long term palliative relief from this ever present, mind-bending, soul-crushing pain. \n\nThe next step, no pun intended, is, custom bilateral hinged molded AFOs with dorsiflexion assist with custom foot bed.\n\nMy own idea is to combine the above AFO's with some kind of wearable, portable, 16 on, 8  off, super powerful bipedal 10's units that I would put on before getting out of bed every morning and take off before climbing into bed every night.\n\nDoes anyone know if such a thing exist? I am not talking about the 10's units that barely register a charge or units that really do not cooperate with clothing and living. I am talking about a unit that I would wear on a belt or something, where the wires would reach to the bottom of my feet and plenty of leads for feet and calves an be able to move with me as I go about my day under clothing or visible when I wear shorts. But something that would work for both legs and last 16 hours a day, 365 days.\n\nAnything at all?\n\nI have my first appointment with Penn Med CMT the end of May, depending upon Covid interruptus.\n\nAll I know is that after 15 years or horrible pain, and now at the age of 65, bordering on losing my ability to drive, becoming increasingly dependent upon others and moving very quickly to the point I will no longer be able to live in my 2 story home, alone, I am really questioning, where is this going and do I want to go there. It sounds really hard for you right now. I do not have advice, CMT friend, but stay brave. I hope you find solutions quickly for the pain and housing and stairs. I hope your dismay can be transformed into hope and even joy. When you say a 10s unit, may I assume you mean something like this?\n\n\nFirst a disclaimer - messing about with any medical device carries risk. You will find reluctance to DIY these things from professionals because of FDA regulation.\n\nThat being said, here is what I would try. Find a unit that by itself has the strength you want. Find one that is battery powered and rechargeable from a USB/phone type cable. Then lengthen the wires (so it reaches your legs) and get a USB power bank that people use to charge their phones (so it runs all day, may need 2 power packs and switch between them). There is not much special about the wires from the main device to the leads on the skin. Anyone with enough electrician skill to strip a wire and splice in a longer one can do that. The longer the wire the more the voltage drops, so the wire needs to be thick enough to not add lots of resistance. Suspect a speaker audio cable would work.\n\nI would be reluctant to modify the internals of the device or try to build one more powerful. Do not want you getting a zap powerful enough to impact your heart. You say you have tried all types of Drugs, just prescriptions? Or have you tried THC / CBD?\n\nI have had some pretty good results, but I do not believe my pain is anywhere near yours.  Yes, I tried both. Direct and indirect applications and combinations of topical and inhalation. I just do not know then, seem like you have tried just about everything \ud83d\ude14", "Dominant CMT Type 2D - Anyone Here? Apparently, this is what I am looking at. Well, one if the neuro muscular genetic anomalies at lest. At this point, my legs and feet and are pretty much gone. I am barely able to walk, cane required for short distances, a manual walker for anything more than a few yards. Just ordered a ( Probably returning it because I discovered too late it is one of the larger ones, not the more streamlined.\n\nSo, here is where I am. As of today, got the EMG on my arms. First one. Not good. The results are moderate to severe.\n\nI NEED to know, brutally, honestly, what I am facing. Currently, my fingers are 'sticky' and do not open or close fluidly. BUT I seem to be able to do most things. I have noticed I am more prone to dropping things or not able to grasp things the first time. I have not noticed any real symptoms in my arms.\n\nI need to know, with 2D will my arms and hands reach a point I where I will not be able to care for my own personal hygiene, or be dependent on others for much of everything.\n\nI am barely coming to grips with the loss of my legs. If my hands and arms go, well, it is time for me to go before they do.\n\nSo, who knows about CMT and arms and hands?\nPlease be brutally honest. \n\nThanks I do not know as much about type 2 as I do about type 1 and less about 2D in particular so hopefully someone else with more experience can address this. \n\nIn general, CMT is slowly progressive. There is a lot of variety from person to person in terms of how severe symptoms get but a person's early life can give a reasonable guide to predicting how their symptoms will develop. You may be in a position where a doctor experienced with CMT could assess you individually and give you a fairly solid answer. If you live in the USA perhaps a visit to one of the CMT Centers of Excellence could help you figure out where you are going from here. \n\nI also suggest that if you can find a physical therapist who is experienced with neurological problems they might be able to help you slow your progression or even improve some abilities a bit. I was in my mid-30s when I first saw a physical therapist and her advice allowed me to improve my own situation. \n\nThere are people here at all levels of ability and disability who know what you are going through. Maybe someone else can offer more specific advice. So I have 2D as well but alas I am still very young so I have not had time for mine to get so bad but unlike you I have always had symptoms in my hands and arms. I go to an occupational therapist every week to try and stave off the effects (which I really recommend it helps a lot) I wear a hand brace at night to help with the clawing. I am not sure what will happen to you but stay strong and get to help you need to keep yourself up and running Thank you for the info. I have not heard of or seen a hand brace. I would like to see one. Can you link me to one?\n\nMy hand and fingers are always the most painful and least responsive after a night of sleep. If you are experiencing these effects at your age, I am kind of scared where I may be and how much time I have before I can not care for myself.\n\nFYI, I will 66 in September.\n\nI have scheduled appointments with University of Penn, waited 6 months for that appointment. About 2 weeks prior to the May 27th appointment I received a call telling me I had been, in my words, \"CoVided\" which means, sucks to be you! After waiting 6 months to see the ONE specialist at the CMT center of excellence, I was told, now you get to wait ANOTHER 6 months, or 7 maybe 8! Thanks to CoVid.\n\nI have been going to an excellent P.T. but he has little knowledge let alone experience with CMT. I am his first patient and he has been in the biz for about 25 years. So, not much CMT help with PT I do not know much about 2D, but a quick glance at ( study with 20 CMT2D patients provides the following statements:\n\n*\"Severe hand and leg involvement with gross peroneal and calf muscle atrophy was   observed   in (...) six CMT2D patients, all but one older males with mean duration of illness 32 years. Each patient with the CMT2D-like phenotype developed moderate reduction of  the perception of pain, touch, temperature, position and vibration in the feet and mild sensory deficits in the hands.\"*\n\nSo 6/20, or 30% developed severe hand involvement, and the majority of these were older people who have had the illness for many decades. There seems to be some other novel mutations described in the literature that also leads to the CMT2D phenotype that where not included in this study. If you know exactly what mutation(s) you have, that can help you find more relevant information because you can then look at studies that describe your exact mutation(s).\n\nFurthermore:\n\n*\"Although  the disease was slowly progressive, the majority of patients functioned independently up to 40 years after the disease onset. Only five patients needed support for ambulation.\"*\n\nIf you want I can try to do a more extensive literature search tomorrow. I can also send you a copy of this paper if you want to read it. At any rate this is definitely something you should ask your neurologist/genetic counselor about, because they know exactly what kind of genetic mutation(s) you have and will be able to give you the best sense of what to expect. \n\nThe braces that I have were made by my occupational therapist not very long ago and in just a few days of wearing them I could see and feel a difference in stiffness in my hands. Im only 16 so it might have less of an effect on you. If/when you get braces you have to be very careful that they do not feed into your claw like ones I had before. Its best for them to keep your fingers straight. PT has helped me a lot with general strength but going to an occupational therapist has really helped with pain and weakness in my hands. Thanks so much for this information. I checked the link, copied a few lines of the quoted text but they did not come up when doing a search on the linked page. Please! Yes, I would like to read this and more. You sound like you have an extensive background in the medical field?\n\nThe neurologist is totally absent. She is not any real help. All she says is see a CMT specialist and I keep telling her I am on the appointment list but keep getting bounced due to CoVid. Thank you for the pics. much appreciated. I will definitely check with the therapist on hand braces. Every thing that will help with delaying the inevitable is fair game. The quoted text appears in the full article; the link given went just to the abstract of the article. The full text is here:  ( Thank for the response. My early years were all about pain. First thing I felt in the morning before really waking, last thing I felt before finally falling asleep. The pain was ALWAYS blamed on my really really flat feet. CMT was never ever considered, neither was anything else. After years, just learn to accept it and believe everyone feels this way. Do not really know any difference.\n\nI will be 66 in a few months and the first really debilitating signs finally showed up in my late 40's early 50's to the point I had to stop work. Even then the diagnosis was Idiopathic neuropathy. And several iterations and variations thereof.\n\nThe diagnosis was finally made via genetic testing August 2019. Made and appointment with University of Penn, CMT center of excellence. That was a SIX month wait. When that appointment was a few weeks away I received a call telling me I had been CoVided. My term. In other words, sucks to be you, wait another 6, 7,8 months, i.e. December 2020, Jan, Feb 2021. All because of CoVid. No neurologist at the largest hospital system here in the state will even seem me. All saying CoVid. CoVid. CoVid.\n\nIt has been one year and STILL have not been able to see anyone and any of the CMT Center's of Excellence. Thanks! &gt; If you want I can try to do a more extensive literature search tomorrow.\n\nYES! PLEASE!\n\nI am having a very difficult time focusing and accomplishing almost anything. I will be 66 in a few weeks. Live alone. I have barely come to terms with the reality that I have just about lost the use of legs and feet. Only a short time away from full time wheelchair. \n\nI live in a 2 story home, all bedrooms and full baths are upstairs, half bath downstairs. I will have to live downstairs permanently with no way to get upstairs to my bedroom or the shower. The downstairs 1/2 bath, sink and toilet, is small, about 3' wide x 6' long, and the door opening, about 25\", is not wide enough for a wheelchair.\n\n\n\n&gt;If you know exactly what mutation(s) you have, that can help you find more relevant information because you can then look at studies that describe your exact mutation(s).\n\nPer the genetic test results summary page:\nThree variant of uncertain clinical significance were seen:\n\nDST C 5878T&gt;C (p. Ser1960Pro) recessive/dominant hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 6\n\nGARS c. 1694T&gt;A (p.Leu565Gln) dominant CMT type 2D\n\nSLC5A7 c. 1642C&gt;T (p. Arg548*) dominant distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 7\n\n\nRegarding the third variant, the genetic counselor wrote:\n\nExcerpt: \n\n\"... . We discussed our particular concern regarding the SLC5A7 variant. .... Vocal cord paresis has been reported in this condition.\n\nYes! Please! Whatever info you, or anyone can provide, PLEASE DO SO! I am a totally filled with anxiety and unable to concentrate or focus. I have tried looking up these variants. Comprehension let alone understanding and grasping the information is beyond me at this point. \n\nThank you, anyone, that can help as I struggle to come to terms with this all means. Hey. Sorry for not posting anything sooner, I have not forgotten though! I have been diving into the literature, but CMT2D turned out to be a bit more complex than I had thought because there are a lot of different CMT-causing GARS mutations. Now that you have posted the exact mutation it narrows things down though, but unfortunately it narrows it down a bit too much as this specific mutation is not described in the literature at all. In fact it seems like all of these mutations are undescribed in the literature. In many cases when a novel mutation that lead to a CMT phenotype is found it will be described in the literature, and then when the same mutation is later detected in other patients, it will be possible to look up these studies and see how the mutation affected the people who where previously described. If no such studies have been made however, it becomes much harder to make accurate predictions about what someone with the mutation can expect. In such cases it is possible to see if other mutations in the same gene have been described, and if they have and they are similar it might be possible to infer a little bit from these. It seems to me that this might be what the genetic counselor have done with the SLC5A7 mutation as the one that is associated with vocal cord paresis is not the exact same as yours, though the effect of the mutation in the expressed protein is probably similar. I read the study that is the source for the claim of vocal cord involvement but it did not go into much detail so I am a bit confused about the exact mechanism they believe are involved in that, I am going to have to read it again. Another complicating factor in your case is that you have three different mutations, there may or may not be clinical overlap between them and they might affect each other. I really think you should push for a follow up consultation with your genetic counselor once the Covid-19 situation allows for it. A genetic counselor should be able to answer your questions much better than I can, especially in your case because it is a difficult one. Even when there is a lack of good data to lean upon it is often possible for trained professionals to make educated assumptions. I am not qualified to do that but both a neurologist and a genetic counselor is. I highly recommend that you write down a list of questions and concerns that you have in advance, I have found that to be very helpful my self when consulting with medical professionals as it is very easy to forget things when you are actually there. I wish I could give better answers than this but I hope it is at least something. I will post later when I have finished diving into the literature, though because none of it is likely to be about your specific variants interpreting it is going to be a challenge.", "CMT and Cannabis I have CMT 1A and recently started taking edibles to help sleep. I also noticed it helps with pain relief but makes my legs twitch a lot. Anyone else with CMT take THC/CBD? If so, how has it benefit you, or has it made things worse? What are some other things you have noticed? I do not have personal experience but you can find previous discussions on this topic if you search for \"Cannabis for CMT\" and \"CMT and weed\" and \"CBD and CMT\" Yes - I would say cannabis helped me tremendously- especially to get out of the depression CMT causes, however I used it too much and developed a condition called CHS that caused extreme stomach pain and I can no longer use it.\n\nIt really allowed my muscles room to relax, separate in a way from the mind, to recover and I actually felt a lot more feed back from my overworked muscles and that allowed me to get them to rest.  I miss being able to use cannabis medically.", "Significant Improvement My previous 4 posts were removed by the mods. I made a new Reddit account so maybe that is the reason? I also contacted the Reddit moderators but had zero response so most likely this will be removed to. Either way, it is still worth a shot because I know this post will help people. Listed below is a method that worked for ME. By no means am I saying it will be success for YOU. You do not need to try this method. I am simply informing the community what works for ME and only ME. Okay now that that is out of the way. Let us try this again...\n\nObviously it is a mild case but it used to impact nearly everything I did. I could not run on a treadmill more than 5 minutes. I used to kick my legs into each other when I would walk, jog or run. When I would jump, my legs were bowed out and my vertical leap was pathetic. I was known for being a slow runner growing up. When I would play baseball I would always hit the ball to the left side of the field because the outer part of my left foot would go in that direction (I bat right-handed). I essentially would \"roll my ankle\" outward every time my left foot in the ground. My calluses were so bad growing up that I had close to zero feeling at the bottom of the foot. I also had toenail and skin issues as seen in the images below (sorry). I have been using footpads that stick to my foot for nearly 5 years now. All of the issues I listed have been resolved. I am now transitioning off of them by doing exercise video workouts to strengthen the outer part of my left foot. I also have it in the right foot but not nearly as bad so it used to force my whole body to shift to the left when I walked. I will be updating this post periodically to share what I did to correct it. I cannot believe there are not more posts about this condition but I am excited to share my experience because I am certain there are more people out there who would benefit from this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\nOriginal concept before I knew about the footpads.

It has been 15 days since the moderators of this sub have received a message from any user so unless your attempt to contact us was over 2 weeks ago, you have not succeeded in sending a message to the mods here. \n\nThere have been no posts removed by the mods in this sub in over 2 weeks. \n\nI am curious what you did to see these improvements, but your post is very unclear. Exercises? Custom insoles? A combination of the two? It does seem that you had a post removed from the r/podiatry sub. Subreddits are completely independent. Their mods are not our mods and their rules are not our rules. Your situation makes more sense now. \n\nI notice, in reading through your history that you do not mention ever being diagnosed with CMT. Have you talked to a doctor about why you have pes cavus? CMT is certainly a cause of pes cavus but I cannot tell from your post if it is actually the cause of \\*your\\* pes cavus. \n\nPlease respond by replying to this post and not editing your original post. I have not been diagnosed but I have been reading about CMT and I am hoping to learn more. I have symptoms of a neurological condition but if I were to see a neurologist I worry about what the bill would look like (I live in the US). My entire life I have had constant tremors in my hands and at times I cannot even hold a pencil. I have a sacral dimple which is probably not a big a deal. My short-term memory loss is scary at times. My energy levels vary significantly day to day. I cannot wear hooded sweatshirts because my shoulders get very sore and wearing anything on my head (even if it is very loose) causes severe migraines and nausea. When I went through school, I had a difficult time staying awake so I would go to the bathroom and sleep and then have to teach myself the entire lesson when I get home. My father has all of this too, in addition to the pes cavus foot. I do not know who to talk to about all of this but would love some advice. I have to say that I do not think CMT would explain all your symptoms. \n\nThe human nervous system is divided into two parts, the Central and Peripheral. CMT is a disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Some of your symptoms, like migraines and memory loss, are central nervous system problems. \n\nIt is possible that you have two different things going on but since you and your father both have these symptoms it seems likely to me (though I am not a doctor) that they are indicating a disorder other than CMT. \n\nThe symptoms that you have which are not clearly central nervous system problems are problems that could be caused by either a central nervous system problem or a peripheral nervous system problem--tremors, for instance, can originate in the brain or they can be a problem with the peripheral \"wiring\" of the body. \n\nUnfortunately, I do not know what could be causing your problems. As a fellow American I fully understand your wariness of a neurologist bill but I think either you or your father will need to see a specialist to get a diagnosis. This is all very helpful - thank you so much! I am going to do some more research and then I will follow up with my PCP and finally try to get some answers. I really appreciate the way everyone is responding here. The foot pain is gone and that is really all I wanted. However, the constant self-doubt of whether or not this is all in my head or actually happening has not been easy to deal with. Thanks again for being open minded and not just calling me \u201ccrazy.\u201d I am glad you are going to look for answers. I hope your doctor can pin down a diagnosis for you without too much trouble. \n\nCMT is a rare and invisible illness so I think a lot of people here have had a similar journey in finding the right diagnosis. We are fortunate that genetic tests have taken most of the uncertainty out of the \"is this really what I have?\" question for CMT. Whatever is causing your problems, while I think it is likely to be something other than CMT, the journey is much the same. I hope you find answers which help.", "Personal progression of the condition - thoughts and experiences. I do not mean the variation from person to person (although clearly important);I mean you do not get it and **bang** there you are that is how you are and what you have to deal with, it/you changes / progresses as you age, and the degree of that change/ progression is unknowable in advance by anybody. I have found a few times over the years, it is felt like my hands have aged 5 years in 1 and that realisation is difficult to deal with.\n\nI think the progression element of the condition is oft mentioned but rarely elaborated on; I know from experience it is one thing to go about saying I have a progressive condition, it is another thing entirely when you realise it has actually progressed and is affecting you more. It is somehow de-personalised and it is incredibly personal.\n\nI stuck this as a response to another post and it is the best I have been able to articulate this odd point - any body else?  Please just speak your piece. I feel you. 30 years old here, I was climbing mountains and running races in my 20s, then slowly, I started losing strength and balance, getting injured, having cramps and twitches. You know it is going to happen but when it does, it makes you realize it is never going to stop, that you are going to keep slowly losing function, and it is hard for me to feel resentful. The treatments in development are keeping me hopeful though. I dunno if I am being overly dramatic or even truthful with myself as I cannot really remember what my personal thoughts or feelings were before I was told of this but after my spinal laminectomy which revealed a slower nerve transmission speed at around half normal that being enough to diagnose me with Charcot Marie Tooth it is like the fire that raged inside me to strive to be stronger and better than the person I was the previous days(I was a frequent gym goer for 3 years) has never been quite as bright. I have never felt the same since then, every day I am conscious of my weird walking and everyday I know why it is like that and I wonder what state I will be in a year, in several years. I used to just think it was an old surgery I was supposed to get done at 18 to sort my right foot now it is a condition that is going to continue to get worse and I just cannot re light that old fire, it is never as strong as my old determination it is kind of like I am just constantly falling like I will hit the ground get back up take a few steps before the floor gives way and I am falling again.\n\nSorry about the rant I know that is not really what you asked but it is how my physce has at least progressed. I hope one day I can get back into that Zone but I find it so hard to be sound of mind when I am not sound of body. Really REALLY does not help that I am on the freaking Autism spectrum too I hate hate hate leaving anything up to ambiguity and this condition is pretty nebulous with how it can progress. How is anyone supposed to be ok with being told 'you could be fine at 50 or wheelchair bound at 40'?  I am sorry you had to sit with that thought, I think it exactly typifies what we as CMTers have to mulch through or minds and somehow take account of everyday.  It is a heavy mental burden even if it is not manifested physically, we can definitely all help each other with this. what have you done to slow the progression? I am only 20 and I already go through chronic pain probably outside of CMT. I have not ran since I was 12. I do not see the point tbh. Yep. I never really realise there is progression since it is so subtle/gradual. But then one day something happens like a particularly stupid stumble/trip, struggle with typing etc, and it is very much that \"bang\" you speak of. So for about 10 years I was going to the gym hoping that would help, but no matter what I tried, I could not seem to progress. Turns out, this is a known symptom of any muscular neuropathy but the doctors do not seem to be bothered enough, or educated enough, to tell their patients. That whole mantra of simply stay active, it will help? It is complete bullshit for a lot of people with CMT. \n\nAfter finding out that bit of info, I looked into ways of improving muscle gains and after a lot of research and testing, I landed on using SARMS (MK-2866 and LGD-4033) which i have now tried and have had significant improvements to muscle strength in my legs and everywhere else. However, the caveat is that SARMS improve hypertrophy, but CMT causes fatty atrophy, reducing muscle fibers which no amount of exercise can solve, even if you were on steroids. That is where I am going to start giving MK-677 a try as that significantly increases IGF-1 which can induce muscular hyperlasia. If it does, then a combination of SARMS and MK-677 could potentially negate the muscle wasting aspect of the disease. It does not solve the degradation of the nerves, but could effectively prevent the weakness that usually comes along with it.", "where and how to get genetically tested Hey, 27 year old male with CMT (not sure which one).  I have had numerous reconstructive bi-lateral feet surgeries to correct the gait issues (which have caused their own).  \n\nI was wondering where can I get my blood tested to find out which CMT i have?  What is the test name?  Is there any relevant information I should know prior to getting it done?  \nI was tested a young kid but I have no idea where that paper work is.\n\nOn a side note, I am a strength and conditioning coach currently doing my masters course work in sports science and sports nutirtion.  I train individuals for almost anything and I constantly push myself to try and grow... but the CMT makes that quite difficult.  Keep fighting everyone!", "Pressing L3 button on PlayStation controller Wierd issue, I know!\n\nWhen I play Grand Theft Auto on my PlayStation, I cannot use \u201cspecial ability\u201d activated by pressing the L3 buttons on the controller. My thumbs are too weak to press these since they have to be pressed from a certain angle.\n\nIt sucks a bit - I mean, I will live without it, but I cannot play Trevor in his special beast-mode, which is kind of a bummer \ud83d\ude01\n\nDo any of you have this issue?\nIs there a way to move the command to other keys?\n\nHope you have a good day. If you want to drop some money you can get a custom controller with programmable paddles. You press them with your fingers on the back. That would be perfect. It is not something you can programme on the original controller? Actually I just looked it up. You can indeed buy back buttons that plug into the dualshock port Wow, that was easy. Thanks very much! Time to go crazy in Sandy Shores \ud83d\ude01 Have fun! Do not do **too** much murder! Put your thumb on the stick and then press it into your chest until it goes down. It may be a bit clunky but you will press the button while keeping both hands on the controller.\n\nYou can do it on your knee as well if you are bent forward.  I used to have problems like this when playing too much COD and needing to hit r3 to run. I am part of the fabled \"gaming couple\" lol\nI get my boyfriend to press it when I cannot.\nOther than that I can usually screw around with in game controls to reassign to something that works", "What are some good ways or products to help rest your feet/body? I work on my feet all day and have been working even more lately; so my whole body (but mostly feet) have just been so exhausted. And when I lay down or even sit for an extended period of time, when I stand back up it feels like I am stepping into rusty nails. So honestly even taking a nap or laying on the couch just reminds me of that inevitable pain. I have seen some of those water foot massager things, has anyone used those? Or are there any other products you recommend? Is it from calluses? Because I know my calluses cause my feet to feel like they are on fire. If so get a pumice stone, if they are really bad maybe go to a podiatrist or get a pedicure to get them shaved. No, I do not have any calluses. But thank you for the idea! Water foot massager works well for me, and they are pretty cheap. I think mine was $20. I think water is better if you have callouses, a normal foot massager is probably better if not. I also have edema, which I do not think is that common with CMT. Do you have AFOs? That helped the pain in my feet immensely. I also take daily hot baths or sit in the hot tub at my local swimming pool to help my whole body relax. I also often put a heating pad around my feet ankles as I watch a show in bed I have heated leg/feet compressors (Amazon) and they were a gift from God", "Cmt in hands/fingers Hello everyone, 25 y/o female here, cannot really remember what type of cmt I have probably cmt1A idk it is been a long time since I have seen a specialist.\n\n***Was wondering if anyone here can share their experience of how cmt developed in your hands?***\n\nPersonal rant: since it happens later on I would not say mine are much affected yet. But 30 is not too far away and I know I will be seeing worse progression here soon. Today I cried bc I realized something I did not notice before with my left hand, which is understandable since I am right handed, but I noticed I am losing finger control/movement range in my left pointer finger. I have always had poor finger control with my left pinky(had to play with 3 fingers w/ guitar hero lol) but I only recently realized it is probably bc of cmt. I cried bc I am scared of it progressing and I am in computer programming field and like to play videogames so I am afraid in my 30's those things will be harder to do. I have always been so focused on my lower extremities I never really anticipated the complications that affect upper extremities later on. Idk mad me sad today:( It is definitely something you got to adjust to. I am 24 and kind of rage quit playing guitar 5ish years ago because I could not play to the level I wanted to. It did get me more into digital music production tho, but still takes me longer than the average person to pump out a song due to me not being able to play piano well because of my poor hand dexterity. \n\nThe only advice I really have is to stretch, stretch, and more stretching! This disease is frustrating as hell sometimes. It makes me have to work harder at everything, but that in turn makes me better at the things I really care about even if I have to approach it differently. \n\nDo not worry too much about it girl! Look up some hand stretches and make sure to do them at least once a day for 10-15 minutes and you will start seeing results! I am 22 so cannot say much about myself, but it differs for everyone. My grandfather had really slight issues with his hands, he essentially worked as a mechanic his entire life, but then again his feet were not badly affected either. My mother shares his feet but oddly enough her hands have a tremor which although not deal-breaking, is pretty visible. She can still play the guitar and do all the things a mom does, though not as good. She is 52 now. As for me, I am largely asymptomatic at 22, I can walk for kilometers with little issues and my hands are almost normal.. No AFOs, no nothing. So I share your health concerns..\n\nThe answer to your questions unfortunately is none. At the moment, no one can predict the course of this disease. From studies, demyelination does not result in loss of function(for reference, I was told I had severe nerve impairment in my legs), secondary axonal loss do, and apparently there are some yet unknown factors which contribute to this, either genetic-related or lifestyle-related. So basically no test will give you an answer. Try to maintain some stretches in your routine and eat plenty of B vitamin supplements (those are good for nervous system in general)\n\nSorry I cannot answer. It sure does suck having to live with a disease no one can predict. I am persistently anxious too. Wish you well I have had those same thoughts and concerns. My hands are the money makers. Are you in the US? Your employer will make accommodations (required by law) for you. That could look like reduced workload due to slower typing? Or special keyboards or adaptive equipment. The future is going to be so cool. We will all have adaptive tech. You probably will be able to type with your mind soon. I am exaggerating a bit obviously but I really do believe the tech in the next 5 to 10 years will solve your problem. Fellow three finger guitar hero jammer here, no shame in that! \n\nI am 32 with CMT 1A and have gone through exactly what you are experiencing, along with similar interests and hobbies. I will try to be brief, though I would be happy to expand if you would like. \n\nIve noticed a decline in my dexterity over the past couple of years with my hands. Little things caught me off guard that I noticed I could not do any more like pushing remote control buttons with my index finger. Then it was a limited range of motion with typing on a keyboard, difficulty holding certain objects, etc. My right hand is worse than my left now, but the debilitation does not emotionally effect me as much at this point. I like to think of it as playing life on a higher difficulty. \n\nAside from my experiences, it is important to know that all of us progress differently with CMT. You may never encounter the difficulty I currently experience. Hopefully you do not! I will say that I have learned to adapt doing things I enjoy. I can still play games, even if I cannot use the controller that well. I can still type faster than a lot of people, and I do not use half the fingers you are supposed to. Adapting to changes  positively will get you far with CMT. Yeah it sucks, but you are beating this game of life with a higher difficulty modifier. Hi. Do you mind sharing what hand stretches you do? I remember losing the ability to snap my fingers in my 20's and later I noticed I could not touch my thumb to my pinkie. Today at 56 I am unable to grasp anything and I drop things constantly. Losing my hands sucks. Hi, I am wondering, can you \"feel\" your nerve as you use that hand? We are considering getting surgery for my wife's hand bc she said she feels like the nerve is being hurt when she moves her hand. She also suffers this same hand weakness. I know it is hard to say person to person but, do you have this feeling, and you think it is just natural CMT progression / no point getting surgery? Mostly just do yoga, specifically sun salutation. A lot of those poses open up the wrist area like crazy. I also randomly stretch throughout the day when I am feeling cramped. Idk what they are called, but I flatten my hand, grab my fingers, and pull them back towards my elbow  I do not think I feel what your wife is describing. It could very well be she has a different type of CMT than I do, and I am not experiencing it. \n\nThe best thing I can say for her is to work with a neurologist on this. My mother had corrective surgery on her foot that was not very effective. On the other hand, surgery may be exactly the thing that could help. \n\nThe hand weakness is definitely natural progression, however. There are clinical trials underway to help with this so in the future this may not be an issue! Thank you so much \ud83d\ude00 That is awesome to hear \ud83d\ude00 do you have any more info about these trials? Where did you hear about them? I heard about them on this subreddit actually. You can read more about the trial here:  Thank you!!!! that is true, with videogames i thought about how vr isnt very finger intensive and more about hand and arm motion you are right there, stretching is super important for cmt...... i am so bad with consistency in everything though ;-;  \ni will say i have been doing alright with doing at least a few important stretches every other day the last 5ish years basically after losing that teen energy and realizing i need to take better care of my body i try and be good about posture too, use to do yoga a lot more so i should get back into that i still remember the sun salutation routine. i remember when i took yoga classes in college(oh the anxiety of showing my bare feet in a class of 15) i noticed a legitimate improvement in my balance which was awesome. thank you for the b vitamin tip!! heck yeah i feel you i can type pretty well and just realized i dont even use my pinkies at all when i type..... never really noticed before or at least thought i did for the enter and caps lock keys but guess not xD so you are right i guess we really do just learn to adjust and overcome!  \n\n\ni feel like i will definitely be at your point around 30 as i already am in the \"baby stage\" of all those conditions. i can press buttons on a remote control with my index fingers but when it comes to things like pressing down on those types of lighters with the \"trigger\" i cant even do it correctly i have to use both hands same with triggers on certain pistols like my .357 magnum i have to use 2 fingers which is ridiculous with a gun but whatever \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\ni wish i could have an attitude more like yours about it though as the problems i have faced with cmt has definitely affected me emotionally/psychologically and everyday is a struggle tbh since i have it pretty bad in my feet and dont have good healthcare and no family near me, nobody in my family really \"has it\" anyways i think it came from my moms side is what the doctor said when i was a kid but nobody on her side shows any symptoms so its always been something i have faced alone. I am sorry you have to suffer like that:(  \nDoes it affect only your hands or your feet too? My outlook on it has not always been this way, and I can sympathize with what you are going through. I have only recently begun to come to terms with my condition, after lots of inner turmoil. I realized getting angry with the situation was not helping, and living with a \u2018victim\u2019 mentality was making it worse. There is no magic way to get past this stage, but time will help you adjust. With time comes wisdom, as cheesy as it sounds. \n\nIt also helps to be patient when explaining your difficulties to your loved ones. Most people take walking and using their hands for granted, and it is hard for them to put themselves in a position to emphasize.\n\nThis sub is full of people willing to help and going through similar situations. I am sure if you reach a point where you need someone who understands the group here would be happy to help. You are never alone in this. You are welcome! I had a mostly carnivorous diet my entire life so I always had good B6/B12 levels, and my progression seems to stay in place for now. I cannot guarantee it contributed but at least I am trying something I am 24 and have noticed a lot of shaking/tremors in my hands and fingers over the last 3 years. I am going to go in the medical field and I k ow you need a steady hand for stuff so it kind of sucks that my hands started doing this.", "Foot Embarrassment First of all I would love to thank all of you for accepting me a lowly HNPP I know it seems weird to say but I feel even more weird because I cannot find a lot of HNPP stuff. Anyways due to my HNPP I guess I have an acquired form of CMT and its very specific with my feet. Because of it I have very few shoe options that feel okay for me to wear. On a day to day basis the only shoe that seems to do the trick is an old navy flip flop anyways I digress. Because of my foot situation I have weird looking feet especially my left side that has bad nails and skin etc.. Does anyone else get extremely self conscious about their feet like I do when I am in a situation where I know I am going to be looked at? I know my toes curl a little and I am okay with that but the skin and nail stuff makes me feel so bad about myself. At this point my feet are so deformed from the surgeries that were done that I just do not care. It is a thing I live with and I have far more important things to worry about than other people's opinions on scars. I recommend this place to everyone because they have a ton of options when it comes to shoes.  There is plenty of sneakers and sandals, as well as dress shoes that are able to be ordered in sizes that allow for afo\u2019s or for other conditions.  They are not cheap I know\u2014but to be able to buy something that will last a while, not stick out as an orthopedic shoe, plus be comfortable should hopefully make them be worth the cost!\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n It is important to wear something comfortable on your feet. Perhaps a podiatrist could help. I just saw one for the first time last year and she was great. My own toenails get weird and she helped me get them looking better. Contact a pedorthist. They can help find the right shoe to support your feet and also may know of places to shop for shoes that specialize in folks with different needs, so you will just be another customer to satisfy in their eyes. Good luck! Its definitely hard to find good comfortable shoes. Things I used to wear I cannot really anymore because either I am not used it anymore or my feet have kind of changed. Lol I cannot wear flip flops at all. They like do not stay on. I definitely do get embarrassed mostly because of my ankles and like the way I walk sometimes. It is not super noticeable but I do walk weird if I get like tired. Ive been wearing the same pair of shoes over a year because they just work with my feet.  Theyre starting to fall apart but I wear them everywhere.  Ive simply had to accept I have to wear what is comfy and if anyone cares theyre not someone I really care to be around anyway.  When I go out I know someone in their weekend clothes will look at me like I have no sense of style, I just dont have an option to care what they think. Hi- I recommend (if you can afford to) visiting a chiropodist to keep your nails and hard skin in condition for you. Do not attempt to cut off your hard skin yourself if you have limited sensation. For fungal nail infections you can get medication and use tea tree oil on it every day. It takes time but will keep infections at bay. For shoes, you would be best to get some custom insoles made (again if/ when you can afford to). Skechers shoes are marvellous (memory foam ones rather than the foam). I recommend them highly and you can get them cheaper on places like amazon or eBay. My feet get so sore after even short walks and these are so light it helps. It does not eliminate problems but finding the right shoes will help. You can also get medicated toenail paints if you are embarrassed by the colour. Good luck and PM if you ever need advice. That is the right attitude. It is your body not theirs. Everyone has something they are insecure about but somethings outweigh the downsides. Hopefully you do not have to have any more surgeries. Best wishes Fatigue can take us from walking like a \u2018normal\u2019 to a drunk in a matter of minutes aye! My dad\u2019s the same with flip flops. They make him trip even more. Skechers memory foam shoes are great for lightness and taking pressure off.", "Raising awareness in my small town.  Well done and two thumbs up from me!

I am a 22M who also has narcolepsy type 1 since age 10.\n\nI have been having weird muscle cramps and inability to put on muscle on my arms and calves no matter what. I am really into weight lifting and nutrition for years so I knew something was off as I was seeing my chest and some other muscles grow but my arms and calves would be forever stuck. I also been having many foot, tibial, forearm and shoulder injuries for years. I also feel like my tibial muscles give up after long distances running, and my feet and hands are always crazy cold. \n\nI have been ignoring those cramps and symptoms for years cause you know, narcolepsy seemed enough of a punishment. But they found that my arms and legs nerves are not working properly by accident. Let me explain this. I had a shoulder injury which ended up on my posterior delt atrophying, that did not seemed normal and a EMG was done. I received the results yesterday and they are going to refer me to neurology. They asked about family members with issues with walking, high arched feet, walking on their tiptoes... \n\nMy mother has high arched feet and she is been having the symptom of her tibial muscles giving up after waking long distances too, my grandfather also had skinny arms and legs, and by his last years of life he could not walk short-mid distances, he died at age 77 because of covid, he was also alcoholic... None of them gave any importance to those symptoms. Also, my brother who is 19 does not have any symptom now but he is been walking on his tiptoes for MANY years during his childhood. \n\nMy cmt seems quite mild as I can lift heavy weights on squats, bench press, deadlift... I am pretty decent on every sport I tried and I am not clumsy at all. \n\nCan cmt be this mild? What now? I am pretty sure I will get an official diagnosis after the neurology appointment and maybe genetic testing. Is this going to get worse? I have been able to do great for now, even with narcolepsy, but I always knew that something else was going on. \n\nThanks in advance for your advices and support. I could do all those things at your age too. I would say my symptoms did not begin inhibiting me 25yo and on. I would say that my symptoms took an upswing mid to late twenties, have maybe slowed down a little, I am 35 now, or I am just accustomed to them now that I do not notice any decrease in physical performance.\n\n\nAFO\u2019s became a daily accessory around 26-27. \n\n\nI would say if you are diagnosed this early and you are not showing anything serious yet, *USE YOUR FUCKING TIME DOING THINGS YOU ENJOY!* There is so much stuff I loved doing that I feel was snatched away because I simply had no clue what was going on while being undiagnosed. By no means is my life miserable, or am I some sad sack. But I am also human, so I know what I am missing out on.\n\n\nThis disease hits different for a lot of people. So make the most of what you can still do while you still can. If you are decent at most sports and not clumsy at all it is extremely doubtful you have CMT. I have what is considered a very mild case and can also lift heavy weights. Visually I appear quite athletic. But when it comes to actual balance/agility, the difference between someone with and without CMT is pretty major It seems like in my family the age 50 is the time when symptoms get worse. I have asked my grandma about my grandpa symptoms and she says that he started noticing something was off by the age of 50. I asked my uncle too and he says that he is starting to notice that he cannot feel his hands sometimes and that his arms and legs are becoming weak, he is 48... It is pretty sad to think that no matter what I do it will hit me hard sooner or later. Thanks for your advice! I love playing volleyball so everytime I get the chance to play I will do it.\n\nOh, and do you think that my brother should get checked too? He walked on his tiptoes as a kid and he was very clumsy. So is one of my cousins! But none of them are showing any symptoms as of now, maybe cause they are too young? (19 and 16 respectively). I would really like to think so.

Oh yeah, my hands are shaking more these days and it is really annoying.", "Tips for getting diagnosed? My mother has been diagnosed with cmt for decades but when they tested her genes they did not find anything at first then with more testing they came up with variants of uncertain significance identified but only one.  I just do not get it, my issues seem much more like a very bad version of fibro.  I am just so exhausted and I just want answers but it seems science is just so far behind. Go to a neurologist. Delayed and attenuated nerve impulses in upper and lower extremities are characteristic of cmt. The probes they stick in your muscles are a little bit painful, but the graph they show you is pretty neat My emg was normal It is possible that your mother was misdiagnosed and has something other than CMT. Or that you have something different from what she has. Or that both of you have a rare and as yet unknown variant gene causing CMT. \n\nDid you mother have a nerve conduction study to determine that she had CMT? You say you had an EMG and it was normal. Have you had a genetic test to determine if you share her variant of unknown significance? she just got her results and her neurologist wants me to get tested as well, I am not even sure if her doctor is even covered under my medical insurance and I have not had a chance to check yet.  The diagnosis process is very different from the 90s when the mayo clinic diagnosed her. She fits the description to a T, but now genetic testing is the standard Maybe you do not have cmt. Perhaps a stupid suggestion, but look into this maybe your symptoms will vanish if you give it a try  I was diagnosed in 1986 but never tested until 2016. The genetic test basically said it is type 2a2 but it is so rare that they could not conclusively say it at the time - they said they only had a record of 3 family groups that had it. So technically they said it was an unknown variant- even though they know it is CMT 2A2, as confusing as that was. So, it is really confusing. I had this done through the MDA clinic and luckily the department has genetic counselors so mine helped me through all this otherwise I would of been very confused by the results. \n\nIf you want to know see a neurologist and have an EMG done. (Just read your comment about having an EMG being normal. ) my mom had a normal EMG result when she was younger but the disease did not really manifast for her until her upper 40s. She then had an EMG test and DNA test that showed she did have CMT. So EMG\u2019s do not always tell the whole story. \n\nA DNA test would be the route to go but your results may or may not be as confusing as your mom\u2019s. I think it could be helpful if they do the genetic test on you as well. If your insurance will not cover the same neurologist your mother went to, surely another neurologist could order the same test as long as you know what it is.\n\nI know they were doing electrical conductivity tests in the 90s, so I can only guess from what you have said that she had it done and it showed some abnormality. That does not rule out you having the same condition, but it is possible. Genetic testing is not required for a diagnosis. There is a slew of tests a neurologist can do. I was diagnosed with CMT2, and the genetic testing can pinpoint which gene is mutated so you know exactly which type of CMT you have. I declined to do genetic test. You need to see a proper neurologist. \n\nI do not have many positive things to say about doctors and CMT however the one area they have perfected is the genetic sequencing of CMT and what genes cause it. If the doctors cannot do a DNA test than they are out of their depth and should refer you to someone who knows what to look for. Thanks I will call my insurance and get the ball rolling Yes and they did a few biopsies on her and I am sure there is a lot more because she was at the Mayo Clinic for several days I am only 43 but something has completely disabled me and just gets worse the harder I push myself I am going to make an appointment with my neurologist and start the process of getting an appointment with my mother's neurologist too Well the odds are whatever it is it is probably related to what your mom has so you are going to want to get a checked out. Time will tell", "Is there a genetic test or a specific doctor you would recommend to test for (or rule out) CMT? Hi everyone, hopefully this is allowed here but I am wondering if there is a specific type of doctor that is better than others when it comes to CMT? I have struggled with odd symptoms since late childhood (I am 32 now) that no doctor has been able to help me with, though admittedly at times I get so annoyed with the referral path to nowhere I give up on trying to get a diagnosis after seeing so many doctors without answers. I do not feel confident that I have CMT or anything but I have so many identical symptoms. What lead me to it was a basic over the counter DNA test which I know is not necessarily trustworthy but it showed I had the CMT4J gene. After reading about it, it was very obvious to me that I did not have 4J. It is an extremely rare type and a severe one at that and it impacts people since birth. So obviously I could rule that out. I am also a heterozygous carrier so I am assuming one would need both genes. But the other less severe types struck me as odd because I do have so many symptoms that align with those. I have had extreme fatigue every day since my teens that no amount of working out and eating well can shake, doctors have tried to tell me it is depression and I am constantly telling them it is not, I am generally happy otherwise, but just so tired and so fatigued. I have one left claw hand and another forming on the right and muscle wasting starting. The bones on the sides of both of my feet have been sticking out since my late teens which looks exactly like Charcot foot. My gait seems non consistent from one day to the next, I am not sure how to explain it. I also have tremors in my hands and Lately more and more my handwriting is becoming terrible. Not sure if this sounds like CMT or not (I am very open to it being something else btw) but if it does sound like it, does anyone have good advice on what type of doctor to see or tests to ask for? Thanks! Most people who have CMT are diagnosed by a neurologist who performs an electromyograph (EMG) to test how well your nerves conduct electrical signal. A podiatrist would also be able to help understand what is going on with your feet.\n\nIf you are worried about genetic diseases, you could meet with a genetic counselor for a genetic test, but insurance might not pay for it if you do not have a family history of a genetic disease (assuming you live in the US).\n\nAnd just an FYI: some forms of CMT are autosomal dominant. Autosomal means it is not sex-linked, so females and males have the same risk of getting it. Dominant means that if you have 1 gene with CMT (heterozygous), then you will present with symptoms. Thank you! Yeah I am not worried about having 4J because I read it is extremely rare and I likely do carry the one copy of it if my test is correct (it is just a 23andme test so I am not putting money on it even being accurate) but I believe with that version you would have to be homozygous to have it and I am heterozygous. At least I think that is correct. Regardless, the type and symptoms are so severe for that type and often lead in very early childhood mortality so I absolutely can rule it out. I am really not concerned I have that but the raw data leaves out so many other variants I was curious about after reading about the other types (not that I would rely on it anyways) that I thought maybe it would be worth looking into or asking a doctor about. I have never been to a neurologist so I could ask my doctor for a referral. My primary doctor originally told me my hand was \u201cDupuytrens and later maybe I had a cyst or something\u201d but nothing has come of it. Now my other hand is slowly doing it too and it looks exactly like an ulnar claw which seems to be the same in cmt cases when I look online but I have no pain at all and no pain in my feet either so it is odd. I do have weakness which gets worse as the years progress. Anyways, thank you for your advice. I will see about getting a neurologist referral. I am sure it might take a year to get in but it is better than nothing at this point lol I think a neurologist is a good idea, whether your underlying issue is CMT or something else. The weakness, tremors, and unstable gait are all things which could be CMT but not necessarily. But there is a good chance that they are neurological even if not CMT. \n\nI am glad you recognize that the over the counter genetic tests are not great for diagnosis. They can be fun and interesting but 23andMe does not even get my eye color right. \n\nYou are correct that one copy of the CMT4J gene by itself is harmless (though you might want to have a potential partner checked for the same gene if you plan to have kids together). Cases of CMT4J are very rare, though being a carrier is not particularly rare. \n\nCharcot's foot actually has nothing to do with Charcot Marie Tooth disease. Dr. Charcot was very busy, back in the 1800s, and got more than one thing named after him. Folks with CMT do often have foot problems, but not Charcot's foot. The name similarity is pretty confusing.\n\nDepression does not always look like sadness and fatigue can be the main symptom so I can sort of see why doctors might think of that but combined with your other unexplained issues, I think there is probably neurological explanation. Check this out. They will do testing for so many conditions and will work with you and your doctor. They are not expensive and sometimes free depending on what is being researched. Take this information to your doctor or do it yourself. \n\n\n\nThey have a individual section and a physician section.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for folks getting tested, it is usually going to be a lot cheaper (in the US) to go through a doctor's office, so that insurance will pay for it. In most other countries, I assume going through a doctor will get the system to pay for it as well. Ordering it yourself is almost certainly going to mean eating the cost yourself. \n\nAdditionally, while they say they test for \"Charcot Marie Tooth disease\" they do not say what they mean by that. Do they test only for type 1A? For half a dozen of the most common types? Heck, maybe they only test for one super rare type. I do not know because their site does not say. \n\nThere is a wide variety of genetic tests available these days. Anyone who is getting a test done for medical diagnostic purposes should try to work with their doctor to do it, to avoid potential headaches such as your doctor not trusting a particular test (with or without reason) and wanting you to redo it with a test they do trust or getting a false negative because the tests did not check for the particular variant you have. The test is $125 in the US. Insurance did not cover my test which was $8000 in 2007. I had to work with Athena Diagnostics and paid $1600 out of pocket for my genetic testing. Just thought I would help and we are ordering this test for my 4 children through my neurologist. Thanks", "Kids? I know this has been posted about before...anyone had kids knowing they could pass on CMT?  Anyone done IVF?  \n\nTIA I mean anyone born with CMT... a parent has to have it since you know hereditary and all. Or what are you asking? My parents had two kids knowing full well they could have CMT and both me and my sister have it. I think OP is looking for input from people who made the decision to have kids knowing the risk of CMT and how they dealt with it. IVF with tested embryos, prenatal genetic testing, or just crossing your fingers and hoping for the best. \n\nThis is something I am having trouble with as well. But then, even if CMT is out of the equation there is still a whole host of other things that could go wrong. Yea that is what I was getting at...seems foolish to focus so much on having a healthy pregnancy child and then just to roll the dice with CMT, even though mine is mild I know there is no real prediction on how it would be in a child However IVF is expensive So I am probably going to avoid kids unless they crack gene editing using crispr. IVF can lead to a lot of complications far worse than CMT.\n\nThe reason is because the severity of inheritance is random. I have mild CMT and I would not want to risk the odds of having a child with severe CMT, especially as I am first generation CMT in my family. If my inheritance is similar to that of my mother and grandmother, is it more likely that a child of mine with CMT would also be similar? I am the only one of 5 kids to have cmt. Runs on my mothers side, she does not have it. I have not done the genetic test to see exactly which type and gene. I do not think it would stop me from having kids if that is what I wanted. I did IVF, but ended up not testing for CMT (we had to do IVF anyway). If I was younger or had better quality eggs, we would have tested, but I do not get many embryos. I have CMTX and am female, so I have a 50% chance of passing it on to any child. The thought of passing it on is terrible, yet I also thought-- what if my parents decided not to have any more kids once my dad was diagnosed? I would not be here.\n\nAnyhow, using PGD testing with IVF is a long an expensive process, but can be totally worth it. IVF is emotionally tough no matter what, but it is also amazing what miracles science can bring. When we started out with the idea of PGD testing, it felt very powerful knowing I could wipe out CMT from my lineage. CMT is autosomal dominant. That means it cannot skip a generation. Someone who does not have the disease cannot pass it on. Your mom may be very mild and not show symptoms (X chromosome linked CMT causes mild symptoms in women and stronger symptoms in men, if you are a male. In this case you might have sisters who have the disease and do not know it), or you have rare CMT type 4 which is recessive in which case your father would have to carry the recessive gene as well. Neurologist says most likely type 2. Maybe she does have it, but with zero symptoms.  my sisters have had genetic testing and do not have it. My great uncle had it, as did we think my grandfather. If someone has 0 symptoms but have the gene, would not that make them a carrier as opposed to having a disease? Yes, but then it would have to be type 4 CMT. All the other types she would have to have it in order to pass it on to her children. As I said, if it is X linked then she would have a much more mild case than a male child of her. I find the whole concept of first generation CMT totally confusing.\n\nI am 65. I was born with horribly flat feet. (yes, flat feet are also a hallmark of CMT) there was never a night when the last thing I felt before falling asleep was my feet and legs throbbing and the first thing I felt in the morning even before fully waking was my feet and legs throbbing.\n\nIt was always blamed on flat feet. I was told to shut up, stop whining, and stop complaining, and just get on with it.\n\nI have asked what family remains on my mothers side, none on my dads side, and no one recalls any family with anything like CMT.\n\nIt could be from my dads side but there were never any indications or comments, or recollections.\n\nAs far as I know, I am the first and symptoms really began manifesting  around age 45. Progressed and by age 52 I moved into total pain and total disability. \n\nDisability, pain, more and more and more loss of leg strength, mobility, ever worsening neuromuscular spastisity  has driven me to the point of, well, to the point ...\n\nHow does something like CMT just 'begin' out of nowhere when there is no prior history? According to research the answer is no, however I do not know if there is a bell curve distribution for severity. Unfortunately, CMT can just be cause by random gene mutation, and your symptoms started late. I was always an uncoordinated kid, but did not actually begin showing symptoms until age 26 or so. For me personally, I would not choose to have kids given that they could inherit the CMT (and for other reason as well). \n\nI do not mean to make this my soapbox, and I totally get why you would want to have kids, but for me I cannot see choosing to create another human being with significant chances of having a genetic problem when there are so many children out there who need homes right now. Also, until we come up with a solution for climate change, the more people we create, the more pollution there will be... \n\nJust my two cents. My family, once the hereditary aspect was proven, ceased having children.  There are far too many children with special needs awaiting - deserving adoption - than we can help.\nIf you want a child with a disability there is one already waiting for you. I never wanted children in the first place. This is just an added reason when people feel the need to be all \"but why??\" I recently (my son is now 16 months old) had a child. My father had what they thought to be CMT and I still wanted a child. I got pregnant and had said child. He seems fine at this point in time but to be cautious we are having him seen by a neurologist every nine months we also had other issues with him when he was born so he had genetic testing done early., He seems to have something from me but again at this point he seems fine. \n\nNow on to the draw backs. Well, first of all it turns out once I actually got genetic testing done that I actually have HNPP, which is similar to CMT and caused me to develop acquired CMT traits. The biggest problem was the actual birth. I did a vaginal birth with an epidural unfortunately because of this condition I think there was some damage done to my nerves and now I am not as great as I was before giving birth. Second of all the actual parenting at the start is very damaging and problematic for people with these sort of conditions. You have to hold a bottle and baby in your arms for a long time. I am sure you are seeing where the problems arise there. For me as well my baby needed to bedshare with me for a few months due to his other problems. It meant keeping him very close to me and applying pressure to my arms every night. Currently I am still recuperating from this. I am going through PT and AFOs etc.\n\nEven after all this I love my son he is the best thing in my life and I do not regret having him for a second. Even if his condition is worse than his momma's I will take care of him and cherish him. Having a child knowing you have a genetic condition is a very personal choice and one you should not take lightly but parenthood is something I think is truly special and should not be denied to anyone regardless of medical standing. If you need someone to talk with about this feel free to reach out.\n\nSorry, hope this was not too wordy or something.", "Getting my left calf lengthened on Friday Heyo just figured I would share that I am getting my left calf lengthened this Friday. \n\nNot privy on the type but my doc notes that it is unusually tight but my tendons that raise my foot while weak still work and raise when I lift my knee up. So the hope is to ease this tightness and hopefully I will be able to lift my foot up all the way. Was initially supposed to be an ankle tightening but he thinks this is the best option, he reckons that the nerves are still working also - to what capacity i do not know  so just maybe recovering some strength or at least slow down the strength loss from the limited movement. Anyone else had their calves lengthened?\n\nAfter this I hope to get my right foot done which seems like it will require a different kind of procedure but after that I sincere hope just to forget about the whole CMT thing and just live. I keep my fingers crossed that it will wotk just the way you planned it. I have a question though. As someone from Europe with the condition (that no one seems to know even in the fucking capital cities), I keep getting told by my doctors that they would never operate on my feet. (I just asked to stiffen my big toe cause it annoys the hell out of me). According to their reasoning it would take an eternity to heal and I would waste even more muscle by the following stationary lifestyle (I am mild to moderately affected btw)... on this sub however I keep reading about people having quite the big surgeries on their feet/legs. Most of them from, I assume, the US. Do you guys perform surgery with witchcraft or what do you do that the Euros do not know about? \n\nI wish you well and a speedy recovery as well as the outcome you hope for. I had surgery to lengthen my achilles tendon on my left foot. The surgery was done when i was 12, young enough to swiftly recover. I have CMT1A and my left ankle was so tight i would have to stretch for about 30 minutes before i could get out of bed in the morning. Doctors are generally working in your best interest. If they say your muscle loss will be greater than what the surgery can achieve id listen to them. Muscle atrophy is a bitch and it takes time and willpower to get just a percentage of it back. Good luck friend. Im a tad conderned with your last comment  \u201cto forget about the whole CMT thing\u201d i only bring this up because ive fought against it for most of my life. I hope you find a way to work with it though, best of luck! Ditto. \n\nI am looking at the same surgery (referrals between specialists take time). But they have been very careful to note that this will simply take some pressure off one symptom. It is by no means a cure. I am Australian - note that those talking surgery always seem to be American.\n\nI have been told similar. That the recovery process will cause more harm than the benefits of surgery when looking at the lower limbs. The only reason my dr seemed to entertain the idea was because I have \"atypical presentation\" - namely I do not have weak calves. I can afford some sedentary time to recover. \n\nThat all said, I do wonder about the frequencies of surgery in the US. Not to sound cynical, but there is a greater profit driven healthcare model over there... I am English - I have wondered the very same thing after looking at this sub. Cheers man, I just mean forget I have do not let it be a factor in my life anymore. Push onwards without doubt.", "\"Where We Are on Research'', webinar with CMTA CEO Patrick A.

I know if im doing any leg exercises i get wabbly as all hell. Maybe tone it down a little. Its always a good idea to see a specialist for concers either way.  I was when I was younger but not anymore.  If you can, go to the CMT clinic in Iowa with Dr shy. They can do full testing and are the best source of information on what you can do. I actually used to go to him!!! At least before they moved there office. He was super nice but never really recommended anything for me.  Thank you!!! I actually used to go to him!!! At least before they moved there office. He was super nice but never really recommended anything for me.  Thank you!!! I also think it is a good idea to get a follow up, Dr. Shy has a very good reputation. If braces will work for you depends on what CMT type you have and how far it has progressed, but in general they tend to have a noticable positive effect on fatigue, balance and reducing ancle roll overs in those that need them. Insoles usually help a lot if you have high arches. If you live far away, a neurologist with some CMT experience should be able to give you some good advice as well. My advice is always the same, seek out as much knowledge about CMT as you can (from good sources). Knowledge is power, and if you know what genetic type of CMT you have you can with some effort know a lot about to expect in the future and how to best take care of your self going forward.  I would recommend getting a proper diagnosis through either gene testing or nerve velocity testing (ideally both).\n\nThen depending on how high your arch is, the roll of your foot, the length of your achilles tendon, and overall severity of your CMT you will want to look into either insoles, braces, or surgery.", "Ypsilon braces Started wearing ypsilon braces.

As if I am trying to walk with my old gait. I go through stretches of weeks where they feel fine but then there are times where every step is a struggle against the braces.

I got tested when I was in utero for the Type of cmt my mother has and it was negative. I know there is more than one mutation so I am wondering if there is any chance I have another type? (I was tested 24 years ago when my mom was pregnant with me) First or second degree relatives of genetically defined patients with a CMT phenotype are assumed to have the same mutation.\n\nYou may be able to have genetic testing for a low cost. My mother has CMT1A and I was tested by GeneDx for less than $200. The company was actually extremely friendly and helpful. You may want to give them a call/email and have a price quote. They are familiar with CMT.  You could have another type if either 1) there is a different autosomal recessive or x-linked type in your ancestors, or if your mother had more than one type (extremely unlikely!), or if the test you had was not 100% reliable (you had your test in 1993, what kind of test was it?), or if your father had CMT or a recessive gene for recessive types of cmt, or you could have had a de novo mutation and gotten any kind of cmt by chance (extremely unlikely!).

I have been practicing relatively often. My index finger just does not seem to be strong enough to bar across the fret in almost all frets of the guitar bar (excuse the pun) fret 5. Is this a matter of lack of practice, and not training it enough, or is this weakness inevitable with this condition? Is there any way to increase the finger's strength? I play guitar very occasionally but I do not have a hard time depressing multiple strings on the same fret with my index finger (if I am understanding you correctly). I do have a hard time finding the strength to do that with other fingers, although oddly my pinky is strong enough. I also have problems with dexterity in my fingers but I figure that is a matter of needing to practice more. \n\nI play both electric and acoustic and, unsurprisingly, electric is much easier. I am sorry to tell you that your best guitar playing days are behind you unless you can figure out how to play guitar like Jeff Healey, who plays his guitar seated and on his lap. Look him up on YouTube. I was diagnosed at age five and now at 56 I can barely write my name. I have to used two hands to pull a tissue out of a box because my grip is totally gone. Sorry. For finger strength you should discuss that with your doctor. There are finger exercisers that may or may not help depending on the severity of your CMT symptoms.\n\nThat said, there are some mechanical things you can change about how you play. As long as you can move your fingers, there will be some possibility of playing guitar with some accommodations.\n\nFirst, talk with your doctor or physical therapist about finger strength and any recommendations for exercises you can do to maintain the strength you have or possibly increase finger strength.\n\nSecondly, if you are currently playing and struggling with using steel strings, I would strongly suggest changing to nylon strings. If you have a guitar made for steel strings, you can try ball end nylon strings like the ones linked below. These will be softer to play, but will have a slightly different tone. They also take more time than steel strings to stretch and settle in so the first few days of playing with a new set of stings will involve more frequent retuning than steel strings. If these work for you, you might consider a classical guitar for your next guitar purchase. \n\nClassical guitars are designed for nylon strings and have a different bridge (use with regular non ball end nylon strings) and a wider neck which allows for your fingers to not be so crammed together in chord formations. The downside is that by being wider some things will require more finger stretching to reach the right positions.\n\nOr the next possibly is to change how you apply pressure to the string all together. Normally, the shoulder and arm would be kept relaxed while playing and strings would be pressed down solely by finger strength, depending on your strength and dexterity, you might have more luck by bending your fingers to line up over the strings you want to press and then instead of pushing the strings down with finger strength, you essentially PULL the strings onto the frets by using just enough finger strength to maintain finger position/shape and using your shoulder or upper arm to pull your hand back against the strings/fretboard. The forearm of your strumming/picking hand might have to apply some additional pressure as well to hold the guitar still as this will change the physical stability of the guitar against your body. This would basically be retraining your whole body how to play, but could be an option.\n\nAnother option that involves changing everything from position to possibly the guitar itself, would be playing what is called steel guitar or lap steel guitar. These are guitars built specifically to be played with a finger slide and no pressing of the strings on to the frets. These often have a much higher bridge to avoid the strings accidentally coming in contact with the frets. The lap steel guitar is laid flat across the lap or placed on a steel guitar stand. Another type of steel guitar is the pedal steel guitar that legs like a table and has foot pedals (sometimes even knee levers) to allow for more flexibility and tonal control while playing. Both styles of steel guitars are played by moving your finger slide over the strings with no pressing on the fret board at all.\n\nHumanity has a long history of being able to overcome great challenges by changing how we assess the problem and by seeking alternative solutions. While there may come a day that your fingers simply refuse to cooperate, there is often a way to overcome or work around limiting factors. Even if someday you completely loose the use of your fingers, there is the possibly of essentially prosthetics on one hand to hold a finger slide and on the other hand to hold a pick. The rise of 3D printing has made the possibility of unique one off prosthetics like that much more accessible. \n\n The whatever your future holds, I wish you the absolute best of luck and hope you find a way that works for you so you can enjoy playing guitar as long as your heart desires.\n\n\n(\n\n(\n\n( It is possible the action is too high. Try playing other acoustics. Electric guitar is easier to bar chords on. And also nylon string guitars are much easier to play than a traditional steel string acoustic. I was a classically trained cellist for 20 years, cannot do it anymore. It is simply not in the cards for us. Hey as a guitar teacher of a decade and someone who got diagnosed with CMT 3 years ago, it is possible it is related to CMT but also it is really hard for a lot of students to do full barre chords for a long time and it can be very challenging, so it might be something that gets easier with time and practice and related to technique. On that front, have you tried out mini barres, like the FM chord on the first 4 strings? Practicing keeping your wrist and fingers straight and perpendicular to each other on those can help build the technique. Other recommendation in this thread, like switching to nylon strings and lowering the action could definitely help make it physically easier. You could try a 3/4 size nylon string classical guitar and see if that makes it easier. I have also found that even though electrics have steel strings, because of the narrow neck, barre chords tend to feel easier on electric.", "What are handy tools or products that you use that really make your life a lot easier and better? My CMT has progressed considerably since Covid which made me have a sudden drop in my activity level. So I am looking for ideas on what to buy to make life more enjoyable and not concentrate on how bad I am hurting 24/7. (Yes I am in pain management)\n\nSo please suggest anything that makes the pain or uncomfortableness better or something that helps you in your just day to day life getting around or anything really that helps with things that we, with this specific issue, deal with. I do not know if this is really what you are after, but since becoming far less active with covid I have tried to make some more passive exercise options to slow down progression. Swapped to a standing desk (just an add on, the whole desks are pricey) and bought some balance balls and a rocking board so I can get some calf stretching and core work whilst standing at the pc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe things that help with pain and uncomfortableness tend to get frowned upon when I bring them up in \"self care for professionals\" classes. Hard spirits and bitching with siblings with the same issues. My mom's CMT has progressed pretty far.  A couple years ago, she finally broke down and bought a walker.  It has large wheels and folds flat.  I am not sure of the brand, but she bought it on Amazon.  At first, she was embarrassed by the walker.  I think she almost felt defeated to admit she needed one.  But once she started using it, she was able to take the dog on longer walks.  She did not have to worry about tripping on carpet if her feet caught.  It even allowed her to visit Ireland with me.  The large wheels allowed her to navigate cobblestones, and all the taxi cab drivers were able to fold it and easily store it in their trunk.\n\nShe also uses these little gel spacers between her toes, which help prevent her toes from rubbing together or getting squished in her shoes. Low tire pressure. Anyone else hate seeing that on the car dashboard? It means finding a gas station with the compressed air, ideally free, lots of getting up and down off the dirty ground, dealing with the air hose, screwing/unscrewing those tiny caps from the tires. All made worse if your pressure gauge is one of the cheap ones they sell at every gas station. Buying a better pressure gauge made it better for me. I have this one  but there are many other options. You still have to deal with all of the things I described, but with a better pressure gauge it takes less time and makes it kind of fun. You had me at, \"low tire pressure\"\n. Do you know what gel spacers? I could use something like this. I think she buys them from her local pharmacy, but you can find similar versions on Amazon if you search \"gel toe spacers\".  She uses the ones that look like this:\n\n( Thanks! LOL that is not the type of thing I meant. You probably make a commission or something off the sale, eh? Lol My wife keeps a lightweight, extending cane. It is there for when she needs it but is not really a burden when she does not. Basically like those hiking poles people have for long treks.\n\nThe \"poppers\" on the back of a phone is super handy. Much more control with decreased finger dexterity and strength.\n\nAutomatic can opener, ha.\n\nShe also has a lot of little exercise items around. Resistance bands for feet and ankles, and small ones for training both opening and closing finger musculature. If only! I would have made tens of dollars by now. Sadly I am just a tire gauge enthusiast.", "I have type 1A and am applying to be a participant in the PXT3003 study. I am really excited and hope I am eligible. I have done research on it but I am curious if anyone here has applied or has any experience with it so far?  I am going for all the tests and such in a week or two to make sure I am eligible though I already seen them once and said im pretty likely. So probably will actually start sometime late november. It took a really long time, contacted them like april this year and brought me in once already in June just to say it would start in early september. Better late then never though No experience but if there is any chance of being switched from med to placebo, look out for symptoms of baclofen withdrawal. I am actually waiting on confirmation for this aswell,  fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e Thanks, I will keep that in mind. What is this study??? Can someone explain? \n\nBasically, it is a Phase 3 trial of a treatment that  could stop progression of Type 1A. There is the link to more about it. Damn, it U.S.  I hope if it is successful it quickly comes to Canada I thought it was worldwide, you should look into it. I have not done this before, how does one apply to be part of a study? I found a doctor that is closest to me and reached out to the office. I emailed her and introduced myself and asked to apply or learn more. \n\nHere is where I applied. It shows all the doctors who are participating. Oh that is amazing!! I am crossing my fingers that you see some results! Definitely keep us updated throughout the study!! Also, is it just type 1A? I will! It says the medication (or placebo) is banana flavor \ud83d\ude02 and I believe it is. Oh you have lost me!! I find banana repulsive lol but good luck to you hahaha yea you have to have your neurolgist to send a referral. Also I am from canada and is pending on doing to the trial so it is worldwide (while if worldwide means north america and europe) what would baclofen withdrawel be? also how could you get the symptoms if you take it continuously? I am no expert on baclofen withdrawal but it can be similar to alcohol withdrawal and can be severe. Call 911 severe. It is possible to be given placebo in the \u201csecond round\u201d of the study to compare the patient\u2019s reaction to placebo compared to the real drug. That is a common way to test how effective the drug is. ah makes sense. Damn, I would have applied because it sounds pretty awesome to try but I am a female so I would have to be on birth control which I am not and do not want to be. RIP.", "Dryer sheets This is a strange one, but, I thought I would let everyone know about a recent change I made (maybe out of paranoia). I happened to read about the fact that dryer sheets contain chemicals that are neurotoxic and can be absorbed through the skin, there is even one or two that specifically have muscular/motor effects.\n\nI might be paranoid but I cut out fabric softener and dryer sheets entirely after reading this, switched to wool dryer balls which in the long run will be cheaper anyway. A tip if anyone does the same- you can drop some essential oils on the balls and make your laundry smell good!\n\n\n\n ", "Physiotherapy tiny rant Heya\nSo my dr just prescribed me physiotherapy. Yay!\nTwice a week. Every week. How is one supposed to keep a full time job with that? \"sorry boss, I need to take an afternoon off. Twice this week. And next week. And every week after that.\" any ideas? The nearest physio is about 45min away, which means 2.5-3h for every visit. Argh. This on top of other regular dr's visits about twice a month, as you all probably know all too well. PT never helped me that much. You can go just enough to learn a home program you can do. If you have never been, it could be helpful. Personally, for me, I get the best help working out (with modifications for my disability) of course. Honestly, I find yoga more helpful than physio. Stretching out the muscles and improving balance. It is hard, and sore to begin with, but seriously helpful. You can actually see and feel the benefits", "Walking in the dark What is your experience with walking in the dark?\n\nI feel like I roll more on my feet and have a harder time keeping balance when there is no light. If walking under streetlights I feel improvement. I hate it. Hands out feeling for something to brace on as all balance is out the window. It is a known effect of loss of proprioception. You cannot balance as well due to feel, and so you compensate with your eyes. Your balance is a combination of proprioception, vision, and inner ear balance.\n\nAmong my most unsteady times have been walking on uneven ground in the dark (worst was a pitch black beach at night). I do not ever really walk in the dark, but I do know that I have a tendency to look down at my feet when I walk. If I could not see them when I looked down due to darkness, I would definitely stumble more. I cannot do it. If it is dark I need to walk along the wall or hold on to something/someone. Strobe lighting is also terrible and totally screws up my ability to stay upright.\n\nA bit more random but I also find I am more likely to fall over if a room I am familiar with changes, throw in a new piece of furniture or change the blinds and it is totally disorienting to me for weeks. Darkness is kryptonite for me...I also lose my balance like crazy if my path narrows My husband falls at night all the time. Now I realise why. Let us just say I look drunk while walking in the dark... it is the only way I can explain it.", "Does anyone else think a pinned shoe\u2019s for AFO\u2019s suggestion thread would be good? It is a question I see here pretty regularly. Whether it is exercise shoes, casual or whatever. Just shoes people have found that they like and would recommend for use with AFO\u2019s It might be useful, but shoes change all the time so I am not sure how long the information would stay relevant. \n\nAlso, I think we can only sticky 2 things at a time. I could probably combine our two weekly threads into one \"good or bad\" thread. That would free up a slot for shoes or other frequently asked questions, if people want me to do that.", "Standing for long periods How do you all cope with joint/ankle fatigue or foot pain from standing for a long period of time? I have high arch insoles, but the outer parts of my soles still feel sore after standing for a few hours Take a look into different brands of shoes that are meant for people who are on their feel all day. I am a personal trainer, virtually now, but when I was in studio, I would often be on my feet for 8+ hours a day. I got Hokas and it was the best decision of my life. \n\nGranted, I do not have the typical high arches of CMT, i have incredibly flat feet with pronated ankles due to the types of medical intervention I had years ago. Anywho, that brand might be worth looking into at least. Hope this helps!\n\nAlsoooo if you are just standing and not walking, look at investing a gel standing mat if you have not already :) By using a wheelchair for events that require lots of standing", "Hi! I honestly just wanted to say hi to everybody i never expect a group to actually come up when i searched cmt but i am so happy it did \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nanyway \n\nhope you all are doing well Hello Hello! :) Welcome to the community, we are small, but helpful when possible :) Hey, fellow how is you?? Hollaaa Hi and welcome! \n\nIf you are intertested we lso have flairs for most types that you can use, I have 1A for instance. Welcome!", "Sex and CMT Bit of an odd question but I (female) seem to have a decreased sensitivity in and around my vagina. I very rarely orgasm and even if I do it is not particularly enjoyable. I am wondering if this might have something to do with my CMT, a bit like how my body is slow to react to burning heat? It is probably possible, CMT can affect basically everything. But most women do not feel pleasure inside the vagina, it is the clitoris that is known for creating pleasure. I would try more by yourself (or with your partner) looking up and trying out clitoral stuff. Yeah I was referring to the clitoris and the g-spot when I said \"around\", sorry that was not super clear! I swear I have tried everything, it is so frustrating that my cmt has not only ruined my ability to be physically \"normal\" but sexually as well! Haha ok! You never know, some women are very unaware of what is down there.\n\nIt could also be a mental thing? I know there \"disorders\" that could cause you not to like want sex, or enjoy it.\n\nOr it could be the CMT. that is the hard thing about CMT, in cases like these I am not sure how you would figure out what is the issue. For sure :')\n\nWhen I (eventually, if ever) get in to see a neurologist I am going to ask them about it. In the meantime I guess it will be a mystery! Same boat, and I have wondered about this too. Like the other reply, my guess is that a large part of it is a mental block that CMT contributes to. Interested though if this is pretty common Glad I am not the only one! Cannot report any decreased sensitivity as a male.  Large amounts of whiskey is the only thing that seems to decrease sexual function ... much like any guy. ;-)\n\nHas CMT really \"ruined\" your sexuality?  I would not blame it just yet...\n\nHave you had recent bloodwork checking various things like testosterone levels, estradiol, progesterone, and a complete blood count?  There are lots of things that can ruin your libido and impact your ability to \"get off.\" I do not understand the mental block idea.  I realize many women have orgasms tightly coupled to different arousal styles and methods of stimulation... But I do not understand how a genetic mutation like CMT can be so devastating that one cannot get off an orgasm because of it. It is never solely because of one thing, especially not solely because of CMT. 75% of women do not orgasm from intercourse alone. That is already a disadvantage. Now if you add in the stress of how your body looks bc of CMT, the fatigue you may be feeling that day, and awareness of limitations that CMT may cause during intercourse (less flexibility, muscle weakness) then it makes getting there even more difficult. \n\nKey word is that CMT contributes to mental blocks that exist, not that CMT makes it physically or mentally impossible or that it can be overcome. Just adds an extra hurdle in getting there.  As a guy, I have had no issues in that department other than body confidence issues. I have however had perfectly healthy partners who struggle to orgasm through penetration, which is really normal and common. ", "Sometimes they do not see it Hello, I (F18 1A) am curious about your guys experiences with people who assume you do not have a disease or treat you as if you are faking it or able to do normal things because they cannot see that CMT effects you. \n\nThe only way a person would know for me is if they were to see me running or actually look at my feet/hammies. I was recently denied disability (even though having it as a child) because the gov. Believes I am not fully effected. It sucks when every day people do not get it, let alone the government. My gait is somewhat uneven, but most people do not really realize anything is really wrong/different until I have to go up or down stairs (being called upon to run would also do it, but that is rare as a 40-something adult). Since I do not usually volunteer information about CMT unprompted, I get a lot of surprised side-eye when someone first sees me tackle stairs. \n\nHonestly, not talking about it is not ideal, but bringing it up is usually awkward for me unless there is a reason, so I wait for people to ask--which they never do because everyone I know is too polite, I guess. \n\nDealing with the government is its own nightmare. You do not say what country you are from but the USA, at least, is infamous for denying disability the first time you apply even in very obvious cases. Like you could be missing a leg and the gov't would be \"hmm, maybe it will grow back.\" I do not know much about navigating the process but I think it is common to have to reapply a couple of times to get it approved. There are lawyers who specialize in that sort of thing, which sounds like a depressing industry, but I expect there is a lot of information out there to help improve your application from people who know more about it. I am in my 40's and have dealt with it most of my life. People judge me as being lazy because they think I am trying to avoid heavy work or cannot lift heavy things. The truth is, it does not take much activity for me to get severe fatigue. \n\nAs for disability, you have to keep trying and may want to consider getting a lawyer, a lot of people do. They deny almost everyone on the first attempt. The reason is simple, there is a LOT of fraud in the system and a LOT of lazy people who just do not want to work and really are not disabled but want the \"free\" money. This is basically their way of sorting out the real disabled people from the fakers -- and the fakers do exist. The problem is how long it takes. It can be very frustrating to deal with. Having my invisible disability become visible has changed my life. I recommend getting AFOs and wearing them where they always show. Black AFOs with black booties looks good IMO. Avoid disability if you can. It is so little. You will not have a great life. Can you use your hands? If you can, get a job that is not physical in nature. Go to college. What is \u201cdisability\u201d? From other comments it looks like it means disability payment like a replacement income. I am curious why you were given disability payments as a child? I did not know that was a thing that could happen. \n\nMy CMT is mostly invisible and it does get frustrating. It is kind of funny, some people immediately point out my CMT when they meet me (usually socially unaware folks). I get a lot of \u201cwhat is wrong with your leg\u201d and \u201cwhy are you limping?\u201d But I also get a fair amount of people who tell me I look athletic and ask me what sports I play. Luckily, I have never been called out for using a disability placard. Why do you want to be on disability if for the most part people cannot even tell you have CMT? I would assume that means that you do not have too severe of a case. Go to college. Get a job that is not to physically demanding. Being on disability really, really sucks. It is not enough to live on. Only do it if you have absolutely no other options. I am 50 and I still work. I might not always be able to but I am going to fight til the last minute. I like not have to worry about money every minute, being able to go on vacation, eating high quality food,etc.. CMT effects us all differently. You do not know how I am affected since disability goes beyond looks. I am already applying to colleges. You are unfortunately one of the people I posted about, please do not assume someone is state without knowing their full story. Well, obviously you have more going on. Maybe it is not the CMT. I was seeing that you said you could run. This is pretty high level for cmt. I wear braces and sometimes use a chair. It took me years but these days I am not bothered by people who do not understand or who think I am faking /making out that is its worse than it is. I know the extent to which this disease has impacted me since I was 10.  When you explain it to people in a non defensive way they usually get it.. It is the lack of muscular endurance that really gets me.. No matter the activity or job I need more breaks. My capabilities (hands and lower leg strength particularly) have decreased and I now have disability income support. In the past I  felt guilty for receiving income support and went off it, even though I physically could not work enough hours to earn a living (and had to rely on my parents). I am not ashamed at all to say I receive income support which I need until I am qualified for a professional role. All the best and good luck with your studies :) Just found this subreddit and tbh it is the first time I feel \u201cseen\u201d. I have a slight limp that gets worse the more pain I am in, but most people never notice it or assume I just have a \u201cweird walk\u201d. I have often thought of getting a cane to help with my gait and also so people will actually treat me seriously. I am also fighting with disability in my state currently. They have denied me once and I am waiting on the second denial even though I have obvious secondary issues and medical records for my CMT (we found out about it when I was 11). Why would you say \"You will not have a great life\"? How do you know? I have dealt with CMT for 50 years and I have had a great life. I went to college, got a good job, got married to an incredible woman, and am now retired at 55. I have lived overseas and been to almost every state and I have friends in many places. I know I have had a good life. \n\nPeople come on here for support and saying those kinds of things is not helpful. Lol. I said if you go on disability at 18 it is not going to be great. Living off $783 a month is very hardy if there is any way to work at all, it is better to try. I have CMT and a great life but I have financial stability. If your only 18 its highly likely she cannot have a part time job to make money while in uni as most low paying jobs are physically labourous. Me and my family have handy cap plaques but we barly use it but we never take it down but whenever we park in a handycap spot we get dirty looks from some random person and on occasion someone yells that we dont deserve to even have the plaquard up but what they dont realize is we are all disabled everyone but my mother and my older sister has cmt type 2 i have wolff parkinson white me and my sister have autism and she has a double s curve in her spine i have arthritus and a bit of a hobble. i basicly just tell them not all disabilitys are visable.", "New job as at Humane Society doing adoptions. Oof. Man, walking dogs all day with this is a beast. Couldn\u2019tve gotten the job if they knew because it \u201cDemands the ability to stand and walk for long hours and be able to lift up to 60 lb\u2019s\u201d. No one there knows, we wear jeans everyday so my braces are hidden. But I am sure they think I walk oddly and lean on things constantly, or am always slightly bending at the knee if there is nothing to lean against slyly. Quads are wildly sore after each shift and I\u201dm completely physically exhausted but I absolutely love the job and find that I can (mainly seem to) do it like anyone else there. It is so awesome to work with people just trying to help some cats and dogs out. Literally all I do is come in walk dogs, tell people about dogs and cats that I bring to them,who they hopefully adopt, then walk more dogs then go home. Not trying to brag by any means, just saying this shit can suck BALLS, but not letting it defeat you feels great. That is all, just thought I would share.\n\ntl;dr Got a new job where I have to stand still often, and walk a lot of dogs. Mad tired at the end of shift, but I love it and I am happy I do it. I would suspect that the longer you work there, the stronger you will get, too. Win-win. That is my dream job! But I would not be able to do it. So proud of you for taking care of them and you might want to tell them about the CMT at some point. They will see how well you have done in spite of it and it will make it easier if you do not have to hide your need to rest every now and then. ", "Any CMTers experience with the tonal gym?  I find I actually gain what muscle I can really fast. Granted, certain pets of my body just do not change This is widely debated but I think the agreed stance is that muscle gain is much harder/not possible with CMT for all muscle groups, not just peripheral muscles. It is definitely possible! I have CMT1A and my calves and wrists are weak and muscle growth is extremely hard in those areas. \n\nOther than that it is possible with the right diet/lifting/attitude. Gains can 100% be achieved.\n\nI might have weak calves but my thighs are jacked from being a thigh walker and have seen upper body gains that are relevant to the work I put into it. Stretching the feet and legs is key! Stretch the shit out of your feet! Work on moving them and trying to feel the nerves even though it is a shit show.\n\nDo not believe this shit, it is going to be harder than the average person but use that as fuel and improve your life! Both my brother and father have let CMT overtake them, physically and mentally. Do not let it overtake you! And get your ass to the gym and own that shit. You are who you are, no one other than you gives a fuck if you are shaking benching 100lbs. Oh do not get me wrong, I have put on a lot of mass and I am probably one of the most jacked people with CMT.... but I am also not natural either.\n\nI trained for years and had little progress and plateaued very quickly. It was only when I added the extra sauce did I manage to actually make real progress and also have consistent gains. I am hoping by the end of year to be able to put up some pics to show what can be achieved. Embarrassment is not the only factor. I am a corporate manager and a dog owner so between walking and stretching that takes up almost two hours a day. Having an at home gym would be a huge time saver The best workout is the one that you can fit into your routine. As a new person to exercise (I am presuming) having a guided plan will help massively. Also make sure to watch your calories and dont get sucked down the supplement rabbit hole as 99% of it is marketing bs.", "What to do: DUI Field Sobriety Test This will be kind of long, but I am hoping this will help some of you and perhaps put some minds at ease a little. My father, my son and I have CMT. My husband has been a cop for 10 years, and he has expressed his concern over the years about what I should do if I am ever asked to conduct a field sobriety test. I worry about it as well.\n\nWe are involved a little in the CMT community, and my husband volunteered last year at the Charcot Marie Tooth Association\u2019s Camp Footprint. Through our interactions, we have learned that many people with CMT express the same concern over what to do, and we want to help in anyway we can.\n\nWe wrote down what you might encounter during a field sobriety test and suggestions for what you might do. Please know that each state varies, and being aware of your state\u2019s laws regarding this matter will also benefit you.\n\nHere is what we wrote:\n\nIn the event you are stopped for whatever reason, answer any questions they have about whether or not you have been drinking; these are standard questions when they suspect someone is driving under the influence. They are not accusing you of doing anything illegal; they are trying to assess the situation. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated, and will make the process go much quicker.\n\nIf they suspect you are driving under the influence, the cop will might do both a breathalyzer test and a field sobriety test. If they want to conduct a field sobriety test, make it CLEAR you have a physical disability. DO NOT hesitate to tell them this information when asked to do a field sobriety test. If you have a handicap ID, let them know you have it and say you can show them the ID.\n\nIf you do not have a handicap ID, tell the cop you have a physical disability that has been documented by your doctor. Should you be wrongly accused of driving under the influence and taken to court, this documentation could prove vital to your case.\n\nDuring the field sobriety examination, they may do a nystagmus test. This is the test where they make you follow your finger with your eyes to see if they twitch. You will most likely FAIL this test because CMT can cause your eyes to be twitchy. (My husband used to practice doing the nystagmus test on me during his training and I failed *every time*.)\n\nShould the cop ask about your disability, the terms \"Charcot Marie Tooth\u201d or \u201cPeripheral Neuropathy\u201d are not descriptive enough for him to quickly grasp within the span of a traffic stop. I could almost bet anyone with CMT has had to further explain that CMT has nothing to with teeth when discussing it with someone. So, there should be reasonable expectations for cops understanding it as well.\n\nYou could say something along the lines of: \"I have a degenerative neuromuscular disease that negatively affects my entire nervous system, including but not limited to my balance and coordination.\u201d Other suggestions for what to say are welcome.\n\nField sobriety tests are not the only method of determining intoxication. If you fail a breathalyzer test (say you have mouthwash breath which causes the breathalyzer to falsely show signs of alcohol) and you cannot conduct a field sobriety test due to your disability, you might be able request a blood sample be taken, which would prove your sobriety, but this varies by state.\n\nFinally, cops are not judge and jury. They are there to try to keep people safe in the immediate present. They do not determine if you are guilty. That is the judge\u2019s job. \n Good read! Thanks for taking the time to explain how to handle one of the many situations one might come in contact with. Many many awkward situations I am sure are to come for anyone due to CMT. I keep reverting to my past awkward situations that now I understand since being diagnosed with CMT at a later age. Nicely done! And thanks again! I think about this every time I see a cop behind me or sitting along the highway. I am glad you posted this! Oh yes, I can relate. I tend to be painfully shy due to years of judgmental people (family members included) being unreasonably rude and hurtful. I am still learning how to be my own advocate without hesitation. So it is definitely a little nerve-wracking thinking about the possibility of having to confidently tell someone of authority, who could make my life extremely difficult, that I need accommodations.\n\nMy husband tries to casually advocate for people with disabilities when discussing situations that would need accommodations with colleagues. I do wonder about people who have undiagnosed CMT and may have been wrongly accused of intoxication. I was nervous about posting it. It makes me really happy to hear that others find it helpful. Great advice! \n\nMy father has a card in his wallet that he got either from his doctor or from CMTA. I know CMTA has an ID card explaining what CMT is and how it affects people. It is meant to help in these types of situations. It is a good idea to download this card from CMTA to keep on you as it can help legitimize what you are saying.   That is a great suggestion! Thank you. There are two cards available on their site that I found (\n\nI do worry that their description on the cards is very condensed, and it does not include information about how CMT could impact your eyes. Yeah, I noticed what you mentioned about the eyes was not included. I think the card needs some updating. Hmm... I wonder who to contact at CMTA about that. Would you mind if I shared your post when I try contacting them? We originally wrote this after receiving an email from the CMTA (Jeana Sweeney and Elizabeth Ouellette) after other members expressed their concerns to them about what to do in this situation. I think they were going to put the information in an article, but I do not know if plans changed.\n\nWe have changed the section about nystagmus test since we last talked to them because we since found more information on the matter, which I have posted here. Originally, we only had information that said anti-seizure medication like Gabapentin (which is also prescribed to people with CMT to treat symptoms) can cause nystagmus, but as it turns out, CMT alone can cause it.\n\nI do think their card could use some updating like you said, so maybe expressing your concern to them would be beneficial. Perhaps even a card that is not directed at the TSA, but looks a little more professional than their What is CMT? card. Try contacting Jeana Sweeney; she is the director of community engagement, and an absolutely wonderful person!  I agree about a card that is not directed at TSA. Thanks for letting me know who to contact!  Be polite and patient with the officer, but politely explain that you have a \u201cnerve and muscle disability that affects balance\u201d which \u201cmay make it impossible to pass tests\u201d and which \u201cmay affect my eye muscles, too.\u201d Everyone knows that nerves and muscles are, everyone knows what a disability is. \n\nIf you get into CMT and neuropathy s/he will just get confused and think you are making stuff up, unless you have a doctor\u2019s letter.\n\nLots of cops nowadays have body cameras which capture a stop. A camera would also capture the explanation and create a nice piece of evidence to use in plea negotiations or a jury trial, in the event a ticket was issued. ", "GOT MY AFOS!! ", "Nephew had his first surgery...we decorated his walker to match his casts. ", "Need to vent about losing balance I am 39 now and was diagnosed at 31. My balance has generally been okay, up until the last two weeks. I have been pitching and losing my balance a few times a day. I would say it been somewhat sudden in its onset. I have been pushing myself a little harder the last few weeks by helping the roofers instal a roof on my house. Mostly just handing things to them and making sure they are hydrated. \n\nI fell backwards onto the stairs last week when coming down. Luckily it was back and not forward. It has been happening when walking and when standing and turning around. \n\nHas anyone had problems with a sudden onset of pitching? Why are you helping the roofers? Let me just reassure you that you are not and probably will not lose your sense of inner ear balance. (Although congestion/ear infections can mess it up for a bit)\n\nWhat IS super common with CMT is reduction of proprioception or \"muscle balance\"/being able to tell position and force on a muscle/joint.  Without this you probably cannot react to shifting surfaces well or stand perfectly still with your eyes closed. \n\nAlso, we are pretty sensitive to heat/dehydration because half of blood pumping is done with muscles outside of the heart.\n\nFor steps many generally have to watch their feet for feedback and for ladders make sure you maintain 3 points of contact, if that is still a safe thing for you.\n\nI have had more falls and patellar subluxations than I can count on my fingers and toes, gave up for a while but exercise has actually improved both to almost non-existent. Exercise is effective for increasing nerve response as much as it is for muscle tone. (Albeit small gains for us without the ability for muscles to send the \"repair\" signal) Oh definitely! Especially after overexerting myself. Since you were helping the roofers you were probably on your feet more than you realized. It is very annoying, but it helps to realize your limits and not be too hard on yourself. Some weeks are better than others. Regular exercise (I like Pilates and biking) can help improve this over time. They are friends and it is only the two of them. It is mostly me just getting stuff for them. Nothing major.\n\nEdit: There is roof access from my upstairs and the roof is not very steep. I also stayed well away from the edge. Oh man, I forgot overexertion \"drop outs\" were not a normal person thing. Yeah, definitely this, usually once I start dropping things I know to stop, rest, and reconsider doing anything else that day. Continuing leads to falls/tips from what I call brownouts, leg(s) just stop listening for a second. Brownouts! I love that term! I usually say that my leg decided to take a break from its job lol AFOs foxed balance for me Hopefully one day soon I can get insurance and get a pair. What kind do you have? Yeah the loss of proprioception sucks. I have to use a cane at night to get to the toilet to stop mid-night crashes. Like another comment said that not paying attention to how my feet are placed leads to more crashes. I have customs with a Coyote Strut I constantly watch where I am stepping when I am not in my house. I only use a cane when I am going to be standing for a long period of time in public, like if I go see a show or go to a party. It was just worrying to me that it was such a sudden thing, but I have not really pushed myself that hard in years, so I guess I now know  what one of the results is if I do push myself that hard. I am 32, and I now have to tell people that are just getting to know me that I may look like I lose my balance but I am fine. It is almost like a strange dance, I will be cooking in the kitchen and all of sudden I seem to lean in any direction and I usually have to grab something to retain my balance or I counter balance by lifting up a foot and spinning a little then grabbing something. It is really hard to explain but if I had to give an example of a minor case of vertigo, that would be it. CMT's so weird.... Can you give any tips on exercises, or a good place to start? I just try to stay active with disc golf, drums, gardening, and work, but I think a good routine might be beneficial. Thanks your help. Sounds like you are off to a pretty great start! Any low impact whole body activity is great (especially if it is routine and enjoyable), as avoiding injury and joint pain is quite important. \n\nI am no expert but I started with pretty much exclusively cardio (that and rest) so as to improve my terrible endurance. Just make sure to stay hydrated, electrolited (love Pedialyte powder packs, \"liquid iv\" drink is good too), and fed (I usually replace about half the calories burned over my daily norm).\n\nOn a normal gym day I would do some HiiT (more like MiiT) on treadmill (walking w incline) and elliptical, then make a round of the machines and (personally) avoiding the free weight/lifting area. I would focus on getting to higher reps/sets, usually 10x3, before even thinking about increasing weight. If anything put a muscle out of commission for more than a day id dial it way back and go slow. The most tested muscle for me was patience.\n\nNowdays I stick to a pedal exerciser and grip trainer while I work and cycling/VR/free weights in my time off. You would be surprised how intense some of the more active VR games get.  I should probably throw in some flexibility/RoM stuff in there too.\n\nEdit: the above is on the scale of years, not months. Progress was and remains so very, very slow. Even now something like a sprained wrist sets me back significantly. I appreciate your response very much. I love all thess suggestions. If it was not for my outdoor garden I would have been slacking these last few months haha. Balance is a big issue for me. I fell on a child once which made me cry through guilt and embarrassment. People usually presume I am healthy so I am often deemed lazy thus often try to do things I know will cripple me in some way later. If you ever want to vent your frustrations you are welcome to PM any time. I am a socially polite person too plus because CMT is not as outwardly obvious as some disabilities I find people can (or my insecurities tell me people) presume I am lazy. I hate that so sometimes try to help but then end up paying the price physically later by falling etc. I had to stop helping. After a few days of it, I became to physically exhausted to help. Luckily I found someone to step in. On a happier note, I fixed the leak in my shower faucet! My wife uses the Swedish AFOs from Ali Med. Very inexpensive and effective. \n My physio recommended Pilates from childhood. Personality I do not have the discipline but light Pilates and swimming is particularly beneficial.

I am researching a study but do not understand WHY, if CMT is a dysfunction in the motor and sensory neuropathy  I did not realize this was a thing. Link to the study?  I would imagine the explanation though is that the intestines contains nerves that help digest and move food through the digestive tract. \n\n Desktop link: \n***\n ^^/r/HelperBot_ ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove. ^^Counter: ^^257521 **Enteric nervous system**\n\nThe enteric nervous system (ENS) or intrinsic nervous system is one of the main divisions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and consists of a mesh-like system of neurons that governs the function of the gastrointestinal tract. It is capable of acting independently of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, although it may be influenced by them. The ENS is also called the second brain.It is derived from neural crest cells.\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ( ^| ( ^| ( ^| (   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 There is a relatively high prevalence of gastrointestinal problems in CMT. See Figure 3 in ( (\"Quality-of-Life in Charcot Marie Tooth Disease: The Patient's Perspective\") and ( (\"Lower urinary tract functions in a series of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy patients.\")\n\nAlthough it depends on the genetic type of CMT, autonomic nerve damage is generally common in patients with CMT. See ( (Dysautonomia in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease and Correlations with Patient-Reported Disability (P2.112)).\n\nDamage to autonomic nerves can cause disruption of normal reflex mechanisms which in turn affects the smooth muscles in our intestine. For instance, autonomic nerve damage of the vagus nerve (which innervates the stomach) is likely to cause smooth muscle involvement which in turn could cause gastrointestinal problems such as delayed gastric emptying.\n\nI am not aware of any studies that looks at this problem in detail with regards to CMT patients, but it have been discussed fairly extensively in relation to diabetes, which often cause a neuropathy that shares many similarities with CMT. One example of such a study is ( (\"Physiologic studies of autonomic-nervous-system dysfunction accompanying diabetes mellitus.\"). IMO, for the same reason that other people do.There is a relatively high prevalence of GI issues in the American population and if you follow the more cutting edge testing and studies related to GI health, you will see that there is a connection between gut health and almost everything else from arthritis to alzheimer's. Functional Medicine is pioneering a lot of this research.  I had GI issues and through testing it was determined that I had extremely low gut immunity (IgA) and also gut permeability. As those issues are being addressed, my \"gut issues\" are disappearing. \n\nAlso interesting, I thought my CMT pain was related to CMT, but I have discovered than when I eat industrial cooking oils, like canola and especially soy, I get extreme nerve pain. I turned my cousin on to this and he experimented and found the exact same result with regards to his CMT and pain. ", "Is the COVID vaccine contra-indicated for CMT? Pretty much the title. I have tried getting a hold of my doctor but I have not heard back. Does anyone know if the vaccine is contra-indicated? The general consensus when this was asked before is no, get your shots. The answer is no. Get vaccinated. 1) The vaccines are so new, and CMV is such a rare disease, that it is unlikely that CMV patients were well-represented in the data.  So there is really no way to tell from the data whether CMV patients will have a different reaction to the vaccine\n\n2) Only your doctor and you can make a decision about risk vs. benefits for you &amp; your health.  But overall, all public health officials are highly recommending getting the vaccine whenever it is available for you. CMV? Cytomegalovirus? We all make typos, it is just weird that you did it three times, unless I am missing something else that could stand for. I just got mine yesterday and so far I am fine.

My doctor never explained the type of CMT I have, but he did recommend that I get the Covid vaccine. I am similar.

None of us have any notable muscular atrophy or neurological degradation, but it is definitely evident in our feet - impressively high arches, relatively small, pigeon toed, and a tendency to 'walk on our tip toes,' or more accurately a tendency to distribute our body weight more towards the front of the foot than heel. I am 18 and pretty fit, so age and poor physical fitness should not be the cause.\n\nI tend to trip a lot, roll my ankles often, and twist my knee frequently, though that happens more in sports/running. Also, my coordination and reflexes are not abysmal, but they are relatively poor. Not sure if it is related to CMT but it is worth mentioning.\n\nBut my balance... it is pretty bad. I cannot stand on one leg for more than 10 seconds, eyes open. Eyes closed, I can hardly last 3. It is not debilitating; I can still ride a bike and maneuver it through tight spots. But when it comes down to strictly standing still when focusing on balance, I sway often, and find myself sometimes having to catch myself from falling, just standing still. Even trying to kneel on one knee is quite a task!\n\nJust out of curiosity, I am wondering if my poor balance is common in mild forms of CMT or if they are two entirely independent things.

The data continues to be encouraging for the higher dose in particular showing modest improvement in ability to function. \n\nThe full press release is here:  (  \n\nTo recap where they are in this trial, Pharnext went through the clinical trials for this drug, phases 1 &amp; 2 with no problems but then in the phase 3 trial they apparently messed up their formulation of the higher dose of the PXT3003, so the people who were taking that had a delay of some months in their treatment. \n\nAccording to this new data, the folks in the other arms of the test (low dose and placebo) also had a gap in their treatment of a couple of months. Possibly the experimenters had to ensure that the low dose had been formulated correctly, possibly they were just trying to figure out what to do next... they do not say why. Maybe it was just a gap between the end of the official trial and the start of their extended coverage where they are letting folks who were in the trial stay on treatment until the drug is commercially available.\n\nAfter the gap in coverage they only had the correctly formulated low dose pills available, so they just gave two pills to the high dose people, effectively unblinding the formerly double blind test. The unblinding plus the gap in treatment is what has lead to the requirement that Pharnext re-run the phase 3 trial before this drug can be approved. \n\nIf you do not want to read through their whole statement, you can skip to the bottom where there is a chart that sums it up: green line is higher dose, blue lower dose, red is placebo group. The dashed line shows the gap in treatment and the solid line shows where treatment was being given. After the gap in treatment, when treatment resumed the placebo group was given access to the actual drug, either in high or low dose amounts, at which time their measurement of function which had been trending slowly down as one might expect from normal CMT progressions begins trending upward like the others. Very interesting, thanks for posting the update. The delay is a real shame, because it pushes back the FDA approval date by another 2 years give or take. I also wonder if even higher doses than the highest tested here would perform even better, a simple extrapolation based on the current results would suggest so. I also wonder what the mechanism of action is, it is a bit voodoo right now but that will certainly be sorted out in the future. Thanks for the update. I am curious to this communities' thoughts on PXT3003 vs some of the other treatments that are coming out. From what I can gather this seems to be the least promising of all the treatments that are in the works but the most likely to be available in the near term. \n\nAlso, sample size is much smaller than I expected in the clinical trials.

At the very least I am hoping it is slowing down my degeneration. Better than taking nothing... Any negative side effects? Do you know if it is placebo or the actual drug?

The feels like temp where I am is over 100 every day. That is hard with the leg braces, which are so hot. So sometimes, I might go without which means limited walking. The heat affects me badly sometimes if I am taking medication for pain, so I try not to if I am going to be outside. Advice? Hydrate. Hydrate. Hydrate. Eat so healthy your doctor wants to give you an award. And exercise like your life demands on it.

I have had two completed now, one five years ago during diagnosis stage, and one this year. If anyone has had multiple, how much had your CMT progressed during how many years? During my first EMG, I had a decent amount of nerves that were slow to work, but still worked. I only had one nerve that was completely unresponsive. My muscles had not yet been effected yet. However, now I only have three totally healthy nerves left. Three muscles do not work at all. Multiple nerves in arms and legs that are close to being unresponsive, and many muscles in arms and legs that are close to not getting/giving signals. My neurologist said it is a pretty drastic decline for a 4.5 year span. If anyone has had multiple EMG's, did your results have better (slower progression) outcomes? We can anticipate it being MUCH worse in 5 years. Everyone is condition can progress at different rates. For example, I have an uncle who was just diagnosed and he is in his 80s! He went his whole life running marathons living a normal life. Also, it can progress rapidly in a short period of time then slowly get worse over decades. My worst period was probably my late teens into early 20's, I lost a huge amount of arm strength at that time. But, it is remained relatively stable since then 25 years later.   \n\n\nI have had  6 EMG's and 2 this year due to an injury on my arm. My neurologist at the MDA clinic has done one of those EMG's this year and compared it to his test in 2016 and he says it is a little worse but not significantly worse. Thank you! It is amazing how this disease varies so much. Between family members, and even the own patient. It all just depends on how much of the protein is produced.

I am thinking I can raise the money and somehow get the test done myself.\n\nI am in the US and on Medicaid. My neurologist thought I might have CMT but Medicaid will not cover the cost of genetic testing. He told me to come back in six months so we can check on things. In the meantime he diagnosed me as having an idiopathic peripheral neuropathy, a condition that is not covered under Medicaid (so now I cannot get referred to see him again).\n\nThanks for your time. Try contacting MDA. They might have a way to get you tested. Anyone in your family been diagnosed by genetic test? I am curious as to whether getting the genetic test might be a problem if you want to go to a different insurance later. Could the genetic test then be proof of a preexisting condition? I know Obamacare prohibited using preexisting conditions but given the current state of affairs... I do not live in the US so my knowledge about this stuff is not great. Did the doctor do a nerve velocity test? This would also confirm if you have CMT or not, and is quick to do...although does involve some pain as they shove 100 mA through your feet and hands. Yeah, the voltage/whatever was delayed by like five milliseconds on my right lower leg/ankle. It was not the same with my other leg, though, so it could be CMT or it could be something else. Honestly I have no idea. It is not always painful. I have done it several times, and it has never been painful to me. Slightly uncomfortable, yes, but that is about it.\n\nThere are some good information about genetic testing here:\n\n Ah, the pain is due the doctor seeing how far he can push it. As the nerves do not conduct properly the current they need to use to get the same response has to be higher. The greater the response the better the results....so if you will let them, they will ramp it up to 100 mA which is extremely painful but gets good results! I am no expert at all, but would not they only do that if you have severe axonal damage? \n\nIn my case, my nerve's response to stimulation by the current was decreased but only slightly, indicating very minor axonal damage. I am not sure what current they used (I am going to go dig through my papers and find out), but since I did not feel any pain I suppose that could be because they got a decent response at a fairly low current? There was a diminished response (~5 ms) in my right ankle/calf but he did not increase the amplitude (I do not think). It was pretty intense but I am afraid I did not take notes so I do not know what he used.\n\nWhen you were diagnosed was the signal delay fairly uniform across your limbs? I do not know if it is strange that the signal was delayed in one of my ankles but not really anywhere else.  Thank you for responding. No, they have not, which makes it strange that CMT was considered by the neurologist. It is to do with the quality of data, like the brighter a light you use, the more clearly you can see. In my case I allowed the doctor to use extremely high current causing my hands to involuntarily twitch and sweat profusely, and from that, they were able to see in the results that the nerve damage from CMT was minimal (4). While the initial testing is uncomfortable, the tests become sharper and therefore painful, but not intolerable, at higher amplitudes.

Been waiting on paperwork.   \n\n\nCost - I am paying nothing out of pocket, but the bill is about $2k for the afo, another $1k for custom orthotics that will survive learning to walk properly again, and then insurance also covering some speacialist shoes to go with it. In saying that, it really looked like it would fit in any shoe. I think the orthotist was just wanting to get extra room due to toes failing at being toes.", "Tendon transfers prove to be effective for CMT. This post is to collate information on tendon transfers, a procedure that is life changing for many with CMT. \nPlease INCLUDE all information about yours in the comments. If you had a tendon transferred:\n\n1. What tendon was it?\n2. Where was it transferred?\n3. On a scale 1-10, how helpful was it?\n\nLet us make this an info thread for people to be able to make wise choices. I will volunteer a counter-example: I chose not to have a transfer. Surgeon said honestly it would be a year before I would be 100% back in action. So I have just used some light carbon fiber leg/ankle supports and foregone the surgery.\nI have no regrets, I am very happy with stable ankles. But I am my own case not anyone else\u2019s. I hope this comment is of some help. My surgeon is recommending tibial anterior transfer by splitting the tendon. \nEvery medical journal I have managed to find online states that it is the tibial posterior transfer that is the most effective. I have requested for another doctor to see me for a second opinion. I am hoping to get some insight from others. Ok so...I have none of the medical jargon. Sorry in advance.\n\nI had each of the tendons that connect at the top of my toes moved to the top (I think) of the bones in the middle of my foot.\n\nPrior to the surgery, when I was asked to lift my foot, you could see each of my toes lift up before my foot moved. After the surgery, my foot lifts \"normally.\" Pins were placed in my toes to straighten them while the bones healed.\n\nSurgery was performed at Egleston in Atlanta when I was 15. I am now 32. This surgery stopped my toes from curling, which had been getting worse. This caused shoes to fit, and gave me a much more normal walking motion. Assuming that surgery is still a thing, I personally recommend it.\n\nI saw doctor John Sladky who was at Emory and is now apparently at UF. My surgeon was Robert Bruce who I guess is on charge of orthopedics at Egleston now. Both were amazing. I think I am definitely going to go with tendon transfer myself in my right foot. I have the astronomical low odds of having both Charcot Marie tooth disease and a tethered spinal cord (latter of which has now been corrected) apparently im either second in my country (Scotland) or the world doc did not specify (would that be cool I feel like that would be cool). My orthopaedic said he could transfer the stronger tendon and move my heel. I am going to enquire about my left foot because it is taken a strange turn, up until recently It would kind of dip a bit but nothing too major it was always stronger but after using my right splint to give my right foot support my left foot has weirdly Gotten worse. Like it feels tired whenever I wear a shoe now and it actually feels warm and hard to lift so I am hoping for some preemptive measures before it goes the way of my right. It is messing me up I feel pretty down so like you I am also keeping my eyes peeled and ears close to the ground when it comes to surgical measures.", "Tools Does anyone have suggestions for useful tools to make everyday life a little easier? So far, I have a tool to assist with buttoning clothes and opening jars. \n\nWork smarter not harder, am I right?

I have found that making sure my desk chair is exactly the right height is important. Other than that, well... \n\nI think there may be some other things that trigger it, but it has been maddeningly difficult to pin them down. Usually if it flares up I try to make sure I am not sitting weird or walking differently or anything and it goes away again after a few days, leaving me unsure if what I did helped or not. I had hip pain for years, I finally had some x-rays done and found out I had bilateral congenital hip dysplasia and ended up needing both replaced. I have never been given a clear answer as to if CMT1A had anything to do with it but no one else in my family had such bad hip issues. I am significantly more active now with my replaced hips even with the CMT. My chiropractor is always working on my hips\u2026I wonder if I have the same thing Find a good orthopedist and get some x-rays done, best way to know for sure if there is anything going on. And like others have said, the sooner you know what is going on the easier it may be to treat.

You are doing a fantastic job building muscle. Good luck on your weightloss journey. What is ur secret ? there is not rlly a secret, there are 3 important factors to build muscles 1. u have to eat more calories than u burn (calorie tracker app is very helpfull) 2. exercise at least 3 times a week regularly (i only skip the gym when i am ill or have an injury) 3. and the most important factor is that u keep on exercising even when u think u make no progress take a pic every now and then and u will see maybe not the biggest difference but progress is progress it does not matter how long it takes for u. If u keep on, those tiny differences will be one day big one Thanks for sharing your result! It is inspiring!!! You dont have to be in a calorie surplus to build muscle!!! You can gain muscle in a calorie deficit as long as you eat enough protein and exercise each musclegroop at least 2 times a week", " Friday Feelings - Small Celebrations Little things that went right this week. \n\nTimes when CMT could not stand in your way.\n\nVictories that you want to share.

Good morning all,\nI do not  have CMT but my wife does and I have watched her struggle with pain for a long time.\n\nOver the past week she has discovered juicing as a potential way to help with her pain . \n\nI am sure lots on this redit can associate that with pain sometimes\ncomes desperation to try just about anything.  She has been on numerous pain medications \nSome of which altered her mental state and made her almost unrecognized as my partner\nand love of my life as it messed with her so bad.  It was after one such episode of drugs that she started\nUsing a 1:1 CBD oil with pretty good success and I was pretty happy and excited for her.\n\nBut this past week something truly incredible has happened and I really almost do not believe it.\nShe is juicing 1 entire head of celery every morning and drinking it ( sounds crazy right ?)\n\nIf anyone in this group has access to a high end cold press juicer ( my wife bought an omega brand)\nI would be curious if you would commit to 1 week of trying this and letting me know if it helps you\nas well !  After 2 days my wife no longer had nerve pain ! I am in a bit of shock to be honest and it \nSounds so incredulous that years of struggle could be erased in a couple of days.\n\nI guess I am in a state of disbelief and if a couple more people would have the same effect \nI would be at peace that this really is working and not just some weird temporary shift in this \nTerrible disease.\n\nAnyway private message me or publicly respond if you have any thoughts .\n\nIf you have access to a juicer (ask your friends ) what do you have to lose \nCelery is cheap and this could possibly change your life.\n\nAll the best This is interesting, I hope someone else has a chance to try it out. Just out of curiosity, do you know what CMT type she has? And how long has she experienced pain? Did she have pain in other parts of the body besides the extremities?\n\nOn the top of my head it could perhaps be explained by a muscle relaxing effect of the juice, or she might have undiagnosed arthritis or a similar autoimmune disease as a comorbidity with the CMT and the pain is caused by that and not the CMT. Celery juice supposedly contain anti-imflammatory components. Then again it supposedly also work as an analgesic so it could also be explained by that. If it does indeed work for neuropathic pain that is pretty significant, and it could be possible to pinpoint the mechanism, depending on how well the components of celery have been described in the literature. Check out CMT hope for healing on instagram! Food can be an amazing medicine for us with CMT! I follow them and they are a great account Thank you for the additional resources.

Numbness loss if sensation in her big toe.  The pretty standard foot drop.  She had been recently having issue with her hands as well.\n\nI think we are in day 6 of no pain medication just celery !!! Still in disbelief!!! It is incomprehensible for me to think that after all of this time and all of the different medications and special braces and inversion beds and tens machines that a freakin vegetable could be her saviour !\n\nI would describe my wife as in a mild state of euphoria.\n\nIf someone out there has the financial means to try this ( juicers are not cheap ) please let me know how you make out . Right!! I am still working on being able to drink it... very strong taste almost like medicine.. probably because it is lol.\nThey say the best way for it to work is to drink it on an empty stomach! Do you have nerve pain and does the celery juice help with it ? My wife is now a week in and aside from one episode of pain has been pretty much pain free. It definatly helps. Aswell as avoiding neuro toxin foods like canola oil and gmo products.\nIm really happy that your wife isnt having pain as much.. such a relief on her. I do have nerve pain but i dont have a juicer and i find the process alittle hard to do myself in a blender. But definatly worth it. Celery juice is a major fad right now. I am not saying that anything positive or negative. It is just really popular right now and trending as a cure-all. Looks like you forgot to switch accounts, and that CMT insta is nothing but celery juice pics.

Hi everyone,\n\nAs someone who suffers from CMT, I have found it to be difficult to find a place with centralized information on many different questions I come across regarding living with CMT. Many times I find myself checking at least 3 different places (Google, Facebook, Reddit) before finding my answer. To simplify this, I would like to build a website where those suffering with CMT or know someone suffering with CMT can go to one place to find personal answers to their questions that are easy to get to.\n\nIf this is something you would find useful, what are some topics/categories you would like to see on it? Any info on nutrition or supplements  that might be helpful would be great! I have recently (11/ 2018) been diagnosed with Type 4 and am overwhelmed by the amount of random information out there. My neurologist is not very helpful I am afraid, and I live smack in the middle of nowhere, so I do not have a whole lot of options when it comes to finding specialists. I am not even sure if the things that keep happening are symptoms of CMT, or something else. So a list of some kind of symptoms would be so very helpful, if that is even possible. Thank you for doing this. Thank you for this! I know there are a couple of studies with a pretty good sample size that asked the patients to report their symptoms. They could be good sources for information for all the \"I experience X, is it caused by my CMT?\"-type questions. All of the information is tabularized and easily extracted, I can dig out some links if you are interested. There are also some very extensive review articles that touches upon most of the quantifiable aspects of CMT, ( by GeneReviews is very good. But this kind of information can be very tiresome and boring to read. What I feel is lacking is something in between the medical literature and everything else out there. I believe very strongly that it is important that the information that is provided to people with CMT is correct, and I have seen my share of bogus and snake oil being presented as fact on various social media and forums dedicated to CMT.\n\nAnother thing that would have been really cool is a website that pool information from many different sources. Reddit, facebook, twitter, the various CMT organization discussion platforms and CMT communities on the internet, the academic literature, books, blogs, you name it. Everything in one place as long as it relates to CMT and with powerful tools to filter, sort and search that information. These are just some thoughts from me on the subject matter and what I would personally would like to see.\n\nEdit: \n\nAnother thing I would love to see is a site that let us the visitors compute their CMT neuropathy score or any of the other CMT scores and tie that score with the genotype to the CMT literature which use the same score. With such a score it is possible to make fairly accurate statements about how the CMT will progress in time, and it will make it possible to tie a lot of CMT research results to you while exclude that which is not applicable to you based on \"where you are\" in terms of the disease progression and relative to the CMT population in general. Maybe it is a bit niche but I think it has potential. It just might be possible to make an app to facilitate capturing the data points needed to compute a score. I second the emphasis on ensuring that the information is correct. I might be able to help check some of it against medical literature (though I do not have access to everything) if needed. However, I am about to go on vacation for 2 weeks so I will not be around much till after that. That is the goal - build a website where all information from forums, community groups, and cmt platforms are in one place and people can filter/sort. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI find it frustrating that I either need to always post my question to get an answer somewhere for more personal day to day things that CMT websites dont attend to OR do a crap ton of research just to find an answer. Im hoping that centralizing information will make it simpler for folks to find info quickly. In terms of tracking progression, a lot of data would need to be collected over a period of time. I have done something like this for myself where everyday I track what i eat, number of hours i sleep, and other components to get a feel of what is helping me with CMT and what is making it worse.   \n\n\nI did reach out to the CMT org once about this and they did not seem like they wanted to cooperate or help at all which is unfortunate. I am in the UK but always had much more help and support from Muscular Dystrophy as opposed to CMT's own organisation. Might be worth reaching out to them. The effect of diet and sleep on CMT is something that is very hard to isolate, so the literature is not very developed on those topics. But the general advice of \"sleep enough and eat a varied and healthy diet\" surely apply to us with CMT as much as anyone else. I am not sure there is much benefit to be had in trying to improve upon those general advice though?\n\nThere are however longitudinal studies on CMT disease progression. Most people who have the same genotype and who had the same disease progression (as measured by a medical scoring system for disease severity classification) at the same age will follow the same curve of muscle loss, nerve slowing, etc. So basically, if you calculate your own score, you can plot your self on one of those curves, and with fairly good accuracy make predictions such as \"in 5 years I will likely have become X% weaker\", or if you have a more serious form, predictions such as \"at age X +- Y years I am likely to need assistance walking\". It can also answer other questions, for instance you might know that some people with your genotype develop problems swallowing, but then based on your score and age you could find out that because your onset was so late you are likely not to be in the group that will experience that problem. Or you may wonder \"am I affected more severely than most with my genotype\"? Stuff like that. I have dabbled with implementing the the Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy score in Javascript, and it is feasible to do so. But whether it is worth it to try and build something around it I am not so sure, it is just an idea I have had. I do not know how much experience you have with developing something like that, but if I were to give any advice based on my experience with collecting data about CMT It would be that you should probably start with a small scope and gradually expand it over time. If you get a prototype up and running you could expand it based on feedback from /r/CMT and other sources. I am working on a system that extract, classify and structure information about CMT from the corpus of academic CMT literature. If you get something up and running I would love to share data with you if you would want to pipe it into your model/site. How are you planning to build it? It could be a nice community project if you are interested in that Im most likely going to use React to build it and I would actually love to make this open source and have people contribute. \n\nIf you are personally interested, let me know and I can get you up to speed with what is happening :) That would be great! Do you use discord by any chance? Maybe we can chat there. If you are also interested in contributing to the project, i would be very happy to do this project as a group! Not to take away from your idea but I find a lot of good information at \n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nCould be a starting place for aggregating information. May I suggest creating a GitHub / Sub account for this endeavor? I will be creating a GitHub repo for this and can share it here :) This is a great idea. Most of the CMT websites are either moaning mothers complaining about their kids and the disease, or a million people squawking bullshit on facebook with no evidence to back them up. \n\nIt would be great to have a website that covers:  \n\n\n* The types of CMT\n* **THE UNKNOWN IMPACTS OF CMT**\n   * Daytime fatigue is the big one here. Claiming it is because of CMT is complete bullshit yet the UK CMT foundation claims it, even though it is unproven and logically makes no sense. \n* The latest research\n   * A tracker for the current trials\n* Tips for living.\n   *  Not everyone has it severely, so having a website dedicated to ankle braces is not any good. \n   * PEDs, though this may get legally sticky if you make the website from the US where most are illegal &gt; React to build it and I would actually love to make this open source and have people contribute.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If you are personally interested, let me know \n\nAre you sure you want to build it truely from scratch and not use an OTS setup? Unless you are going to bury hours into it, starting from scratch may take a long, long time. Hey, JoeBob85, just a quick heads-up:  \n**truely** is actually spelled **truly**. You can remember it by **no e**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. Hello,\n\nI do a lot of software development at work and on my own time. Please share the project on GitHub, I would very very happy tt contribute. Fatigue is a symptom that is often reported by CMT patients in studies, here is a good example: \n\nThere are studies on sleep and CMT that shows that some people with CMT have sleep issues, either due to apnea or other mechanisms. Although it is speculation on my part, I believe that sleep issues could potentially explain some of the daytime fatigue experienced by some people with CMT. delete Yep fatigue is a big issue with CMT, but the current claim is it is because of muscle wastage. That makes no sense as stamina would quickly compensate for this, as it does in athletes. Sleep issues is also where I would put my money for being the issue. There is been evidence of minor RLS in some CMT patients and non-REM parasomnia in others.  If you have sleep issues, I would advise to start with a fitbit, see what the pattern of deep sleep is, and go to a sleep study from there if need be. Coping with the pain and stress caused by the feeling of uselessness. Encourage people to go all the way and do surgery as soon as possible. Pain management and leg braces are useless in my experience. Trying to work through the pain with opiates was a huge mistake that I made. In fact I am still dealing with addiction, so I cannot stress enough: the pain WILL GET WORSE and the pills will get less and less effective. If you feel good when you first get prescribed, it will not last. I read an interesting paper about fatigue and CMT today, which suggests that fatigue in CMT can be understood as a compensatory mechanism in the CNS.\n\n(\n\nSome key parts:\n\n*Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth 1A patients showed lower motor cortex activity during motor planning, with earlier onset and larger prefrontal cortex activity during the late stage of the fatiguing task than healthy controls. These data demonstrate the key role of the prefrontal cortex in the development of fatigue in Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth 1A patients, which may be activated as a compensatory mechanism for the low motor cortex activation, thus reflecting high awareness of movement complexity.*\n\n*In CMT 1A patients there are less motor units available, lower activity in the M1 and sensorial problems than controls; in order to accomplish the task when the muscle fatigue increases, they pre-adapt the executive control for the upcoming action over-recruiting the prefrontal  cortex during  the preparation of the contraction, which  may reflect a high awareness of movement complexity and high demand in the cognitive control. Thus, the peripheral fatigue occurring during this task is associated with the central fatigue arising from high cognitive processing that is required to correctly perform the task  and emotional factors such as  levels of motivation and attention.*\n\nVery interesting read! There is a very good website that exist  There is a lot of great information about CMT and the different types. Also a list of medications that may make the CMT symptoms worse.  There are articles about research as well!", "Pics from my surgery (triple arthrodesis, first metatarsal lengthening, tendon transfer, and Achilles lengthening)  I can post more pics if interested. Before and after or x-ray photos, just let me know. That is so crazy to see. I had something similar done in high school (like 7-8yrs who) so I do not remember too much about it. I have scars similar to where your wounds are. I had mine done in middlle school also.. .grade 7. I do not remember much because of the morphine drip and pain killers., but still have my \"shark bite\" scar lol. Im interested in all of the above! That is some serious surgery you have underwent, how do you feel about the results compared to pre-surgery? I am having mine done later this year, more photos would be great!! Did you get both feet done? I have had 3 similar, outside of my feet though, bone reconstruction. Damn that looks so woah but so cool too. I would love to see the rest of the pictures! Did you have any nails in?? Yes both feet are done at this point. First done in 2012, this one last September. Quality of life is definitely better, almost no pain at all. It is so much better now. I do not take narcotics anymore. There is almost no pain at all, my balance and walking are much better now. I even started snowboarding since the surgery In total I have 5 rods, 2 plates, 2 screws, and one tendon anchor in each foot permanently. That is great! And I am amazed that you can snowboard, I would imagine that it requires great leg strenght and balance? I some times cput on cross country skis in the winter, but I always struggle a lot with my balance going down slopes. In loose snow I do not have enough strenght in my calves to always keep the skis parallell or steer properly, it is very annoying and frustrating. I had almost the same surgery. I did have my toes released last time. I am glad I did. Hi glad i did., I am dad.", "Carpal Tunnel Braces? Hello all, I have been using braces for my carpal tunnel (caused by CMT 1A, finally diagnosed after over a decade of me saying something is wrong) at night (the cushion ones with all the padding to add stability). I have some for during the day but I find they often do more harm than good. It always seems like they are pressing too much and exacerbate the situation. Does anyone have any recommendations for braces that will not drive me crazy, especially while typing? I have HNPP rather than CMT, but a lot of the symptoms manifest similarly.\nI have wrist braces as I have carpal tunnel like symptoms, and I have found similarly that wearing them all the time causes me problems.\nI wear mine to help when the symptoms are at the worse end, but otherwise try to leave them off. This also helps prevent muscle deterioration too.\nFor typing, the best thing I can recommend is speech recognition and a headset. Windows has a seemingly quite good version built in, and it works with virtually every programme I have had to type in. Takes a little getting used to, but over time it is got to the point I am nearly as quick as I was when I could type properly.\nI know this does not answer your question directly, but might help anyway? That is helpful, I have started the process of asking work for this and I have been hesitant so it is good to know it actually works! I also do design so some keyboard / mouse usage is unavoidable. I have CMTX, and carpal tunnel surgery was very successful for me.  The surgeon agreed to do the surgery even though we could not predict the outcome. I am working with a surgeon (but obvs with covid it is been postponed). I have already had two tarsal tunnel releases which helped a touch with some of the worst pains but did nothing with sensation returning (and my foot that is 4 years post surgery is starting to have those pains start again). \n\nHow did you find the recovery? And did you get any sensation return? Thanks! The recovery was quick and easy for me. There was only one small incision on each wrist.  I have read about tarsal release, and carpal is WAY simpler. Sensation was improved, but I did not have much trouble with that back then.  Cramping, pain and weakness all were eased.", "This is why CMT causes me severe depression.  \n\nI played the cello from 4th grade thru 23 years old. I was able to play all over town. Four \u201calternative/rock\u201d bands. Not looking for pity. Just, ya know, had no idea what was coming. Was a blast playing with these groups. Outta nowhere it started, could not do the right finger position\u2019s as well, figured I was losing my touch. Then I could not hold the bow anymore. Just saying, while you can, do what you can before you cannot. Not to mention I loved playing basketball, football, and hiking. How do you all deal with the later onset in life depression of losing these things?", "CMT and exercise! Hey everyone!\n\nI know all of our CMT types range in the physical limitations we have. However, if you are able to hold onto a bar/rail and walk up stairs, I highly recommend getting in the gym and walking up some flights on the stair master. \n\nI use to sprint walk on a treadmill with the highest incline possible and did not see results with improvement of muscle growth. Once I started using the stair master, I have seen a huge difference in my walking and balance. \n\nJust thought I would share. I agree ! I do strength training old school style and have since 14 yrs old . Still squatting 225 for reps and leg press above 600. When I am consistent balance is better and the shooting pains resolve ! I always make a point to take the stairs instead of the elevator when I can. I have noticed during hikes that I tend to fall behind my hiking buddies on long stretches on uneven terrain, but in steep inclines I manage to keep up with them fairly well. I think it is because with CMT1A the demyelination is length-dependent so the distal muscles atrophy first. I seem to be at the stage where my feet and calves are affected but my thigh muscles are still relatively intact. I can also vouch for machines like the stair master, I use one semi-regularly. I also use an elliptical trainer and a balance board. I need to get a balance board. My gym does not have one but I rather have one at home and use it. I do not know how much (or even if) it makes a difference, but I like to think it does. I have one at home, the wooden kind with a ball underneath. But I am considering getting one of those balance pads or one of those balance boards that looks like one half of a yoga ball. The balance board I have can cause pretty jerky movements and I think perhaps a softer mat or that \"yoga ball\" type could be better. Just a thought. I have had some issues with my knees giving out, the balance ball along with calf raises seemed to make a big difference.  My cmt is fairly mild, but I did notice a significant difference. I have a pretty long flight of stairs in my house and I live on the top floor, so stairs are apart of my daily life, lol. \n\nI really recommend yoga for pretty much everyone with CMT who is able to stretch even their fingers. I did it for about a year and my hamstrings really got stretched Working out is key. I am rather inconsistent with working out and feel the difference in pain within a few days. Honestly strength training is at least as if not more important than cardio. Also stretching that Achilles heel and calves are key. The more muscle you start with, the more that can atrophy without negatively impacting your day to day activities. I do a lot of bike riding, it is easy on my feet and gives my legs a killer workout.", "Anesthesia question &amp; looking for opinions Does your CMT effect how different anesthesia works on you? Or maybe the meds you are on do? \n\nYears ago I attempted gas anesthesia for the first time since my symptoms had started. They upped it multiple times and it got to the point that my high anxiety paired with the gas and the fact I was NOT numb at all, made me panic &amp; cry my eyes out. I ended up leaving without the procedure and had to schedule an IV sedation appointment. IV sedation works amazingly well on me. I get it atleast 2x a year for  my back. Local anesthesia, I end up having to ask for more. My (old) dentist that I was with for like 10 years learned over time that I needed more local than anyone else he treats. But because they give me so much, my shaking gets worse (only that day).\n\nAnyway, so I have to get 3 teeth removed because all 3 broke within the past month and I am hurtin really bad. I immediately requested IV, which yes costs A LOT more, but obviously I need it right? The thing is, I cant find anywhere that have a day they can do IV before Feb 20th. I have been in excruciating pain the past week and cannot wait that long. So I am asking how anesthesia effects you all just incase I might be able to do gas and get in sooner. Or is there any other anesthesia options for teeth? Could the dentist do a local nerve block around the 3 broken teeth so you do not feel it? Maybe Valium? Some people just metabolize anesthesia faster than others. I am one of those people. I do not believe it has anything to do with CMT. But it is good to be aware of it and talk any before any procedure.\n\nEdit: I remind my dentist and he keeps checking in with me when I have had anything done. He knows to be ready with extra. He just uses local anesthesia. I do not get gas at all. The local wears off quickly, so he gives me more. But you have to be on top of it and speak up as soon as you feel it wearing off. Everyone who has CMT should be cautious about using nitrous oxide, because it can induce severe vitamin B12 deficiency which in turn can cause neurotoxicity. Always check your vitamin B12 levels before using nitrous oxide and do not use it if your vitamin B12 levels are low.\n\nFor this reason it is categorized as having a \"moderate to significant risk\" on the \n(\n\n Raise these concerns with the anesthesiologist well in advance and try to avoid it if you can, there are good alternatives.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the fancy \"Today I Learned\"-award kind stranger. :) Re: Anxiety with anesthesia\n\nAs you get the nitrous, the dentist will also give you a local anesthetic injection. Usually, the injection contains epinephrine, too, which decreases local bleeding. However, that epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, often gives you a \"rush\" with a palpable increase in heart rate, tremors, and causes anxiety directly. You are not expecting that, and altogether, you will just want out of there!\n\nSo next time you go, ask the dentist to use an anesthetic injection without epinephrine. It just may help. If the dentist says that the epinephrine is too small an amount to cause that, point out that it is a concentration of 1:100,000, the same ER's use to treat anaphylaxis, and the dentist may give several shots of it.\n\n( Oh wow. I have had B12 deficiency for over 10 years. I was getting a shot every month but the past 2/3 years I only get one when I see the dr which is like twice a year nowadays. I absolutely had no idea it had anything to do with my CMT. I am going to go research it now. Thank you so much. My anxiety will not allow me to do it with local. My anxiety is truly crippling and I would be a crying mess  due to overthinking about how much pain I will be in. Yea see that is how I am with just regular little fix-ups like fillings and such. I am just so extremely scared about local or gas to pull 3 molars. I really do not think that would calm me down enough. I have a high tolerance for meds like that due to my years of major experimentation as a teen. Thank you. I will have a chat with them when I see the dentist Monday. I made an appt with a different oral surgeon group in hopes that 1 of them would have sooner availability. It is a good idea to have your levels checked regularly so that they do not dip too low. To be clear, low levels of B12 is not caused by CMT, however low levels of B12 can damage the nerves and with CMT there will already be underlying nerve damage so any extra damage caused by low B12 levels are especially unfortunate for us.\n\nIf you have low levels of B12 and then inhale nitrous oxide, then your B12 levels could go even lower, causing nerve damage.\n\nFortunately low B12 levels are pretty easy to monitor and treat! I am glad you found this informative, stay healthy! I take longer than normal to wake up from general anesthesia, but I have only had it a few times; the longest being an 8 hour surgery. I personally try to minimize the use of anesthesia for myself. There is *always* risk, even for those without neurological deficit.\n\nI was not put out when I had my wisdom teeth removed. No IV. Maybe an oral medication to relax me? The sound of my teeth shattering and the amount of force required by the dentist was a bit uncomfortable, but it honestly was not bad.\n\nI was administered laughing gas (nitrous oxide) once in my life, and that was a mistake. My dentist gave it to me when I was getting braces as a kid. I did not think anything of it at the time, but I noticed that my body started \"lagging,\" so to speak. Limb movements delayed and not very controlled, as if my nerve conduction speeds became even slower than they already are. Very similar to how I get during really high fevers when I get sick. Not a fun feeling. This is me, too. I woke up during a major surgery, so the next one I had, they monitored me and ended up having to give me 2.5x of the anesthesic. \n\nThis is due to Ehlers Danlos Syndrome for me. We are way less sensitive to certain types of anesthesia. I do not know if you also have EDS, but I know several others with cmt1a and EDS. Wow I did not know this! Thank you for sharing! Wow I was on anesthesia a couple of weeks ago for a procedure. Had no idea about this. Of course I mentioned my CMT to my doctors so I wonder if they took that into consideration. I did wake up with severe shivering. Like I could not stop shaking despite the heated blanket the nurse put on me.", "Helios - CMT Bracing: Eric from Los Angeles \"Helios is a game changer fo...

I drink coffee daily but I would like to explore alternatives. I used to drink mate every day, it is been a few years though. I did like effect vs. coffee but I cannot say I noticed anything different that could be CMT related. It is a great drink though! Good to know, thanks! I drank mate for a while. I liked how it was slower to kick in and a steadier energy boost. It also takes longer to wear off and it gave me weird dreams so I stopped using it. I do not think any of that is due to CMT (a couple of my coworkers tried it at the same time, with similar effects) but just my experience.", "Deciding when to get tested My mom has CMT 1A, but I am still undecided about when I want to get tested. I am 23 now and there is definitely things that could be symptoms, but could also be me just being hyper aware since I see first hand what my mom goes through. I know I would like to get tested before I eventually have children, but is there any real benefit to getting tested before then, assuming I am not having major symptoms, aside from just knowing? Until it is time for family planning or taking the new pharma drug for 1A that is due out later this year, no there is no real benefit if you are showing no symptoms.\n\nIf you are seeing some symptoms starting to exercise now and really staying on top of that can go a long way. So in that sense testing could give you the kick in the arse you need to stay on it.  I have been checking in on the PXT3003 study occasionally on ( Do you know if this the same one you are talking about?  Yea that is the only one. Be thankful it is coming, most of us do not have any such thing to look forward to.  Getting the diagnosis can be a powerful experience, even if one is mentally prepaired. And it can take a while to digest a postive result. I would probably reccomend doing it well in advance of starting a family, that way there is enough time to reflect on what it means.\n\nAs for testing, you can do a simple test right now if you want. If you have ever had a reflex, and/or are able to trigger your patellar reflex now, then you likely do not have CMT1A. If you cannot trigger a reflex then you probably do, given your family history of 1A. As u/pmp22 said, i would do it just so you get the processing out of the way. Even though I basically knew I had it (obvious symptoms and my dad had it) the diagnosis was difficult for me to process initially. \n\nYou did not mention where you live but if you are anywhere near the Bay area I HIGHLY recommend getting diagnosed at Stanford with Dr. Day. Their clinic is a model of what healthcare should be, I did not know what I was walking into for my appointment but I saw about 5 different doctors who explained to me how the CMT can affect my feet (what orthotics to get, etc.), nervous system (try to avoid letting your arms or legs fall asleep), breathing, etc. etc. It was fantastic. ", "Musical Instruments Hello all,\n\nI just wanted to ask if anyone has any ideas for musical instruments I can play with this condition. I love to make music but I have been playing guitar for a while now and CMT has begun to rear it is ugly head. Do you know of any instruments I should give a try? Drums! Feel free to DM me. I was diagnosed with CMT 15 years ago and went on to graduate from Berklee College of Music. I have been playing and teaching out in Los Angeles for the past 7 years. While CMT definitely makes some things tricky, I have figured out ways around those challenges. I play trumpet and am teaching myself piano.\n\nI would suggest piano/ keyboard first simply because practicing trumpet at home can be very loud.  That said my hands do get tired pretty quickly, but not nearly as bad as when I was learning guitar years ago.\n\nTrumpet is easy to operate with only the three keys and a little slide action, but like I said it is very loud in a house/ apartment Also, electric guitar, you do not have to press the strings as hard I started drumming when I was 7 and now I am on the UConn drumline! Definitely recommend. The guitar strings were too hard for me with CMT. I would say guitar. I have cmt 1A and while I cannot do some of the more technical sweep picking style playing anymore I am still able to play lead guitar fairly well. Guitar is also an excellent workout for finger and forearm strength I have played piano my whole life and my PM&amp;R specialist actually thinks it is the reason my hands have hardly been affected, especially compared to the rest of my body. I quit for a while in college and my hands got noticeably worse so I bought a key board and try to play at least 30 minutes a day and nearly all of the dexterity has come back. It is not a cure all but keeping up your finger strength is incredibly important. The only thing about piano is that if you are starting late, it is really important to make sure you maintain proper wrist and hand technique to prevent other issues. Me too, I have quite mild cmt,  and I have always wondered if my hands would have been worse off if it was not for the piano.", "Is anyone taking Modafinil? Is anyone taking Modafinil/Modiodal/Modalert or whatevs for fatigue? No, what is that and what do they do? It is a central stimulant drug used for narcolepsy and shift work sleep disorders. A friend of mine with multiple sclerosis takes it to combat fatigue associated with her MS, I was wondering if neurologists are also prescribing it for people with CMT-associated fatigue.\n There is a study that found that it had good effet on a couple of patients with CMT. The sample size is low so the results should not be taken at face value but it interesting none the less. It would be interesting to hear what results others who might have tried it gets. For me the fatigue is one of the most noticeable symptoms and getting something for it could really improve my quality of life.\n\n Yup I have been on it for 12 months. It is not very affective as it does not resolve the cause of fatigue.\n\nI have found that 100 mg just about stops me falling asleep, and 200 mg keeps me more alert than normal, but I still need to nap in the afternoon as all it does is overdrive your adrenal system to keep you awake.  Thanks for replying! Can I ask if your neurologist is prescribing it to you?  Thanks so much for the info. And awesome username!\nI have tried it for a few days now, and it is amazing how much it has helped with my fatigue, but I am not sure if that is just a honeymoon fase or if the effects will last if I keep taking it regularly. Good question.  So no, my neurologist is a dumbass who is in denial about daytime sleepiness (which is very different to fatigue but most doctors do not realise this). \nI was under an endocrinologist who prescribed them, and my sleep consultant has kept the prescription going.  Oh cool. Not cool about your dumbass neurologist though. Did he not want to prescribe it because he did not think you suffered from daytime sleepiness? Or because he did not think it would help you? \nSorry for all the questions, but what did the endocrinologist prescribe it for? My neurologist is just lazy and not very smart. All she wants to do is analyse if your condition is stable or deteriorating. She has no intention of improving day to day quality of life and sadly she is at UCL so it is not a good sign.\n\nThe endocrinologist prescribed it because he is wanted to treat the daytime sleepiness and modafanil works well with some folks (narcoleptics) but less so with people with sleep apnea etc. I am still on it whilst I am being investigated by my sleep consultant, but that is taking forever due to the broken NHS in the UK.", "how to cope growing up with cmt hi um this is probably kind of rude because im basically saying this condition makes you a freak but it does not idk but can someone please just tell me how you coped growing up and how to idk be as normal as i can with cmt, im 13 and have type 2a ive been diagnosed since i was a baby as my older brother and mum also have cmt but they could always cope so well but i am just constantly feeling awful about myself and everythint because of cmt, i have 3 older brothers (eldest has cmt hes 22) but onr of them is my brother 11 months older than me and this might sound rude but i hate that he got to be the normal one that could run, jump, stand properly walk do everything normally and I had to be the one stuck with cmt and i dont mean to be rude but cmt has just ruined my life ive never been fully happy because i always know ill stick out like a sore thumb and no matter how hard i try ill never be able to do most things and properly have a childhood because im constantly held back, i cant do anything and i hate it please idek what to do anymore because i always feel awful and hate everything because of this and i knoe this is a disgusting thing to say but i hate my mum for having kids knowing theres a chance she will pass it on knowing how hard it is to live with and ill never forgive her for that. I am 39 and have been dealing with cmt from like age 10ish? Middle school and high school were tough for sure, but you are not CMT... you are a person with thoughts, feelings and talent outside of your disability. You are not a freak, you just are not typically developed. Now the real good shit. After high school most people grow up and do not feel the need to ridicule someone different.   \n\n\nI had the similar thoughts about why my parents would have kids knowing there is a chance. I am personally not going to have kids... I may adopt someday. It does get easier to cope with over time.  I hope you have good friends to talk too... that can make it easier. Lots of people have \"invisible illnesses\" and might feel comfortable talking to you about it if you bring it up... I rarely talk about my CMT or experiences unless someone has been extremely rude or genuinely seems interested. I hope you find some happiness :) Hey there, 28 year old here. I can relate to what you are feeling. I am one of three but the only one of my brothers with CMT. My older brother runs marathons and my younger brother was a varsity athlete in high school without even trying very hard.  I love my brothers very much, but it is hard not to feel some jealousy when all you want is the same opportunity they were given. \n\nMy advice to you, do not feel guilty when you are upset about your CMT. It stinks, no arguments here. I remember feeling a lot of the same things you described when I was your age.  I had to wear a back brace for years before your age, and I hated feeling left out at recess and gym class. \n\nAfter a while I decided I did not want to feel mad and sad about it all the time anymore.  So to make the best out of it, I started reading lots of books and playing chess and video games.  This helped make me happier. When you are happier, it becomes easier to make friends despite some of your differences from them. \n\nI still feel sad and mad about my CMT sometimes. And I probably always will. But I am also grateful for all of things I do have and all the things I can do.  If you can focus on all of the things that you can do rather than what you cannot, this will help with some of the pain you are feeling.  \n\nAnd I would apply this to your mom if you can. You are upset that she had kids knowing they could have CMT. That is actually a rational thing to feel. But try to focus on all the things you love about your mom. All the fun times you have had and anything she does for you.  I am sure if it was up to her, you would not have CMT. So do not hold it against her too harshly. I am 41, and did not know I had CMT until 3 year ago but I always knew I was very, very different. Here is the thing, the best friends I made in high school are my best friends now, and my husband looks past everything and loves ME. And if you accept it, and own it, it is so much better. Hard to believe, but true You are not rude for feeling this way at all, do not beat yourself up for feeling this way because we have all felt it at some point. CMT sucks and life is not fair. It is not fair that we inherited this disease. What the others are saying is true - life does gets better when you accept the fact that CMT is part of your life and forever will be. Maybe you cannot play sports or do some physical things, but there are so many other things you can do! I used to resent my sister for not having CMT and being super athletic, but there are good qualities about me that she does not have, and I am sure there is the same for you with your brothers. You just have to find what you are good at and what you enjoy most. You also will meet people who do not care about your CMT at all, and you can live a very happy life. Plus, when you grow up, sports become a lot less important. :) I know you resent your mom for passing it onto you, but if she did not have you then you would not be here, and the world would be worse off without you in it! I did not know I had it when I was your age, but I definitely could not play sports. I constantly felt like I was doing something wrong because all my friends were able to run fast and jump and balance and I could never do those things. Gym class was a nightmare, I was made fun of constantly. \n\nI did not know how to cope back then, honestly I would pick on other people to make me feel better about myself. Eventually I found things I could outcompete my friends at and I took pleasure in beating them at those things (video games, poker, board games, etc). I got a lot of confidence from winning. \n\nIf I had known I had CMT I would like to think I would have coped by taking control, doing the right stretches and exercises, and focusing on my mental health. It might help you to have someone to talk to about it, if that is not your brother or you mom then they could help you find a therapist that specializes in chronic illnesses. All your feelings are very normal and there are clinicians trained in helping people deal with those feelings. \n\nLike you, I resent my parent with CMT. My Dad knew he had it and he never told my mom and he never even told me. I had to find out on my own at 18 years old. I will never forgive him for it, but he is also done a lot of other bad things to me. I also find it hard to grasp why someone with CMT would choose to have kids knowing it is a coin flip their child winds up with a disability. Those are normal thoughts and feelings to have. I hope you do not let it get in the way of your relationship with you mom though. \n\nThings will get better, adolescence can be really hard for those of us who are different from the crowd. I promise it gets better, it does for everyone. First of all, it is totally okay that you are feeling this way. Feelings are neither good or bad, they are just information about the things that matter to us.\n\nSecond, you are not defined solely by your disability. You are a whole person with many traits and talents. Rather than dwelling on all the things you cannot do, try to focus on what you can do. For me, that was developing my mind, but it is important to find something that matters to you.\n\nThird, knowing your limitations is helpful and important, but it is equally important to find out what those are for yourself. Do not let anyone tell you that you cannot do something because of CMT, no matter how well-intentioned (unless it is your doctor). If there is something you want to try, try it anyway. Sometimes you will surprise yourself. I am 32 and definitely felt this when I was your age. Middle and high school were probably the hardest times in my life. But because I could not do things other kids could, I got really into watching movies, reading books, and making art. By the time I got into college I found other kids who were also really really into those same things and thought I was really cool and interesting. Also, it seemed like everyone played sports and it was a big part of folks identity, and I really felt like I missed out on being on a team, but once you leave school, literally no one continues to play sports. \nIt is totally ok to feel mad and sad, but for me it really did get better. We all have days where we hate this thing and days where it does not matter.  Whilst it is a big part of your life and will always remind you in making things hard, it does help to have hobbies you enjoy.  Nothing says you cannot find things to enjoy.  Getting in exercise and working out plays a great part in my habits.  It is shocking to hear, but with CMT you can actually workout and have muscles.

I did this as a child but I do not believe they are related.", "I have a question My family has a history of CMT on my fathers side. I do not really remember how it affected my grandfather since he passed when I was young and I have been told that my grandfathers sister(my great-aunt I guess?) was in a wheelchair by her 30's from it.\n\nMy dad 67 now and somehow he is still trucking. Even with almost no control in his hands this man STILL holds a Technical Writing job which is 100% computer based, does his own car repairs, gardens, and walks up and down a 16 step flight of stairs multiple times a day.\n\nAny way, today while I was digging through various dental disorders I came across osteogenesis imperfecta. While reading through it is symptoms I started picking up on a lot of things I have noticed in not only my dad but myself as well. He has the blue tinge on the whites of his eyes, his hearing is nearly gone to the point that he should learn sign langue(but you know with the whole hands do not work thing), his spine has curved so much he has a hump, and I know his teeth are in pretty rough shape.\n\nSo what I was wondering is if anyone knows of a common link between osteogenesis imperfecta and Charcot Marie Tooth. Being that they are both pretty uncommon disorders what are the chances that you could be diagnosed with them together.\n\nAnd then also on a side note, my whole life pretty much I have been worried about whether or not I will start showing signs of CMT and now that I am 24 and have had 2 epidurals(this is what triggered the onset for my dads) I just wanted to know the early signs and symptoms that you guys had and what age you were at your diagnosis? I was 25 and all the sudden my feet burned like the dickens while directing my first feature film. It reached the point where I could barely walk. \n\nMine seems to come in episodes. I am almost 32 now and standing is the biggest hurdle. But my arms and ears and eyes and neck and scalp and legs are all starting show real problems. \n\nI can still do most things. But it is hard not to be mad at the world or mad at my Dad. I really love the outdoors, my career, and intense exercise, but much of what I love most is slowly slipping away. \n\nJust trust me and live each day. Love life while you can. Should you never develop symptoms you will have nothing to regret. Should you develop symptoms you will be glad you listened. \n\nI try and imagine that I am going to die soon. For me it helps really look at the world through thankful eyes.  CMT severity is horrible to try to predict.  In my family - direct and first cousins - it has ranged from wheelchairs by 10 to unnoticeable until 70.  For some anesthesia seems to acerbate the symptoms yet for others it does not.\n\nThat said, in my family one seems to have either CMT **or** osteogenesis imperfecta.   For whatever reason they seem to be exclusive.\n\nMay this help you. &gt;So what I was wondering is if anyone knows of a common link between osteogenesis imperfecta and Charcot Marie Tooth. Being that they are both pretty uncommon disorders what are the chances that you could be diagnosed with them together.\n\nThere is no connection between the two diseases that would suggest an increase in the risk of having one if you had the other as far as I understand. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by mutations in genes that are located in different loci on the same chromosome and in many cases also on different chromosomes from the loci and regions of CMT mutations/deletions/duplications. Interestingly enough, a mutation in a gene called COL1A1 is the cause OI Type I, and this gene is located pretty close to the region of Chromosome 17 that is duplicated in CMT 1A. But it is still far enough apart that there is no overlap, and thus no association between the two.\n\nHowever, if your father has one or both of these diseases, you could inherit one or both of them.\n\nThe inheritance pattern of CMT depends on the genotype, but the most common type is CMT 1A. CMT 1A is an autosomal dominant disease, which means that there is a 50% chance of inheriting it if one of your parents have it. Other forms of CMT are autosomal recessive or X-linked.\n\nLike CMT, Osteogenesis imperfecta is also caused by different genotypes, but because of your description of his symptoms and the fact that he is still alive we can exclude many of the genotypes. Based on your description it seems likely that he has type I or III, which are both inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.\n\nSo if your father has CMT 1A and OI, there is a 50% chance that you have both.\n\nIf you want some more information on OI, this is a good article:\n\n Thank you guys for all the information. I am going to schedule a genetic test from Invitae soon. Since I have Medicaid there will not be any charge which is amazing as I would never be able to afford it out of pocket. If I come back positive then I am going to have my kids tested as well.\n\nOn another note, is this what a hammer toe looks like?\n\n", "Do you ask to keep your shoes on entering other houses?

I did not mention it but stretching before bed helps me sleep more soundly too, all the usual leg stretches. Please excuse the inquiry, but only under your feet? I like the idea of using blankets. I have been sleeping with a kingsize pillow under my lower legs. The downside is that I am constantly changing positions throughout the night and the pillow naturally takes a beating.\n\nHow high would you roughly guess your feet are elevated above your, what, knees or thighs or ...? The alcohol wakes you up or the need to pee? \n\nI ask only because in addition to taking ibuprofen PM table each evening, I need, due to the pain, about 2 shots of Vodka in some mixer before bedtime just to get the pain down to a tolerable level that will allow me to fall asleep.\n\nWith that, I often still toss and turn most of the night. Due to not only the alcohol but the mixing solution, and being older, an enlarged prostate, I am often awakened 4,5,6 + times a night either with pain or with the real or pseudo need to pee. An enlarged prostrate, being elderly, with CMT, wow, amazed I am still here. I do not wake up to pee, it is just that the alcohol makes me restless, and that is fairly commonly accepted, regardless of CMT. \n\nThis is going to sound weird, but, do you breathe through your mouth at all when you sleep? I have been reading a book called Breath by James Nestor and in it he describes how breathing through your mouth messes up the hormones that are suppose to suppress your need to pee while you sleep. I have been taping my mouth shut with micropore tape every night to force myself to breathe through my nose, it is helped my quality of sleep a little. It is basically free... worth a shot. Prior to my CMT reaching this extreme, alcohol prior to sleeping was never an issue. Unfortunately, regardless of every pain medicine and medicine cocktail, the pain is even worse. Now, alcohol prior to bed in addition to acetaminophen PM at bedtime is the only way I can get even a few restless hours of sleep.\n\nAs far as breathing through my mouth while sleeping, I have no idea. Thanks for the suggestion, I will look into micropore tape and breathing while sleeping. \n\nNow, any suggestions on the typical old man problem of enlarged prostrate, which is a big problem with signalling the false, or real, urge to pee?! I do not move a lot at night, so I find it most comfortable to keep it under my calves. As for height, I keep them above my heart, as my blood tends to pool without the assistance of external forces, such as gravity or pressure.", "CMT and Testosterone ", "Just found this group! Hey guys! I am a 23F and have lived with CMT my entire life. Until a year ago, it was just labeled Idiopathic Peripheral Neuropathy, but my uncle had a suspicion and I had genetic testing done to confirm CMT1A. My son also has it, he is 3. For the most part it has not effected me horribly other than not being able to run, tripping a lot(foot drop, but I rarely wore my braces growing up), and low energy. But about 5 years ago I slipped on ice and snapped a tendon in my right heel. Over the course of 4 years I tried to find out what was wrong and how to fix it, but no surgeon, neurologist, or podiatrist was helpful in the slightest. This caused me to be practically immobile, and I had to drop out of school and could not work. Last year I found a surgeon in Galveston who helped me fix my foot through tendon transfer, muscle transfer, and fusions. For the first time in years I am able to walk without pain, workout, and even stand on one foot. I know I am lucky, because I was told I would be in a wheelchair by 15. I am here to meet others with this condition, get ideas on how to work with my son since his is worse than mine, and to share what I have done to make life a little easier.  Welcome and I am very glad to hear that you are able to walk without pain. That is a huge deal. Do you know what type of CMT that you and your son have? That may help you with managing symptoms. I am a number of years ahead of you, but I can say that without a doubt, exercise is key to maintaining what strength I have. I was very dedicated to my Pilates workout for about ten years, then life intervened and I have been trying to put myself back together in recent months. I regret not prioritizing that over everything else. I would be in a much better situation now. Keeping your weight in a normal range will help also. I am tried and have a bit of a flu bug so making it short for now. Yeah, we both have CMT1A. Neither of my parents have it, but my mom and granddad have MS so we are wondering if it mutated from that or something. I absolutely agree with the exercise. I used to go hiking and bowling all the time before my injury and I am sure it is what kept me out of a wheelchair. I have recovered from my surgery enough now that I have been working out a few times a week and can definitely see improvement in my ankle, knee, and core strength.  Oops, sorry. I missed that in your first post \ud83d\ude2c Good job on the exercise. Hi I know this is an old post, but what type of tendon transfer did you have?", "Footwear and AFOs Just wondering what is your shoe of preference if you have AFOs? I like an Italian brand of shoes called Aku. They have really good quality shoes (full grain leather, vibram soles, hand made in Europe). Also they make \"orthopedic\" versions of their shoes which leaves extra space for afos/soles. I get the orthopedic version from my orthopedist, I do not know where else to get them as I have not seen the orthopedic versions anywhere else. Also I buy wide sneakers (E), I like Nike and New Balance. Most shoe shops offer extra wide and wide sneakers.\n\nMy biggest struggle is not fitting afos etc, but the fact that my soles wear out extremely quickly on the sides. Luckily my orthopedist clinic changes soles for free (yay for socialist medicine :)). Its a bit far for me to get there though, so I have tried to fix the wear on my soles myself using shoe goo (it is a product called show goo), but this has not been successful. I have reached the point now where I am seriously considering buying everything I need to change soles with professional \u00e9quipement myself just like a semi pro shoe repairman. It cannot be THAT hard. And I am sick of having to change soles every 2-3 months. Reebok Classic Nylon, flat wide soles and I like the look. My orthotist swore by Hoka One One and I finally got some. I regret not getting them sooner. My AFOs have chewed through a pair of Asics two pairs of Born leather boots, which lasted me about 4 years between them. I even had them re-soled with Vibrum and that lasted about 6 months.\n\nNow I wear either my L.L.Bean hiking boots, or Doc Martins (both men's shoes.) Even larger-size women's shoes end up being too narrow, and I really prefer anything that can take the wear on the sides and has additional ankle support. ", "My feet Pre surgery and Post Surgery  Heyo, ive never posted anything before so im probably really bad at this but i thought I would share with you guys this picture showing the difference a day before and 2 weeks after recieving corrective surgery. I have got CMT1A (im pretty sure) and after many years of seeing doctors who had only made the disease worse for me i finally found a doctor who had an idea of what the disease is/does and got this surgery done. But yeah basically i just wanted to share this so people can see the difference in my feet Pre surgery and Post surgery and maybe decide whether they would want to get it done themselves (depending on what type of cmt they have and the level of their foot drop). I have some, not sure of your situation but I walk alot, did this affect your ability to walk? Better or worse? Did you have a triple arthrodesis? \n Back before the surgery i did do a fair bit of walking and let me just say my balance was horrid, walking in a straight line was a challenge and standing still? Yeah right. Apart from that i would trip and fall every so often and if i were to walk a really really long distance I would be out of it the next day. Right now im only 7 weeks post surgery so im only just starting to do barefoot walking but i can 100% say that one thing ive noticed so far is that my balance is alot better, but with walking distances right now i dont really know yet, I will be sure to get back to you in about a month or so after i start uni again ( doctors said i should be walking without assistance by then ). No i cant quite remember the name of the operation i had, I will be sure to get back to you after i find the paperwork I got a bilateral cavovarus reconstruction and tendon transfers Update? So im a bit over 6 months post operation now and i can definitely say my walking has improved a bunch. Heres some of the larger changes which i have noticed:\n\n\u25cfMy balance is a lot better than what it was before, i can actually stand still now ( before i would constantly lose my balance so standing in the one spot was not really a thing for me ) and after a few weeks of physio have managed to be able to stand on one foot for about a minute without falling over.\n\u25cfI do a fair amount of walking on a daily basis and what I have noticed is that i can actually walk further than before without getting any pain or as much fatigue.\n\u25cfI can actually run now! I forgot that that was a thing and about a month ago i started running because i was late to something and only realised after that i had just actually ran.\n\nThose are some of the larger things i have noticed, my surgery was December 12th and i started being able to walk without assistance in around early March so I have had a bit of time with my new feet and can say that im pretty happy with them now.", "CMT Specific Exercise CMT SPECIFIC SMALL GROUP TRAINING SESSIONS AVAILABLE NOW! Go to  to sign up\n\nThis is a 2 month, CMT specific program, which will consist of weekly small group training sessions with Tedashi. You will be paired in groups of 3-4 with others who have the same mobility level similar to yours. Each class will have customized classes for CMTers at these different levels, where you will work on building up your Strength, Stability, and Coordination. What sort of intensity will the workouts be and is there an age range in mind? No idea. But they say they will pair you with people similar to your ability level. The level will match where you are at. It is $273 for 8 classes if anyone is curious on price and does not want to click through. If anyone goes through this I would be interested to hear how you find it. This should have been higher in the post. I shared this because a friend with CMT says she got a lot of help from this trainer but I did not realize it was quite so high. I assume that they are giving you a program to do the rest of the week because working out one day a week is not enough, but I am not sure. Curiosity got the better of me. Having never heard of these people before, and looking at the rest of the classes they offer, and not finding anything on their site that speaks to their qualifications to conduct such a class, I emailed them requesting a link(s) for their background and qualification to conduct CMT exercise classes.

I\u2018d say it has helped me tremendously however when I wake up in the mornings I still feel like I got hit by a bus.  It takes me a while to get out of bed and I can barely walk first thing in the morning.\n\nI am trying to get back into the workforce but If I am really honest it takes all I have to do basic choirs  around the house.

An AHI of 87 is awful I hope they got your cpap machine at a better pressure now. I do not have sleep apnea but have non-REM sleep parasomnia instead. That was about 25 waking episodes per hour and requires meds to fix it.

I use nasal pillows and yes over the last 6 years we have been able to dial in the pressure. Yes I had a sleep study done recently to check for Central Sleep Apnea and did not have that.  I will  have to talk to my doctor about non-REM parasomnia so I can rule that out. Thanks for sharing. I hope you can find some kind of work, I am doing telemarketing while I finish school.

I am 19 and have been lifting on and off since I was 16. At 16 I was going through some dysmorphia and dropped to 135 lbs. (I am 6 foot) I am now 160 and have put on good muscle on my arms and back. Have not noticed as much for chest but I have honestly neglected leg day. I can only use leg machines and a smith machine for squats so I have been putting it off. My cmt is not too bad. I have poor balance, a shitty run, fucked up feet but other than that I am fully independent. I would like to see if anybody has successfully put on muscle mass to a good degree without roids. Not opposed to roids but I am still young and do not want to mess with my hormone levels. My goal is around 180 with 12% bf. right now I am at 160 with 16%. There are a lot of people on here who refuse to believe that this is possible for cmt so i ask you to fuck off. My arms are much larger than they used to be and I know I can get bigger. The only body part that will not grow that much would be my legs. So are there any serious people on here that can offer me advice? Now, I am a woman so my ability to put on muscle mass is different, but yes, you absolutely can. You need to start prioritizing leg day. It will be THE thing that makes the CMT progress more slowly. Eat a good diet, lots of protein, and lift consistently and the muscle will come. You should be able to build muscle everywhere except your calves and forearms. Be careful not to get too bulky and heavy as you might have trouble carrying the extra weight. I lifted weights until I was about 26 (lazy) with no issues. Here is what my doctor told me, you can absolutely put on muscle, just not in the areas that are heavily affected by cmt, those areas are more about maintenance, and that you should not compare your results to someone who does not have cmt as that person inevitably will have different results than you.", " Friday Feelings - Small Celebrations Little things that went right this week. \n\nTimes when CMT could not stand in your way.\n\nVictories that you want to share. I posted a picture of me cooling down while canoeing.\nThe CMT UK charity runs specialist adventure activity holidays for teenagers. This year we had 5 new people join in the fun and there were 3 wheelchair users.\n\nWe all went canoeing, recliner cycling, zipwire, and a lakeside walk/push. In the evenings to relax we did crafts, orienteering and quizzes.\nEveryone took part in every activity and took turns helping to push the wheelies. The teamwork, bravery and resilience was absolutely heart-warming.\n\nI love it so much and I doubt I would have done these things without CMT. Yeah of course it sucks most days but it does open us up to different opportunities. That sounds like such a great program!", "Diagnosis w/o genetic test Hi, \nI have CMT, and I am not sure which type. I have heard that you can sometimes narrow down which type based on who else in the family has it, does anyone know if this is true?  \nI have wanted genetic testing but have not been able to get it yet and I would like to have at least some idea of which type because there are new treatments for some subtypes.  \nThanks for any info!\n\nFyi, in my family both males and females are affected, both my sisters,  my mother,  uncle, nephew,  and son seem to have CMT. You can often narrow it down a little by looking at the family history. X-linked types for instance can not be inherited from father to son and will usually affect males more severely than females. It is also possible to make educated guesses based on age of onset, which nerves that are affected, if there are transient episodes of weakness, the absense or presence of pressure palsies and so forth. But doing that kind of differential diagnosis is unprecise and requires a comprehensive understanding of CMT and how it presents. Before we had gene tests and could measure the NCV this was pretty much how it used to be diagnosed, and the result was that patients with different genotypes but similar symptoms were all given the same generic diagnosis.\n\nThe NCV test was a small revolution for CMT diagnosis and it is still widely used today. If you test your NCV a neurologist will most likely be able to find your genotype using it and your family history alone. A gene test is often not needed, and is often done simply to confirm the diagnosis. If traditional methods provide conflicting data, a gene test is also warranted. Thanks", " Wednesday Wonderings: Quick CMT Questions Have any little questions, small things you wonder: is this CMT related? \n\nDoes anyone/everyone deal with this? \n\nHere is your place to ask! My mom and grandma have CMT - not entirely sure on the type - I think it is CMT2. It primarily affects their feet. It started to effect both of them late twenties/early thirties. My sister and I have not been tested. I think I am starting to develop signs but I am not to sure - I think it is time for me to see a neurologist but because of Covid I have put it off. I have just turned 28. \nMy feet are so numb and cold. When they get cold it takes hours for them to warm up. I have always hated socks but now cannot tolerate bare feet. My circulation is just terrible. I do not think I have noticed any weakness - but this year has been a weird one and I have just had a baby so have been somewhat distracted. \nMy question is: did anybody else notice circulation/ numbness/coldness as one of their first signs? Cold feet were one of my earliest symptoms, I think. I use one of those rice-filled heating pads you can warm up in the microwave to heat my feet up in the winter. It is a lot faster and more effective than waiting for them to warm up on their own. Thank you I will try this- big socks just are not cutting it. Foot pain was / is one of my earliest memories. Then pain below the knees, like a constant, searing, electric current. A burning that would not abate. Keep me awake all night as a small child and worse as an old man. Cold, numb, a weird, hard to describe tingling numbness but i could feel yet a numbness.\n\nI have CMT2D, as well as 2 other genetic neuro problems. It only took 65 years to get a diagnosis. Covid has prevented me from seeing the specialist I need to see, in a timely manner.\n\nI am now 66.5. I have learned the specialist I need to see, those that, aledgeably, are specialist in CMT often have a backlog of several months. Prior to covid, my first appointment with a Center of Excellence M.D. was 6 months out. Then, pushed another 6 months due to covid.\n\nIf you are considering seeing a CMT neurologist, you might want to consider starting before you 'need' to see a specialist that KNOWS about CMT.\n\nGood luck! I am 31 and have type 1A. I definitely noticed weakness and balance problems before my cold feet,  but man they get colder and colder each year. I swear somehow they are colder than the ambient temp. \n\nHere is a tip from my neurologist - warm up your core body temperature to drive blood out of your core and into your feet. Wear a jacket or even a hat and your feet will warm up. Personally I have found this to be uncomfortable but it does work. Many posts about cold feet, but does anyone deal with the opposite? It can be an average temperature day and it will be like my feet alone have a fever. I thought it was just sensory at first, but the skin is warmer to the touch. Anyone here have cmt x and hand problems?", "Haglund's deformity It feels like some bone on my right heel has an enlargement of the bony section of the heel.\n\nI guess it might be ( Have any of you got this problem? And how did you try to fix it? I have it on one of my heels, after seeing a few specialists I was told surgery is the only way to reduce the size and it was not recommended for me.\n\nFor me it occurred at the same time I developed Sural Neuralgia and calcification in my Achilles tendon. That all caused severe pain but is under control after I had a series of PRP injections. The heel lump remains and I have had to have new shoes made that alleviate the pressure. \n\nI would suggest seeing a podiatrist first up, although a sports physician ended up being my saviour. I was never told I had Haglund's, but I did have issues from an injury in my left foot - coupled with the CMT and years of walking on it badly had stretched the tendons and messed up my heel bone. The way it affected me sounds a lot like Haglund's, with this hitting shoes and sticking out at the back.\n\nI had a modified ( in 2015 and they shaved down a portion of my heel so that my weight landed correctly and it did not rub my shoes anymore. That was in 2015 and since then it is been fine.\n\nSurgery's not a great recommendation, but talk to your doc and see the options.

My mother was recently diagnosed with CMT1A at the age of 64.  This has been a complete shock to us as she has not had any obvious symptoms. She recently had numbness in her feet and went to see her doctor. After that she was seen by a neurologist fairly quickly, went through the standard testing and was diagnosed. She has not had genetic testing done yet. Still waiting for that.  No one else on her side of the family has CMT that we know of. My sister (age 44) and myself (age 40) do not have any mobility issues currently but now that we have researched the disease we seem to have some of the symptoms such as muscle cramps. My sister toe walked as a kid. In the last few days I have noticed my feet and legs have a warm sensation while sitting. I do not notice it while standing or walking though. I do not know if I am just psyching myself out or just now paying attention to what is going on with my body. \n\nI understand there is a 50% chance that we could have it and wondering what the best course of action for us would be? Should we just wait for my mother\u2019s genetic test results which could be anytime next year or should we see our doctor ASAP and get tested?\n\nThis is all just happening so suddenly and I am having a very hard time coping. I have got 3 kids and worry that I have unknowingly passed this on to them. My middle son who is 9 walks on his tip toes and has been for years. I never thought anything of it before but now Im so worried about him. \n\nSorry for the long post but I just needed to release all this somewhere. I have done so much searching online but there is not much info about adult onset. Anyone else on here diagnosed middle age or later?\n\nTl;dr my mother has recently been diagnosed with adult onset CMT1A. I am worried my sister and I will have it as well. Extremely worried and stressed that my kids will have it too. A lot of us in here have been symptomatic since early childhood.  Be thankful that your mom has been able to live a full live thus far with little affliction from the disease.   Not to diminish what you are going through because it sucks no matter when you get it.   But there are a lot worse diseases or medical issues that you could be diagnosed with in your 60s.\n\n\nSome of what you are describing there about yourself could be purely mental.  Lots of people cramp, etc.  I would not stress overly about it.  In my opinion, wait until your mom gets the genetic testing and if positive then see a neurologist yourself.  If she does have it then you should probably get tested to see if there is any chance your kids may have it.  No sense in having your kids worry about it if you do not have it yourself.\n\n\nIf you do have the disease, there really is not much that you can do for your children if they are not symptomatic.  You can have them see a neurologist and be tested, but there is not any treatment for the disease only for the symptoms such as ankle braces and surgery.  There are some potential drugs in the pipeline that may slow or stop progression, but we are at least a few years off.\n\n\nOne thing to consider though is your future grandchildren.  It is possible to avoid passing CMT onto your children using Invitro Fertilization.  My wife and I used to to ensure I did not pass CMT onto my kids (I have a more advanced case of the disease than most).  If you do have CMT and your kids are not symptomatic, it may still worth them being tested before they have kids.  My brother was tested, and was negative for the disease before he tried to have kids. Hi there! Using a throwaway because my coworkers know my main account.\n\nHonestly, it does sound a bit like you are psyching yourself out. My entire (huge) family has CMT, and for the most part we have all managed to live happy, fulfilled lives. I am in my 30s and use orthotics and have some cramping. Otherwise my life is normal.\n\nYes, some people are very severely affected by CMT, and you will see that represented on this subreddit. But statistically most people who have CMT have relatively mild symptoms throughout their life, to the point where some people are never diagnosed because they do not even realize there is an issue. Although we cannot know the future, the fact that your mom was not diagnosed until her mid60s and the fact that neither you nor she currently require mobility assistence at your ages are both very good signs that your disease course (assuming you actually have it... and you may not) is likely to be mild. Again, this is not to diminish the experience of those who do have severe CMT, but just to note that nothing you have described so far sounds seriously alarming at this point. I would not worry too much unless there is more of a reason. I am sorry that your family has to deal with this out of the blue, it must be quite a shock. \n\nSince your mother does not have her genetic test results yet, you cannot know that she has type 1A. Therefore, you cannot be sure that there is a 50% chance of her passing it along. CMT type 1A is the most common type, so it is certainly possible, but if it turns out that she has one of the rare recessive types, for instance, the odds that she passed it along are much lower. (Under any circumstances, the odds will not be higher than 50%) \n\nYou may or may not have CMT but the only reason to rush to try to find out would be for your own peace of mind. You are unsettled by this news, and understandably so. The possible symptoms such as muscle cramps are mild and vague enough that anyone can experience these things. If you find that you cannot bear not knowing, that is a valid reason to seek testing (although, \"fun\" fact, insurance companies in the US may not agree; they are more likely to agree to pay for the test if you tell them that you are thinking of having another child; this also varies based on your state and insurance company though). \n\nYou have been basically fine up till now. CMT is not going to suddenly start having a big impact on your life overnight, physically. There is no treatment for it, beyond treating the symptoms as they develop and you have no significant symptoms. \n\nYou refer to your mother's CMT as \"adult onset\" but CMT is not a thing that lurks silently until it gets triggered. What she has is basically a case so mild that it took till her mid-60s for her nerves to accumulate enough of an impact for it to be noticed. I point this out because there is no reason to expect a sudden dramatic difference. As far as her body is concerned, it is going to keep on doing the same thing it has for 64 years. \n\nYou now know to keep an eye on your children; if they are struggling to keep up in gym class or show other problems, this gives you a clue what to look at for an answer. If they seem to be OK for now, there is no real rush. My mom did not know she had it until late - maybe 60? But she had symptoms before. My symptoms began in my mid - late thirties. Thank you for replying. It eases my mind a little knowing that my children will have options in the future if they decide to have kids of their own. Thank you everyone for the support and words of encouragement. I am feeling a little better after reading your comments. I am trying my best to remain positive and see the bright side that up until now my mom has lived a fairly unaffected life.", "I am new to this Hi everyone.

This has left me as the next top mod but I do not think this change will really make much practical difference to how things are run here.\n\nOur goals are to ensure that we continue on as a community with the same level of help and respect we have had in the past. No one knows another person's full medical, financial, or life circumstances based on their brief posting here. There are many factors that contribute to someone making the choices they make in managing their CMT. People should bear this in mind and temper their judgement of other member's personal medical choices.\n\nWe have long been a community that respects science and medicine. Science has not yet come up with treatments or cure for our problems, but progress to that end moves slowly forward. It is frustrating that progress is not faster but it is nonetheless the best system we have.\n\nWe do not wish to discourage anyone from opening a discussion in good faith about potential treatment ideas or asking weird questions. While we respect the progress science makes, we are interested in discussing ideas that science has yet to evaluate as well. However, no one has solved CMT yet and no one should be pushing a solution on others.\n\nMy own version of the rules I would like to establish are these:\n\n1. Respect other members and their medical choices\n2. Discussion of unproven treatments or ideas are welcome; pushing them on others is not\n3. No repeated commercial self-promotion If those rules are true, why was ( post about bodybuilding removed? With 6 upvotes and a genuine question why was it removed? Hey /u/NixyeNox First of all, let me begin by THANKING YOU AND THE OTHER ADMINS FOR CREATING AND MAINTAINING THIS SUB. IT HAS BEEN, LITERALLY, A LIFE SAVER FOR ME. SO, THANK YOU!\n\nNow that, that is out of the way, I would say your 3, very lose and broad scope, 'Rules' are quite acceptable and should be, one would hope, easy to abide by.\n\nWith that said, there is always that 'one' that constantly pushes, for no other reason than they have to push. So, I would suggest considering including a qualifier to the rules, such as, the admins will have final say when one of the rules has been breached.\n\nRegarding rule #3, I am curious about the inclusion of the word. 'repeated' Why not just state outright, No  commercial self-promotion?  \n\nPersonally, I find the rules to be just plain common courtesy and common sense. I Do not think you, or the other admins, are asking for too much. Was it *ripped* away? Maybe it got *shredded*? I think maybe a useful stickied thread for a question that pops up normally is \u201cwhat kind of tools (as in gadgets or devices) do you find useful for daily use\u201d, or \u201csomeone I am close to (normally a family member or SO) has cmt, what can I get them to make life easier\u201d? This is a serious point and a serious subreddit. Dont spam. Relax dude, if you cannot have humor with this disease than you are losing. Humour is about timing.\n\nA new user to Reddit and this community had their post removed with a legitimate question, and then the mods put up this post. I am not seeing the funny side to any of this. You are right, I do not see a funny side to your post. In addition, and maybe cause I personally am not the biggest fan of reddit just being a q&amp;a platform, a few other subs for chronic conditions have weekly stickies for a rant, or small victories... shit that does not seem worth a thread but it is nice to share to an understanding audience/nice to read others going through similar. Also helps with a lot of the DAE \\. I hate that this seems necessary, but it looks like some form of guideline is needed around recommending drugs/treatments. It is one thing for people to recommend something like stretches that worked, or \"I have been on abc and it is been pretty good\", or say linking the guide on the US cmta website. It is another to see the \"go get a prescription for xxxx from your doctor, and if they will not give it to you, find another\" that is cropping up more often. Thread and comments were locked because it became a discussion involving content that violated reddit's site wide content policy. If /u/tims2abc123 wants to message the moderators to discuss the matter in more detail, we encourage /u/tims2abc123 to do so. Similarly, if /u/tims2abc123 wants to repost the question, that is okay too.\n\nSometimes genuine and valid questions can open the door to content that violates a policy, and sometimes a thread needs to be locked and comments closed in order to maintain a healthy community. I like that :)\n\nThanks for the suggestion.\n\nSeems like a topic that is always relevant and useful. I like that too Hey thanks  for the thoughtful words and for the feedback.\n\nIn short, the mods discussed this and it was decided that we believe in the community and do not want to be censors. Ultimately, people here are able to judge for themselves whether or not a resource is valuable. And we believe it should be up to the community to decide whether a link (even to a commercial site) ought to be upvoted or not. We also believe that a commercial component should not automatically disqualify a potentially useful resource, even a self-promoted one, to be posted. All we ask is that the person messages the moderators prior to posting, and also for any future posts or comments with the link. This keeps a check on potentially self-interested posting while also allowing a healthy discussion around the issue.\n\nThat is the diplomatic take. Admittedly, it would be much easier - in the short term, anyway - to have an \"our way or the highway\" rule that let us censor, delete, allow, disallow, decide using our best judgment. But we believe the community is what matters and, collectively, it is much wiser and more fair than any individual moderator could be. We want to make ourselves invisible and not have to enforce rules. Alas!\n\nPersonally, I appreciate your feedback and the questions. I never thought we would need rules here because things were such common sense. But we created them out of respect for the community (including anyone who who might inadvertently be violating those rules - we owe them an explanation). Also, worth pointing out that we are also **obligated** to comply with reddit's content policy and this means enforcing any site wide rules.\n\n(\n\n(\n\nIf a thread ever gets removed or locked or comments get locked, that is the reason. Any questions, please message the moderator team. We listen and we will reply to you. I am glad you are still sticking with us, u/awwman_ I know it is been rough.\n\nYou probably have a point about the commercial self-promotion rule but we are indicating a willingness to allow occasional exceptions as long as they are approved/not repetitive and are also useful.\n\nReddit gives mods an enormous amount of leeway in running subreddits so technically we do have the final say on most things. That said, I do not know if we need to remind folks of that in the sidebar. Which of those weekly stickies do you like most? If you had to choose one, to start. Open to your suggestions and happy to test it out I agree, I added them to sidebar but keep feeling like they do not need such prominence and are overwhelmingly understood intuitively by most members here. I will remove them and post them as a reference in this thread, so they do not accidentally add bad vibes My current bad mood makes me say rant, but there is also options for just a random chat if anyone creative can come up with a thread title. I am sure there are some \u201cwhat is on your nerves\u201d / nerve  puns that capture the right sentiment.\n\nI will check out what other chronic health communities do and see if there is a good weekly thread format to sticky... which can perhaps encompass the good, the bad, and the ugly. Wins and losses, speak freely, vent, brag, express gratitude, or complain. S\u2019all good. Actually the content does not as shown by the prolific steroid and PED communities on reddit. I think there is been a misunderstanding of the rules here, as r/PEDS, r/sarmsourcetalk etc have tens of thousands of users and are not considered to be against Reddit policy. Good way to miss a very serious point about this subreddit and reduce it to petty remarks. No more sockpuppets? You take think taking down a new members post is going to encourage them to message you?! Of course not. All it means is they lost confidence in the entire subreddit and thankfully I dm'ed with the answer to his question as he will not be coming back here. Great way to \"encourage\" the community. A weekly thread for the good things and a weekly thread for the bad things might be a place to start. I do like your nerve pun idea, too. No more sockpuppets  Nobody is arguing with you about muscle growth /u/JoeBob85. One of the reasons anabolic steroids are not supported by the medical community (with the exception of people with severe burns, AIDS , cachectic hepatitis, etc) is because some of the most dangerous side effects of anabolic steroid use are the psychiatric effects:\n\n&gt;Misuse of anabolic steroids might lead to negative mental effects, such as: paranoid (extreme, unreasonable) jealousy. extreme irritability and aggression (\u201croid rage\u201d) delusions\u2014false beliefs or ideas.\n\n(\n\nAnd these are not rare events, they are in the realm of \\~ 25% (and that number is fair if you review the literature... although it might even be 5-10% higher depending on which study you read and how it generalizes). So, when I say \"one of the reasons anabolic steroids are not supported by the medical community\" I am CLEARLY not referring to instances where they *are*  supported by the medical community...", "Sural Neuralgia as well as CMT Has anyone been diagnosed with this as well as CMT (1a in my case)? At first my pain was put down to worsening CMT, but after seeing what feels like 100 different doctors, physio, podiatry, neuro, etc this seems to be the answer. I am currently doing physical therapy, but progress is really slow and I am not even sure if it is improving at all. Walking at all is incredibly painful and I am worried that reduced physical activity is going to make my CMT worse and I am just stuck in a downward spiral.\n\nAdvice, support, anything at all is appreciated. Hello, and welcome. I do not recall seeing you here before. I looked up a diagram of the sural nerve to get a better idea of the area affected. Before I comment on your question, A few questions please. I do not want to influence your response with something I post. The same damn questions we are all asked a million times, Can you describe your pain and the area/region? I am not an expert on anything but if you are worried about your physical activity, talk to your physiotherapist about different exercise options. From what I understand sural neuralgia affects your walking? Perhaps aqua therapy or swimming might be good (I have actually had it recommended for cmt patients). Or a rowing machine, even? Burning tearing type pain down the back of my lower leg and ankle. Movement and pressure is the problem. Weight bearing by itself like standing still is fine, but walking is not. Physio has me using a stationary bike to move the tendon, it can only be done in very short bursts because of the pain. Unfortunately pools are all closed here because of covid otherwise I would definitely be trailing that. \n\nIt is probably a long shot to find someone else who has had it with cmt, it is not common and usually occurs as a sporting injury. Yeah, was it an injury or did it just happen? I only asked because I have similar pain, but it goes into the foot and the sole of both feet. I have posted in this sub about burning pain previously. Have you had genetic testing'? Anything there? EMG's and or Nerve Conduction Studies? MRI's? MRI's of the spine? It happened without major injury. I think a rolled ankle triggered it, but like a lot of us I roll my ankles all the time and nothing. My physio thinks it is more of a repetitive strain type injury, so no catalytic event, just lots a small trauma. Yep, had them all and I have had the burning pain through the feet for years as well. That burning has been treated with lyrica with some success. This is a different kind of burning, it kind of feels like when you have a healing wound and then move in a way that tears it open again. I have had xrays and ultrasounds to diagnose and I have major swelling on the ankle which differentiates it from the usual \"cannot find anything to cause it\" type pains.\n\nI will probably be having an mri done on the foot as well. My gp is wanting to rule out anything else being a problem since all the conservative treatments have been a dead end. Surgery is a last resort.", "Cannabis and cmt 1a Not sure if this allowed but. Do any patients have any experience using cannabis? \nI am quite a heavy user and i feel like my body/muscles appreciates it. Particularly days where I do not consume as much cannabis as usual I seem to have a lot more issues with cramping in my hands and legs. Seems like while the medical world is opening it eyes so I wondered how many others have similar experiences? I have HNPP. I have been a heavy marijuana user for about a decade. It is the only thing that gives me relief. Neurologist approves it. The subject comes up here occasionally. You can check out past threads  \"Cannabis for CMT\" and \"CMT and weed\" and \"CBD and CMT\" for some experiences. Okayyy. I am sorry but I am only new to thinking about learning about my CMT so I am clueless on what HNPP is? And that said pretty much clueless on the whole CMT, kind of been hiding from it but I really need to start facing up to  it and learn more Ohh nice thanks HNPP is like, the genetic opposite of cmt 1. I am missing a copy of the PMP22 gene. CMT1, you have an extra copy. Strangely, our symptoms are incredibly similar. So like I have really poor nerve conductivity. I find that my coordination and balance goes (further) to shit when I toke. Still a good time though I am a nightly consumer and it helps me stay asleep. Nights that I do not take it, I end up with super RLS and wake up multiple times a night due to pain (more related to psoriatic arthritis than CMT, I think). I have used it for many years to uplift me and to give my overloaded muscles a chance to rest and recover.  However, I used it too much and developed an allergy to cannabis that does not allow me to use it anymore.  I beleive like everything moderation is key. Seeing that Cannabis can help regulate GABA then there is a strong chance that it could help with CMT 1A. It is definitely worth taking up with a doctor if you can get it medically. Sounds great. I have known for a few years now and thus far have done my best to stay away from the topic or at least verbally, kind of out of sight out of mind, which is complete rubbish as it is still daily on my mind I just avoid all talk or even learning about it which I am now seeing probs is not the best way. I have been smoking for a decade now and I do not notice it do anything for me but I also do not really suffer from much pain with CMT unless I have strained tf outta myself which i rarely do but even then it does not really do much for me except distract me. Thanks for your input. At the age of 30 something I have pretty much utilised cannabis for half my life. Yeah l cannot really say too much about the pain as it is not really something I struggle with, there is deffo days where my legs, feet or body ache and having a smoke does not seem to dull the pain but as you say more perhaps distract me but I definitely feel it reduces the amount of cramps.", "A drug (called PXT 3003) consists of sorbitol, naltrexone, &amp; baclofen, the drug inhibits the PMP22 gene from being OVER-EXPRESSED (what happens when people have CMT). I wanted to know how the drug INHIBITS the gene in a more descriptive way. If anyone can explain please do, need for presentation :) ", "Weird question: Any tokers? Seriously. Might be a little off topic for this sub, but this has been piquing my curiosity for a while. When I smoke weed, my balance and coordination become *very* poor. I stumble like I am drunk, and if I am in the dark or my eyes are closed, I have to hold onto something or else I will fall. I have a hunch that the proprioception impairment caused by CMT (I have 1A, mild) is greatly exaggerated when high. Combined with the relaxing of already weak ankle muscles, my balancing ability is useless when high. I sway a lot even standing still.\n\nI hate to seem like I am jumping to CMT as a scapegoat for this, but I posted to r/trees and someone said they experience the exact same thing, and they, too, have CMT. It really is not an issue, but I find it extremely interesting and I want to see if this is a common thing in those with CMT. Anybody experience anything like this? I would appreciate any insightful input. My buddy vapes regularly all day. His impairment seems unaffected by weed, but his impairment is quite progress, helps with the seizures that come later.\n\n\nThe vape is nice because the volcano has an optional larger attachment for the bags so he can manipulate it himself.\n\n\nMuch love to you folks, I miss being able to do more things with my old roomate. Stay positive. I smoke and vape, since I have tolerance I can handle myself pretty well at a low (&lt;0.3g) dose. It is an issue when I do not eat anything before and I get dizzy but otherwise it is a great pain reliever.  I do not think my balance is affected any more than a person without CMT. I have never noticed anything other than what I would describe as typical high clumisness. I will pay attention next time though. \n\nSide note- I have something wrong with my neck proprioceptors or my inner ear and am constantly light headed. This prompted me to go to a vestibular rehab clinic which has helped my balance tremendously, if you ever want to work on balance in PT your insurance should cover it.  I dont do weed but I absolutely have no balance. Literally, can not ride a bike  Does your friend have seizures? In most cases CMT does not affect the central nervous system, but there are a few case studies reporting myoclonic seizures and CMT. If he does have seizures he should definitely see a neurologist who specializes in CMT. We are in a socialized healthcare country, so his bases are covered thanks for asking! Actually, we have seen the same neurologist from the time I got lead poisoning at the foundry. Neurology is so cool! It is like they can turn you into a puppet if they want just by tapping and squeezing places, tell all sorts of things about you from that.\n\n\nI cannot remember which subcategory of CMT he has, it is not really the sort of thing to pry into a man's life like that. I smoke quite often and definitely feel that my balance is impaired. I have 1a and feel that it makes my balance feel a little off. No where near as bad as when I am drunk, but it is nearly impossible for me to walk without a wall when I am high in the dark. \n\nI have to be carried when I get too twisted.  \ud83d\ude1e Yeah its a problem for me too. Honestly even a decent tabacco high throws my balance off a bit. My balance is shit to begin with so its always something i keep in mind when i plan on smoking anything. ", "Pregnancy and CMT Hi,\n\nI was wondering if anyone on here could tell me how they found coping with being pregnant? Did your CMT symptoms get worse? Did CMT cause any complications.\n\nI was diagnosed with an unknown variant of CMT this year that my neurologist thinks I am unlikely to pass on so considering having another child but worried that this pregnancy will be more difficult than my first since my existing child was born before symptoms of CMT started.\n\nThanks My wife's in her third trimester and has 1A. She is doing well.\n\nShe qualified for maternal-fetal intervention - specialized care and additional checkups through her pregnancy - due to her CMT, but she has not experienced any noticeable issues as a result of the condition. She very fatigued, but hard to say if it is any worse than what is normal for pregnancy.\n\nThe baby is showing to be quite big for her expected delivery date; the obstetrician has talked about preparing for a C-section rather than a strained labor if the weight trend continues - a little on the conservative side for putting her through a rough delivery with degraded muscle function.\n\nUltimately a lot is going to be dependent on your particular scenario and your doctor's recommendation. Thank you for that. My doctor has said there is no reason for us not to have a second, was just interested to hear first hand experiences. I already wore AFOs when I got pregnant but needed a rollator Walker once I was really heavy. I developed gestational diabetes with my second, which, 20 years later is now Diabetes type 2, controlled with medication. I think it is mostly my inability to exercise for any length of time that caused it. I also got carpal tunnel and sciatica with pregnancy. The sciatica subsided and I had Surgery for the carpal tunnel. I still wear night wrist splints for that.  I think us cmTers have more fragile nerves and are prone to inflammation. That was it though. I have a son and a daughter. Neither of them have symptoms and they are 20 and 22. Neither of them want to be tested. They are just living their life. Thanks for that. I had sciatica in my first pregnancy, I wonder now if that might have been related.", "Genetic testing... This might sound weird, but does anyone have any idea how I might find genetic testing done on me?\n\nMy mom did it to my brothers and I in like 2001. I had the CMTx Gene and my brothers did not. I wanted to get the results now, so my new neurologist can have my full records, but my mom's not sure where she put the copy she has at home (she is got an autoimmune disease so we are drowning in medical paperwork).\n\nShe is going to look for it, but she is got so much going on itll probably be a month or longer until she really looks for it. \n\nAnyone have any idea how I might track down my genetic testing? The doctor that ordered the test will have a copy of it. If he is not available, the medical records department in the hospital or clinic that the doctor worked in should have it on file. \n\nIf you know the name of the lab, they probably retained a copy of the results as well.  Yeah I have none of that information. Mom might, but it was 17 years ago haha The only other options you have is to retest, or ask your mother.  Haha I asked. Like I said it would probably take a while for her to find it. But that is fine :) thanks for the help", "Strongman Saturday Hi All,\n\nI just wanted to share a small part of my strongman training session from today.   This was a 90kg (200lbs) Zercher yoke carry which was part of a medley, but today included stone to shoulder as well as arm-over-arm pulls.\n\nWhilst I have a very weak grip (no surprises there) I thought it might be help to show and share this madness.  I have a blast and the people i train with understand some things may be tricky for me, but there is no harm in getting in there and having a go and testing your limits.\n\nI have orthotics in, ankles strapped and a mind set of i love every minute of this stuff.  I dont see the point in not trying and not giving in, i am to old and stubborn to let cmt win.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway thanks for reading (and watching if you do), I will try and post some more as i can.\n\n( Thank you so much for sharing and for the inspiration. Keep at it! Good job. Awesome man!! Doctors always told me to take it easy and shit, but looking at you, I know I can do more. Inspiration \u270c\ud83c\udffc Wow. This is amazing!! Keep on going and plz continue to share with us.", "Tattoos So, I was thinking about getting a tattoo. I wanted it on my calf, but a relative of mine is freaking out saying the trauma of a tattoo could trigger my CMT and worsen my symptoms (I have CMTx and my symptoms are very mild). I cannot find anything for our against this. Anyone have any personal stories or maybe articles about this?", "Seems drs are reluctant to order CMT testing? Has anyone else experienced this? My brother, nephew, and Dad have CMT. \n\nEvery time I bring up a symptom for myself or one of my daughters that I believe could be related to CMT I feel it is not taken seriously. \n\nI do not understand why I cannot just get the test. I have good insurance and I am quite certain I have it. I just want to know for sure. Frustrating! Test was about the only thing they did for me as a child (aside ankle braces), that was not a fun day I remember,feel like family history should be a good red flag to order it? idk Some drs think it doesnt matter. If multiple family members have tested positive, they dont need to test you to know that if you are having the same symptoms, you also have it. My whole family on my dad's side has it, but only three of us have been tested and most of us are verified disabled and on government benefits. I would switch doctors if you feel the current one will not take your concerns seriously. In my experience this is a bad sign for being able to get good care. It should be a simple matter to get tested and if your doctor will not order the test or tell you why not, find someone who listens and cares. Ask them to note that they are refusing the test. Generally doctors are more willing to do what the patient asks when told to mark it in the patient's medical history in order to not be the Dr. whose name is noted next to the mistake, assuming they actually made one.  Most will do it to save face on the off chance they missed something once they know their name is actually attached to your prognosis. I am in the US and had a genetic test done last year (came back positive for CMT2A)...the company that tested me (Invitae) then offered to test my children for cheap (they both came back negative) Okay thank you. Good to know. Okay this is good to know. I think my bro could qualify for benefits and I am worried about one of my daughters, not so much myself. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb You are welcome. To be honest my test was completely unrelated to CMT. I went in for a ganglion cyst on my wrist, got sent for a test for carpal tunnel and ended up with CMT. See if you can get a nerve conduction test for carpal tunnel. Look up the symptoms and use them if you are not actually having them. The test will show slowing of nerve conduction that can only be CMT. Try to be professional/ nice about it of course.  Sadly we are at the whim of the Dr. and dont want to be rude. That was really uplifting to read your children do not have it. I have been told it is a 50:50 chance of passing on and always worried about kids so it is reassuring to know the positive part of the 50:50 does happen. :) I was convinced at least 1 would...but woohoo praise God. \n\nAs I struggled with the thoughts beforehand, I rested in the fact that I have had plenty of challenges in this CMT journey, but I have life, and a family/friends I love. So, even if they had it, there is still so much good! This. Allllll of this.", "One side? Met with my neuro today, first time in 2 years. My right side is progressing fast? From my hip down to my feet I hardly had any strength during exam. Finally getting afo's and bracing for my wrist/hands to hopefully help with weakness. Does anyone have a side that is worse? I have to get an EMG of my right side to see if there is anything that is causing the fast progression and for it to only be fast on the one side. I did have a horrible TBI with brain bleeding on my left side of my brain, which I know that controls the right side of your body. Am I the only one? My left leg is atrophying faster than my right leg. I have noticed my left leg is a bit smaller especially in the calf. Also my tendons are much shorter on my left leg than my right. I do not notice much of a difference in my hands and arms though. Thank you! I wonder if it is uncommon. My neuro thought it was the weirdest thing lol. (HNPP here) My right hand and foot is much worse. No clue why, but it always has been Definitely not the only one. My left is worse than my right. I had additional surgery for my left foot to correct some of it, but it is still worse than my right foot. No idea why. I am right handed, I wonder if that is just a coincidence though My right side is way worse than left also My right side is also way worse. Some questions:\n\nHow old are you? \n\nWhat was your age of onset? \n\nWhat was your baseline strength?\n\nWhat type of cmt do you have? \n\nI think it is important to follow up with the emg as this will provide more insight. My right side has always progressed faster than my left side. It makes sense in my arms since that is my dominant side but I never quite understood it with my legs. Hopefully getting a bit more insight later this year! I am HNPP too!! My right hand and arm are significantly worse than my left as well, which is really inconvenient given that it is my dominant side.", "leg bracing questions hi guys, I have had leg braces for a very long time now. I have just run into a problem, however. my braces make my shoe squeak or my shoe make my braces squeak. it almost sounds like I am farting if you know what I mean. has anyone else ever run into this problem?  does anyone think mole skin on the outside of my brace on the bottom part would work?

Unfortunately, it failed to prove useful in early clinical trials and development work on it has been discontinued:  ( Is strange why they stopped ace-083 given that it seemed to add muscle mass to the injected sites but realistically it was a very small trial and they went after arguably the wrong muscles, focusing on the bicep as one of the points....\nHowever, PXT3003 looks far more promising as it helps with the progression of the disease rather than muscle atrophy which, let us be honest, has been solved since the 60's through AAS'. Do you have links on the ace-083 trial? The OP article says they were focusing on dorsifexors, which I think most here would agree are a problematic muscle for us.   \n\n\nAnd if it is building muscle mass but no tone, there would not be too much functional benefit.

I need your help, if anyone is able to provide it. Because of Where and her father both having CMT, my wife never learned how to ride a bike. Her parents bought her a 3 wheeler, but because of the size of our apartment and where we live, we were not able to keep it with us, so my in laws took it with them when they moved out of state. I really want to get my wife a collapseable tric for Christmas or something. Does anyone know where I might be able to get one that is not too expensive, or maybe a good brand? I cannot help but I am also interested in some suggestions as riding a regular bike is to dangerous for me I have a decent amount of experience with trikes, in general many of them are pretty tough to ride. In particular,  they prevent you from leaning into turns,  which makes even slight grades unnatural.\n\nThat being said, if space is a concern, I would look into one like this:\n\n\nAll quality filding bikes have a premium associated with them, and one of the tradeoffs is generally smaller wheel sizes. This one might be a bit extreme,  but it is really focused on people needing the most compact size for urban areas.\n\nThere are a whole bunch of folding bikes that might be a better fit too, which could be combined with adult training wheels, too. There are also adult balance bikes,  which could be a nice thing to look into first, as riding a trike/training wheels is much harder. Adult balance bike:  Adult training wheels:  For me CMT does not cause me any issues with riding a \u201cnormal\u201d bike, with the exception of keeping my feet on the pedals at times. I solve that with clipless pedals (the kind that your feet lock into). Balance is affected in CMT because of proprioception, but mostly bikes do not rely on that type of balance. So in general although she would still have to learn to ride one, it is not a given that CMT will be a problem for riding a bike. I agree, however I struggle with my balance enough that when I am riding a bike I am constantly focused on not falling so it is very exhausting. I also managed to fall a couple of times when stopping and sprained my ankle in the process. So I decided it is not worth it for me. CMT type 1a btw. YMMV of course because CMT varies drastically from individual to individual.\n\nJust saying that in general most of the balance required for balancing on a bike is inner ear and visual rather than the type of balance that is most affected by CMT. I personally find balance while walking or especially standing still a lot more difficult than balance on a bike.", "How do you deal with missed opportunities and relationship issues with CMT? Hey I am currently a 21yo male and feel I missed out on a lot of experiences all my life, both in the past and in terms of currently. This can be in terms of not joining any physical activities such as skateboarding as a kid and always feeling inferior to my peers physically. Also in terms of friendships which I had very few due to a mix of my awkwardness from the disease, along with problems with my teeth, which made me feel rejected from joining most friend groups. It also hurts me in terms of relationships as I have never been able to attract anyone all my life. This has given me a really low body image because of this and feel like no one will ever like my deformed body and face. \n\nAlso Whenever I am reminded of people sharing their fun experiences during their childhood or highschool or even seeing people having fun or highschoolers with girlfriends it just sends a deep paralyzing feeling of dread and regret that I cannot get out of. It doesnt help that now I have other chronic pains that the causes seem unclear with one of them affecting my sexual function. I also am two years behind most people in uni because I had to take a break because I wanted my body to heal, which it didnt. I am wondering if you know any techniques to help with this feeling. Thanks! 26M here with pretty severe CMT. In all honesty, these feelings that you are having, they are just something you learn to deal with unfortunately, as people in our situation. I have been through all these emotions you list and more, and it can be overwhelming and unrelenting at times. But you are still young, you have got time on your side. As you go through life, you meet people that defy what you expect, that accept your situation, whether that is friendship wise or relationship wise, no matter how little sense it may make to you. It does happen and it can happen, I have been in a wheelchair for a decade and somehow people have found me attractive. You will have your chance I promise you. An open mind and a big heart can overshadow almost anything, make yourself the best version of you, control what you can control, and things will start to happen. The key is confidence, as hard as that is. Even if it is not real, projecting some confidence, being able to laugh at yourself, these are all things that can take the edge off. It absolutely sucks feeling like you missed out on so many \u2018highlights\u2019 of being a teenager or whatever, and that is not something that gets much easier, unfortunately. For me, just trying to find things i was passionate about and diving into them so much I would forget reality helped me. Talking to people online and improving my confidence and communication skills without having the anxiety of people being able to see my condition helped. Obviously we cannot escape our conditions and our situations, but we can still be happy, find good people, because they are out there, just got to have faith mate. Hope any of this was helpful, let me know Thanks. I think I knew a lot of this already but its nice knowing that I am no i am not alone and that I can get out of it and be happy. Its hard since I am the only one in the family so its hard find people with the condition to connect with. So thank you : ) It is hard and I am not sure anyone here can answer this question tbh.  It is like a lifelong grieving process for the death of the person you envision yourself as without this burden.  At least in my case haha.  I do not mean to be too dramatic; but in my case at least there is definitely a sense of identity crisis over trying to figure out how to present myself to potential friends/ romantic partners.  \n\nAt 21 you are still young (I am 27).  I wish I could guarantee you it will get easier; honestly with age you will probably just become less social; at least I have haha.  \n\nI am rambling some but wanted to respond that you are not alone in this struggle.  People can be mean, I can be mean; but we are all our own worst enemies.  I beat myself up more than anyone, regrets are in some ways the heaviest burden of disability.  I would keep the pain and lose the regrets versus the other way around every day of the week.  But neither will ever happen.  My point being I guess; keep improving yourself.  CMT is a burden, but it makes us stronger when we succeed.  Everything you have done is beating this disease, you are more than average in that you prevail against your own body.\n\nSorry I got sidetracked, but again just wanted to say youre not alone in feeling that way haha I have related to this at various points in my (25f) life. Especially so since I have a twin sister who does not have CMT, so there is a lot of comparison which can really get me down. Honestly, there are going to be things you cannot do, and it fucking sucks. But there is still HEAPS of stuff you can do. And at this point, you are still young so you have a choice: you can either spend your days feeling bitter, upset, ripped off, and sad for the things you cannot do. Or you can make peace with it, get out there and make the most of your life! \n\nObviously it is unlikely you will just wake up tomorrow feeling good about the hand you have been dealt, so I really, really, really recommend finding a good psychologist. It makes a huge difference and they can give you the right tools to cope with the times where you feel really heartbroken and sad. \n\nIf you are concerned about dating or relationships, get on the apps!! Like. All of them. Seriously, it might be a bit shit at times but if you persevere, you will find someone. It is a numbers game. There is 8 billion people in this world, it is statistically almost impossible that you will not find someone. You will, you are young, but you need to get out there! Thanks for the advice! I know currently I generally am trying to fix what I can and working on myself yo be the best person I can be. It still doesnt take away that pain in my gut whenever Im reminded of someone who had a happier life so far. I try to stay positive tho in normal to day to day life. I have tried some dating apps and however I dont think that is a good idea as with males it is extremely hard even if you are abled and generally good looking. And with my face which messed up my jaw growth with my teeth (It may not have been clear in the post) makes my face look a little deformed as well making it look long and mouth uneven. This makes it very hard to get any matches as they are generally based on looks. I only got 1-2 matches over a month of trying and no replies. This only made it worse for me personally for my self image. I will continue trying to do something in person though as I am just going on campus for the first time in the fall which can make me see people that likely can get attracted to the person I am and not my face or body. Being on a campus can be a really great experience and I hope it helps you connect with more people. \n\nIt can be easy to fall into thinking that nearly everyone is healthy and normal except yourself but statistics say that between 1-in-4 or 1-in-5 adults in the US have a disability of some sort. This is skewed towards older adults but disabilities are still fairly common among younger adults--not all of the disabilities are visible. We all have factors that hinder us in life and other factors that help. \n\nMy twenties had a lot of ups and downs and I finally met my spouse when I was 30 (I am mid-40s now). The best advice I can give is to hang out on campus and talk to people, to cultivate interests and talk to people about them, and try to find ways you can work on your strengths. \n\nGood luck! Thanks. I am trying my best to be social and look at all the opportunities that I have but I am still anxious that somehow I will screw something up and have more missed opportunities and regret. I am glad that someone like you have found someone tho! hope to do the same oneday Look, CMT or no, some folks have amazing experiences in childhood. Some people have those experiences later, and for some people, what you are feeling you missed out on would have been terrible! I met my now-wife just 5 years ago (42m, CMT1B). Now I look at the times before as just the training for the amazing life we are building now.\n\nAs we age, our bodies are changing, and it is tempting to lament that I cannot do what I did in my 20s. But when she looks at me, she sees the 5 years we have had together, too, so what might turn someone off on a quick-swipe dating app is now endearing and wonderful. Connection with other humans is basically nothing like what movies or magazines or Facebook tells you it is like.\n\nThe important thing is to focus on being you, genuinely you, and to find the joy in the things you CAN do well and improve. Yes, you have challenges, but everyone has challenges. There are tons of stories of the most \u201cbeautiful\u201d, \u201csuccessful\u201d people secretly feeling ugly, sad, and lonely. If you can, consider finding a counselor/therapist to help you put these feelings in context and avoid letting them define you.\n\nTry to avoid comparing yourself to others \u2014 it is mostly a marketing technique to get you to buy stuff to help you \u201cmeasure up\u201d. Hang in there! thanks. I hope I can be as content as you someday :) I felt very similar to you at that age.  I think the hardest part is that I was fairly normal until age 10.  I was an okay athlete, lots of friends, somewhat outgoing.  Then the disease progressed rapidly.  By the time I was 13 and entering high school, I had only a few friends I still talked to and was extremely introverted.  Then when I was 16 I left school for two years and was home schooled after a series of surgeries on my feet.\n\nI commuted to college and lived at home.  For the first two years, I had only met a couple people that I conversed with outside of classes.  At the start of my third year, I made a decision.  I just started talking to people.  Before class?  Chatted with the person standing next to me, etc.  I quickly made friends that invited me to parties, out to events, etc.  It really gave me a boost of confidence.   \n\nI am 36 now, married with kids.  I met a girl at work that did not even know something was wrong with me till I told her on our first \"date\" (I have a hunchback, and an awkward gait ,not sure how she didnt notice).  \n\nThat \"teenage\" experience that is so glorified in the media is just a small part of your life.  Try to make the most of what you can. Never give up hope, focus on what you have and can do, talk to people, be open and friendly.  Find hobbies you can be passionate about, even better if they allow you to meet new people. It is just one of those things in life. You can either use it as an excuse and let it hold you back, or adapt and overcome. Staying active, working out and pushing through the fatigue has helped me a lot. I went through a drug addiction for a few years due to the depression but I am clean now and have not been happier. \n\nWork on yourself and the relationship will come.", "My Right Hand - Sorry for the Separate Pics I hardly ever attach pics to a post. I could not figure out how to attach multiple pics to one post.\n\nMy apologies if they come across as spam. It is okay. I will remove the extras and you can comment/link to them in your main right hand pic post (the one with the most comments).", "youtubi  hahaha", "May have CMT....not sure yet. Hello everyone, \n\nI am currently waiting to undergo some possible genetic testing for some sort of neuromuscular problem.  The doctors do not know for sure yet what it is, and the fact that I have no family history does not seem to deter them from CMT or some other genetically inherited polyneuropathy. Of course, they are also looking at some other possibilities, but I do not even want to think about those. I have always had the classic \u201cclaw foot\u201d look, but no other real symptoms that I noticed. In undergrad I went to the doctor for a sprained ankle and he asked me about my foot. I had no idea why, but I am starting to wonder. \n\nWhat initially brought me to the doctor was an issue of feeling \u201coff balance\u201d. I never had serious balance issues, but I do remember helping a friend out in grad school and being the only one unable to balance 20 seconds on one leg during data collection for his study. Now, 4 years later, that has gotten quite a bit worse. I also have pins and needles feelings in my feet and my legs frequently feel cold. \n\nI guess my main question is did anyone have CMT that they did not really notice until their 30s? I turn 30 this year. Or if anyone has had a similar presentation as me? Several of my family members have CMT 1A and have all presented with symptoms at different ages.  The youngest being my mom who started displaying symptoms in her early teens and the oldest being my aunt who never displayed symptoms until her late 40s.  Also,  each of the people have very different severities if it.  I guess total...  I have 7 family members I am aware of with CMT right now.  Never realized the number till just now. What symptoms did they have, if you do not mind me asking? My mom is the one I know most about.   She was a majorette and kept spraining her ankles.  So I guess lower leg weakness was her first symptom . As it progressed she started having trouble with balance especially if standing in one place. She had to be near something to lean on.  Then came the high step walk as she did not have muscle to hold her foot in place.  Known as drop foot.  She has had hammer toe and high arch for as long as I can remember.  In her hands she began with loss of sensation. Especially not sensitive to heat.  She struggled picking things up if it were small. Like to pick a penny up of a table became impossible.  So I guess no finger strength.  Hope these things are helpful.  I know she does have pins and needle sensation at times and things such as that. Not sure if that was an early symptom for her though.  On a side note...  although she cannot straighten her fingers..  she crochets and does amazing crafts and plays keyboard like nobody\u2019s business.  I am sure every case is just different but from the way it seems in my family\u2019s case..   the older they were when they got it..   the less severe the symptoms.  Not sure why that is.  Feel free to ask any other questions you would like...   so many different cases in this family I do not even know which to discuss.  :/   We did not know it was 1A for sure until pretty recently. My cousin in her 20\u2019s started having leg weakness and balance issues.  She was tested away due to family history obviously.  She went through a study to get the genetic testing to see which form it is for sure . Have you had any electrodiagnostic testing yet? Do you have a normal knee jerk reflex?\n\nCMT without a family history is not that uncommon, IIRC for CMT1A about 10% of the cases are de novo. Some types of CMT have a very mild and late presentation in some patients. My great grandfather as well as my mother, who both had CMT1A had a very mild presentation and a late onset, while my grandmother and my self both had an early onset and generally more pronounced symptoms. My feet are normal, legs are normal. I was diagnosed 5 Months ago and I am 30. No family history or anything. I definitely feel you.  \n\n\nOver a few years my symptoms went from slightly numb to completely gone from the knees down, tingling in my fingers and whatnot. Horrible balance. Finally gave in to a cane, and I am waiting on more testing. CMT feels like a ghost, always just out of sight, ever shifting and changing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thread\n\n ( I had an EMG/NCV done. I did not have much slowing of conduction but I did have some polyphasic potentials and a few muscles with increased amplitude and recruitment. I have a diminished knee jerk and Achilles reflex. Do you have the NCS values (latency, conduction velocity, and amplitude)? Is the knee and Achilles reflex diminished or completely absent? I am not in any position to interpret results or make a diagnosis, so take everything I write with copious amounts of salt and keep in mind that it is probably wrong.. But from the information you have provided so far I am tempted to lean towards a myopathy rather than CMT. Hey, no, thank you because I am trying to figure out what is going on and if I should have the genetic testing done. From the report: I have slowing of CV for left peroneal and right tibial nerves, prolonged tibial F-waves, and reduced amplitude with slowing of CV for superficial peroneal nerves of both legs. Something is obviously going on, but it is hard to say much more without looking at the actual paperwork of the test results. If genetic testing is indicated depends on the results of the studies you have already had as well as you and your family's medical history. If genetic testing is offered to you, it is usually either because the physician wants to confirm a preliminary diagnosis or because the previous tests were inconclusive and he/she want to rule out some possibility or possibilities in order to get closer to a precise diagnosis.\n\nGenetic testing for CMT relies heavily on the results from the electrodiagnosis, and really the only way to make a proper decision about what, if any, gene(s) to test for is for someone with knowledge and experience to look at the actual values for the various tests you have had and take it from there. However, if you have the actual values for an ulnar motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) and an upper extremity compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude test you can use those numbers along with your medical history to see what the rational steps in a diagnosis could be, provided that your combination of values and history does not fall outside the scope of CMT. Such an exercise would obviously only be of educational value.\n\nThere is a very handy study that goes through the methods that are used for targeted genetic testing for CMT called \"( It is a pretty nice read, and it even comes with flow charts. Me, my mom, and aunt all have CMT and have struggled with it since we were young, but a few of my aunts, now in their 30s-50s, are starting to experience symptoms to a more minor degree. So it can happen, the severity just varies", "Just need to vent I (23M) used to experience a lot of bullying for my physical appearance back in middle school and high school. My posture has always been shit especially after getting a neck fusion in 6th grade to stop the progression of my scoliosis. \n\nI have not really heard any insults in a while and if I did I paid them no mind, but on my recent camping trip with some friends I heard some people loudly talking shit about my posture as I was walking by.\n\nI always try to be lighthearted about my disability and often make jokes about myself, but these people were just being mean for no reason. I tried to not let it get to me but I hate people who can only feel good about themselves by making others feel bad.\n\nCMT sucks but those kind of people really make me feel alienated Obviously really horrible humans. I am sorry. I hope that if something awful like this happens again you might speak up. I think one of the best ways to speak up is to ask a question - something like \u201cWhy would you say something like that about someone with a disability?\u201d These people will never learn if nobody calls them on their BS. And maybe they will not ever learn. Humans are really shit sometimes. Sorry you had to put up with that. Hugs from me. X That is really hard. I am 46 now but had my share of receiving mockery in middle/high school. Over the years your skin will get a little thicker but sometimes it still hurts to hear it. The only encouragement I can give you is that you are not alone. I have been there too. People are so fucking weird sometimes. That is really mean, instead of laughing at you they should have  asked you something about it or in the best scenario just leave you alone. Hope you feel better now, everything is going to be okay  :) I hate playing the disabled card. I feel like it only cements me as different and thereby lesser in those people's minds. In the moment I got really angry and I did not want to start a confrontation because I have a short temper when it comes to things like that. I thought it best to just let it be because no matter what I said to them it was not going to change their minds, but it might have helped ease mine though. I appreciate you \ud83e\udd70 I thought my skin was thick lol we all have our insecurities though I genuinely enjoy when people ask about my disability! It shows that they see a difference, but do not let it affect how they treat people That just sucks. I am really sorry. One thing that helps me when others say hurtful things or take actions that negatively impact me is to remember I cannot control everyone and their actions but that I can control how I react. Dont let their words have power over you. They lack understanding or are just crappy people that are not worth your time. Know that there are many of us that love you. Anyone who has CMT and fights it everyday I have mad respect and love for. They and you are strong brave individuals that are examples to everyone. I do not have CMT but have loved ones that do. It is hard for people who do not have disabilities or know people with disabilities to understand. Especially at a young age. One more thing that may help is to use those negative words as fuel to help others and accomplish great things. I am sorry you had a bad day!  And hey, words can f\u2019in hurt no matter our age. Just know what a wonderful person you are and keep going! Seems some people have been extra rude during the last year. Just Know that if they really got to know you, they would not act that way. Those that say things like that, are saying much more about themselves than you. Never understood how people could do that. I never got bullied at school, despite being sway backed, thick glasses, scoliosis, ugly and could not run, etc.\nMy bullies were at home", "Ankle / foot pain getting worse  I can only speak for myself, I have CMT2D and the pain in my feet, including the pain you speak  of, dorsiflexion, can be very intense and painful. I had that pain for all of my life. I can no loner move the toes, in any direction but the pain is still there. If you know what type of CMT you have, and you are all ready experiencing foot drop, what I would tell you about, when to see a doctor is kind of like asking when you should buy insurance? The answer is, before you need it. I have been very disgusted with the 'experts', especially their availability, (often long wait times for the first appointment) and even when you FINALLY see the 'specialist' it has been my experience they often are not helpful. However, getting the proverbial 'foot in the door' goes a long way when you really do need to see someone more regularly. I have AFOs and they literally changed my life. I was operating on an 8/9 for pain, and now I am just a three most of the time. I still have bad days, but now it is rare", "CMT and COVID-19 - webinar Hey all,\n\nThis Friday the 20th at 12pm EST, the Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation is having a webinar for people with CMT regarding the covid-19 pandemic.  It is free to join.  I am not affiliated with the HNF, just spreading the link because it seems important for us to be informed:\n\n (  Thanks for the heads up! Thank you! Thank you for sharing. Is anyone willing to post a summary of the Webinar here after it is been broadcast? Live Q&amp;A about this on the CMTA Facebook page today in 5 mins I have just watched it now, and in the beginning they mention that they will compile a PDF from the webinar and put it up on their website. At the moment it is not up though.\n\nA rough timeline of the webinar is as follows:\n\n00:00-06:39 \u2013 Getting started / technical issues\n06:40-08:24 \u2013 Webinar begins, introductions and general information\n08:24-15:51 \u2013  Presentation of symptom tracking app/service (Capture Proof, \n16:20-18:26 \u2013 Some quick introductions from other webinar attendees + introduction of Dr. John Bach from Rutgers Medical University\n18:28-1:52:07 \u2013 Dr. John Bach talks about non-invasive ventilation and related topics in relation to CMT and COVID-19 with some Q&amp;A at the end about the same topic\n1:52:08 \u2013 The webinar ends mid sentence, although it was wrapping up at that point\n\nOverall it was an interesting webinar, though breathing issues is not something I am intimately familiar with. I would say 95% of this webinar was about breathing issues and ventilation and apart from that there was not any new information about CMT and COVID-19. But then again as far as I know nobody has any new information about CMT and COVID-19 at the moment so I probably should not have expected that either.\nAt any rate for those who have CMT and have breathing issues it is probably worth a watch. Dr. John Bach has some pretty strong opinions on non-invasive ventilation which I am not in a position to judge but for those whom it concern it is probably going to be of interest. If I had breathing issues I would certainly look into some of his claims.", "Sensitive to heat? I have CMT 1a and, while I have the typical numbness in my feet and reduced sensation of cold, I find I am really sensitive to heat! I am always waiting way longer than anyone else to drink hot chocolate and have to turn down the temperature for showers. Is anyone else in the same boat? it does not make sense to me as CMT reduces sensitivity... Yes. I am sensitive to heat because CMT causes my autonomic neuropathy. Dysautonomia sucks. The heat is just one thing that dysautonomia gives me issues with. Low blood volume and low blood pressure are extra bonuses. But are you referring more to body temperature or just the sensation of heat? My problem is more about touching hot things. Room/outside temperature. I see. I had to look it up. That must be a real pain. I am also sensitive to heat as well as to cold. I noticed that I always turn down the temperature of water after taking shower by my roommate. But cold is bigger problem for me) I read through the comments and did not know low blood pressure was part of CMT. The more you know. But aside from that, I am way not sensitive; it takes extremes of both ends to make my \"feel\" something, but if exposed to one of the two, my body will tell me way before I feel it. I do not have much sensation in my extremities, but drinking or eating hot/cold stuff is not a problem, nothing more than normal. Extra sensations could be due to the overcompensation of the sensations not felt or have low response? Yeah that is more what I would expect. You raise a good point, maybe it is overcompensation. Not sure whether that is possible for lack of a PhD in neuroscience.", "Every day leg strengthening excercises Heyo everyone I got diagnosed with CMT a year ago after the surgeons noticed that the signals in my legs were around half the speed during a surgery to untether my spine from a lipoma, apparently having both CMT and a Tethered Spine is nearly unheard off so do not I feel bloody lucky. What type I do not know. After that I just got discharged, no advice given no outlook nothing I gathered all information I know off the internet so you can imagine what I have done to my mental state, I hate being on the spectrum.\n\nAnyway my right leg in general is weaker than my left thanks to the tethering. Though recently my left ankle has started to weaken and drop. It is rather annoying the sensation I feel in my foot so I keep it lifted with the Boxia foot lift for the time being until I get the tendon tightened it practically eliminates all discomfort.... in my left foot. This has created and interesting phenomenon in my right leg where my right thigh just my right begins to tire rather quickly even when I use a raise on both feet. So I am left with a choice no raise which causes my left foot to feel strange but my right leg to feel normal but cause a drag or put on a raise and tire out my right leg.\n\nSo to compensate I am hoping to try and increase the thigh strength in my right leg. I am hopeful despite the previous tethering that strength increase is still possible as I retain all feeling and sensation in it. Can anyone recommend any leg strengthening techniques that I can do every day to eventually overcome this obstacle. \n\nI go to the gym frequently so exercise is not an issue heck I am looking to increase it and get back into weight lifting just not too certain what I can lift as the aforementioned spine surgery may act as a limitation despite if beings year ago. How do you guys handle leg day also? Do you find it helps?\n\nSorry for the bible I just figured It would be optimal to outline my current situation. Ah I seriously wish that those drugs PXT 3003 And ACE 083 would become available soon. I do a lot of stationary biking at a resistance where I am actually engaging the muscle as opposed to just spinning my legs.   Also I do supermans to work on the glutes.  Lower back exercises could help a lot too.\n\nAt home sometimes I do squats where I stand sideways in a door frame so I can use it to help me balance. Otherwise I cannot really squat because of poor ankle flexibility/ stability Hey thanks man I will give those a shot! Yeah I think it is about time I upped the resistance for my cardio. Bout time I reclaim my lost strength^_^ I do physio weekly and see a podiatrist occasionally. As well as yearly check ups with neurologist and surgeon. Doing physio has really helped me, to make sure I am doing excercises that are safe and still beneficial for me. I have really fast muscle growth now and my body has never been as fit and healthy. she has me do a lot of stretches and does IMS and weekly massage. I Would totally recommend getting some professionals to help make a plan for you! I work out with a physical trainer and do the normal leg day stuff with adaptations for me weakness. It is hard. And if I walk too much on leg day,I cannot walk afterward pretty much. But it does help! - Stretch all leg muscles every day (calves will be super tight, quads will be tight etc)\n- Best cardio is the bike (mix it up with the reclined as that can focus more on your quads)\n- Cross trainer is good for working inner thighs, inner quad, outer calf, and adductors. Do not use it as a cardio exercise as it will cause to much stress due to CMT weaknesses.\n- Leg machines are a good starting point for building up quads and hamstrings\n- Seated leg press is the most versatile as you can target all leg muscles depending on foot position, but go light and get form over weight.\n\n**Also do not be alarmed if you plateau quickly. There might be a direct link that causes CMT to inhibit muscle growth**\n\nN.b I have had my right hip replaced so I have had some experience in CMT and issues training legs. Do you live in the USA? HNF is having a Movement As Medicine seminar in Arizona in November. I am going. Limits are meant to be broken ama\u2019rite? Hehe cheers for the advice I was just thinking I have been going to easy on myself better crank up the resistance. I was strong once before the surgery so I do not doubt I will be able to reclaim it is just getting back into that routine. Ah I am afraid I live in Scotland.", " On My Nerves - Small Irritations Weekly thread for the little CMT things bugging you this week I am struggling to keep balance when walking and depend on holding on to rails etc when boarding the bus, moving up and down stairs etc. My family is always telling me I should not touch this and that because of corona and its really bugging me. They know I am sick, but I do not think they realise that it is hurtful that they do not realise that things they take for granted is an effort to me. I hate that I have to touch railings so much myself these days. I try to carry hand sanitizer or wear gloves but I would be very frustrated if someone tried to tell me not to touch something to steady myself. It is just not going to end well if I do not use the railing. This leads into a whole other frustration I have even when there is not coronavirus, of people standing/conversing by stair wells blocking access to the hand rails. Then look at you like sideways when you ask if you can use the hand rail", "CMT And HNF Published In The Rare Neurological Disease Special Report  Thank you for the share, this is fantastic news!", " Friday Feelings - Small Celebrations Little things that went right this week. \n\nTimes when CMT could not stand in your way.\n\nVictories that you want to share. Cmt type 1A here. I ran a half marathon (13 miles\u2026. Well limped the last 4 miles lol) about 5 days ago. First one ever and I finished in 3 hours and 13 min and I only trained for a couple months. My feet and ankles paid dearly for it but I did it! 4 miles is 6.44 km That Is awesome! That is awesome! I had done a few half years ago and really loved it. I can only run/walk them though-- not run the whole thing. I would love to get back into it. I had to wear really good ankle braces to make sure they did not give out, and those would start to chaff my skin. Did you wear any braces or anything like that? (I do not wear AFOs-- I do not have foot drop)\n\nCongrats!! No I have never wore anything before but I would like to look into it cuz I have a pretty good foot drop going on and super high arches. That is what killed me the most is I do not think my feet and ankles could take the pounding of running with no kind of support, just a regular running shoe. Wow!  That is amazing", "CMT &amp; Family Planning Just found out I have a type of CMT where they do not have enough genetic information to use IVF and PGT-M to have a child that is free of CMT. Feeling pretty heartbroken as I really do not want to pass this disease down to my future children. My case has been relatively mild, and so has my dad\u2019s although his is now starting to progress rapidly since he turned 60, but I know it is not a given that my kid would also have a mild case should they inherit it from me.\n\nHas anyone made the choice to take the risk and have children, knowing they could inherit CMT? How did it turn out? I do not but my mom had me and my brother knowing we could inherit it. My mom has a pretty mild case. My brother is severly affected. He can still walk but has a mobility aid for long distances. I have always been mildly affected (but more than my mom) but it recently worsened. I am 26 but cannot live on my own because I cannot do all of my chores and I need a car to get around (even though I live in a place where public transport is good).\n\nWe have type 1A btw. I personnaly will not be taking the risk. I do not want kids yet but when I do I will find a place that will offer me IVF with confirmation that the implanted embryos do not have it. Right now this is not legal where I live. I have CMT 1a and did not even know that IVF would have been an option before I had my kids. I have 3 children and all three have CMT. \nOn the other hand, my aunt had 6 children and only two inherited it. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Personally I had quite a few good other reasons not to have kids (mainly my low life expectancy), so it was not an issue for me. My sister is facing that dilemma though, and she seems inclined to have children regardless.\n\nOur understanding of genetics is progressing pretty rapidly, so there is a fair chance things could improve both in preventing having children with it and with curing it. You could wait and see, depending on your age and life situation. Thank you so much for sharing. I am 30 so I do not have all the time in the world, but I do have a few more years to see what happens. We also are contemplating freezing embryos which would extend that timeline even more, although it would be pretty expensive. My parents had me and my 2 siblings knowing it was a 50/50 chance of being affected. My case is the worse and i had to have a couple corrective surgeries that significantly improved my quality of life. Definitely a personal decision but wanted to share my story I had my first not knowing about CMT at all. I passed it on to my son, and was wracked with guilt (I am more composed about it now but it was very hard at the beginning). He is seeing a pediatric neurologist for his first formal \u201cassessment\u201d in December, but so far has no symptoms, according to the doctor, though he is a clumsy-as-heck kid. \n\nI am now a single parent. If I could afford IVF with PGD I would do it. Since I cannot, it is going to be no more kids or maybe eventually foster-to-adopt (complicated feelings about that, too). \n\nMy symptoms are extremely mild, and I am 35F. I would say do not feel guilty.  Passing it on accidentally is not so bad when you read these anecdotes of people knowing about it and still having kids. My dad had my brother and I and he was really conflicted about it for a while. (He was not diagnosed but he knew it was SOMETHING bc other members of his family had the same \u201cafflictions\u201d. ) I ended up with it and my brother did not, and while I have some intense symptoms, I do not hold it against my dad because I am happy to be alive and I am blessed with parents that have the resources to help me with anything that may come in the future by way of surgeries etc. this is an extremely personal choice, but I wanted to let you know that as the kid born to parents knowing it was a possibility, I do not resent them and love them for supporting me. It is definitely a hard decision but I just wanted to let you know that it is possible to have a healthy relationship with your child even if you do decide to have children!", "Anyone experience anything like this? I realize I probably should see a doctor but I am not even sure where to start and it is the weekend so figure I will ask here. I have type 1a. Mostly the typical high arches, hammer toes, foot drop, etc. I have mostly resisted AfOs and the like because, well I do not have a good reason except I was trying to hold onto some semblance of \u201cnormal.\u201d \n\nAnyways, last night I walked out of my apartment and heard like a pop and felt a burning pain in my calf. I can still walk and it literally is only painful when I am walking, and mostly like up an incline or making a full step. It is a burning in the middle of my calf. There is no swelling, no pain otherwise and does not hurt to touch. \n\nAnyone have anything like this happen? I am so frustrated right now. I did not even step wrong or otherwise do anything to my foot. I am not a doctor, but this sounds like a pulled muscle to me. It might have been your achilles tendon. It tends to make a popping sound when it rips. Does your foot drop further than usual? Either way, go get it checked. Wish you a speedy recovery Drop is not worse than normal and does not always hurt but sometimes. I will definitely get it checked. Thank you! An Achilles pop is very painful and you would not be able to walk after. I have seen a complete rupture happen and the foot can no longer control the calf. A partial small Achilles tear may be to blame, though. That Is true. It supposedly hurts alot. I just figured with the reduced sensations in the limbs it might have felt less severe than it does for someone that is nit affected by CMT. Either way, a trip to the doc should give answers.", "Keto, Intermittent Fasting, and CMT Has anyone else been exploring the ketogenic diet, intermittent fasting, and their benefits of helping with symptoms of CMT? I am curious if anyone else has had any success. I have been feeling great since I started about 6 months ago. There is a blog called ( that has been spreading information about it.\n\nThere is a recent post about a study that shows Intermittent Fasting could benefit patients with CMT.\n\n(\n\nI would really like to hear about anyone else's experience with this lifestyle and if it has benefited them at all. Never heard of that before. Very interesting article though. I have never tried fasting, but my wife and I have been doing keto for a month and a half now. I am the one with CMT. It has been a big difference in my level of energy. I find it easier to get out of bed in the mornings, and I do not crash in the middle of the day. I started at 320, I am down to 286. My knees do not ache like they used to. It has been a blessing. It is good to see someone else with CMT is doing keto! I am not on keto, but like I have said in previous posts I am on nandrolone decanoate.  The absolute best drug for CMT I have ever found.  I eat a diet that is close to keto and it is been mostly positive.  Nandrolone is far better than keto. I am having the same benefits! I went from 240lb to 170lb, and I feel so healthy now. I barely have any of the symptoms I used to associate with CMT. I have been doing IF for a while actually. I usually do 14/10 or 13/11. To be honest I have not noticed improvement to CMT but I have better gut health and blood sugar control. I also did the dna analysis through foundmyfitness and IF was recommended for me to decrease the risk of breast cancer. \n\nI have done Keto in the past but I prefer to cycle in and out of it. I can get into after two days of 50 net carbs. I do have a lot more energy when I am in ketosis.  The journal article was very interesting. It does show benefit in mice, though keep in mind we are talking about an every other day fast I do not think you would see any sort of benefit with Time-restricted Fasting like you are describing.\n\nThe study showed improvement when using Alternate-day Fasting, 24 hour fast followed by 24 hour food and repeat. Yes, exactly. Any Alternate-day Fasting plan. I was following a WDF plan and fasting 2 days out of the week, but I think I am going to try ADF now to see if that shows better results. Does this include those who were born with CMT? Been trying to lose weight but struggling because I cannot exercise lots due to CMT and my pain is very high. \n That is great to hear! I still have my normal hand and foot problems. It would be great if after a few months that would subside. How long have you been on keto? I have roughly dropped a pound a day.  Yes. I was born with CMT. I have seen wonderful improvements with Keto and IF. Check out the ( What sort of hand and foot problems? My hands do not shake anymore, my grip strength is improving greatly with exercise, and my feet are strengthening as I continue to go on walks. The longer I am in ketosis and practice IF, the more my pain subsides. Weight loss is good too! Hand cramping, knuckle aches, loss of grip. Foot numbness and pain, leg cramps. My plan is to shed weight and start exercising to build muscle. I may try the 12/12 fasting, but a whole day I do not think I could do.  Oh I see. I learned that electrolyte imbalance has a lot to do with muscle cramping and aching. Once I started taking in more sodium, potassium, and especially magnesium, I saw most of my muscle cramping go away.\n\nJust as a heads up, the study found that whole day,  alternate day fasting was what improved the rat's health. They did not try time-restricted (12/12, 16/8, etc). I do not think time-restricted fasting would have much health benefit. 12 hours of eating is not nearly long enough for the body to switch to repair mode. That is the whole point. ADF switches the body to repair mode, keeping you healthy until you can eat again so you can reproduce. That is the idea anyway. Spinach and avocados are both very high in potassium and magnesium, FYI. I eat one avocado and a lot of spinach every single day. I have changed the saying to: \"An avocado a day keeps the doctor away.\" Yes, I noticed that. I will see if I can work up to that. It is not a lifestyle I could maintain, though I might manage once a week or so. I am curious as to what the minimum effective dose would be though. I know that dr. Satchin panda from the Salk institute who studies Time restricted eating mentions benefits at 12-13 hrs (not related to CMT). Regardless the benefits of better blood sugar control and gut health improve my quality of like greatly.  Start at 12/12 and work up to it if you can. Time restricted eating is beneficial for your health even at 12 hours. This is a video with dr. Satchin panda out of the Salk institute about the health benefits of time restricted eating even as low as 12 hrs.  \n Yes! Both keto and intermittent fasting has helped me lose 22 kgs the last 8 months, and that has definitely helped my cmt symptoms. I have way more energy on that diet as well, I highly recommend it to anyone :) Is this still an active site?", "Us old folks Is there a cmt thread that us old people will be welcome? I seem to be too old for this one. You are welcome here, but not all posts here will be relevant to you. I believe you are referring to the post from four days ago that you commented on that specified that OP was looking to build a support group of other teenagers. \n\nIt is the same as how someone may ask if there are other parents of people with CMT, or other people who play musical instruments, or other people who have gotten surgery. In this case it was looking for other people at the start of their life who are suffering from mobility problems. \n\nYou were not the target audience for that one comment, but that does not mean you are not welcome here. Atleast the young ones know what is wrong. I went thru it alone, called lazy, faker, liar. I would have wanted info from anyone. Try going thru 60 years of that and see if you do not get easily hurt and take remarks personal.\nI do not have medical care, so no treatment or Dr to talk to.\nNo one in my family has cmt, so how I ended up with 2, I do not know. Howcome I hurt so bad some days that even breathing hurts? My brother in law has cmt and says he never had any pain with it, just weak and numb.\nIt is supposed to be from elbows and knees down. Why did my thighs start not being able to support me either? \nWhat is with the breathing getting shallower and the \"catch up breaths\" that startle me? \nWhy is my vision failing?\nI have no one to ask anything to. I do not care how old they are. I am sorry. That sounds painful, and terrifying. I can understand why you would lash out, but I hope you will refrain from doing so in the future. \n\nThere is some data on CMT causing breathing problems, which you can look at ( \n\nYou are not alone with this. Exactly this. \n\nEveryone with CMT is welcome on this subreddit, to commiserate, exchange tips, or just talk to people who know something of what it is like to navigate the world with this additional complication. \n\nHowever, while the subreddit is for all, not every thread will be relevant to any one person's interests or situation. \n\nI do not have much to offer a teenager looking to connect with other young folks myself these days. I can remember when I was young and that kind of thing was a problem for me, and I sympathize. \n\nBut if there is some sort of adaptation one needs to make to get their tik-tok on or play Roblox or whatever it is that teenagers are doing these days, well, I am clearly out of the loop. The best I can do is offer space for them to talk to each other about it, hopefully without feeling self-conscious about trying to find someone who shares their particular challenges.\n\nOf course, there is plenty of space to talk about general issues as well, or specifically older people's issues! I am sorry you have had such a rough experience, OP. Everyone deserves to have their medical issues taken seriously, and to get answers. \n\nCMT is a peripheral nerve issue, which I am sure you have heard many times. But in CMT it kind of has two meanings: it is a disorder of the peripheral nerves, which are the part of the nervous system that is not the brain. It is also a disease that impacts the most peripheral parts of the body first. \n\nTypically, it is first evident in the feet, then the ankles, then maybe calves, maybe hands... it is distance-from-the-brain based because the further a muscle is from the brain the greater the length of questionable nerve tissue an impulse has to travel along to get there. The greater the distance, the greater the chance for something to go wrong, more or less. \n\nMy sibling, whose case of CMT is much worse than my own, has had considerable thigh weakness for years, perhaps from age 40 or so I think. \n\nI do not know much about pain management for CMT, but it is a topic that gets talked about here from time to time and if you want to make a post specifically discussing that, some of the other people here might have some useful insights. Thank you! That was very informative. Since one of the types I have is the 2b1/4c1 it explained exactly what my breathing issue is. Just knowing is better than not.", "(short) What do you answer when someone asks you \"why do walk like this?\" ", "Looking for a Website At a recent Center of Excellence appointment, the expert in CMT proclaimed, \"We are on a diagnostic quest.\" With that, he pulled up some website, and said, \"Let us look at the European history of this variant.\" and just like that, voil\u00e0! He pulls up the variant and the history.\n\nIn 100,000  European's, this variant has been seen exactly, SIX times! SIX!

Anyone have any experience with these medications? Personally, Baclofen, even at low doses really makes me sleepy and interferes with daily living. What say you?\n\n ( Ditto on baclofen. I only take it of a night and when it is bad, as the cost/benefit usually does not stack up. Thanks for the confirmation! One MD wanted to implant an intrathecal pump whereby Baclofen would be injected directly into the  spinal canal.

I have been using a foam roller recently with the hope to relieve some back pain and tightness from CMT.  I have personally experienced some feelings I never expected as my back has loosened.  I had been having a feeling for a long time that my spine could not go as straight as I needed it to, I could stand up straight but it still felt tight.  I decided to work on loosening my chest and shoulder muscle in a hope to combat the tightness in my upper back, and they certainly helped.  But I could not find a stretch that really felt like it was targeting the bend in my spine I wanted to work on.  Enter the foam roller.\n\nThe foam roller relieves that last bit of tightness, as I roll slowly I can literally feel my vertebrae releasing tension.  It provides a nice relief for 30 min from my back pain and I believe keeps the pain subdued to an extent some days.  I am not saying it fixes me, but I find a relief from it that I was not even aware I could experience and thought I would share in the hope it helps someone.\n\nI do not know how to include pics in this post sorry, here is a url that takes you to a google image thing of my favorite stretch with the roller:\n\n\n\n I have been using one lately and I find it a great help.   It is great as you can use it when needed and generally feels as good as someone doing a massage for you.  I am also trying to convince my father to try it out as well Yeah I love that I can use it when I want, and it takes less than 10 min to get some relief ", "Is it weird knowing that you are going to live your whole life with CMT? For context I am 14 and I have a very mild case of CMT (not sure which type) which affects mainly my calfs, my thighs and a little bit in my hands (Crap at art, fiddle-y things, videogames, etc.). I have had to have 2 operations in total on my right knee and ankle due to CMT (My kneecaps were pushed outwards, screwing up the entire alignment of both legs) and am still recovering, three months later from my knee op, and the fact that I need another op on my left knee. I also cannot stand up from the floor without some form of stable support.\n\nSometimes, I will spend ages just having conversations inside my head about what I think about life-it sounds weird I know-and, every so often, I will stumble upon the recurring realisation that I will be living with CMT my whole life, until the day I die. It does not worry me so much, it is just hard to wrap my head around, I am 35, I was diagnosed when I was 9. I had a lot of the same thoughts growing up, especially as I saw peers maturing into bodies that would grow stronger as I knew mine would eventually begin to fail me. This created some poor coping mechanisms, such as self-deprecating humor and a sense of fatalism. I would be quick to mock myself as a way to disarm perceived attacks on my disability (that never actually came). As I have grown older I have become more content with my body and it is flaws. After all, it is the only one that I will have. :)\n\nI would like to offer two pieces of encouragement:\nFirst, the quality of treatment for CMT symptoms, from pain management to reconstructive surgery, have improved significantly since CMT was first discovered. As an example, I had hammer toe surgery in 2005 which involved installing wire pins that left me practically immobilized for 4 weeks while the joints fused, and in crutches for another 4 weeks after that. I am having the same surgery on other toes in December, this time using newly developed NiTol implants with an expected full recovery time of 2 weeks. Quite the improvement.\nSecond, the internet has made knowledge sharing around CMT much easier. When I was first diagnosed in 1991 the only way to keep up with what was happening with CMT research was a quarterly journal. I did not know anyone with CMT and there were no support groups in my area. Now you can easily find everything from tips about how to tie your shoelaces to following clinical trials online. Being a part of a community that can offer help or just simply empathize with your challenges is no trivial thing.\n\nFinally, a piece of advice: explore ways to get comfortable with your body and dismiss the notion that it is defining characteristic is it is deficiency. Work with a physical therapist to find an exercise routine that brings you in touch with how your body moves. Practice yoga. Develop a fashion style that makes you want to take selfies (even if they are just for you). Personally, I have found that getting tattoos helps me feel more connected to my body and gives me the power of choice in a situation where I otherwise have little control.\n\nAnyways, this was a lot. I hope it helps some. On top of knowing I am going to live my whole life with CMT is the thought that it is going to get worse. At 21 now, I have to leave open pill bottles, my shampoo bottle, and food containers because I struggle so much opening them. I shake like I am 80yrs old and walk with a limp. Realizing that these things will only get worse honestly kills me a bit inside. \nBut, do what you can to improve yourself despite CMT- if you struggle too much in one area, invest more of your effort and drive into another area. I could never keep up with athletics growing up and so I worked on non-physical hobbies. \nAlso, realize that you can have accommodations in your life to make things a bit easier for you. If you plan on going to college, then you can have exam help, permission to use a laptop, and even extra time. 24 and I was diagnosed at about 10/11. I have had surgery on both feet to release the tendons and stretch out my toes/feet a bit. Still have issues with balance and walking. Am pretty \"clumsy\". I have been noticing more and more some weakness in my hands but overall I do have a mild form and it is still frustrating that I am unable to do stuff others can. I have a hard time with stairs. Like the other person said its important to find what works for you and helps you. You have to kind of get to know yourself. Personally I am not worried about having CMT, it is the effect that it will have on my body that worries me. I make that distinction because I am optimistic about the future when it comes to finding treatments that might halt the progression or perhaps even revert some of the damage that have been done by the CMT.\n\nWhen I was 14, the state of CMT research was still largely in a \"discovery\" phase, with the first CMT genotype having been found just a decade earlier. Future pathways for research towards are cure was starting to appear in the literature, but it was clear at that time that an actual working cure was a long, long way into the future, with many challenges in the way. Nobody were specifically working on finding effective therapies, and funding for CMT research towards a cure were negligible. Today the story is a different one. Many of these challenges have been dealt with, the amount of papers being published every year on CMT is twice what it was when I was 14, there are several trials either ongoing or in the pipeline that is testing out compounds that might have a positive effect on CMT symptoms, and there are active funding of several research groups that are specifically working on finding new treatments for CMT. The future for CMT research is looking brighter than ever before, and in that regard today is the best time yet in the history of the world to be 14 with CMT.\n\nI think that it is well within the realm of reason to believe that there will be a cure and a treatment for CMT within your life time.  Same age but the type I have is not nearly as destructive as some.  You hit the nail on the head. You learn to be comfortable with who you are at a younger age with CMT I think. I also did the whole self deprecating humor because I knew a lot of assholes growing up. People loot at me like I shot a dog when I do it now days, so I have tried stopping that. Or people offering help when I hurt myself... \"No I am fine\"   It is the whole getting over pride thing  that takes getting used to. Do not be so proud that you block others out. I am 24, symptoms started when I was 12 and had a temporary diagnosis at 14 (still do not know the type, but the only thing I would want it for is just family planning). The first paragraph you wrote 100% applies to me, except that the attacks actually came and the self-deprecating humor developed as an answer to that. In physical education, if almost every girl is faster/better at everything than a boy... He will be mocked, and I was mocked heavily, to the point that I started ignoring my body and ended up in the hospital two times after falling and not being able to get up, due to fatigue and pain. Today, I still use that kind of humor, although I am not attacked. People sometimes comment that they can distinguish me in a crowd for how I walk or how I am always tripping, even on an even floor. I do not care anymore, I have come to terms with CMT.\n\nI was lucky enough to find people who \"forced\" me into sports, ending up cometing at a national level in disabled swimming. Won several medals, but some years ago I had to stop due to being unable to conciliate university and trainings. I miss it a lot. /u/Meakas21, if you practice sports, do what you can not to leave them. While I was active, I felt ike my body was actually gaining strength, but from the moment I stopped the symptoms were aggravated. &gt;Do not be so proud that you block others out.\n\nThis hits the nail on the head for me. Well said. Thank you so much for these comments. I am glad that I found this sub because it awesome to see other people I can relate with, especially as a moody teenager. The whole self-deprecating humour I can relate with on so many levels and it is really made me think about it and how the whole \u2018crippled, disabled, product-of-imbreeding\u2019 gag is starting to identify me as a person to my mates and peers, which is not really what I want. Also, another question:\n\nDoes anyone else have a thought that some people are sometimes only nice because they feel bad for you, not because they like you as a person?\n\nSorry if I  come across as really awkward, I am just psyched that I have found people that I can relate with I do not really get that thought- I am even more cynical in that I feel (and am actually sure of) that people only ask about if I am hurt/limping because they are nosey and do not really care beyond being able to label me. Out of every person who has commented on the way I walk (and I remember each and every one) only one of them ended up being a worthwhile human and is now my fianc\u00e9, funnily enough. \n\nI do not think that people feel bad for me at all- they ask because they are nosey or comment because they are lacking some social manners (at least all the ones I have talked to).  Man. Yes. I am 20. My mom told me when I was 13 I had CMT. She waited so long to tell me (she knew after I had genetic testing at 3) because she has an auto immune disease as well that is killing her, and she wanted me to know I was not going to be like her.\n\n\nThe problem with CMT is the variability. My mom never had syptoms until she was in her late 20s, and that started with the onset of her auto immune disease, so it is impossible to tell if she would ever had symptoms. My aunt started having issues in her 20s I think, and she refused to address them so now she walks terribly, like her ankles roll with every step, and her hands are kind of fucked. My grandma started showing signs when she was younger, but her family did not want to address or talk about it at all. So it got really bad. Eventually she had surgeries done, but it was really too late. Her hands are real bad, as  are her legs/walking. \n\n\nI only had issues when it came to soccer. Around the time I was 15, I got braces for soccer only, that made it easier for me to play. At 18, I quit soccer. I had not been affected by my CMT other than that, and I thought I would be lucky.\n\nBut in the past 6 months I have noticed a change. I cannot really run anymore, if I do I trip or roll my ankles. My feet hurt alot more. I work retail. Last year black Friday week I worked 60 hours. My feet were killing me, as they would with any normal person. But after 2 days off my feet they were better.\n\nThis black Friday, I worked 30 hours then add another 12 standing hours that week because of a football game where we destroyed our rival. Here we are, 2 weeks later, and my feet still hurt. I have had days off and done nothing, and they still hurt.\n\n\nIt is still not noticeable to others, but yeah, I know it is getting worse now, and worries me. I do not want my life to be limited by this, and it is hard because it is just impossible to tell how bad it will get.\n\n\nSo yeah, knowing you will live with this your whole life is weird. You will probably get overly worried over small changes like me, but it is important to focus on the good things. They are making great progress on research, and I think in yours and mine life time, there will be a cure, at least for CMT1A, and hopefully for the other kinds (I have CMTX, so I hope they can cure that as well). &gt; NiTol implant\n\nDo you have any information to share about this? Thanks First of all I highly recommend that you get tested and verify genetically exactly what form you have.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed it was actually a very calming feeling that I had. I finally knew why I had trouble trying to roller skate as a kid. I finally knew why I could never hop on a skateboard and move around like everybody else. I finally knew why are used to fall and land on my knees and bruise and scrape them up so bad.\n\nI was only 14 or 15 years old at the time and when I received the test results I knew inside that I never wanted to pass this on to somebody else. At that moment I knew I never wanted to have a child of my own genetics. Eventually when I was 23 I did a vasectomy to ensure my choice.  I can look back and say it was probably one of the best choices I ever made. I have nothing against kids. In fact multiple times I have looked into adoption processes...\n\nMy point is that when you know about something like this you can make plans in your life.  You never wish somebody to have this disease, but if you are unfortunate enough to have it... at least you can take action to prevent its progression excessively fast (avoiding neurotoxic drugs), avoid physical tasks that are dangerous,  stretch / exercise more, and make other plans based on your limitations.\n\n\n Never worry about why people are being nice. Just accept that they are nice. It is actually \"NiTi\" (Nickel Titanium). I have two SmartToe implants.  Hi,\u00a0\n\nfirst of all. Do not let the diagnose pull you down.\u00a0\nI got the news when I was around your age. I guess I have\u00a0CMT1A - not quite sure, because I did not had a gen test\u00a0I was diagnosed with nasty tests and they took a sample\u00a0of nerv/muscle tissue from my mothers foot. She has the same\u00a0problems. My grandma also had it. She got over 80 years old.\u00a0\n\nUp until now I can say that you can have a life with CMT.\u00a0\nYes..it is a pain in the a**. So my tips for you:\u00a0\n\n- Do what every you want. If your symptoms are not that\u00a0\n\u00a0 big at the moment than try everything you want to do.\u00a0\n\u00a0 You will see that there might be some limits. I know that\u00a0 I will not be the best runner in the world or athlet in what\u00a0 sport ever. But still I did dancing - Yeah...feet hurt like hell\u00a0 after an evening of dancing (classic and latin dancing not disco\u00a0 style wiggly stuff) but it was fun. When I got married I\u00a0 would have liked to dance the whole night but nope... that\u00a0 did not work out. But I danced when ever possible. Or I startet\u00a0 scuba diving. It is fun and beeing in the water helps with all that\u00a0 heavy equipment. On land I took my time to get ready or some people\u00a0 helped me to get the stuff to the water line. I skateboarded and\u00a0 drove mountenbike like hell. Do it now! Do not wait. It is possible\u00a0 that CMT gets worse and then you can still do it but it might get harder.\u00a0\n\n- Think and decide for you - but do not overthink it. I tought I would never\u00a0 find the woman of my dream to get married as I allways felt like quasimodo\u00a0 who just needs a peanut to trip and crash onto the floor. Nope. Found a girl,\u00a0 married and am happy.\u00a0\n\u00a0Same with kids. Up until my early thirtys I said \"no kids\". Then I decided\u00a0 that there is a 50% chance to pass it on. And up until then I had\u00a0 a good life and I know from my family that I can get old and that the\u00a0 problems arising can be managed. So I took the dare. Now I am a happy father\u00a0 of a girl. Until now she does not show any signs of CMT. So maybe I got lucky\u00a0 and the good 50% won. But I also decided after that that I will not take\u00a0 the chance a second time. If you think it is not good to pass it on and you\u00a0 decide against a child in the future. So be it. It is your life and your decision.\u00a0\n\n- But what ever you do just do not ignore it. I ignored it the last 25 years.\u00a0 Or I tried to ignore it - you cannot really. But I ingored it in ways like:\u00a0 I tripped - ah, my fault should have been more carefull / Yeah...feelings in\u00a0 the feets are getting worse and I cannot really feel anything except pain in the\u00a0 feet...it is just a phase...will be going away... etc. etc. Dumb idea.\u00a0\n\u00a0 If it is worse, get professional help. And stay in touch with a good doc.\u00a0 I did not had any test of my nervs (signal speed, etc..) the last 25+ years.\u00a0 so maybe I could have got more support, medicin, gymnastic etc.. I was on a\u00a0 \"I do not look - so it is not there\" trip. Bullsh*t. ;) Now I took the time and\u00a0 confronted myself with it - I have to as the signs are to present. So now I\u00a0 officaly filed for disabled status and got it. I can save a lot of money now\u00a0 (in germany at least). I can get more support, more holidays in the office,\u00a0 etc.. Heck, I even ca get 25% discount on a new car. So, depending on where\u00a0 you live, there can be benefits. ;)\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nSo try to arrange yourself with CMT. You can have a somewhat normal life. For everything else you can get tools. Or you can invent something to help\u00a0yourself and others. I am a software developer... so I am just sitting in front\u00a0of my screen and hack away in Java, Angular or C or some other language.\u00a0Good thing: I do not have to walk arround the whole day. Allways look at the\u00a0bright side.\u00a0\n\nTry not to worry too much. Live life at it is fullest. Do not try to plan\u00a0ahead long into the future. You cannot plan the next 10, 20, 30, 40,50,60,70...\u00a0years. Life changes every now and then and then you can reevaluate. Like I did\u00a0\nwith my decision regarding having a child. Thanks to the internet and\u00a0groups like this one on reddit you can allways get support and feedback. Use\u00a0it wisly young padawan and build your own decision.\u00a0\n\nI also reevaluate and decided to finaly start some sport programm again.\u00a0Had a nasty disc prolapse in the neck a year ago. And the physicist all\u00a0recomended to try to strenghten the muscels. So I will try Yoga now.\u00a0\nBulking in the gym is not for me. Yoga has gentle movements, builds strength,\u00a0clears the mind and keeps you flexible...so I heard. From other postings here\u00a0and in other online boards I distilled that a kind of minimum level of sport/muscle\u00a0\ntraining is good and helps to fight the results of the CMT. So based on this\u00a0my last tip for today...try to keep up some kind of sport. I have been a\u00a0couche potato the last 20 years...and I do regret this.\u00a0\n\nSo keep on smiling...take it seriously but do not overthink the stuff. You\u00a0still have so much time ahead of you...all the possiblitys are yours.\u00a0\n\nOr like \"the doctor\" said: We are all stories in the end. Just make it a good one, eh?!\u00a0\nAnd do not let the CMT pull you down. Do not sweat it. There are many different ailments that people live with in life. CMT is simply a pebble in a very large pond. It might bum you out because you have it but it is not the end of the world.", "Advice So me and my little brother are finding out exactly why type of cmt we have, his bloodworks came back and we have found out he has x-linked cmt, does this mean I will have the same variation? Yes, if both you and your brother have CMT, it is almost certainly the same type. Thank you Nu daughtwr has the dame type. May I als what age you are and what your symptomatisch are? So my little brother is 13 and I am 22, my symptoms seem to be worse, no muscle in my hands, nerve pain in my feet, really unbalanced and my hands stop working sometimes? Heavy tremors, and just general discomfort in my arms and legs really. Likely the same type. The symptoms of family members with the exact same type can vary widely.", "CMT and LASIK surgery Has anyone had LASIK surgery with any issues?\n\nI have CMTX and have been to two LASIK consultations. One doctor says it would be no issue while another says there is increased risk of dry eye issues after the procedure. The CMT Association says there is no known increased risk for those with CMT. I am doing myopia reversal. For starters (\n\nthen ( &amp; (  I have not been formally diagnosed with cmt, but I have been diagnosed with hereditary and idiopathic peripheral neuropathy. I have foot drop and cannot stand on my toes. That said I have gotten lasik in 2014. -8.5 with astigmatism was my numbers before surgery. After surgery my eyes were dry for a long time, but less than a year. But that was probably from my very high prescription. I displayed no symptoms of cmt or neuropathy in 2014. I am still  seeing perfectly now with no dry eyes 7 years later.\n\nTake my advice at your own peril. If I were you, I would spend an hour reading on Google \"cmt and lasik\" or \"peripheral neuropathy and lasik\". If nothing comes up maybe you should not mention you have cmt to your surgeon? Thank you for replying. The doctor reached back out after speaking with another surgeon and they are comfortable moving forward. I just have to sign an additional consent form. I have done a few hours of research and cannot find anything suggesting it is higher risk than any other person. I had RK (for nearsightedness) waaaay back when it was done with a scalpel and not lazar. My eyes still \"star\" lights and developed dry eyes. But since I was legally blind to start with, I would do it again.", "Anyone near alameda? Sports injury background a bonus Are you OK? Does not seem like the right sub for your question / statement ", "Symmetry Novice (dumb) question: With CMT, you always read that is a symmetrical motor-sensory neuropathy. In your experience do you lose function completely symmetrically (left and right hand same amount of function lost at the same time), or will one side be stronger than another but still decline? Even perfectly normal healthy people have some differences in strength. \n\nTypically if you are right handed you are also right footed, though we do not think about that as much. And the right side of your body with accordingly be slightly stronger just because you tend to default to using your right hand or foot more often. (Switch \"right\" with \"left\" for left handed folks)\n\nIn CMT (at least type 1A which I am most familiar with) your Nerve Conduction Velocity is slowed symmetrically but just like anyone else you can have differences in strength based on how you typically move and the resulting differences in strength. Thanks. I am just wondering as I see my left hand and R leg declining faster than their counterparts. Personally, I have pronounced asymmetry - my dominant (right) side is weaker, both hand and foot, always has been.\n\nIt is weird. If you think about molecular mechanism of CMTX (which I have), this asymmetry should not happen. I have asked my neurologist about it, he kind of just shrugged, said it is common and not well understood. For what it is worth, I have type 1B and I am very asymmetrical! They said that is a hallmark of my subtype, so maybe you have the same. I am 55, CMT 2A\nMy decline has been pretty symmetrical. For decades in my feet/lower legs &amp; and now (last 5-7 years) in my hands/forearms. I have CMTX as well and my left side has always been considerably weaker than my right. I am very mildly affected right now, but saw progression while I was pregnant and it was predominantly in my left leg/foot. For me, the start of the decline has always been symmetrical but the amount of decline has been asymmetrical. It started in both of my legs at the same time, and several years ago both of my arms started to be heavily affected at the same time. However, the right half of my body feels weaker and in pain far more often than my left even though it is my dominant side. Thanks for the reply. That is kind of how mine is. Both legs but left worse than right and left arm worse than right. I have got some proximal muscle involvement as well so I do not meet the classic CMT and we are working through some differential diagnoses.", "Insoles -   I had my feet moulded and received these today and they have helped my feet and walking almost immediately. The orthotics specialist told me that the more points of contact my feet have with the ground, the more signals will reach the brain, which enables the brain to associate them in space. Part of my feet issues have been to do with feeling like my feet are somewhat detached from my control, so I experience \"foot-drop\" and I roll my ankles frequently. I also have very high arches which is typical of CMT (1A). These insoles had a positive effect immediately.\n\nIf you are a fellow sufferer, I cannot recommend seeking out an orthotic specialist enough. I agree. Completely changed my ability to enjoy life :) Such a revelation! Yeah. If you have not tried acupuncture in your calves, I have had some great relief from that as well! I would never thought of that. I am down for anything at this point. Thanks for the tip \u270c\ud83c\udffb I have only heard good things about acupuncture and yet I cannot bring myself to do it Please try it. I am having it done Weekly at this point.", "Husband mocked the way I walk ", "Hi everyone! I was diagnosed with CMT quite recently and wanted to get all of your opinions on something. What are the pros and cons of getting the genetic test done to find out which type of CMT I have exactly? I was diagnosed almost 30 years ago, but just this summer had the genetic testing to find out which kind (I have CMT 2a)\n\nIt is much more affordable now than it used to be. With insurance it only cost me $100 out of pocket. So at that price, I wanted to know so I could track research, see my specifics, and get a better understanding of what lies ahead of me. \n\nSecondly, I have 2 children (my daughter getting married soon). I have always lived with a little fear/guilt of them getting it and the company that did my testing (Invitae) will test your kids for cheap if you test positive. With 2a there was a 50/50 chance with each one. I wanted them to know so it did not surprise them later. Praise God...neither of them have it!\n\nIt was not difficult to go 30 years without knowing the type. Most are pretty similar. But now I am glad to be able to be a little more specific as I do my own research.   I always assumed I had 1a. Now I am glad I know! Pros: \n\nThere are enough differences between types that you might want to be able to know yours if you want to read up on it. \n\nDifferent inheritance patterns: good to know if you are planning to have children or have a large family and others might be wondering about their own risk of having an undiagnosed case of the disease.\n\nWhile there is currently no treatment, there are some in the works which target specific subtypes. If you get tested you can know if those could help you. \n\nCons: \n\nMaybe you do not want it on your medical record for health insurance reasons in the US? But if you have already been diagnosed, I do not know that subtyping matters. I do not really know that this is a specific problem so much as the health insurance industry keeps changing and who even knows.\n\nThere is a blood draw, so I guess if you really hate needles? There are no cons except for price unless you pay nothing like I did. I was diagnosed 33 years ago but did the genetic test 2 years ago and found like others in my family it is CMT 2a2. \n\nThe advantage of it is when they work on drugs knowing your type is essential as they can only work on specific types of CMT at a time (CMT  can affect the nerves differently depending on the type) for example if you have CMT 1a then you are in luck while the rest of us watch with longing on the sidelines.  \ud83d\ude00 Pros:\n\n-\tYou know what you have\n-\tYou can participate in research/trials\n-\tIt is simpler to communicate (\u201cI have CMT 1B\u201d, vs. \u201cI have peripheral neuropathy, possibly CMT, unknown phenotype\u201d)\n-\tYou can be aware of the risk for your kids (if any)\n-\tWay less invasive/painful than the EMG you probably already had\n-\tYou can follow research more easily\n\nCons:\n\n-\tMight cost $$ (get precleared from your insurance)\n-\tDoes not change the limited treatments available I have not had it done. I cannot see any benefit personally to justify paying. Maybe if it was covered and there was no cost involved? I fully agree with all of this but would add:\nPros:knowing can help you gauge what to expect as far as progression of the disease as they are pretty consistent yet everyone is different. Example is that I have type 1a and read that most people with this type have hand issues and I have absolute no issues with my hands. I just read ( today, it is great news for Type 2 research! A treatment for the various Type 2 genotypes might come a little bit later than for say 1A, but on the other hand because the pathological mechanism in Type 2 is axonal, there is a lot of research in other fields that is directly applicable to Type 2. Axonal repair and neurodegeneration in general, regardless of the cause, is a hot research topic. That is really neat! Thanks for sharing", "Fitness and weightloss with CMT? What is your experience working out with CMT, and weightloss/gain? Do you have any advice, tips, or things to avoid doing?\n\nI have 1A and want to get into shape and I am sure there is other people here who would want some pointers ^^ When it comes to weight loss, the most important thing is to not have a too aggressive caloric deficit. Most people want results fast, but the bigger the caloric deficit the bigger the loss of muscle, and we especially have to try and hold on to our muscle mass as much as possible. A low to moderate caloric deficit combined with sensible resistance training while in deficit and a sufficient protein intake is the most optimal strategy.\nA point to note also is that people with CMT in general have a higher muscle fat fraction than non CMT-people as well as an overall lower amount of lean body mass. This will vary quite a lot between individuals, but it could be something to keep in mind when calculating the basal metabolic rate. My favorite tip is that people with CMT tend to burn more calories (25% to 35% more, if I recall correctly) when simply walking across level ground, compared to healthy non-CMT folks. So walking is really a great exercise for us. \n\nI will add my usual: a couple of physical therapy sessions with a PT who specializes in neurological disorders can help identify the exercises best suited to strengthening your body. If you can swing it, nothing beats professional expertise specific to you.\n\nOther than that, I agree with pmp22, you will want to calculate how many calories you burn and eat a bit less than that. There are various diets that you can try, but ultimately it comes down to finding a way to make your body happy eating a bit less. \n\nPersonally, I find higher protein and lower carbs make me less hungry--and the protein is useful for muscle building--but I do not think diets are really one size fits all so much as maybe play around and see what works for you, so long as you are eating the right number of calories and getting some vegetables and such. Oh, a kitchen scale really helps with figuring out portions, so get one if you do not have one. In short, little success in doing anything normal. I have done moderate to extensive cardio, small and large calorie deficits etc. Did not do much at all. \nThat is not too say that there is not an obvious solution though.", "The CMTA's ongoing research ", " Friday Feelings - Small Celebrations Little things that went right this week. \n\nTimes when CMT could not stand in your way.\n\nVictories that you want to share.", "Update So I posted a few days ago, my little brother has had he is bloodworks back and has x linked cmt, and my nerve coduction studies say that my cat shows a axonal picture rather than a demeylination, anyone here able to help shed some light and explain what this all means to me?? Also I was told mine is autosomal dominant?  X-linked CMT is a group of types, like CMT1 and CMT2 are. There are sub-types to each of these and that might help pin down some of the confusion here. Each sub-type is caused by a problem with a different gene so if your brother was diagnosed with a genetic test, they must know which sub-type it is. \n\nCMTX1 is the most common of the X-linked CMT types and it is a demyelinating type, I believe. I am not sure about the other sub-types of CMTX off the top of my head but if you find out which sub-type he has it might help you to learn more about what is going on. \n\nI do not think your doctor could know that yours is autosomal dominant without a genetic test. He (or she) may have been speculating based on the most common types that seemed to fit your symptoms. So they told me autosomal domintlant as the CNT only comes from my mum's side, my brothers effected gene is the gjb1 gene i believe Mothers pass on an X chromosome to both their sons and their daughters. Fathers will pass on an X chromosome to only their daughters. The fact that it has come from your mum's side does not mean it is not X-linked. The only way to rule out X-linked CMT (without genetic testing) is if you see a father passing CMT onto their son. In this case, it is almost certain that your CMT mutation is the same GJB1 mutation as your brother's. Also, CMTX1 can be demyelinating, axonal, or an 'intermediate' between the two. Some forms of CMT are not easily categorised, and CMTX1 is one of those. Thank you so much, this really helped a lot!!! The involvement of the GJB1 gene means that your brother has CMTX1. \n\nAs stopstalkingmepaul mentioned, it sounds like the inheritance pattern you describe could be either x-linked or autosomal dominant. CMTX1 is x-linked dominant. Okay and this would mean that we both have the same mutaed gene sitting on the x chromosome? Or could we have different mutated genes that sit on the x chromosome?? Theoretically you could have different mutated genes on the x chromosome but the odds against it are \"winning one of the really good lotteries\" type odds. You almost certainly have the same mutated gene. Okay cool, thanks for the info, you have all answered all my questions!!", "PXT3003 Phase 3 Trial showed improvement for CMT1A symptoms (\n\nThis combination drug showed some improvement of CMT1A symptoms. The company is applying for market approval in US &amp; EU. \n\nThere are still question remaining and further research underway, but this is the most promise a CMT1A treatment has ever shown.  I applied for this trial but was bounced because my EMG results were out of range. My conduction rate was too *slow*, which was a weird situation of being too symptomatic for a study. I am excited to see these results and hope that they can get to market soon. That is a very strange drug. \nIt is an antispasmodic, a drug addiction inhibitor, and....a laxative. \nFrom what I have seen with sleep issues,the antispasmodic makes a lot of sense as gabapentine can be prescribed to help, but the other two drugs are just random af. I would like to know the reasoning for adding them and what pharmacokinetics is going on. Wow, this is huge! While I am still holding out hope for a full genetic correction, this sounds really promising. \n\nCan someone step in and comment on risks? u/pmp22 ? \n\nAny comment on how long it will take to get a drug like this to market?  It certainly is a strange looking combination, is not it? I did a lot of reading on it a couple of years ago when these trials began to try to figure out what they were trying to do with this. \n\nMy recollection is that since CMT1A increases PMP22 protein production to an unhealthy level this combination of drugs boosts the cell's normal rate of breaking down PMP22, clearing out some of the excess so the cell can function better.  \n\nHere is ( \n\n&amp;#x200B; All three components of PXT3003 are already on the market for other things and therefore have well established safety profiles. Granted, using the three together obviously does something different than using them alone or this drug combo would not be a thing, but none of the trial participants seemed to have major problems with the combo. \n\nThe three drugs are: \n\nBaclofen, which Google tells me is commonly prescribed for muscle spasms in dosages of around 40 to 80 mg; PXT3003 uses 12 mg for the higher dose. \n\nNaltrexone, often prescribed at around 50 mg, is in PXT3003 at 1.4 mg. \n\nAnd 420 mg of sorbitol. Sorbitol is used as a laxative sometimes but it also approved as a food additive and is used as a sweetener. The FDA says that consuming more than 50,000 mg a day can give you diarrhea but this is a comfortable amount lower than that.  \n\nI do not really know about the amount of time it might take to get this through the regulatory process. I would guess something like 6 months to a year? I would be glad to hear from anyone familiar with approval times in cases like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B; I wonder what effect the sorbitol has, it is such a common food additive (and one I happen to be terribly intolerant of).\n\nThis seems to be really promising research though, I saw the initial reports when the study started and fully expected never to hear about it again, which seems to usually be the case. I believe it actually targets the cellular levels of PMP22 mRNA. Figure 3 of the patent application has the effect of each of the three active components on PMP22 mRNA levels, and each individually lowers them. \n That is what I get for relying on memory, thanks for the correction.  No worries! Thanks for posting this. I actually participated in this trial. Unfortunately it had no perceivable effects, but I am glad it is working well for other patients  I am very curious to hear your experience. Can you share or are you under NDA?\n\nMy question primarily is- did you show any improvement on the ONLS and was there any real objective testing done (like, did they do a pre and post NCV test)? I am curious if you showed improvement but did not perceive it, basically.  They ran regular tests on me every 6 months ranging from blood work to ekg to ncv tests but nothing demonstrated serious improvement. After the trial ended I was told I was on the high dose so I know I was not getting just sugar water. \n\nMy nerve conductivity was slower than they targeted range of applicants but I was still able to get in, but that may explain why I havnt experienced similar results as other patients. \n\nUnfortunately the doctors never established a baseline before they started me on the treatment so all of my metrics have been compared to the first test while I was on medication. However, the trial was long enough for me to confidently believe that if I was improving it would have shown by now. \n\nMy last test day is coming up and I will no longer receive the medication \u2014 however as some people have commented the drug is made with three already approved drugs and I plan on having a pharmacist make a cocktail using the same ratios as the medication.  Under \"DETAILED DESCRIPTION\" in the link above there are some more information about the relevant metabolic pathways of the compounds in relation to CMT1A. PMP22 overexpression is the root cause of the disease, but how that overexpression leads to the phenotype in patients is still not fully understood.\nSkimming through the three compounds in PXT3003, it seems that D-Sorbitol decreases PMP22 gene expression through multiple different pathways. It also seems to increase the removal of misfolded protein aggregates which forms in excess in Schwanns cells with the PMP22 duplication. It also reduce oxidative stress and have a positive effect in relation to cell death. Baclofen and Naltrexone decreases transcription of the PMP22 gene, and it is suggested that Naltrexone also plays an important role in the biology of Schwann cells. As far as I understand, Pharnext is also suggesting that taking them together has a more positive effect on CMT1A than what each compounds would have on it is own. I am sure this study will get a lot of attention going forward, and the topic of additive or synergistic effects in relation to CMT as well as the roles each of these compounds play will see much more interest going forward. What an exciting time for CMT research and for us all.  Hey, thanks for mentioning me. I have not looked closely into risks yet, but I will look into it with vigor once the study is out. In general, each individual compound in this mixture has their own set of side effects and contraindications. But they seem to be well tolerated in the general population with relatively mild side effects, especially at the doses that are relevant here. They do not seem to be contraindicated in people with CMT1A and as far as I know the prevalence and/or intensity of side effects is not higher in people with CMT1A compared to people without CMT1A, though I have not looked into that. If they do have positive synergistic effects when taken together, then they could potentially have negative synergistic effects as well. The only data that can answer that question is the studies on PXT3003, and though they suggest there is no such negative effects it is important to remember that so far studies funded by Pharnext is the only data we have on that. In time these findings will hopefully be replicated by independent teams. There is also the question of long term effects, which Pharnext is exploring with an extension study and that hopefully other studies will look at in the future. There are also other things to keep in mind, for instance in medical research only about 60% of results in peer reviewed papers are actually true, so relying on any single paper to draw conclusions is a risky business. But time is precious when you have CMT, and research is often slow.\n\nHow long it will take until this becomes available is not something I can answer. A quick look through the literature suggests that the review of the application for market approval takes about 12 months in the EU, but that is just one part of the the pathway from Phase III trial to market approval and eventually production, distribution and sale of the drug. It would be interesting to ask someone with experience from the pharmaceutical industry for their opinion on ballpark figures on this though. There are economic incentives for Pharnext to become first to market with a therapy for CMT1A, so I am sure they are working as fast as they can. Mind if I ask what your NCV numbers are?  Do not remember off the top of my head, but I will write them down and post an update after my last test day", "Join Movement is Medicine! CMT Specific Workouts! ", "Has anyone experienced intimacy issues due to neuropathy? Just a heads up that this post is about sex and what not so you have been warned. I hope this is not against the rules or spirit of this sub.\n\nI am a male in my late 20s and I have got CMT. To put it bluntly I have never been able to orgasm and I think it is due to neuropathy. I will not go into too much detail, but I have tried just about everything (alone and with a partner) to get myself there but nothing has worked and I honestly do not know if I have even come close. I know I need to speak to my doctor about this, but I have always been a tad uncomfortable asking this question.\n\nHave any of you had this issue? Were you able to work around it or find ways to get there? I am female but have the same problem and I think it is CMT related. I have reduced sensitivity elsewhere so I figure it is reduced there too. No solutions though sorry, still trying to work it out for myself I do not have anything useful to add to the topic but as a mod I will say that I think it is absolutely a legitimate medical issue and a good topic for discussion here. M late 20\u2019s, I have had this issue before.  For me it comes and goes.  Mine is not as severe as yours but I have definitely noticed it.  Asked the DR and she just said that it is different nerves and I might want to see a urologist. That is what I need to do. It is not going to be a conversation I would like to have but it is an important thing to know more about. Thank you for the response Just one of those things that I have got to learn to deal with. We have all got stuff like that due to CMT. I do not think we have peripheral nerves in our genitals. CMT probably is not the problem. You deserve to be able to enjoy sexual pleasure. Talk to your doctor. So this seems to be common and these types of threads keep popping up every few months so don;t worry about it.\n\nOne of the first things to check is your strength of you pelvic floor. My guess is that it will be extremely weak and tight due to people with CMT being limited in building muscle. You will want to start a serious regime in stretching it and strengthening it.\n\nYou could also take some ED medication as that helps increase blood flow to the area and this would again, be a great indicator if the issue is muslar in nature. Tadalafil is a good starting point as it is not too strong. If 20mg of that does nothing then up it to Sildenafil (Viagra). Fun fact; these drugs also help at the gym, so if you take them, make sure you do some exercise to get the most from them  :p \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlways feel comfortable talking to your doctor about anything that could be CMT related. It is a highly complex disease which the medical world still barely understands, and no one knows all the side effects. There is a good chance that if you have had it, dozens of other people have.", "accepting my CMT diagnosis ", "Questions about using Marijuana to treat the symptoms of CMT I appologies if there is already a thread on this. I feel like there should be but I was unable to find one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, i am currious about anyone's experience with using Marijuana for CMT. What have you folks found?  On FB cmt groups they use it all the time. I personally do not I will put it this way, CMT is not breaking me yet and when it does I will absolutely use pot to treat the symptoms. To combat what though? I have not gotten the genetic test done yet to figure out which kind I have, but I believe it is one that does not cause pain. Do they use it for pain? I have CMT (Cannot remember which) and am a regular user. I do not notice any difference in my movements or anything like that, but if you are referring to chronic pain, I have not progressed that far yet. So unfortunately I cannot speak on the pain front. Pain from symptoms, pain from afos, emotional distress from living with the disease. there is honestly such a wide range of reasons why it can be used. Pain shouldnt be the only reason for use.  I understand that it can help with swelling too.  Marijuana has no beneficial attributes for CMT1A.  I cannot imagine it helping with any form.  Enjoy the high, but know both THC and CBD have thusfar shown no positive impact for CMT.\n\nJump on anabolic steroids like nandrolone.  You will see benefits. I think it helps relieve my general joint pain and I do not notice nerve pain as much.  It helps enjoy walking and outdoors.  I think it is a good pain relief option for mild pain and cannabis has also been shown to help with inflammation.  The high is controllable to an extent in my opinion, much more so than alcohol.  \n\nSometimes I push myself to do things in public to be social and active knowing I can go home and smoke to relax pain free.  \n\nYou do you,  use responsibly,  it is not a cure just a way to seek relief I use CBD oil to help with pain I get from type 1a. It certainly feels like it is helped, it seems to work quickly and I am able to sleep a lot better.  Would you expand on your experiences with using Marijuana and how it did not help? I can see all of these others offering first hand knowledge of how it does in fact help them so i would be interested in more information on your situation. To be honest, it sounds like this is coming from a political stance as apposed to an informed personal experience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally would never take steroids ever again in my life if at all avoidable. The side effects are not worth the nothing they accomplish in my experience. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also suffer from IBS and was on steriods for some time for that which was horrible. I eventually tried Marijuana to find that it made life livable again and I use it daily to treat that. So as the CMT symptoms are coming around it is difficult for me to judge if the Marijuana is helping my CMT pain as i have been taking from before already. This is why I ask for personal experiences from others.  Anabolic steroids are very different than corticosteroids.  I think you are confusing the two.  You were likely on prednisolone to reduce inflamation.  Prednisolone is fucking insane and I would never take it unless I had extremely bad inflammation of tissues.\n\nI am telling you for a fact that anabolic steroids have **proven** improvements in CMT patients. \n\nFor example: \n&gt; After the 3-month therapy, the patient gained 5.0 kg of lean body mass. Muscular strength increased significantly: maximum voluntary contraction at bench press increased from 10 to 25 kg, dumbbell fly capacity increased from 2 to 8 kg, and leg press capacity increased from 15 to 40 kg. The Walking Index (WISCI)  improved from level 6 to 14. The **SNCV increased from 20.3 to 22 m/s in the medial nerve and 19.6 to 21.5 m/s in the tibial nerve**, respectively. Similarly, the** CMAP increased from 3.1 to 3.4mV and from 1.0 mV to 1.3 mV in medial and tibial nerves**, respectively. The muscle biopsy showed an extensive type-grouping, consisting of cluster of types, suggesting a reinnervation process.\n\nThis is insanely great news for CMT patients!  Any reinnervation is good for CMT and having even these small improvements as seen in this study, its well worth it.   I am a big advocate for nandrolone because it can be safely dosed for women as well as men.  For men, you will need to jump on testosterone replacement therapy because nandrolone will shut down your testicles because you will not have enough luteinizin hormone due to nandrolone being recognized as free Testostrone.  Being on TRT is not necessarily a bad thing.  Its another powerful med that has huge benefits with minimal side effects as long as you follow a safe protocol and do regular bloodwork.\n\nAs for marijuana, I have used it many of times and seen no personal benefit re: CMT or discomfort.  I could care less about politics.  I can promise you that there is no lasting benefit from marijuana usage.  Oxandrolone is a shit drug because long term usage can damage your liver, especially if you drink oaccasionally.  Nandrolone will not destroy your liver.\n\n Very interesting. thank you. I have to admit that the thought of having to be on this steroid is terrifying and I hope I never need to but positive results are certainly a step in the right direction. \n\nI would, however, still suggest that pain relieve and sleep aid are still very positive impacts on CMT which Marijuana unquestionably provides and it still boggles the mind how this is downvoted as it is. Is this not a productive conversation? I came looking for answers honestly. I had an External Fixator on my right foot and my left is so inflamed and the pain is intolerable and I am not sure what to do.  Marijuana will help with the pain. Try it. Yeah I am currently in Europe touring I am going to try to go see a neurologist when I get back.  I use CBD oil and it helps a bunch with muscle spasms.  I recently got back from the CMTA convention in Seattle. One of the specialists there highly encouraged the use of stains high in CBD and low in THC for pain management as well as using a vaporizer/edibles/tinctures/ointments rather than smoking straight as smoke inhalation has it is own list of added side effects. \n\nLimit alcohol consumption as well and any real depressants. Of course talk with your doctor first!  Thanks for the info", "Barefoot vs. padded shoes I am in my mid-twenties now and really starting to notice the effect of CMT on my walking and my feet in general. I have it relatively mildly compared to some of my family members but especially over the last year or two I am really struggling with pain when/after walking (which comes on a lot earlier than it used to), lack of balance, rolling my ankle a lot, and just generally being a bit clumsy and heavy on my feet. As it gets worse I am really struggling to find shoes that are comfortable and have gone through more pairs than I would like to admit in the past few months. I have now resorted to buying cheap pairs from Primark so that I do not lose so much money on shoes that do not work for me, but I was thinking about investing in a pair of shoes that would be properly comfortable and good for my feet as I want to get back to hiking again.   \n\n\nI have seen a lot of conflicting information, which basically comes down to either: \n\n\\- padded shoes are better for people with CMT as they offer more support\n\n\\- barefoot shoes are better for people with CMT as they are not as rigid and encourage a more natural way of walking, which will help to build up foot strength and muscles\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wondered if anyone here has any experience with either padded or barefoot shoes, and what you would recommend? I have been looking at Vivobarefoot but they are quite expensive and I also do not want to do something that is possibly detrimental to my feet in the long term. You want shoes with a good sole, ankle support, and you NEED prescription orthotics (insoles). Once you have all three you will be fine.\n\nAlso as done advice for shoes, get some with a Virbam sole. It is a specific type of sole that is pretty much indestructible when it comes to walking. You can get good pairs from places like Sports Direct. Years ago I used to rock the Skeletoes because I liked the arch support.\n\nI prefer to actually be barefoot, but I love my Croc flip flops. If I have to wear sneakers, I go for loosely tied converse high tops For pain, I would suggest as others mentioned, trying out orthotics. I use them for just general walking around. \n\nI will say in my 20s I would run about a mile a day in toe shoes (Vibram five fingers) for strength building. I cannot say for sure if it helped but it definitely did not hurt, for me at least. \n\nI will say I have not experienced pain with my CMT though. I do not wear AFOs and I recently have found a sweet spot with Xeroshoes another barefoot brand and not as expensive as Vivobarefoot. They have a wide sole and a wide toe box and I feel very grounded because of the thinner sole. I do not like a lotta padding because it is harder for me to perceive changes on the ground and I am more likely to be \u201cblindsided\u201d by uneven ground and fall. It is going to depend partly on how advanced your symptoms are in your feet and partly on individual variation. I am assuming that you are in the majority of CMT folks who have high arches; if not much of my advice will be considerably less relevant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was a teenager I loved the barefoot style, and they worked well for me then. I read somewhere that people with high arches (this was not talking about CMT folks, just general people with high arches) do well with flexible shoes because their feet are already more rigid. I think that is true, up to a point. I am in my 40's now and I am past that point. Perhaps it is that my feet are now so stiff that even a flexible shoe can not compensate and what advantage I once found with those is gone. Now I am most comfortable wearing short hiking boots with rigid soles and good padding. Personally, I wear Keens. Keens makes a lot of shoes/boots which have wide toes and less-wide heels and that suits my feet very well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are having specific foot issues like pain from the stress of high arches you will need something with a good arch support which may need to be a custom insert as some of our arches get too high for standard off the shelf solutions. I did have a period of 2 or 3 years between wearing barefoot style shoes and when I switched to heavier shoes when I wore the highest off the shelf insert I could fine. It worked well for me for a while, but ultimately the hiking boots have worked out better for much longer. One of my issues is the top of my foot is up against the inner roof of whatever shoes I am wearing, so adding arch support really makes it feel tight. \n\nThat said, I have amassed a decent sneaker collection. Performance basketball shoes, the really good ones feel like you are walking on air. Having enough so that I can rotate them daily prevents them from being worn out too fast. \n\nI have worn the barefoot soles for exercise, they are fine. Usually very lightweight, which is nice. If you have not tried alternative lacing schemes for high arches, I highly recommend you give them a try. There is a diagram here: ( and I find that it helps considerably to alleviate pressure on the top of my feet. Thanks for posting. I have never seen this. Wonder if it will stop the tongues from going sideways too. My father has was diagnosed at 18 and was told he would be in a wheelchair by age 50. He is nearly 65 now, and still going strong. As far as anyone could tell, his mutation on PMP22, was spontaneous and no one else in the family had it. His was characterized as type 2 (back then apparently there were only two types). \n\nI am in the diagnostic stages myself, and I have spoken to my dad in detail about it, because I am having many of the same issues as you. I constantly roll my right ankle, and it seems to NEVER heal. My dad gave me a pair of braces that prevent me from rolling my ankles, and told me that for many of my childhood years that he would pick skateboarding shoes because the outer soles were flat, and he had more confidence in his steps.\n\nI have always been most comfortable in Converse All-Stars, as I do not have high arches. \n\nHis biggest word of advice that he constantly reminds me of... DO NOT STOP WALKING, or working. Sure, it hurts a lot, especially with constant sprains, etc. but, the second you do not have something to do, or somewhere to be, you will be in a wheelchair before you know it.. (just my story, you do you)\n\nNowadays, he is wearing a brace that wraps around his calf and connects to the tongue of his boots. They allow him to pick his toes up off the ground, and paired with \u201ccombat boots\u201d that are stiff in the ankle and has side zippers, he can easily get them off, and do his job.\n\nDo not give up. I cannot either \ud83e\udd17 I swear I have been rocking the same pair of croc slides since I was thirteen they are incredible How did you get orthotics in the first place? Are they prescribed by a doctor? My affected family members are past the point where orthotics would help so I have no real knowledge about them That is one of the reasons I was considering barefoot shoes, I feel like they might help me keep my footing better. Are they comfortable on even ground too? Thanks so much for the info! Amazing, thank you! My grandma has it and swore by going out for a walk every day to keep her going. Since Covid happened and she cannot go out so much her mobility has really deteriorated, so I can completely understand (and believe) your Dad's advice. Looking into orthotics as a lot of people have suggested getting some. Thank you for the advice! Yes, a doctor will prescribe them for you. I would suggest going to a neurologist that knows about CMT. I believe the CMTA has centers of excellence they recommend, if you are in the US and close enough I highly recommend Stanford or the University of Iowa. \n\nEven a GP can prescribe them though, should not be too much of a hassle. I am in the UK and I know my family members have often had difficulty dealing with GPs as many are not familiar with the condition. Hopefully I can speak to someone at the surgery and see if they have anyone more familiar with it who I can speak to. I think so! Again I use an arch support in them. They are very orthotic friendly. I am sure the brands all differ from each other though. I found Vivo to be a little slappy loud on the ground personally. The reality is that what you need is prescribed insoles, generally with advice from an orthopedic surgeon who understands CMT. No off-the-shelf shoe will fully account for the mechanical complexities caused by CMT, so trying to find the perfect pair is akin to trying to find the perfect diamond in a Swarovski shop - you will not be able to. \n\nThere is some key features in shoes that will help (( but really the insoles are going to be key. Which Xeros do you have? I was looking at the speedforce and the oswego, also looking at the Primal 2 from Lems. I am definitely going to see my GP and find out about getting orthotics. I found out yesterday that the local hospital also has a neuromuscular disease department with CMT specialists, so hopefully I can get a referral and get some further help beyond what my GP can do. Aptos and Oswego. I really like the Oswegos . I like Aptos too but they run a little big.", "My lovely Boyfriend has CMT X linked Hi everyone, \nLet me first say that I am brand new to reddit and I have no idea if this is where to post lol.\nFor a while now, I have been with the earth's greatest man. He is intelligent, funny, sweet and caring. He is attractive and innovative to me. And he also has CMT. I have known of his condition since the beginning and I never judged him for it or questioned it. I love this man and I want us to have a future together. Everytime he would fall while we went on adventures, I never was embarrassed. Instead, I felt such a deep empathy for him, I wanted to pick him up and hold him and tell him it was alright. He deals with so much anxiety and self deprecation but I have always been patient with him and I do not mind reassuring him.\n\nHowever, I also have a borderline personality disorder or bipolar mom. My whole life has been a challenge with her and she is made me have doubts in so many aspects of my life regardless of what it was. I finally opened up to my mom about his condition and she was upset and planted a lot of seeds of doubt although I know it came from a good place in her heart. But I was fine on my own, I did not need her opinions. Fast forward, and she still keeps bringing it up, and I guess I built up so much anxiety (I deal with very bad anxiety) that these doubts began to grow. Now I am crippled up in my bed in tears worried sick about it, and questioning my love for him \"what is love?\" \"Am I able to care for him?\" \"What is caring?\" \"Is it care or pity?\" \"Is it normal for me to question it?\"\nI keep reading threads online and they scare me more by saying basically that if I question it, I must not love my partner. I do not find these fair assumptions because in our life together so far, it was not an issue. \nGuys, I really need your help to make me understand what is going on and how to fix it because I do not want this to affect my relationship. I am scared to death that I am beginning to feel differently for him, I start to tremble and almost vomit. We are currently talking through the issue and I feel better when he is there to tell me it is all okay but I guess I am still upset. Him and I are very open with each other and have healthy communication skills together.\n\nEverywhere I see that love is supposed to be perfect and never have moments like this, but I am wondering if you guys have ever experienced it and how to deal with it. I am my own worst enemy. For the last 4 months I thought I was dying of a terminal illness (I am sometimes a hypochondriac), so I am not sure if this gives you any insight to why it is so hard for me. This condition is brand new to me (he recently finally told me the exact name of it and I have been  researching the last month or so on how to help him the best way possible), and so I feel I am going through the ebbs and flows of it but I am not sure if it is normal and I feel so guilty. Regardless of his condition, I think I would have just picked something else to worry about because it is just my nature I guess. \nPlease help me if you feel you have any advice or kind words of encouragement. I certainly do not want to be told to quit my relationship and that I am a bad person for questioning things. I just want things to be back to normal and me not worry so much about his condition, because beforehand, I literally never thought twice about it. \nThanks, redditors. I appreciate you if you read this far. :) Also, please let me add that I am open to suggestions on how to make him feel better. I sometimes give him foot massages and I help him stretch his calves but I am not sure if this helps. And if anyone has X linked CMT and would be willing to give me insight to your life and advice, please do so. I want to be the best I can be and truly help this community and my boyfriend (even if I am going through a tough time). It sounds to me like you are pretty overwhelmed right now. I cannot pretend I have good advice for how to manage your mother's mental health issues and how to navigate those dynamics, but here is some food for thought.\n\n1) When it comes to the idea of having to \"care\" for him, that future varies a lot from person to person with CMT. If you Google the disease, you will often see the worst of it. However, if he is currently quite ambulatory, CMT is generally a slow progressing disease and you should not expect him to have dramatic loss of function any time soon.\n\n2) I am not sure if you two talk about having kids one day and if that is causing some stress, but CMTX is a sex-linked trait and that makes the inheritance a bit interesting. Assuming you are not a carrier for CMTX, it is impossible for the two of you to have a boy with CMT (your partner would contribute the Y chromosome and his X would not matter) and if you have a girl, women with only one X chromosome with CMTX tend to show mild to no symptoms. All of this ignores the possibility of avoiding CMT inheritance entirely through PGI, though that is an expensive route. \n\n3) When I met my husband, I was almost asymptomatic for CMT and was not diagnosed until 2 years in. In the 8 years I have known him, my CMT progressed quite a bit, but that has not meant our lives together have gotten worse. We still took a Euro trip last year where I walked up to 10 miles a day, but now I do it with AFOs and we just have to make time to do my stretches/take some sitting breaks along the way.\n\nBasically, the disease progressing will be frustrating at times, but it is never going to be the only thing going on in your lives. Sure, my CMT got worse in the last 8 years, but I also got two degrees, visited 2 continents, married the love of my life, got my first job, and now my husband and I are starting to search for our first house! With all of that happening, I believe my life is unequivocally better now than it was a decade ago, even when factoring in CMT. \n\n4) Last point, which is blunt but important - a life with the promise of no health complications is truly an illusion of the healthy. People can start relationships with no known health issues and develop autoimmune diseases, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, lifelong injuries from a car wreck, etc. That is why wedding vows include \"in sickness and in health\" - the odds of dealing with that sickness part is near 100% over the long arc of a lifetime. CMT makes that reality more obvious and immediate, but it is not like choosing a different partner would guarantee you would not have to deal with something equally or more medically disruptive with them one day.\n\nUltimately, I understand how anxiety could lead to your current thoughts while still not putting your love for him in question. However, if these unwanted thoughts do not get better soon, I would suggest talking to a counselor. It is hard to say definitively without knowing you, but this really sounds more like a case of runaway anxiety and intrusive thoughts and that this may never have come up were it not for your mother's input. Good luck. 10 miles is 16.09 km Hello, thanks so much for your input :D I truly appreciate that you took time to write to me. I woke up so far this morning not completely sickened by anxiety, so I think I am slowly making progress.\nYes, if my mother would have never butted in, I would have *never* had these thoughts other than the general concern for his health which everyone has for their partner. As I was thinking last night, I cannot just one week be loving someone and the next not; I think there is a lot of overthinking and anxiety problems hidden in here for me and that is what makes it hard. \nThank you for letting me know of your experience. Yes, when I first started to dig into this condition, I cried and was so worried that something awful would happen to him - it was a wake up call and I guess my concern also contributed to this big meltdown I am having. I saw so many sites discussing the worst possible events and I pictured him having to cope with it even though I know he adores being active, it broke my heart. But now that I am educating myself and becoming less ignorant of this disease, I realize what a broad spectrum of CMT is present, and I also realized that no matter what, I would be there for him. Everyone has issues. I mean, look at me, I am on here blabbering about my anxiety and yet he still is understanding and patient with me. \nAnd no worries, I am not sure how to maneuver the relationship with my mother either lol, the whole thing was brought up because I am planning to move to an apartment with him as he is finishing up university and so am I. We had a solid plan but my mother has a way of distorting things for me and making me freak out over things I would normally be confident in. \nMight I ask, what did you see on your trip? My boyfriend and I want to travel in the near future and I would love to hear some advice on where to go. \nAgain, thanks so much for the reply. It is beyond appreciated and I am grateful. As far as counseling, I have thought of looking into it many years ago but I come from a family where these things are frowned upon and stigmatized. I am personally not this way, but being brought up in an extremely judgemental environment was not easy. In the future I think it may help me though. \nThanks :) You are not doing him a favor by being with him because he is disabled. If you are not going to love him unconditionally and if you feel like you are a good or giving or a righteous person for dating someone with CMT, which is what your words make it sound like, break up with him. If you are doubting the relationship now, when he has not progressed as much as he will, then you are not strong enough to be in this relationship. Do him a favor and give him a chance to be with someone who is not weak. It is also ableist to blame your mother's mental illness on your own doubts. Why not be accountable for your own feelings instead of blaming someone else's mental illness? If you are that affected by someone else's mental illness, it sounds like you need therapy and until then, you should not be in a relationship with even an able-bodied person. Our (American/Western) culture really pushes an ideal of perfect love but as love is a thing which exists between human beings, it is a bit messier than that. It sounds like when your mother started questioning your relationship she made you stop and ask questions, which is not totally unhealthy, but then you started questioning your relationship \\*because\\* you had once questioned it and it spiraled a bit out of control there. \n\nIt is good and healthy to look to the future and ask yourself if this is what you want from life. It is not healthy to think true love would never question. Love allows you to answer the question, \"yes, this is the life I want, being with this person and all the benefits and challenges they bring to my life\". Every relationship will have both benefits and challenges. If you are happy with what your life looks like with this person and you are both committed to overcoming obstacles together you will be fine. \n\nThat is rather more than I meant to say on the topic of love and relationships, haha. Anyway I have been with my husband about 15 years now so take what you want from that. \n\nI think other people have covered some important things: CMT is slowly progressive so even though it varies a lot from person to person it is quite possible to look at someone and have a good idea of what their personal disease trajectory will look like. This is not a disease which surprises you. \n\nI would suggest that you consider talking to a therapist of some sort, just because a neutral person can help you straighten out your thoughts. I read somewhere that \"our parents know how to push our buttons because they put them there\" and perhaps talking to someone could help you sort out how to deal with any further anxieties your mother stirs up. Hi there. Thanks for the input. I understand your perspective but I do love him unconditionally. It is difficult because of certain situations I am currently in, it makes me overthink and doubt myself, not him. I know how it could easily be misconstrued, but it did not even have to be about his condition; it could have been anything. That is sadly how anxiety and intrusive thoughts work and it is been a long journey for me. As far as my mental health, it is been a rough year, friend. Again, thanks for your reply. Thank you so much for your words, I appreciate it greatly. You are absolutely right. In the past when i would evaluate my relationship with him, it was no big deal to me, I was simply seeing our future and making sure it matched what we both needed. It did not mean I did not love him, it was just a simple observance. Fast forward to now, and I am questioning my questions and motives and overanalyzing everything. And it took a lot of bravery for me to even post this thread because I know it is not an anxiety subreddit; It is a CMT one and I do not know if everyone understands how deeply anxiety impacts both my boyfriend and I. \n\nEither way, your words mean a lot to me. I knew that regardless of his condition I would have to go through a process like this *because* I am choosing to stay with him. I know, it sounds weird. But if I didnt love him, I would not even bother to care or seek advice from reddit of all places lol. My personality type is pretty paradoxical and I have a hard time because I question so much, I am always in my head so to speak. I am happy with him and we have the same goals and we want to accomplish them together. We share the same philosophy and he was my best friend before being in a relationship with me, so I know we are strong. I guess it is just me that is causing this spiral and it is getting a lot to handle. Love is messy. But I do have hope for our future and I feel it is just a weird stage or something that I have to go through. \n\nHe told me went through something similar in the beginning of the relationship, whereas I am just now starting to because many traumatic events have happened to me the past year and I did not have time to overanalyze my relationship. In my heart I just knew I loved him, it was a given. And I still feel that way but I am dealing with my own demons to get back to where I was.\nThanks for helping me. FWIW, I did not get the impression that you are with him out of a sense of self-righteousness at all. It does sound like you have a lot going on with anxiety - I cannot speak for you, but current events have not been kind to people with -and without - anxiety, regardless of what else they have going on in their lives. :) Also, it is possible to love someone unconditionally and still probe your feelings - is this the life you want? Are you still happy? That, to me, is just normal introspection, a way of checking in with myself. In no way do I think that makes me weak. Love - even unconditional, head over heels love - is still a choice, which is important to remember when things get hard (as they do in any relationship). I would agree with another poster that counseling or therapy might be helpful, a neutral space to explore and process your feelings. (and I see u/NixyeNox has touched on these points as well)\n\nSimilar to what u/IEA_Taco said, there are no guarantees regarding health or ability in this life. Things could change at any time, and part of committing to someone is acknowledging and accepting that. \n\nFinally, of course there is the possibility that feelings will change. You are young (I assume, based on you saying you are finishing university), and people grow and change. Acknowledging and acting on those changes is hard but necessary, if it comes to that. Only you (not your mother, not strangers on Reddit) can know what is right for you. I wish you and your bf all the best, it sounds like you have a good thing going. Feel free to DM for some CMT-partner support if you need it. :) It sounds like your mother does not have your best interests at heart.  If it hurts and confuses you to listen to what she says, you might want to stop getting advice from her. No problem! As someone who has gone to counseling a few times in my life for anxiety-related issues, I really do recommend it. It is amazing how much you can rewire your patterns with just a little help :) \n\nWhen we went on our trip, we did a UK/Ireland tour! We hit up Dublin, Portrush, Edinburgh, Sheffield, and Berne. Our favorites were actually the little seaside towns, Portrush and Berne! However, Edinburgh was probably my favorite of the large cities. Would recommend :)", "Anyone on here with kids? Wondering if my 3yo\u2019s falling/tripping is CMT related or him just being a wobbly 3yo. It is assumed that my family\u2019s subtype is x linked. However I am seeing a neurologist in a few weeks for the first time to hopefully get some testing done.  \n\nI am a female, and if it is in fact CMTX then that means my children have a 50/50 chance of getting it. I have two boys. My 3yo can run and jump and ride his scooter and climbs and is super active. He has pretty good hand eye coordination too. Currently it is 11am and he has tripped &amp; fallen already at least 4 times this morning. I am wondering if anyone has any input on what is normal for a 3yo as far as falls and learning their balance. I have CMTX. As a toddler, I walked on my tiptoes because I could not get my heels down to the floor. Even after corrective shoes made it possible for me to stand normally, I could never squat flat-footed or walk on my heels. \nGood luck with your upcoming testing - and with raising a rowdy three-year-old! I was wobbly as a kid (CMT2A)\nWas not officially diagnosed until adulthood. Genetic testing typed it last summer. Company that tested me tested my kids for cheap since I tested positive (Invitae). Both of them came back negative! That is so good to hear about your kids! I cry a lot thinking mine may have it. I will definitely get mine tested if I can get the same deal as you. Thanks for your feedback! I have got 3 kids with Cmt1a confirmed in the two older ones, awaiting test results for the youngest. All mine were very clumsy but so are most toddlers! \n\nEldest toe walked though and that was a massive factor into her original testing, she is coming up to 12 and still toe walks and is going for serial casting again in a few weeks. \n\nA neurologist will be able to do any tests that they need to and will more than likely offer a blood test just to put your mind to rest. Thank you so much for your feedback. I have definitely been feeling quite stressed about it all (I am 7mo postpartum and have also been dealing with some PPD). When you say toe walked, was that just on occasion or like most of the time she walked? I have noticed my 3yo does that sometimes but otherwise walks he was with heels on the ground. It varies so much in families, I have got family members who have it and are hardly affected, others who are more severe. I know it is so hard to not worry, especially when it is your child but please try not to. You never know how it will affect him if he does test positive. There are a lot more different types of AFOs now than when I was younger (I had the whole shebang) and they are constantly doing new research.\n\nMy daughter toe walked the time, her heels would never touch the ground and still do not. But she has serve hypertension , my son who is the complete opposite has hyper mobility and does not toe walk but falls often. \n\nIf you are based in the UK and need any support with anything then we found that a muscular dystrophy charity was an amazing source of information and help. I dont have kids, but have a ton of cousins, nieces, and nephews with CMT. I cant speak to your child tripping a lot, some kids just are accident prone... but I can speak to the fact that it is not unusual for there to be different types of CMT in families.\n\nMy dad and all of my male cousins are/were on ssdi from a young age, not immobile young, but definitely not as mobile as normal kids. My aunts, me, and my brother all have a very mild case, diagnosed when we were adults, and not yet maybe never debilitating.\n\nI grew up away from my family, so I really didnt know much about it, until I was diagnosed accidentally. My neurologist explained that I definitely was not present the same as my dad, and it was likely I had a different type. Genetic testing where I live is prohibitively expensive, so no way to know.\n\nYour little boy could be completely normal, have a mild version, or have your version. I really hope he is missed the mark and got out unscathed, but even if he did not, hes going to be fine. Wow, I did not know there could be different types in the same family. Thank you for your response. I think I also have a mild case. I always thought I did not have it. My 41 yo brother was diagnosed at 20. My mom has it too and it has gotten worse for her in recent years (she is 61). I always thought I got lucky and did not get it. But recently at 31 years old I started feeling some tingling and numbness in my fingers &amp; hands, and my balance is starting to get a little wonky. So, of course I have been super worried about my boys potentially having it. Thank goodness for a rock of a husband who will love me no matter what happens, and who always lifts me up when I am upset about it. I live in the city where the Mayo Clinic is (just moved here last year) and I am hoping the genetic testing here is not super expensive. Idk what to expect! My daughter inherited type 1 from my husband. His mother and my step-daughter also have it. My daughter met all the milestones at an appropriate age, but her pediatrician has never been able to incite deep tendon reflex reaction during physical examination. My daughter is 17 now and has been relatively symptom free. I wish the same for you.

We need more Dr. Shys in this world.", "Is this CMT or I am exagerating? Hi,\n\nI started getting wrist, arm pain progressively in the last months, I do not feel like I am losing sense in my fingers or arm just a lot of pain when typing using computer, I went to being a gamer, and programmer to having pain browsing computer normally.\n\nI have no issues with my legs, I can run, train, nice muscles on them.\n\nReason I am asking my uncle, cousin have CMT, but my mom does not, and cmt is from mother side.\n\nHow does your cmt affect your arms? I want to see if I have same symptoms. Could be (although rather rare I believe, since your mother does not have it) but could also be something like a tendosynovitis. I would go to the doctor.\n\nFor me btw. the symptoms in my feet have always been worse than those in my hands. (I have type 1A) First let me say that whether it is CMT or not, you should still get it checked out. At a glance, wrist and arm pain in someone who uses a computer a lot sounds like it could be carpel tunnel or a related strain issue. I want to emphasize that such repetitive strain issues are amenable to treatment if they are caught early and if it is one of those you will be a lot better off if you get it diagnosed and treated sooner rather than later. \n\nOK, that said, has your mother been tested for CMT? If she has and definitely does not have it the chances that you have CMT are probably no greater than those of someone who does not have any relatives with CMT. Do you know which type runs in your family?\n\nIf she has never had a genetic test, there is a small chance that she simply has such a mild case that it has passed unnoticed, in which case she could have passed it on. \n\nCMT typically manifests first in feet and lower legs and later in hands and lower arms but this is not a strict rule. There are definitely people who see hand symptoms first. \n\nPersonally, my hand/arm involvement is minimal. My hands shake a bit and my grip is on the weak side, that is about all. There are people here who have much more prominent hand symptoms, though. Thanks for letting me know. I see, thanks for your time, my mom had no genetic test.. she is about 50 all health, working as a nurse no problem.\n\nWould be right on your side, I did play a lot of intense click  video games, but then I just remembered my mom telling me about her family having CMT caused me a bit of paranoia. I am already seeking treatment, got x-ray tomorrow just the thought of having CMT really scared me, it is not the thought of  oh being a bit weaker till I die, far I know her brother has CMT his legs are getting bad but he can still work etc, but I would want such a disease affecting my professional career as I just started getting good at my job, I am a computer scientist, wanting to go into research and all of sudden my ulna side hurts a lot, like a lot just from typing. I will probably talk with a doc and wait. This could be a normal computer use injury. See a doctor. This happens to lots of people without CMT. CMT usually affects feet before hands. thx for letting me know. If you have Raynaud's phenomenon, that is liable to be CMT, but nothing you described sounds particularly like CMT.", "Finally took charge I am a 24 year old male with CMT. I am not sure what type, I was diagnosed when I was about 12. The diagnosis came after my parents finally noticed my severe high arches and my funny gait and decided to get it checked out. I was then given some kind of orthotics that I am sure you all know only fit in big ugly shoes. Well as a a middle schooler I thought I was too cool for those big ugly shoes I never wore them. Literally maybe 10 times. I wish I would have believe me I now realize my mistake, but we cannot change the past. \n\nAs years passed I noticed my CMT was getting worse but I was hell bent on not letting it make me any different than my friends. As a result I suffered multiple ankle sprains and stress fractures. It finally came to an end when I broke my 5th metatarsal on my left foot while....bowling. Freaking BOWLING. I did not even drop the ball on my foot, just rolled my first turn and when I stepped down it snapped. This was two years ago and I remember the Dr saying this obviously is not a bowling injury, it is a CMT injury. That was it I knew I could not shrug off my diagnosis anymore if I could not even do something like bowl without worry of breaking a bone.\n\nFast forward two years and a ton of doctors appointments. Yesterday I had a triple arthrodesis with an Achilles lengthening on my left foot. After seeking multiple opinions I decided this was the best option for me. I do not fully know what to expect and I do not know if any of you have had a similar procedure and care to comment or if I am just rambling on.\n\nAnyways I am glad a community like this exists. Besides my family members who have it I have never met or talked to another person with CMT. So I am down to talk about it or answer some questions if anybody has any. Thanks I have not had the surgery but I know it is extremely common among people with CMT. Welcome to the community! Glad to hear you finally started addressing the condition. I totally feel the urge to just pretend nothing is wrong and carry on. CMT is the sort of disease that no one knows you have until you tell them so it is really tempting to pretend, but I have come to realize I am always better off asking for support. Wherever you go there will always be people eager to help! Hi, happy to hear you are moving forward.\n\nI have had similar of not the same surgery (I forgot what the doctor called it haha).  Back in 2015 my left arch was surgically broken in 3 places and realigned then screwed together.  My achilles were both lengthened in a separate surgery in 2004 or so.  \n\nI have so much more ankle stability now! Like almost too much haha.  My left foot went from being a flat tire to somewhat working like a foot/ ankle should haha.  My physical therapist told me to be careful because the way they moved some of the muscles and tendons around to increase stability would put extra stress on my knee.  She was right, I now have to be aware that my left knee is at risk of injury due to some lack of ankle flexibility combined with the new stability.  But it is still so much better than before.  I hope you recover well and are able to start enjoying activities more! Things will not be perfect, but in my experience the things I do now are much more enjoyable without have to worry about rolling an ankle.\n\nI actually avoided bowling for years because of fear of falling over haha.  I have enjoyed it since my 2015 surgery though, there is a bowling/ bar I have gone to a few times.  What I have learned though is that bowling is actually bad for my wrists.  I think CMT has affected my wrist strength to the point the ball is too heavy.  But hey sometimes you just got to live a little. I had the triple arthrodesis done on both feet at age 13. It allowed me to switch from metal braces attached to high top leather orthopedic shoe to a plastic AFO (brace) and any kind of shoe I wanted. Today I am wearing a carbon fiber brace with Adidas. I am more than twice your age and am confined to a power wheelchair now, so I can say with experience: **Do not slow down**. Seek out and take every opportunity to experience life as much as you can. Ride horses, ride a zip line, scuba dive, chase girls or guys or both, climb a mountain, shoot a gun, hike a trail, go fishing, travel, etc. . . My CMT is severe and I allowed myself to put on weight as I got older so I have to use a chair. You may never need a chair, most folks with CMT do not. I never regretted getting my ankles fused.

Finding good shoes or boots that fit are my new jam lol. As far as losing muscle mass, I walk pretty much everywhere but it is inevitable. Other people here offered options but having basically no health insurance it would be pricey... maybe someday. Before I was diagnosed I used to sometimes break down and cry in the middle of shoe stores and not understand why everything I tried on hurt.  When I found a boot I could wear I bought two pairs, and it is sadly discontinued now. I hear that... for sneakers I stick to wide, mesh, running shoes. Boots are hit or miss... little to no heel, wide and a good tread are what I look for. Unfortunately there are few stores on the west coast that sell decent boots. Luckily when I went back to visit family in the Michigan, I found a decent insulated pair after trying about 5 pairs. The struggle for shoes is so hard. Even when I find a good shoe, it does not mean it will stay that way. Sometimes I can wear a shoe for two years and it is great, but then my foot just changes shape and the next season it kills my feet. I have found discontinued shoes on eBay. I had one pair that ended up working great but was off the shelves before I knew it would work so well. Over the next six years I found three more pairs on eBay. Two were even brand new with tags.

But it has been lately, I honestly I feel like I am going crazy not knowing if I am feeling pain from the CMT or if its just normal. I just started working a FT job (2 days ago) as a cake decorator and am on my feet all day. My ankles and feet were hurting for most of the day before I started, there were occasional shocks of pain, or driving and feeling like the gas pedal is made of a giant glass shard. I have gotten custom orthotics and nice tennis shoes I have seen a lot of reviews for. But now, I am just in constant pain at work. I want to cry all day. I flinch anytime I turn away from someone. This job is my passion and it should be exciting, but I just come home cranky, exhausted and in pain. And I do not know if its mainly the CMT or if its just that feeling when you start a job like this or waiting tables. \n\nIt is kind of weird, but walking around my all-hard wood floor house without shoes or socks does not hurt as bad as wearing shoes with or without the orthotics.\n\nDoes anyone maybe have shoe brands they have found to be really good? See if you can get your custom orthotics adjusted. I needed a different material and that really helped. Of course, I ( 42 f )still cannot stand all day like that without major consequences. New balance, the old school more structured kind have treated me pretty well. First thing I would do is see if your orthotics need adjusting. They are a finicky thing. My orthotics doctor always follows up two weeks later to see if they need adjusting. My feet have changed drastically (from dead flat to high arch, and now they are going back again) and the pain sounds like how I feel when the arch is being overcorrected. \nBesides that it is generally known that CMT and standing do not mix well. Maybe take a look at how you operate and see if you cannot make some accommodations. Even something as simple as leaving some high stools around the workspace to sit on while you work. I also used to be dead flat and now am getting huge arches, so interesting to hear that from someone else. Any guidance on managing the transition? I preferred when my feet were flat to be honest Honestly I was really little when I had flat feet. Really, it just meant having to get new orthotics regularly. I also had AFO\u2019s for several years. Having a good specialist is really important. My current orthotics are designed with posts under the arch to keep my foot from rolling in. Is it possible do decorate cakes while sitting down?   Might have to get a bit creative,  but I would try to find a way....   maybe if not sitting than maybe alternsting between standing and sitting on your knees with the cake lowered down further? I think your Orthotics are too aggressive.   If your Orthotics are trying to make corrections and it is too much I believe it kind of puts your foot to sleep and you get that glass shard pain.", "Chris young  ", "Opinions on working out? Yes or no? Hello everyone! I am 22 years old and I have been wheelchair bound since I am 10-11 years old, was diagnosed when I was 2 years old, do not know what type of CMT but I would say I am on the severe end of the spectrum since it affects my foot (had surgery when I was 5-6 yo), legs, arms and hands strength a lot, I have also been diagnosed with restrictive lung disease and I have had surgery done for scoliosis when I was around 11-12.\nI thought on doing this type of exercises (sitting, without added weight)  to keep the little strength of my upper arms, but I am not seeing a physical therapist at this moment and I have not for a while, and my doctors never mentioned anything about exercising (only stretching) so I am not sure if it would help at all, do you think working out could be good to keep my arm strength? I have read that some people think that exercising when you have CMT could have a negative impact in your general strength but at the same time I have read that some people thinks the total opposite so I would like to read more opinions. I have added specific info about myself since I know everybody\u2019s case/symptoms are different.\nBy the way of course I will be extremely careful to not overdo things and accidentally hurt myself. In my opinion a little bit of exercise is good. The problem is if you overdo it. And how do you know where that line is? When I was a teen I was strong enough where I could help move a long heavy dinner table with two fingers on each hand instead of using my hands and arms. Then around the age of 18 I got an exercise bike that had moving arms. I used it everyday for 3 months. Then I stopped. I rapidly lost maybe 60% of all the strength in my arms and hands. Permanently. 20+ years later they are only weaker. Suffice it to say not only right after that I could not move a dinner table with my fingers, I could hardly move a table at all! \n\nI would suggest a little caution especially since you are on the severe end of the spectrum and I would suggest seeing a physical therapist to help you with this. Doing it alone might be a bad idea. Are you me? Yes. Yup I will definitely try to see one! Well fuck me with a goat cheese Any exercise is good no matter what. Us folks with CMT just have to be careful not to overdo it. Find out what you can do and do it. If it hurts then stop. Why is overdoing it bad? As in muscle pain after lifting weights? I think we all agree that the answer is \"yes, but not too much\" but what does that mean in practice? There are tons of books and websites dedicated to helping healthy people figure out the exact optimal way to push themselves to do the most good--and those people are at less risk of injury. \n\nI speak (type) as someone who has both benefited enormously from exercising and who also had a bad cycle for years of \"try to work out, overdo it, injure myself, give up for a few months, try again\". When I was diagnosed at 20 my neurologist told me to never exercise, that I could only hurt myself and not help. It took me years to get over that very bad advice (I had to walk to class and eventually I noticed that I had gotten a lot better at walking from doing it). When I saw that I could improve I kept trying to throw myself at the gym and coming out with a sprained ankle or similar. \n\nA really good physical therapist who specializes in neurological issues helped me to understand how to gently but regularly target certain muscles and how I could really see benefits from exercises over time without injury. \n\ntldr: ideally find a good physical therapist, one who specializes in neurological problems. Otherwise, take it slow but do try some light exercise and give it 2 or 3 months before you expect results. \n\nGood luck! Because what are you doing when you work out? You are deteriorating your muscles so that they can build themselves back up. With CMT, at least with certain types, we already have issues with the electrical signals in our muscles and responsiveness so may not be a good idea to put them through so much stress because they may not respond as well when recovering. That leaves room for injury. Its so hard to give advice without know the type. I have CMT1A and if i do too much standing in a given day i can hardly walk that night or the next day. Id like to say to be careful with workout and avoid over exerting yourself. I know myself and I want to push my limits when i do arms or my core but if i do that with my legs i can do more damage than good. If you are really interested i would consult a knowledgeable physical therapist for sure The signals to the muscles are degraded. Meaning certain muscles will overwork other muscles, this can cause undue strain on ligaments, joints, and surrounding muscles and in my experience the recovery time often negates the initial workout in the first place. This is not something you can push through, you HAVE to work within your limits or they push back Probably the best response in the thread So as long as you arent sore for days afterwards its okay? I only seem to have weakness in the flexor muscles of my ankle. But if they do recover and you dont experience pain days after its okay? I am not a doctor or physical therapist and I am only speaking from my experience. I would imagine that would be ok as long as you are aware of your limits and if it hurts then stop. I am aware of my limits and I push myself every now and then but I am aware of my limits and listen to my body. It is hard to say because CMT is actually a lot of different diseases. But, in my opinion, exercise is really good for improving function in quite a few ways. Just make sure you work with a qualified professional at first (preferably a neuro-focused PT).\n\nI actually do pretty moderately heavy weight lifting, with some modifications, and I think it is made an enormous impact on my overall health and even made me more stable and improved my gait somewhat. I think the advice to not lift weights with CMT that you sometimes hear is outright wrong, at least in my case. I have seen results. \n\nYou likely cannot do every exercise that a non-affected person can do. You may tire out faster. That is okay. Just keep trying. One thing I have found is that a lot of reps of lighter weight is good for the muscles that are more atrophied/affected. I do heavier lifts on the muscle groups that are not affected. This may mean that exercises that are more \u201cwhole body\u201d like some free weight lifts are not as good a fit.\n\nBuilding stronger muscles in the parts of your body that you can is really worthwhile even if you cannot gain any tone at all in the limbs that are most affected by CMT. If you can build your hips, glutes, quads, core, and hamstrings, for example, they can really do a lot to help you compensate for weak lower legs. The same is true for arms. I talked to a doctor about this, they said with 1A he does not think I should worry about over doing my workouts. The real risk is just injury - which can take you out of the gym for a while.\n\nMay be different with different types of CMT", " Friday Feelings - Small Celebrations Little things that went right this week. \n\nTimes when CMT could not stand in your way.\n\nVictories that you want to share.

Hey there again! \n\nHonestly it is been a nightmare ever since I was a child - it was bad then and even worse now - but I get all dizzy and feel very sick from overheating, my skin goes red with the heat but it still feels cooler to me than what it actually is \n\nI tend not to stay in the bath for long because of either overheating or the \"coolness\" of the water and was not sure if there was a product or a specific bath that could regulate the temperature but I guess I will just have to make do! :) Thanks for this ill have to try out the things you mentioned\n\nBaths tire me out too but because I can only stay for a short time I can cope with it for now!\u263a Good luck! Look up dysautonomia/pots. My biggest issue with my CMT is POTS. Give me the pain and dysfunction any day. I have CMT1A and not everyone has dysautonomia with CMT, but a lot of us do. I actually use a thermometer to measure the temperature. I usually have it about 38C before I get it Oh my God you are a lifesaver. Thank you! I did not realize POTS was correlated with 1a at all. I have always had \"random\" days where the fatigue was so bad I could barely stand and yet others I was great (like beatsaber expert+ great). Thought I was doomed/dying of heart failure despite making huge progress in cardio these last 5 years. Now I am realizing the good days are usually when I intake a lot of water with electrolytes and the bad ones when I have an energy drink instead. \n\nJust today I was having some weird symptoms after recovering from a cold last week, felt like it came back full force minus the congestion, but I have not had nearly as much water as normal today. Did the heart rate and blood pressure tests and my HR goes from 52 while lying (normal for me) to 85-90 within minutes of just standing.\n\nGoing to have to talk to my doctor of course but I will keep my sodium and fluid intake a bit higher until then. If you have questions, feel free to pm me. This has been happening to me for over 25 years. \n\nFair warning, only some doctors use their training and link dysautonomia to CMT, even though it is caused by peripheral neuropathy. It may be useful to Google it and have the research at the ready in case your doc is like my old doc.\n\nFurther warning, if you go to your cardiologist on a good day and they want to do the POTS test, it will come back normal. Just like a fasting + glucose liquid blood sugar test will not show hypoglycemia, even if you have it bad. My flares are brought on the worst by heat and sometimes I will be stuck in a cycle where my blood pressure will get so low and heart rate will get so high... Then the adrenaline gets excreted, the glycogen stores get eaten up, the insulin is released, all in the name of my body trying to get my blood pressure up, all the while causing havoc. It feels like a panic attack, but it is not. This will last for days, and sometimes months. For me, IV infusion therapy helps, as does traditional Chinese medicine (herbs and acupuncture together heals me the fastest). Good luck! Make sure the energy drink does not contain B6, esp. high dose. A no-no for CMT. Why is it a no no per se?", "Does anybody know if it 's possible to create a natural form of PXT3003 with Chinese herbs that has a similar action to the drug?  doubt it. Prob easier just to get your doc to ask and prescribe the ones in it for you. We also do not even know if pxt3003 does work so looking for something that is not as effective for something that might not even be effective seems like a waste of time imo. That sounds nigh-on impossible. People with CMT1A have a PMP22 duplication on at least one chromosome, so instead of having two copies of the gene each making some mRNA, we have three copies making mRNA. This leads us to have too much PMP22 mRNA, which makes too much PMP22 protein, and something about that whole process causes problems for cells in the peripheral nervous system. \n\nPXT3003 works by lowering the number of PMP22 mRNA molecules  in the cell. \n\nThis is not a case where scientists are treating symptoms, so that you could find a Chinese herb that treats the same symptom and swap it out. This is a treatment on a molecular level. You would have to find Chinese herbs that lowered PMP2 mRNA levels in the peripheral nervous system. That is going to be really hard to find.\n\nTLDR: No. Nope and there is no point.\nAs I have said many times it is only the baclofen that has any affect. The only herbal supp that is vaguely similar would be 3g of lions mane a day. What you are looking for are Gaba B upregulators or just an increase in Gaba as it is the down regulation of the Gaba-B receptor that triggers the excess pmp22 production. How do you know it has no effect? Why would millions of dollars be pumped into trials if you already know what does and does not work? Hope some gene therapy will be used for something more akin to a cure but we have to wait and see if it works. Just research the drug and see how they are all end of life and two have literally no affect and make no sense to put into a treatment.\n\n\nBaclofen works as it is a Gaba-B agonist, and Gaba-B down regulation CAUSES CMT 1A. This has been proven in two rodent models. \nHowever Baclofen has huge side effects which is why it is rarely used. \n\nAlso they have actually cured CMT 1A with gene therapy so yea.....pxt is just rehashing crappy drugs.\n\nSources:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo people can downvote all they like, but there are the sources. what u mean end of life? like they have no use anymore? My neurologist and his peers were also unimpressed with pxt3003. If you look into the results, there was not much improvement in patients. At best it reduced decline, but even that was minor and hard to measure. It was so inconclusive that new standards are being developed to quantify CMT function. Besides that, the drug concoction was unstable. Finally, when they say the drug is safe and tolerated, they do not mention baclofen causes life threatening withdrawal symptoms. isnt the dose of baclofen in pxt3003 so small though? compared to normal doses Yep! Exactly that.\n\nSo what happens is that either the drug has been replaced by another drug that is either more effective and/or has less side effects, new methods of treatment come out making the drug less popular, or it is impossible to sell the drug at a profit as the patent has expired. \n\n  \nSo one way around that is to wrap up a number of drugs and rebrand it for a new use and under a new name. This allows the company to do new trials and get a new patent. That is basically what PXT3003 is. Plus that drug became DOA when the CRISPR trial succeeded in curing CMT 1A. Aye, I am part of the study for developing a new standard to measure CMT development and deterioration. It should be completed around 2023/24. just wondering when do you think the crispr trial would start for humans? Also like is there anything bad about using pxt3003 besides possibly being ineffective? like the dosage of the one that causes massive side effects as you say is much smaller than any currently used dose of the drug. I do not know I am just thinking if the fda approves it as being effective with little side effects I do not see the harm in taking it from person to person if it helps them until the crispr thing gets done for a more permanent treatment 2023/4 is when they plan to start it.  \n\n\nSo baclofen is extremely potent even at tiny dosages. Most drugs that affect neurotransmissions are like that and even 1mg could be effective enough to warrant results/damage.\n\nThere are other solutions which would be better for short term use with helping CMT. Unless you had severe spasming and nerve pain I just would not recommend using Baclofen and im pretty liberal with what medicines and supplements I use. what damage would you be talking about? Also what supplements or meds  would be better? After all the vitamin C studies, there were a few meta pieces about how difficult it is to actually measure any therapeutic benefit in any CMT research. Three years is on the absolute upper end for a phase 3 trial, and it is difficult to really measure any change over that time given how slow it moves, or more how unpredictably.", "Does anyone use Modafinil for chronic daytime sleepiness ? I feel like this is the most debilitating part of CMT for me. I have mixed ADHD as well and currently use Adderall in moderation(like when I need to read for classes,do quizzes, or a lot of housework mainly because time is a myth to my ADHD brain). I would like to try Modafinil after seeing that it can help with daytime sleepiness- I just always feel tired. I never feel rested or like I have slept. I wake up and feel nearly the same as I did when I went to sleep and my whole body aches. It is always been this way, I do not remember ever feeling any different . I used to get yelled at for being tired all the time when I was young because I \u201cdid not do anything to be tired\u201d. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nVery interested in seeing if anyone else has tried this and if it is helped at all. I have not tried it, but I am pretty sure I have heard of people using it for/with CMT before, so hopefully someone here has first hand experience. I have tried it, I have also used ADHD medication. It keeps me awake but it does not get me to focus the way traditional ADHD meds would. If it is not too much hassle I would not hesitate to ask a doc about it, mine prescribed it because of the CMT just to give it a shot. I wound up not liking the feeling and decided to go off of it, it felt more similar to caffeine for me. I am in the processes of trying to qualify for it in the United States. I have to have a sleep study conducted first to rule out other causes of chronic daily fatigue such as sleep apnea. Without a sleep study, my insurer will not cover the cost because Modafinil is not specifically approved for people with CMT, but rather people who have narcolepsy or who are long shift works (pilots, doctors, etc.). I am cautiously optimistic that after the sleep study I will be able to get it prescribed at a low cost to me.\n\nI am so tired that I have a horrible short term  memory and doing something as simple as grocery shopping makes me so tired that I cannot function for the rest of the day. I have been using it for a year. It is not for CMT  though.  I have sleep apnea and insomnia and on my job driving (hundreds of miles a day) there were times I was falling asleep in the middle of the day. My Pulmonary Dr suggested 200 mg's of it and it definitely works! I do not get sleepy and do not take naps on those days.\n\nThe effect is actually sort of similar to Wellbutrin - I took 400 mg's a day for 6 years. Except I get even less sleepy on Modafinil. And Modafinil does give me more of a sense of focus, almost laser intense focus at times. That is another plus. And I do not get the annoying side effects I got with Wellbutrin like an enlarged prostate, back pains and vision issues.\n\nThere is only one major drawback and it is a big one - it makes me impatient, irritable and I drive very aggressively when I take it. Like, there are times I am close to either having road rage or causing someone else road rage with how fast and aggressively I drive. It got so bad that I started cutting pills in half on my off days and taking half a dose and then I stopped taking it entirely on days that I did not work. So, it sort of depends but I vacillate month to month. Some months I take it everyday, some months just work days.\n\nIt is not going to affect your CMT fatigue. I still get very fatigued on days when I am doing a lot, I just do not get sleepy. Your mind stays alert unlike the rest of your body.  So, in that sense it could help you. You might actually have sleep apnea, I saw a stat that 40% people with CMT1A have sleep apnea.  Do not 100% trust my numbers though.\n\n\n\n Thanks for the information. :) I have type 2A and it could definitely be sleep apnea. Either way, I hope there is a solution to the persistent fatigue! Best case is that it is sleep apnea.  OSA causes all sorts of issues and they can pretty much (depending on severity) be resolved by cpap Ok, I have extensive experience with this.\n\nIn short, stay away from modafanil as it likely will not help and will just drain your already stressed system.\n\n What you need is **a sleep study to determine your quality of sleep** Once this has been completed you will find you will likely need something to help you sleep rather than something to keep you awake. Modafanil did nothing for me as I was waking 20 times an hour! RPDota is spot on. It is more likely you have sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or non REM sleep parasomnia. I take it daily and I had a sleep study done before I started taking it. They found nothing and told me my insomnia was because of my CMT. You probably will not be able to take it plus Adderall. I must drink plenty of water while taking it because it causes unbearable leg cramps if not. If I do not need to do anything I do not take it. I also had to get a prior authorization from my neurologist to the insurance before they would cover the cost.", "Tips on Skating? Hi guys!\n\nMy husband has CMT-X linked, and last night we were at a college hockey game (go PSU!). I noticed how happy he was watching it. My husband adores hockey. Anytime we are at a sports shop, he likes to tinker around the pucks and sticks. Sometimes he shows me how to hold the equipment properly and all that jazz (sorry guys, I suck at sports but this is for my sweetheart!). I know intuitively he wishes he could do it without pain or balance issues. As a child before the CMT really settled in, he was able to skate a little. I hear stories of how his father built him a skate rink outdoors for him.  He is naturally athletic aside from the CMT and he keeps up on his arm and chest physique every week. We even have a signed Mario Lemieux jersey hanging in our room...  I am crying while writing this because I just want to do something to help. He is my world and I want him to experience all the joy of life. \n\nI am writing to ask if you all would know a piece of gear/equipment that may help him do these types of things: skiing, snowboarding, skating, etc. He really enjoys winter sports. Please, anything would help. I tried Googling but found nothing. You all seem much more in the loop of CMT and I would appreciate any advice or links to sports braces, etc. Thank you all very much.", "Fasting: Treatment for CMT/MS/auto-immune diseases? (Currently 5 days into my fast)  \n\nRe-post from the fasting subreddit, but posting it here as it may come in front of more people that are more interested in the topic. As per the posting instructions of the fasting reddit, all opinions expressed are my own. I have, however, read tonnes of medical studies to support them and will be linking to them, probably in the comment section. Here is another thread where OP has expressed that (\n\nFasting improves your immune system and significantly increases autophagy, which was my primary driver in deciding to fast - I am now 5 days into my current fast, going for 10.\n\nAfter hearing about a friend's friend (who has MS), and who regained lost vision on an eye after fasting for 7 days, I decided to do a longer fast myself. I personally have CMT1A which is a neurodegenerative disease caused by PMP22 protein aggregates in the peripheral parts of the body, that end up affecting the production of myelin. This whole fast is to personally see if fasting would act as a treatment for my CMT, as I have read and heard about the positive effects on other diseases such as MS and other auto-immune ones.\n\nI have additionally done keto (more or less) where I lost approximately 35lbs over the course of a year, and have never felt as good as I did after sticking to keto for a year. In my mind, everyone should do serious keto, at least once a year to additionally help improve your insulin sensitivity. As cliche as it sounds, keto made losing weight SIGNIFICANTLY easier than a normal calorie-restricted high-carb diet.\n\nSince I wanted to experience the effects of autophagy from long-term fasting, I figured I would put on 10-15lbs to support fasting for at least 10 days, so here I am, now 5 days into my fast. I had my last meal at 6pm on Jan 7th, at which point I weighed in at 181 lbs. I am currently at 167 lbs, although a lot of the weight lost has likely been water weight. I will be linking pictures of my weigh ins in the comment section, and probably expect to regain 7 lbs or so simply from retaining more water once I start eating again. I have, quite frankly, been surprised just by the rapid weight loss, although my initial weigh in was basically on a full stomach.\n\nThis thread is inteded as my personal diary and because I would love to inspire other people with neurodegenerative diseases to give it a try - if for nothing else, it cannot hurt. I have saved a bunch of medical studies I will start linking to below once my post has been approved.   i will be following this with interest.  i have cmt2, unknown variety, and have been going downhill fairly quickly.  if fasting does something good for you, i might give it a try ... Fellow 1A here, curious about the effects on cmt specifically with the keto. Anything to report? I have been intermittent fasting for the last 2 1/2 months for weight loss. It has no positive affects on a neurodegenerative disease (There is certainly no scientific evidence to back up that claim) other than possible negative affects of losing muscle. In fact my hands have weakened **a lot** since starting. Before I could open jars and bottles that I now have an extremely hard time opening and my shoulders are having pains they did not have before. So I have definitely lost some muscle in the process. While I plan to continue fasting it is not a miracle cure all. I would be extremely cautious withmaking those claims as I am extremely leary of them as over the past 20 years I have seen those claims made on a variety of \"miracle\" diets that I have tried and none of them have stood up under long term scrutiny. But, I do think fasting has it is positives especially with insulin levels which is why I continue with it. Anecdotally I think my CMT has gotten less bad. Whether it is more so a placebo effect, I am not sure of. I do eat lots of eggs because lecithin has been shown to improve myelination. Check out the study:\n\n ( Yeah it is tough trying something new while considering the placebo effect or if it is actually improvement. Either way if you feel better that is all that matters However, I am doing the fast for the benefits of fasting that could potentially improve CMT - improved stem cell regenerativeness and autophagy, reducing the misfolded proteins. I am in the process of posting links to studies you might be interested in reading. I do believe that my keto diet has helped my CMT, and please follow my replies to other people commenting as they will address how I optimize my diet for CMT, and which foods I think people with CMT should avoid. Not saying it is a miracle cure, at all. There is scientific studies that indicate the advantages of fasting for myelination. I will be posting them in the original thread. I promise. \n\nYou will lose strenght during fasting, and it is recommended that you workout during fasting to preserve muscle mass.  I have gone through lots of studies to see the reported effects on myelinaton from various initiatives. Will you lose strength from fasting, yes, but will you potentially improve your myelination from the increased stem cell regenerativeness and improved autophagy to help remove excess PMP22 buildup that makes it harder to add muscle in the first place, I believe so. I have heard the same claim made as well with the research I have done. However, I would be extremely skeptical of there being much of a positive impact done via fasting. I would hope that I am wrong but I would strongly caution against claiming it can reverse course on CMT without some strong evidence for it, of which we have none. It truly seems pointless to even make the claim without having experienced a dramatic turnaround in your life. Other than weight loss I would guess you have not seen a reversal in your CMT symptoms though you are still new to fasting. I think it is a weak claim to make with little evidence to back it up. I wish it were true and I will gladly report here if I am wrong but I would not expect much of a positive impact on CMT from fasting, especially in my experience where it has actually weakened me. If in 6 months things have changed dramatically I will report back on it, but I do not expect too. Please see the studies I have included in the original post. While the studies are interesting and hopeful, the problem is it worked in *mice*. And, of course, mice are not people. We need studies on people to see if it translates into people. I read **The obesity Code** by Dr. Jason Fung and one of his warnings is to be leary of studies that have only been done on mice. Sometimes things that work on mice have no effect on humans. He mentions that the only autophagy results scientists have ever been able to test so far are with mice and if they were done with humans they would have to fast for a very very long time to replicate the results mice got, so he cautions people not to get too excited about  autophagy  claims. Should you have any connections, I would be more than happy to do a 15 day fast and have the results medically documented. Also, calorie restriction, while obviously different from fasting has been shown to have good effects on longevity in a myriad of animals. The issue about replicating these studies in humans is it is so much harder since our lifespans are so much longer, and having people stay consistent for that long is hard. Everything I have read suggests minimal exercise during fasting. \n\nAnd working from a sample size of two (I have 1a, partner has MS), fasting definitely makes symptoms noticeably worse for both of us. \n\nIt seems you have taken very preliminary research and drawn some wild conclusions. I have no clue why you would do minimal exercise. Did you read all the studies? 1a's different from MS, MS obviously being auto-immune. I have only heard that fasting increased MS. Well, your post title says CMT/MS, so why would you include both if they are \"obviously different\"? MS because it is auto-immune, and the link between fasting and improved immune systems being even more well-documented. CMT because I have it and from all the studies I have read and everything I have read about the various benefits pf fasting, I cannot see why it would potentially make the disease worse. Out of curiosity, what is your experience with fasting? Increased fatigue, greater pain around areas with nerve damage, more prone to injury. Any benefits I saw were exactly the same as those I saw from simply cutting out \"bad\" food and/or when Ive lost weight. \n\nFor the partner with MS, his tremors become much, much worse. Coordination goes down the drain. Please consider consulting sources other than his. There are going to be significant downsides just to try an unscientific treatment suggested by a random stranger. Is this during the fast or after as well? My mood was better during my first fast, as was my sleep. My sleep's been better this time too, quite frankly been feeling less pain walking barefoot, too. Also, what duration were your fasts? Were they water fasts? Did you consume electrolytes during the fast? I have done both water only and water with electrolytes. Usually around 21 days. Problems were present from about 3 days, and would persist until about a week following. I am not surprised you would feel bad if you do not do any electrolytes. The fasting's done for the longer term benefit of creating the best conditions for remyelination for CMT due to autophagy, and for MS for the immune system benefits. I have done it with electrolytes. It did not make a different. \n\nAutophagy occurs regardless of fasting. It is the same as those people who talk about detox/clense ignoring that whole liver/kidney thing. \n\nI am curious what you think the immune system benefits are though. Eeeh... How much have you read about autophagy? It is significantly increased through fasting (due to no protein intake). \n\nNot on my computer currently, but I will dig up information on fasting and immune system when I am on my computer. Besides feeling cold, I have had no bad consequences from fasting, but for longer term benefits, I will happily live with that throughout the fast. Do not bother. I have google, and cannot seem to see anything beyond mice models, which other users have addressed. I have not yet had a chance to read all the studies you linked but I did just read the only study you linked in regards to the safety of fasting and \"minimized physical activity\" was an important part of their protocol. \n\nI am glad that this seems to be helping you but I think there is plenty of reason for caution and consideration before anyone else jumps into fasting or keto with the hope of improving their neurological condition.  Of the 768 charts that were examined for adverse events in this study, 16 reported neuropathy. No further details were given about this and it may not be relevant to CMT folks, but it could be; there is no way to know. \n\nWhether fasting could help, and which types of CMT it might help, and under what conditions, is an interesting topic to examine. However, I would like to suggest that people practice a \"do no harm\" approach with regards to their own bodies and at a minimum seek out a lot more information on safe fasting techniques before trying it. According to the study you linked, what you eat right before and after the fast are important, which I did not know and you did not mention. \n\nI intend to read all the studies you linked, but it will take some time. Although I have not yet had a chance to work my way through the linked studies, the titles indicate that they talk about improved clearance of misfolded PMP22, which is specific to CMT1A only. Type 2 indicates that you have damaged axons and since it is an unknown type the mechanism for that damage is not known. \n\nI cannot say that fasting absolutely will not help you, but I do not know that there is any evidence here that it might. I always wondered if CMT was why I have always been so skinny, but it is different for everyone I suppose. Cool idea though. I have been wanting to document the effects of mmj for those with CMT and prior painkiller prescriptions. Best of luck to you! Hope it helps! I implore everyone reading considering this to read the top comment. Fasting and keto most likely v will not do anything and leave you incredibly weak. I have seen it pedalled to desperate disabled people before and often does more harm than good. Consult your doctors, I doubt they will be on board. Update: I was feeling light headed today and increased both my water intake and doubled my electrolyte intake which made a significant impact. Feeling great now. I feel like I have the same mental clarity that I was positively experiencing during my first fast. I have not had the feeling of any additional clumsiness or any other negative impacts from fasting. A lot of what I have been hearing is exercise is best when intermittent fasting as that is when you can really burn off fat. That is when fasting athletes like to train, for example. I think it depends heavily on the length of fast and the exercise goal. Burning fat vs gaining/preserving muscle. Just out of curiosity, what did you drink for electrolytes? One thing I heard of doing was adding salt to water but I did not try it. grazing diet &gt; fasting The only thing that eating small meals will do is keep your insulin high and make you more likely to gain weight because your body will not ever release the necessary ketones for you to be able to use fat for fuel. Absolutely false. East small, low to no carb and sugar, every three hours. I lost 30 pounds effortlessly and my pre-diabetic blood sugar level dropped to normal. \n\nFasting = malnutrition and stress on your nervous system. Not good for neuromuscular disorders. Permanent dietary lifestyle change provides optimal benefit. You are not losing weight because of your meal frequency but because you are in ketosis by not eating carbs. \n\nHave you actually read any of the studies I linked to in the post? I am intrigued  - the theory/explanation described in one of the studies makes sense to me. (I quoted it below.) Personally I do more of a time-restricted eating method (14/10) or (16/8.) According to what I have heard from Satchin Panda out of the Salk Institute (I believe in a Rhonda Patrick podcast), as little as a 12 hour fast is beneficial. Personally I would seek the minimum effective dose. If you exercise, eat lowish carb and time restrict/intermittent fast, you will ramp up autophagy off and on. I personally do not exercise hard when I am fasting as I am more prone to injury so I wait until an hour after eating.\n\n\"In the C22 mouse model of overexpression of PMP22, resembling the CMT1A phenotype, aggregate formation is seen in affected nerves. This aggregation occurs together with a reduced proteasomal activity and association of the aggregates with autophagosomes (( Since autophagy and the proteasome can play compensatory roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis, autophagy seems to play a part in the pathomechanism of CMT1 neuropathic mouse models. With reduced proteasomal activity, basal autophagy on its own might not be enough to clear out all the aggregating mutant proteins, but induction of autophagy by external methods can aid in the degradation of toxic products.\" - \"Autophagy as an Emerging Common Pathomechanism in Inherited Peripheral Neuropathies\" -  ( You eat enough to give you energy until the next meal. Has nothing to do with ketosis. Fasting is a 1st world privilege, and unhealthy. Anyone can find content online to support their belief. The point of grazing is not to lose weight, that is a bonus. It is about optimal eating for health. and it is making you cranky Fasting is bad for you.  Eat small and frequently.  Reduce or eliminate wheat products. I am fasting today for a Wednesday surgery, and it is going to make me less productive. There is nothing healthy about it, and it messes up your metabolism. \n\nDiets rarely work in the long run. Weight usually comes back. Permanent lifestyle changes are most effective. Yet you are the one who has not shown me a single study claiming it is dangerous despite me finding the contrary, published on recognized sites. I do not have to. I have done both. You can find a study for anything and everything on today's internet. Did you research then come to a conclusion, or form a belief then look for research to back it up?\n\nI had to be familiar with a dozen medical specialties and interviewed 20 doctors when I worked as a writer/researcher for a university hospital. Abstaining from inflammation-causing carbs is the logical conclusion. Fasting when you have MS can lead to major relapsing, so I do not know why anyone would recommend that. &gt;Fasting is bad for you.  Eat small and frequently.  Reduce or eliminate wheat products. I am fasting today for a Wednesday surgery, and it is going to make me less productive. There is nothing healthy about it, and it messes up your metabolism.\n\nThere is actually a lot of research showing the opposite, fasting can be very good for you. What is interesting is that when it comes to fasting I have come across far less opposition to it in the medical community than when I have brought up diets, such as low carb diets I have done in the past. In fact, I was talking about it with my endocrinologist a few weeks ago and he actually had positive things to say about it, recommending 14 hours for a fast.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind with intermittent fasting, you are still eating a normal amount of calories in a day (or restricted depending on if you are trying to lose weight), just in a far more restricted span of time. I have to fast today. It is a draaaaag Shamans fasted so they could have visions. I had experiences like that. Once I was nestled, all snug in my bed, when visions of sugarplums danced in my head. Twas the night before Christmas, if i recall right Been fasting since 11:30 last night. I feel like a hundred bucks I have not completely finished working my way through these papers, but I want to get a preliminary report up while there is still a chance some people will see it. Overall, there is not much evidence that supports fasting to improve CMT given in the linked papers. All of this is relevant only to CMT1A as well, so if you have another type, be aware that it is not even really part of this discussion. \n\nTaking them one at a time: \n\n1) is fasting safe? This paper does not really address my safety concerns so much as provide some evidence that people in a particular medically supervised fasting program were more or less OK. They had a particular protocol that they followed and it is unclear how well it generalizes to fasting in general.\n\n2) for CMT caused by too much PMP22, autophagy (caused by extended fasting) can help remyelination: this is a review paper; the only relevant bit cites Madorsky 2009 which is the next paper so I will skip to that\n\n3) Mouse model with CMT1A improved grip strength through intermittent fasting AKA Madorsky 2009: This is a great paper on the TremblerJ mouse, a traditional mouse model for CMT. Very solid experimental work. Why are they using TremblerJ and not the newer C22 mouse model which has actual human PMP22 genes? They mention at the end that they \\*also\\* looked at the C22 mouse and did the same experiments on it but that data was inconclusive. So unfortunately, there is reason to believe that this might not generalize to humans. The end of their paper also mentioned the ascorbic acid trials which were, in 2009 at the writing of this paper, about to begin in humans. Unfortunately, ascorbic acid turned out to be an example of a treatment that worked for TremblerJ mice, but then went to human trials and completely failed to show any effect. \n\n4) Fasting induces neuronal autophagy (aka helps when excess PMP22 aggregates is an issue): This paper focuses specifically on the difficulties of getting past the blood/brain barrier to promote autophagy in the brain. The CNS (Central Nervous System aka brain) has very different mechanisms and challenges; this paper is really not relevant. \n\n5) \"intermittent fasting can upregulate autophagy in oligodendrocytes and increase myelination\": oligodendrocytes are the CNS equivalent to Schwann cells. They are distinctly different from Schwann cells and not really relevant to treating CMT. \n\n6)  Intermittent fasting is neuroprotective: Intermittent fasting protected the brain during a stroke. Not relevant. \n\n7) PMP22 aggregates could lead to toxicity if you do not encourage autophagy: basically yeah, PMP22 overproduction builds up in Schwann cells, many misfolded proteins cannot be properly cleared, so increasing the clearing process (autophagy) in Schwann cells seems likely to help. This is the basic premise behind this whole discussion. \n\n8) , intermittent fasting can slow the progression of neuronal dysfunction in a range of different diseases such as Alzheimer's: mostly CNS diseases, CMT is only mentioned briefly with a citation of the Madorsky 2009 paper above\n\n9) Unrelated to fasting specifically, but lecithin, which there is a lot of in eggs, can help myelination: Interesting idea; I skipped this for now and will look at it later. Mmm, eggs.\n\n10) autophagy helps with protein aggregation disease, which CMT1A is a type of: This paper is about a small in vitro experiment directly adding a drug (rapamycin) to model organism cells in a petri dish to increase autophagy; interesting implications but very early work, not at all related to fasting particularly. The basic principal that autophagy would help CMT if it could be selectively induced in the Schwann cells is mentioned in passing.\n\n11)  This article talks about fasting slowing neurodegeneration: Interesting (to me) overview of fasting, a topic I do not know nearly as much about as I do CMT. Discusses fasting impacts on CNS diseases but not PNS (peripheral nervous system) ones like CMT. \n\n12) Fasting mimicking diet improves remyelination: This is a paper about an experiment in a mouse model for MS, it is not relevant. \n\nThis barely scratches the surface of this topic, but I wanted to get this posted so that no one feels intimidated by the long list of articles purporting to show that fasting improves CMT. The topic of fasting is an interesting one, but these articles do not support it well. \n\nFasting can mean many things, and can include periods of abstaining from food for as little as 12 hours, which is something I do anyway simply because I prefer not to eat right before bedtime. There are considerations for proper hydration in any fast and electrolytes for fasts greater than 24 hours. If you wish to experiment upon yourself, it is your body and your right to do so but I would certainly want to learn more about fasting before trying it myself (not counting my \"I just do not eat late\" version). Even healthy people have legitimate concerns about muscle wasting when they fast. People with CMT may not always be able to regain lost muscle, so that is not something to take lightly. \n\nJust from the one review article I read on fasting it sounds like many of the positive effects may show up after rather short fasting periods and something like a \"fast for 20 hours a day, only eat during a 4 hour window\" might be worth looking into. I do not know enough about it to say, but if I were serious about trying this I would aim for something like that as a starting point rather than a multi-day fast. \n\nApologies if I have been unclear in anything. I am trying to translate these papers very briefly into non-scientific speak and it is late. Thanks for your review of all the different papers. It is significantly more constructive than anything else that is been commented on here. I do realize that most studies have not focused on fasting for humans with CMT, or more particularly CMT1A, and my desire to explore the topic did stem from the various things I read about fasting, non-CMT related, why I tried backing up my theories with the best studies I could find. \n\nI did end my own fast after slightly more than 6 days rather than a full 10 days. I was feeling nauseous and thought it was a better idea to be on the safe side. I do not regret my fast, and will likely do another one in a year's time - probably 5/6 days then, too. \n\nI did expect fatigue during the fast - after all, you are not consuming any calories at all, and I did not experience any negative consequences afterwards. My training regimen is quite significant and I do realize that muscle wasting is something people with CMT should be concerned about. What led me to try this out regardless was a study that showed the proportional muscle wastage from fasting was significantly smaller than it was from a traditional calorie restriction. \n\nOverall, my goal was to hopefully use autophagy to get rid of some of the PMP22 protein aggregates. No clue if that happened, and if it did, I would imagine potential benefits would take time to materialize through remyelination, and subsequent muscle building. \n\nI do, very much, appreciate your constructive comment, though. I would be interested to hear if you feel there are any long term effects, good or bad, once your body has adjusted.\n\nThere were some interesting comparisons between fasting and calorie restriction in the one review article I read. I plan to do more reading on that when I have time. If the body of research seems to support it after I look into it further, I might try something like only eating once a day for a while to see if there is any effect. I do not think I would try going more than 24 hours without eating some protein myself because of muscle wasting concerns. I worked hard for what little muscle I have! While most people have undoubtedly moved on, I have continued to do some reading of literature on fasting. There are no real conclusions because there is not enough research for conclusions. All we can do is try to ground wild speculation in some reasonable yet tentative hypotheses at the moment. \n\nFasting downregulates a major controller of cell function called mTOR. When mTOR gets turned down, cells recycle more--they break down proteins faster. So one might expect this to help clear out some of the excess PMP22 in CMT1A. \n\nHowever! CMT1A already shows some downregulation of mTOR (reason unknown but maybe the cell is already trying to break down that excess protein). Will fasting turn it down further? Will turning it down further have any effect? No idea! \n\nWhat else turns down mTOR? Ketogenic diets. The keto diet was originally developed in the 1920s for epileptics and refined over the decades with modern versions like the Atkins diet. I am not saying that a ketogenic diet would help CMT1A because again, wild speculation, barely enough to base a mouse study on tbh. But if anyone reading this is considering fasting, maybe consider the Atkins diet instead. It is like fasting but with steak. \n\nThere are a lot of weak points in this chain of speculation, but there is probably little harm to trying the Atkins diet. If this appeals to you maybe talk to your doctor and ask if they think it would be a healthy thing for you to try, regardless of its possible impact on your CMT. \n\nI also tried reading up on the lecithin paper. They only really showed results in the Trembler-J mouse (which in my personal opinion might be a better model of CMT1E than of CMT1A) and unfortunately there is just not much research that has been done on this yet. Still, if there is anything to this idea the recommendation would probably be to try to get more of your calories from fats than carbs, which points back to something like the Atkins diet from a totally different angle. In this case actually being in ketosis is unimportant, just increasing the percentage of your calories that come from fats might be healthy. Decreasing your carbs in this case is just to avoid increasing your calories overall, i.e. if you want to add bacon to every meal you will probably want to cut back on the bread or do not be surprised when your pants do not fit. \n\nThis is all the ragged edge of research and there is a reason no ones doctor is recommending these things. There are a lot of potential flaws in these theories and a lot more research is needed to be able to suggest any action on these ideas. I am summarizing what I have been able to get out of these papers here simply because I think everyone has a right to know what research is in the works. &gt;  Fasting when you have MS can lead to major relapsing,\n\nSo much this. I see way too many people in the clinic who swear by some dietary treatment instead of medical intervention who are back in the clinic due to severe relapses, where those who are treated remain relatively stable. Thank you. I know from unfortunate experience what going without food can do to you. I am not trying to be a troll here.

If you are looking for stairlifts\u2014start looking now on places like craigslist and Facebook marketplace.  It is a sad circumstance but I have seen numerous occasions of stairlifts put up for sale after the elderly user has died and the surviving family is looking to get rid of it.  I have seen them literally for free if you remove it.\n\nEdit: I just looked on my local marketplace\u2014$350 for an 18\u2019 max stair lift and it is already taken down. WOW! Thank you. Yes, I am considering a stair lift. It may not be an option in the future if my arms and hands go the way of my feet and legs. But, if I could find a stair lift, especially in THAT price range, $0000.00, that would be wonderful.\n\nI am considering ANYTHING. I want to hear from everyone. Everything they thought of, tried, rejected, why they rejected it.\n\nAny kind of ad hock, thrown-together, garage/basement Jerry-rigged apparatus. Whether they grew wings, used some kind of impromptu hoist.

What have you done? Tried? Invented? ... I use a stairlift which I bought and had installed by a local store that specializes in stairlifts and ramps. That was a total of about $3000 but it can be more for things like curves. A large part of the cost was installation.\n\nI assume that you can get one much cheaper if you buy it used and do your own installation.\n\nIt really helps. I am in a wheelchair most of the time, but I can get around upstairs with a walker due to the short distances.\n\nMy wife (very able-bodied) uses the stairlift to carry heavy things like clothes, vacuum cleaner, etc. I have had 1 company, Bruno, come out and they gave me a quote of $3,500. That is for 13 steps. There is landing at top. To the right of the landing is 2 steps that lead into a loft overlooking the small family room. \n\nTo the left is 2 steps that lead into the bedroom side of the upstairs. And, directly ahead in the landing is a the backside of a wall that goes to the bedroom.\n\nEven if i get up the 13 steps, there are still another 2 steps i need to conquer. \n\nAdditionally, if I end up losing the use of my arms and hands as well as my legs, i would need a chair that swivels. That is only an extra $1,500.\n\nIf I need to get anything big, furniture, rugs, whatever, up or down the stairs, I would have to call Bruno to come out remove the chair from the railing, then call them again to reattach the chair.

Same I think it is the weather I wish I knew. Another bed day. Smoke \u2018them if ya got \u2018them. It is literally the only this I know that helps me. Definitely weather. Double socks, gloves. Keep warm, and take Tylenol, or gabapentin, if you can. Distraction? Is there anything you like that takes a lot of attention like artwork or games? Try everything. I really like taking a bath with epson salts after a day when I am feeling sore.\n\nGood luck and tomorrow can be better. I thought it was just me - I HATE, absolutely HATE winters in the mid-atlantic states. Nothing but wet, cold, rain, gray, wind... Mentally, it just really gets to me. But add the physical pain, challenges, frustrations, aches, stumbles, falls, ... it all just throws me over the edge at times.\n\nI have found sticking my feet and lower legs in the bathtub with a nice stream of slightly warm running water helps.

My favorite comment. Sadly, I could not smoke because I am in the process of getting a new job. :( I hate taking my gabapentin. I have found it does not help me. This time of the year is always rough, stupid weather. The bath is my best friend lol. Thank you! I went grocery shopping at Walmart. Lol. I made myself get up and move. I will be taking a bath shortly when my toddler goes to sleep! Bath time for me soon! My favorite time lol. I have not had it in a while, but that stuff let me sleep without my twitches, and my legs or arms spasming. If that does not feel best to you and your situation, as your nuero or even your pcp to see if something else might work. Since CMT is not a uniform experience, shit can go one way or another. \n\nQuick edit: CBD oil, legal in OTC items, the balms are FUCKING AMAZING. Hypoallergenic, if that matters, and will not show on a drug screen. Yes, it does help me sleep. I just need to find something for when I am awake. :( The CBD or gabapentin? Gabapentin. Before I had my son, I was taking gabapentin 3x a day and cymbalta once a day. After I stopped breastfeeding, I got out back on gabapentin and I stopped taking it because I just did not notice any difference other than sleeping better. I get ya. Everything changes after having a kid. I do not take anything that makes me drowsy so I can hear mine. CBD oil or balms, heck, even extra layers help. Thermals are amazing at limiting bulk, too, just hard to get over AFOs. Blankets, and gloves, and heaters, the works (I am also anemic, so my hands do that cramp-into-a-fist-thing waaaay to often). My hands also cramp into fists.  Does low iron make that worse? I think so. Cannot keep warm, so my hands cramp faster and more often. I have started taking cbd oil. Been on it for a few months now and it definitely helps. Also have a cbd and thc massage oil which is AMAZING when you massage it into your feet/hands.

Having multiple illnesses can make it hard to predict what will ultimately happen, but it has been... a week? 10 days? since your last covid shot? I think there is an excellent chance that you will recover from this eventually. \n\nHowever, while I sympathize with the exhaustion and pain you find yourself dealing with, no doubt compounded by some surprise that it is happening at all as a result of a covid shot, I must ask you to consider that there are other folks here who cannot walk 5 minutes on a good day. \n\nWe have folks in this community who have \"only\" been impacted by CMT who are entirely unable to walk. Their lives are still meaningful and valuable. Being unable to walk long or well or at all does not make someone is life \"not living.\" I sincerely hope that you will find your way fully back to your previous vigor, but should you not, you can still have a fulfilling life, even if the shock and grief of losing ability may temporarily hide that fact from you.  Certainly it is reasonable to be sad about losing abilities that you used to have. I simply ask that, despite your legitimate distress, you consider what impact your words might have on others. Lashing out in a way that implies that others in this community might as well not bother living their lives can hurt others.  I never NEVER implied that what I said was directed to anyone other than MYSELF!\nI removed my post and said I would not bother you again. I deleted everything I could find I put in it. I hope that restores your thread the way you want it. I will unjoin. I am noticing a frustrating trend. I go see a new allied health person about a problem. I explain what has been done previously and why it did not work. The person will suggest trying it again, it is the most common solution and maybe they just need better trouble shooting. After some frustrated back and forth, they end up trying to same thing as before. \n\nShocking absolutely no one, it does not work for the reasons I identified at the start. They try one or two other things to trouble shoot the problem with the first idea. They fail. We are now 6-12 months down the line, a decent amount of $$ has been relieved from my account, and we give up as the first solution did not work, even with all the trouble shooting.   \n\n\nI need to be more assertive in those first appointments, and walk out if they will not budge.

Officially found out about my CMT status last year with a lot of the foot pain and two instances of muscle exhaustion to the point of almost no movement I got from work. Now I have a lot more control of things in my life, but due to some recent changes in work and injury of a family member, I have been having to up my daily load a lot. I likely will take tomorrow completely off as I am close to overloading now (even writing this is taking a lot of effort).\n\nI am 25, I take 50mg of CBD twice a day, keto for weight, energy, and for some of the research on neurodegeneration on keto, I am stretching a lot more, increased mineral and water intake, minimum NSAID intake, and occassionally I use a TENS unit or foot messager for immediate help. I am a little concerned about my caffeine uptake (max 200mg per day) and neuroinhibitors do more harm than good.\n\nCan anyone recommend other things to try that I may not know about? Specifically for help with the muscle exhaustion short term while I am taking care of my family member, but I will listen to anything. I can say that stretching helps me a lot to avoid exhaustion, sounds like you are already doing that. Out of curiosity, why is 200mg of caffeine worrying you? I am around this amount. \n\nAlso had great results with vitamin B12 and Niacin for general energy levels (not necessarily muscle exhaustion avoidance)  It sounds like you are doing an amazing job with using a variety of things to help you. Is it hemp CBD or marijuana CBD? \n\nRegarding the B12 comment from someone else, I will share that I use this: \n\nI am taking it primarily to supplement b12 I am not getting due to reduced meat consumption. It sometimes gives me more energy, sometimes not. Based on the experience of another redditor I am taking lions mane. They were combining this with increased niacin, and the bcomplex happens to have niacin.  Marijuana CBD, but significantly under the FDA limit of 4% THC (I buy Lazarus Naturals for their high potency cbd without much THC interference).\n\nI will have to look into b12 it seems, thanks for the link. Definitely looking into b12. \n\nAs for the caffeine, some of it is related to relying on it for energy, some is worrying about it is impact on me emotionally. Actually it looks like they are using hemp. \n\nCheck this out. Under the question \u2018what is your cbd made from?\u201d \n\n Ah, okay then. May I ask why the interest in difference? I can guarantee that there are trace amounts of THC in even this product (so it only matters if you take several doses) and it really should not set off most tests unless you use a wasteful amount of the stuff. Interested because I am curious about the difference and whether one is more effective than the other. My understanding is that cbd derived from marijuana is more effective. For a minute I thought you had found one that was from marijuana but still technically legal (in my state). Honestly all I want is pain relief. I do not want any mental affect / high. There really should not be any difference as CBD from either is structurally similar, the main difference would be presence of other cannanoids like in full spectrum oils. You may want to try full spectrum oil like CBDistillery's product which I have tried, but it ridiculously potent (a bit pricey) and I recommend not more than 20mg doses (measuring by the CBD, I do not remember the CBD per ml). It does have close to the 4% maximum THC byproduct as allowed by the FDA, so be careful about that. Entourage effect is something I am still up in the air about as someone who has tried a lot of products, read the studies, and worked in the medicinal marijuana industry for a few years.\nCBD does have evidence supporting neurodegeneration, so that alone is worth it, but short term effects have been especially beneficial for anxiety, stress, pain, and relaxation. Well, a lot of what I have been doing is watching how much weight I carry with me and making sure I take some time each day to relax. It is generally recommended to not do a lot of high-stress activity on your joints and muscles that could wear you out faster. For me, I cycle on a non-mobile bike, stretch, and go for walks at least once a week. \n\nOther than that, I would consider consulting a physical therapist and/or occupational therapist for specifics to what you are going through, as I am rated pretty high in severity. \n\nCheers :) ", "Anyone else with CMT have issues with squat depth? Really looking to be able to hit a parallel squat ( video of current depth )  Was diagnosed with CMT at around the age of 4. I am now 19 and my CMT seems to have stabilised.

This is a set from a 3 x 10 @ 60kg. I am getting quite close to parallel, but still not close enough. Any tips?", "What field if study for CMT Hey everyone. I am wondering if someone were to begin a field of study with curing CMT as the end goal, what would be the field? CMT is a neurological disease, but I am not sure if that necessarily means a neurologist would be the person to cure it. Perhaps a biologist/geneticist would be able to actually cure the disease (And ones just like it) at the cellular level.\n\nJust figured I would see what people have to say on the matter. Thanks! Definitely not neurology. It would be a genetic field. \n\n If you are just starting undergrad general Biology would be a fine place to start. Depending on your university, you could look at something like Cell &amp; Molecular Biology or Genetics. If your institution offers Neuroscience it would also be fine. Ideally, you would want to take at least one class in all these things. In the USA at least you have some leeway in picking your exact classes and you would want to get a foundation in basic neuroscience, genetics, and cellular biology. \n\nPersonally, I have a degree in Cell &amp; Molecular Biology. I did not get it to work on CMT, more I developed an interest in it because I taught myself to read and understand all the scientific papers on CMT. As I said in the essay that got me into grad school, I would be too emotional about working on my own disease; I would rather work to cure someone else's disease and hope someone else would work on mine. That is not to say other people cannot work on their own disease--if I recall correctly Dr. Shy has CMT and has done amazing work to advance our understanding of CMT for decades. So then cell and molecular biology would be the field to get in to? From your own perspective would you agree with this or do you think there is a better field? I was thinking this would be best, seeing as how curing things like CMT would happened and the cell/DNA level. I just want to make sure so I set sail in the correct direction. I completed my undergrad in Genetics and Biochemistry and then was in a lab with grad and post-doc students in Molecular Genetics. \n\nIn my opinion, Grad school is where you will get to work on more specific diseases/projects and then you can decide if you want to do publications through the University or work for a company. \n\nUndergrad is going to just give you the foundation and fundamentals of science no matter what the major (biology, genetics, biochemistry, cell and molecular bio). A lot of the classes in these majors intertwine up until Junior and Senior year where they get more specific. \n\nAlso, many colleges have these majors in the same department, so you can go talk to the academic advisor on campus and they can point you in the right direction and show you the specific class differences for each major. They will show you the course catalog. Well I am going to have to finish my undergraduate in psychology regardless. My plan is to knock out the biology/chemistry prerequisites for graduate programs on the side during my junior and senior year. I will be ahead enough. I am kind of a different case because I am military and these grad programs are through the Army. Cell and Molecular Biology would be a great foundation. \n\nIf your university of choice offers Cell &amp; Molec take that and and you can disregard the rest of this paragraph: There are a number of closely related degrees in Biology, many of which could be made to serve just fine by choosing the right electives. So if a given university does not offer a degree with the exact title of Cell &amp; Molecular Biology you can still learn what you need by making sure you get in a genetics class or two, some cell &amp; molecular stuff, lots of organic chemistry, ect. Pro tip: you can often get a syllabus from a school which offers, in this case, Cell &amp; Molecular Biology and make sure you take similar classes.  \n\nIf you want to do research try to get involved in research as an undergrad if at all possible. This may just be a semester of washing beakers but it is still good experience and will look great on an application to grad school. This is from the CMTA website. I would maybe try contacting some of these people and asking for advice. \" Kleopas Kleopa, MD, at the Cyprus Institute of Neurology &amp; Genetics, Scott Harper, PhD, at the Ohio State University School of Medicine, and Steven Gray, PhD, at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, all of whom have already initiated projects devoted to gene therapies for CMT.

He is also extending his efforts to develop novel therapies for CMT1A. Dr. Harper has worked extensively in muscular dystrophy and is collaborating with Robert Burgess, PhD, at the Jackson Laboratory to develop a gene therapy treatment for CMT2D.

She is waiting on a genetic specialist to explore this option. Is the only way to find out if one has CMT genetic testing? Only one foot seems to be effected as of right now. Prior to the discovery by new orthopedic specialist she wore AFOs but did not seem to help and hurt too much. While we wait for testing, how can I support her best? Is there anything I can do to relieve pain or make things easier? And yes I have asked her as well but want to make her situation as easy as it can be for her.\n\nAlso, are there any common comorbidities with this condition? Be there for her, support her.  Encourage her.  Understanding some days will be hard some days will be awesome.  We can still do cool things and have fun. \"CMT\" like most medical designations is a description of symptoms, not a cause. It is a wide umbrella term with many genetically quite different causes with quite different symptoms put under it.\n\nGenetic testing can offer you a definitive diagnosis and tell you which type (genetic cause) it is, which is highly useful. Only a few types such as 1A have easy genetic tests though.\n\nPersonally I am presumptive CMT unknown type, since the few tests for specific types were negative for whatever runs in my family history. My sister is not even diagnosed with CMT since her symptoms are too mild to qualify, though good chance they will worsen in her 60s like my mom.\n\nIf your daughter is getting diagnosed at 9 I am guessing her symptoms are more significant. I had signs like hip dysplasia but very little neuropathy so I was never properly diagnosed until after my mom developed neuropathy. Why are airforce one shoes so bad? AFO is a common acronym in this sub. It refers to Ankle Foot Orthotics. There are a few different designs but the idea is that it holds your ankle stable, usually at a fixed 90 degree angle, when your ankle muscles are too weak to do it themselves. There are other ways to get a diagnosis of CMT, as u/bkgn mentioned. A neurologist can run an array of tests, from simple like testing reflexes to more complicated like testing how fast the nerves conduct electricity (some people find that one painful). \n\nGenetic testing is considered the most definitive--for the types that have genetic tests. Most people with CMT have one of the types that genetic testing can detect, but there are certainly a few people who do not. \n\nAFOs can be very personal to the individual and their situation, changing significantly over time. Just from what you have said, it is possible that hers did not fit well or were of the wrong type to help her, but that is just a guess. AFOs treat the symptom, so a good orthopedist should be able to fit AFOs without knowing the underlying cause of the condition. \n\nCMT is a slowly progressive disorder of the peripheral nerves. It very rarely has any other impact beyond the increasing muscle weakness, and sometimes associated pain. If you find out a particular genetic type, there may be more specific information. I think the best way to make things easier for her is to connect her with other kids with CMT. Look for groups in your area. Check out HNF and the CMTA. Comorbidities are essential tremor. Just connecting with other patients, I would say we see a lot of EDS but that is merely an anecdotal observation. I actually have cl-EDS! I will check out groups. Good idea! Thank you. Where can i get one? Typically a doctor will send you to an orthopedic specialist if you need them.", "I have feared ALS for over 4 years (I am 21, M) but wondering if it could be CMT My symptoms include muscle atrophy / mild weakness in my lower leg muscles (I think it is the fibularis brevis? Lower, inside of leg, from ankle to just under knee) as well as thumb atrophy, shoulder atrophy, forearm atrophy, and most recently, lower back atrophy. All of this is accompanied with constant twitches, as well as awkwardness when walking, ect. This is all asymmetrical, but seems to be starting to affect the opposite limbs within just the last month.

I have had 2 clean EMGs years apart and I am desperate to just find some type of non-fatal answer to my progressive and scary symptoms!! Any responses would be so appreciated! Thank you Sounds like it could be a match. The asymmetrical part resonates with me well. Worth investigating at the very least. It is possible. Usually feet (high arches or sometimes flat feet) and lower legs (classically thin/week ankles) show the impact first but it is not set in stone. Plenty of people have equal trouble with their hands/arms. It should be reasonable to get tested. You have had two EMG\u2019s, so what has the doctor said based on that? \n\nAlso I would think that either CMT or ALS would have reduced strength/speed of signals, but you said yours were both clean? I did not develop symptoms until my early 20\u2019s, but even in childhood I had low reactions to electrical signals and no knee reflexes. I am meeting with my neurologist in may for a follow up to my September EMG (I should have gotten in sooner but he moved to an independent practice so I had to accommodate for that) \n\nHe is seen and acknowledged my symptoms but we never talked about the clean EMG and what that could mean. I know CMT is nothing to wish for, but I think it is obvious it would be a miracle diagnosis in comparison to ALS It is honestly hard to say because CMT symptoms overlap with other neuromuscular disorders. I am surprised after two tests they are not sure yet. I have had a few neurologists say \u201cif you are going to get a neurological problem, this is the one you want.\u201d It is actually annoying to hear that but I do get it. I lost a friend to Duschennes muscular dystrophy 20 years ago and it was hard to see him fade over a 5 year period. \nGood luck! Hope they find some answers for you soon! CMT is generally more symmetrical and does not generally involve the shoulders and back as you describe. Cmt progresses distally. So your toes go first and it gradually creeps up. For the majority of us(cases vary) this progression fades as it gets to knees. Same with hands - fingers first. There are severe cases but most of these begin in childhood. Another diagnosis that some people get mistaken for with CMT is Friedrich\u2019s Ataxia so maybe that is something to look into? CMT is generally slowly progressing. Mine has very gradually progressed over a 4 year period so it is definitely been slow. But idk, it is like none of my symptoms 100% match anything. My clinical exams have not shown any babinski sign ect, so I feel slightly confident it is not a serious deadly ALS-type condition. But that is grasping at straws perhaps. Just trying to find a glimmer of hope somewhere ya feel? During my first four years of symptoms the only thing I noticed was that the bottoms of my feet started to hurt and it got harder to stand on my tiptoes. This is the level of slow. Of course everyone is different but very slow is common. Great... welp now I am scared as hell again. But thanks for your help I am sorry. I hope you get an answer soon that is not ALS. I am glad I saw this post... I have a confirmed CMT 1A diagnosis by DNA, my Dad has it as well. I am 30 years old. \n\nI have all the typical 1A symptoms (mild leg weakness, poor balance, hard time recovering from weight lifting, weakness in hands, poor coordination). \n\nHowever, in Nov of 2016 I had a sudden onset of new symptoms which I do not think are CMT, but which match yours. I started having muscle twitching all over, every single day, it gets way worse if I drink alcohol or get dehydrated but it never goes away. My left ear started ringing and has not stopped. My left side of my body started getting significantly weaker, including shoulder, arms, and legs. I have had 3 brain and spine MRIs, I have a very slight bulging disc in my cervical spine but otherwise these are clean. My EMGs were clean except for in my shoulder, there was spontaneous activity on the nerve in my left shoulder. \n\nIf you can afford it, you can push your neurologist for a CMT DNA test. Either way, I would be really curious to hear what your diagnosis is if you ever get one. I have been through so many appointments and doctors and nobody knows what is going on. I am also scared of ALS or MS. Sorry to hear you are going through this, but you are not alone!! \n\nOur multiple clean EMGs should give us peace it is not ALS. But easier said than done when the symptoms continue to be so scary. \n\nKeep me posted with what is going on, and feel free to send me a PM if needed!", "Losing weight and CMT I am looking for advise on how to lose about 50-60 lbs. I eat fairly well but due to my inactivity my weight stays the same. I am a little reluctant to start jogging but if you have guys have had luck with it and without destroying your ankles, I will give it a go. Thanks in advance You could try biking, if your balance is really poor they make recumbents that are easy to ride. Happily, however, losing weight does not have as much to do with activity as it does diet, so you can certainly lose the weight by decreasing the amount you eat. Losing weight will definitely help with all aspects of CMT, so I highly support your goal! I second biking. It has done wonders for overall strength. It also does not lead to fatigue as fast as running, plus you do not have to worry about tripping.  I used to go for a ride every day on my lunch break, no excuses. Now, it is more like 3-5 times per week. Regardless, the extra exercise will help you. Just make sure not to overexert yourself at first. Good luck!! I use a stationary bike and a no impact running machine at my local gym. This one: \n\nI agree with the tylermw8 that diet will impact your weight a lot more than exercise. Avoid fad diets and calorie counting, which are difficult to maintain and from which many people rebound and gain more weight. Look up intuitive eating / mindful eating. You will learn to listen to your body needs and that will help you to not over eat.  Calorie counting works 100% of the time if you can manage to stick to the numbers (assuming tge numbers are calculated correctly). One important aspect of loosing weight is that whenever the body undergoes a net calorie deficiency, there will be a reduction in both the fat percentage and the muscle percentage. It is desirable to try and limit the loss of muscle when in a calorie deficiency. One important factor in that regard is maintaining a degiciency that is not too large. A very large calorie deficiency will have a disproportionately large affect on the loss of muscle mass. So slow and steady is key. Secondly is combining the calorie deficiency with moderate resistance excersize. Cardio should be avoided during a calorie deficience. I personally have been doing yoga. Its awesome, and easy on my frakenfeet. Some of the poses suck, but do the best you can. Slow walks with focusing on walking correctly (if you have cmt, you know what i mean)  Yep! I have been trying to really pay attention to walking correctly. Doing that throughout the day is great exercise!  I have been doing 20 hour intermittent fasting twice a week. Really affective. A 6 months I was 235 lbs, today I am 190 lbs. I ride mountain bike around 10 hours a week for cardio and try to just be mindful of what I put in my body. A simple question of \"is this helpful or hurtful?\" has brought my overall health miles. This week I committed to doing some calisthenics every other day as well because now that I have lost the weight I wanted to, I have realized how incredibly weak I am. I have been giving in to my weak muscles for years. Lots of work to do but feeling very hopeful. This disease is crazy. (28yo male) Another good exercise is kayaking if you have the means, sometimes hand grip goes out with cmt but there is not much involved below the waist. I walk for 45 min a day and that helps me, but the type I have is less destructive overall, so not everyone might agree. You do not need to exercise to lose weight. But, you do need to exercise to be healthy AND to manage CMT. To this end, you should lift weights and do cardio. If you cannot run for cardio, rowing is awesome. This will help a little bit with weight loss, but you will also need to count calories.\n\nLifting while losing weight is especially important for people with CMT becuase weight loss without resistance training will result in some muscle loss even in perfectly normal people. We really cannot afford any of that.", "How rare is CMT2D? I went to camp footprint last year (the camp powered by the CMTA) and met nobody with my type. Do any of you all have 2D? CMT2D is very rare. According to ( the prevalence is less than 1/1000000. CMT1A, the most common type of CMT, has a prevalence of about 1/2500. A quick search through all the posts posted on /r/cmt did not come up with any posts by other reddit users who have CMT2D, so I think it is fair to say that you are the first! \nThe clinical picture of CMT2D shares many similarities with other CMT types, so although your exact type is very rare I am sure other CMT-ers can relate to many of your symptoms and vice versa. The most prominent unique characteristics of 2D as far as I understand it is that the muscle atrophy is more severe in the hands than in the feet (which is unusual!), and that the prevalence of sensory impairment and motor involvement seems to be about the same.\n\nI think ( could also be of interest to you. I never thought I would see anyone with CMT2D on /r/cmt but here we are. :) So who knows, maybe another person with 2D will also find their way to this subreddit in the future. This is epic. Thank you for the info and that study seems really cool! I am sure it is more rare than my subtype because I do not recall hearing of it before. Mine is CMT 2A2, and that is considered very rare too. &gt;Mine is CMT 2A2, and that is considered very rare too.\n\nIt certainly is, ( lists the prevalence for 2A2 as \"unknown\". Have you ever met anyone else with 2A2?\n\nI have added a flair for 2A2 btw since I noticed it was missing from the list of flairs. I have type 2A! Not sure about after that, but possibly 2A1 if I remember correctly You probably know my sister! We have CMT2A Yes, my family members, an aunt, cousins, etc. But, when I had the genetic test they could not say it was CMT with absolute certanty because so few people have tested for this variation. (W Well, 2 is a good start... ha ha &gt;CMT2D \n\nGiven that the labeling of CMT types is somewhat pointless given that you can have type 1A and have symptoms that are usually only found in type 2B, I would not be too focused on finding people with your type of CMT, but instead look for people who have similar symptoms. Their genes may say one thing, but the way CMT manifests itself may say something else altogether! I cannot WAIT for my genetic testing. We know I have CMT2; but no subtype yet. Do you find knowing the subtype is helpful? Not really. I did not change anything about the way I am managing my cmt which is the important part", "New research: Squalenoyl siRNA PMP22 nanoparticles To me this looks really promising. I do not know how normal it is that researchers find something that works on mice, but where the effect is not that great on humans. Still very exciting to see that progress is being made in the field and I will keep following more articles on this. Has anyone else seen this or have any thoughts? I am sorry if this is old news, I am new to trying to understand medical journal articles and am trying to catch up. \n\n I think this looks very promising, but they still have some hurdles to overcome. For instance, the delivery vehicle will be crucial and while they have a promising candidate it is not guaranteed that it will work for delivery to Schwann cells. \n\nMy guess is that this will be a strong candidate for an effective approach to treatment but that it is going to be at least 5 years before it could be available, assuming everything goes right (and also that someone will be along shortly to say I am overly optimistic on my timeframe). Thank you for sharing! I have very little technical background so I hesitate to remark on this but I am hoping others will chime in. \\&gt;  I do not know how normal it is that researchers find something that works on mice, but where the effect is not that great on humans.   \n\n\nI tried to look this up, and found the helpful \" ( \" When an article is published in Nature you know it is going to be good one, and this is no exception. While RNA interference holds tremendous promise, not just for CMT but for a wide array of different diseases including cancer, delivery to target cells has been one of the major obstacles to overcome. For the non-spinal forms of CMT (the majority), what is really needed is systemic delivery (to reach all affected nerves throughout the body) with as specific cell targeting as possible (to avoid side effects). In the case of CMT 1A you ideally want to deliver the therapeutic agent to Schwann cells only, and have the rest of the therapeutic cleared out of your body without it entering any other cell types. Viral vectors have proven unsuitable for this task for a variety of reasons, however in the past couple of years lipid-based nanoparticles have been demonstrated to be a viable solution to this problem. There is currently one RNAi drug that is FDA approved called \"Onpattro\" (Patisiran), which is administered systemically and where delivery is facilitated by lipid-based nanoparticles. The principle have already been proven to be effective and safe, so that it would be applied towards CMT was only a matter of time. To be clear though, this is not old news, this is cutting edge science using the newest and hottest tools available right now. It is pretty amazing how quickly advancements in other areas translates into CMT research. I have been following CMT research for over a decade and I can hardly keep up any more because the output is so high. Although as a person with CMT, things seems to be moving slow as molasses. What is currently happening now in CMT research is that there are a great many different therapeutic and strategic development being researched in parallel. Many of these will not advance past animal models and/or preclinical/phase 1, but I also think that many of them will. Unless Pharnext get their act together with their Phase III for PXT3003, there are no short or medium term solutions to 1A. However, in 6 years to a decade from now it is likely that there will be multiple viable therapeutics. All of these including siRNA are likely to be expensive though and will more than likely require repetitive treatments. According to ( study, *\"In 2004, the FDA estimated that 92 percent of drugs that pass preclinical tests, including \u201cpivotal\u201d animal tests, fail to proceed to the market. More recent analysis suggests that, despite efforts to improve the predictability of animal testing, the failure rate has actually increased and is now closer to 96 percent.\"*\n\nThat said, an approach similar to what is used in this study have been proven to work in humans and is FDA approved. As far as I know there is not much about CMT 1A that could cause siRNA theraphy to not work adequately in humans. Modifier genes could potentially have an impact, and the delivery mechanism they use could potentially have side effects in humans, but other than that I see no reason why it should not work. I suppose they tried it on a rodent CMT model first because it is par for the course, and because the safety do need to be demonstrated in an animal first since the delivery mechanism they used is not identical to the FDA approved one despite being similar.", "Cheers to Star Trek for featuring a character with a disability! ", "Does anyone have any funny CMT stories to share?  There was this one time I was watching the Country Music Channel... Hahaha Nice one :) In middle school a friend of mine handed me his pen at lunch, said it was broken, and asked if I could fix it. I clicked it a couple times, looked at the writing end, but yup, that pen was broken, the nib would not come out. I had not idea how to fix it, so I handed it back to him and he had the weirdest look on his face, a mix of shock and confusion and awe.\n\nIt was a shock pen. It did not have a nib, just delivered a mild electric shock when you clicked it. I did not feel anything. \nApparently CMT1a comes with mild immunity to electrical shocks (minor superpower!).\n\nMy friend used the same trick to get a bunch more kids to shock themselves with the pen, until rumor got out that someone had a shock pen. Then no one would take a pen from him...until I showed up, said \"No, that is not the shock pen. If that was the shock pen, could I do this?\", and clicked the pen in front of them. \n\nWe got my French teacher to shock herself with that one. She chucked the pen clear across the room. It was beautiful. When me and my cousins were hanging out at their house, we were 5 or 6 at the time, we were horsing around and my middle cousin took a running start at me. He tripped and went head first into my legs-which unknown to him-were encased in my new, very hard, very sturdy, afos. The bewildered looked and terror made me feel bad only a second until he got up and tried again. He was a hard headed child. No pun intended. When I was at university I had classes with a lot of Pre-Med folks. One day three of my fellow students came into class talking about how they had just had an anatomy class where they had learned how to take someone is reflexes (the thing where you hit someone is knee with a hammer and their leg jumps). They were really excited about this 100% foolproof (their word) skill they had just mastered. \n\nSo I asked them to show me. \n\nThey were really perplexed by their failure. Not a twitch. The look on their faces was hilarious.\n\nI look fairly normal (especially if you do not know what to look for) but as a result of my CMT I have total areflexia--no one can possibly provoke a reflex from me. \n\nI think it is mostly funny to see someone else stymied by my disease for once instead of me. I remember when my mom came home from the doctor and said she was diagnosed with Shark tooth disease. I was like WTF is Shark tooth disease? I dislocated my knee in my high school marching band and my dad had to help me off the field as I popped it back into place. Was not funny then but is a great story now. Went to an amusement park with a then-boyfriend and his friend. It had just rained and we were tramping around the pavement. Every time I would step my feet would slap down, and I was hitting puddles left and right and accidentally splashing the friend. He was laughing about it at first cause he thought I was doing it on purpose, and then when I did not stop he got annoyed, and finally he got snarky with me and was like \"Do you have a problem or something?!\" and my boyfriend got angry yelled \"yeah man, she does\" and I just laughed and slapped my foot into another puddle and got his pants legs wet.\n\nThe friend was *very* apologetic for the rest of the trip. whenever my dad or i trip over something (usually our own feet or a slight raise in the side walk) we yell \u201chave that removed!\u201d he started it when i was a kid. might not be funny but i find it comforting that we can say it together and laugh at ourselves.", "How do you guys respond when you get asked if you are limping/have a bum leg/etc. ? Particularly when it is by strangers or new friends/acquaintances. I get this often (I guess I limp/awkward gait) and am still trying to figure out an appropriate response.  I always take it as an opportunity to educate someone about the disorder, explain how it affects my day to day life. Back when I wore splints, I would also take it as an opportunity to show off the galaxy-print AFO's I had at the time. It depends on who I am talking to but it is still awkward. I had someone from work comment on it and told me it looks like I am having trouble with my shoes. She tried suggesting inserts from like Walgreens. I was caught off guard because I would never spoken to her before and thought it was rude. I just said it is my feet not the shoes. And it would take more than inserts from Walgreens. Sometimes I do explain the cmt and the surgeries.  I like to come up with absurd answers like \"Batman took my training up a notch\" You do not wear splints anymore? What happened? My brother is a teacher in Vietnam (We are anglo Aussie) at an international school. When the kids ask about his walking he just says he was attacked by a crocodile.  I just say I have got a disability or problem with lifting my feet. If they are curious and ask more I will go in depth. Otherwise that is usually enough.  Had double surgeries on my right leg in 2010. I will need them again in about 8-10 years / whenever the left foot starts to curve more than I can handle. I still walk with an off gait though, because my feet are essentially different sizes/shapes from each other. It is just a lot less painful than it used to be. Oh right. Interesting. I have worn splits since I had surgery. I have CMT Type 2. But I cannot lift my feet on their own at all, so I need splints to walk anywhere that is not around the house.  Ah, yeah. I have not had foot drop yet. My dad and brother do, but for some reason it has not set in for myself yet. Just hammer-toes, high arches, and inward-curves due to different muscle groups atrophying. I am not sure what type I am, need to get genetic testing. I was diagnosed in the early 90's; have not really looked into it. Ah ok. Well they should be able to tell you Type 1 or Type 2 or Type x (I think it is called that) by a consultation with a few tests I believe. \n\nBut each of those types then break down into different ones. My brother and I had genetic testing but we do not have any of the known genes for Type 2 so they are still researching for new ones.  Interesting. Thank you for the info. I have been meaning to get a hold of the neurologist here on Vancouver Island. Sounds like I should get off my lazy butt and do so, especially if it is that easy. Well there just happens to be someone researching CMT at a hospital here in Sydney, and we were part of his research. So to be fair I am not sure how easy it is to get that tested by just any place. :/ Just a heads up, there are also CMT Type 3, 4, 5 and 6 as well as CMTDI (dominant intermediate type) and CMTRI (recessive intermediate type). And it is likely that even more types will be discovered in the future.  Educate Depends on the situation... In a professional enviroment I will explain the disorder. If it is a random person or a new friend, I tell them it is my god given pimp walk. I have a very mild issue and generally respond with \"I have bad ankles\" and call it a day.\n\nMost people do not inquire beyond that. It definitely depends on who is asking.

To me it is more a chance to reach out and educate than anything else. For instance, I might post on FB some CMT facts or something. \n\nI think your best bet is to just bring it up and ask how he feels about it and if he would like you to do anything.

I think sometimes there is a fine line between showing an interest in it and making the person feel like they are a study project. For instance, when I have told people I have CMT, in the past I have had them immediately then ask if they can see me walk or will ask lots of well meaning but ultimately invasive questions. I am not suggesting you would, as you seem a compassionate person but what I am saying is sometimes it is nice to have someone acknowledge our condition but it is important that it does not feel like our condition defines us.

According to Dr. Solomon, the current ETA for FDA approval is 2023-2024. Im trying to get on phase 3 of the trial but everyone Im meant to contact wont message me back :( Just get your local doctor to compound it This drug is such bs. The only active part is the baclofen which they are just trying to repurpose as no one uses it to treat alcoholic syndrome anymore due to its side effects. Having a targeted gabab modulator would be far better to trial and bring to market. Is that possible? Are they allowed to do that? Can you elaborate? I am not a medical professional, so I only get my info from this trial online. Do you think this drug will be harmfull to CMT1A patients? The drug (baclofen) will not do any harm to people due to having  CMT 1A, but baclofen is a very strong drug with a lot of side effects. People with CMT will also suffer these side effects and I am dubious about the risk to reward ratio. \nADX71441 would be far better as it is a more targeted drug, therefore has far fewer side effects and would achieve the same result (or could even be better). Yes.  It is three different ingredients.  One is available OTC, two are scripted.  All three ingredients have a very proven safe track record. I have been on baclofen for a few years now. Granted, my pain management doctor says the dosage is barely a therapeutic dosage as I have experienced side effects. I have not been successful with many, most, of the drugs we have tried. Either I have negative reactions, they are ineffective, or the cost are prohibitive.\n\nI have been taking 10mg of baclofen 4 times per day, as well as other medications. I have looked up ADX71441. I understand it is similar to baclofen but with much less side effects. What I can not seem to find is information on trials or availability or how/if I could participate.\n\nTo be clear, I do NOT have CMT1A. I do have CMT2D AND 2 other genetic neurological diseases that emulate many of CMT symptoms. type 6 and Type 7 of motor/sensory distal .\n\nIs there somewhere I can find out more about ADX71441 as i would like to discuss it with my pain management MD at the next appointment in a few days. I would just try Google as the information is hard to find. However if you do not have 1A then the efficacy of a GABAB upregulator is questionable. This medication is to do with the excess pmp22 production which is not the case in some other CMT variants. Thanks. I googled ADX71441 for info, tried several search parameters ,and came up with nothing. I am on baclofen for pain, 40 mg/day, very low dosage due to problems with side effects. I am primarily interested in ADX71441 because it allegedly has fewer or less sever, side effects. For CMT type 2, a gaba B receptor regulator unfortunately will not be of any use as the mechanisms of action are much different. Gabab directly impacts pmp22 generation, preventing the extra protein from being produced, which in turn prevents demyelination and axonal damage. However, CMT can vary widely per person even when the type is defined so there is unlikely to be any harm in trying.", "good shoes for AFOs Hiya! My fiance needs new shoes. What shoes work for you with your AFOs? Right now he mainly needs gym shoes. Most sneakers are good except for Nike because they are so narrow in my experience. Clark, Rockport, and Hush Puppy all have flat soles and roomy toe box. Super comfy.  Be sure to remove the insoles from the shoes first. Keen have a wide toe box. I wear Reebok Nylon Classics. Lots of colors, wide enough to fit my AFO\u2019s, and they are always made so I do not have to worry about finding a new shoe. And I like the way they look. Wow, this is really helpful. Thank you! I recommend Sketchers. They are pretty comfy with a fairly bulk AFO, am still able to squeeze them on. those look super fly! they are not super narrow like most Reeboks? No, that particular shoe is wide in the toe, and a good width in the middle of the sole which is great because that is where a lot of shoes fail me, being too thin right in the middle.

I have CMT 1A and I have had the problem for many years and take propranolol for it, but have never gotten an explanation as to why it happens. I just found out about dysautonomia, which totally explains my symptoms. Would love to hear if anyone else with CMT has dysautonomia :) No. Since you have medicine, it sounds like you have seen a doctor about this. Did they have you wear a heart monitor? No Holter monitor, but I did get a heart ultrasound and everything looks fine. I am a doctor myself, so I just renew the prescription myself. I should probably go to my primary doctor for a check up though.. And thanks for the reply! I found a study about the increased prevalence of dysautonomia in CMT patients \n\nIts fairly new knowledge, as CMT1A has been believed to not affect the autonomous nervus system.  That is a very interesting link, and those are some pretty surprising results. But unfortunately only the abstract have been published. A major problem with CMT research in general is that researchers often group together many different CMT subtypes in one study, and that is unfortunately also the case in this one. This and other forms of clinical heterogeneity can be a real problem when we are looking for answers that relates to a specific CMT genotype such as 1A. In this particular case for instance, we can imagine that only respondents with CMT genotypes other than 1A reported autonomic symptoms. Without the data there is no way of knowing and we cannot deduce it from this abstract.\n\nThe topic of autonomic nervous system involvement in CMT1 is one that, as far as I am aware, have not really been systematically studied. The few studies that have been done suggests that there is an association between CMT and disturbances of one or more components of the autonomic nervous system, mainly impairment of sweating on the extremities, impairment of vascular control pathways and possibly cardiac involvement. \n\nCranial nerves are sometimes affected in 1A and papillary anomalies are mentioned, possibly due to involvement of parasympathetic fibers. As far as I know, only one study have been done on the vagus nerve in 1A but I cannot get access to it so I do not know what the authors found. \n\nHowever, if I remember correctly, Vagus is affected in some CMT 2 genotypes and because it interfaces with the parasympathetic control of the heart, lungs and digestive tract it could potentially affect any of those in people with CMT 2. If Vagus is affected in 1A, who knows that can of worms that could open up, though it is probably unlikely to be the case. Other CMT genotypes are known to affect the autonomic nervous system though. For instance, mutations in myelin protein zero (in this case CMT 2J and 1B) can cause severe autonomic nervous system involvement including some \"interesting\" cases of chronic coughing and one demonstrated case of anejaculation.\n\nNewer studies also suggests abnormalities in small somatic and autonomic fibers in 1A, and a couple of interesting case studies further suggests that there might be more to come in the future in this regard. I have always had a gut feeling (pun intended) that my CMT1A also affect my autonomic nervous system in various subtle ways, but because these symptoms are diffuse and because of the limited data in the literature it is impossible to be sure. What is becoming increasingly clear though is that out understanding of the complexity of the pathogenesis of CMT1A is still very limited. For instance recent research strongly suggests that there is a developmental aspect to this disease that cause permanent impairment in addition to the mechanisms underlying the progressive degeneration of myelinated (and also unmyelinated it turns out (!) fibers). It seems like there are disease-modifying genes associated with 1A also, and for CMT as a whole it is estimated that up to 75% of all causative genes still remain unknown. \n\nThere are some reports and one study on lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction including bladder spasm in CMT, but it is not possible to make any conclusions on type 1A from those. There are also some studies older than 1990 on autonomic nervous system involvement in \"peroneal muscular atrophy\" (CMT) but the methods they used back then to diagnose the patients makes it impossible to deduce what genotypes might have been involved in those studies.\n\nTo sum it up, the most important papers seems to be ( as well as (\n\nThere are also this ( this ( and ( Have the same thing, I have it semi controlled at this point if I do not over eat and take my medicine regularly(omeprazol 40mg delayed release).

Was so freaked out that I had a heart attack that I went to my primary doctor immediately and had an ekg...came back fine so they said it was not my heart(side note I am treated for high blood pressure). Last year when I started a new job it got really bad, everyday after I ate lunch even if it was a medium sized portion. That is when I saw my doctor and he prescribed me the omeprazol for what he considers Gerd, and does not think it is my heart but wanted me to a scope of my throat and stomach. Insurance was so bad at that job that I could not afford to get the scope done. So that brings us to now if I do not drink a lot of alcohol and watch what I eat then it is tolerable at this point but I will still have a bad one occasionally that really scares me.

I have had the \u2018gut feeling\u2019 as well, but the neurologists I have seen have not been able to confirm or deny.  You are very welcome. Perhaps making an account at the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network could be a good idea? Then you can partake in future questionaires about CMT which might have questions about autonomic nervous system involvement.\n\nI do get heart palpitations my self on the rare occasions where I get to eat truffles, but I do not think that has anything to do with CMT. :) Great advice, thanks! \nTruffles, as in the fungus, or the chocolaty kind?

Do you get heart palpitations when eating anything else?\n\nYeah, no problem there. My mother tried telling me I have an eating disorder and is really having anxiety everytime I eat. \nI have suspected it was vasovagal, so learning about dysautonomia is totally awesome. Good chance it is acid reflux,hence it only happens after large meals and why they gave you beta blockers. Take a load of antacids after eating and see how it goes.

I know I should get a second opinion but I wanted to hear from others experiences as well. I had surgery in high school. One similar to what was posted a couple weeks or so ago. It did help to straighten my feet but now 9-10 years later I do still have issues and  as you all know it is never going away. Last year my doctor (who I have gone to since first being diagnosed when I was a child and also who performed the surgery) has suggested another surgery. He said it seems my arches are collapsing. I am overweight and have been working on it. I do not necessarily mind another surgery but the muscle atrophy with being non weight baring for a couple months worries me and the general recovery as well. I thought about requesting physical therapy but I am unsure of how helpful that may be if ultimately another surgery is needed. I would definitely recommend seeing a physical therapist and asking about ways to be active while non weight bearing.  I did not see one after my first surgery when I was 10 and I put on a lot of weight, partially because I still did not understand anything about nutrition at 10.  After my second surgery at 21 I was recommended to a physical therapist because they literally changed the way I walked by connecting some muscles to different side of my ankle to keep it from turning.  The physical therapist I had was great, she wasnt able to get me to do a lot of balancing exercises normal people do.  But going to see her did help instill more confidence in my \"new\" ankle.\n\nThe physical therapist office also had cardio equipment you could use with your arms while sitting.  My local Planet fitness has one too.  \n\nI dont regret the last surgery nearly the way I do the first one.

Going to sound stupid but.. are those braces you ordered online?  No, the orthotist did both times. Why do you ask? Slightly jealous I guess.  My braces are just AFOs, no cool names.  C'est la vie All of my AFOs were custom built from casts and have been very durable.  Of course they need to be replaced every two or three years because of daily use.  The biggest reason I finally got them was because I could no longer find shoes that helped (or hid) foot drop and tripped often.\n\nMy local MDA clinic helped me find an orthotic with experience in CMT.

Women with CMT who have been pregnant, did you take anything for nausea? I will call my doctor on Monday, but curious what your thoughts are in the meantime. It is a very low dose (10mg) whereas a regular vitamin is 50mg. Considering the warning is for megadoses of 10x the recommended daily allowance I would not be worried  Some good information here:\n\n\n\nThe general consensus seems to be that &lt;100mg is safe for pregnant women. What complicates things is the CMT diagnosis. The mother having cmt is one factor to concider, but another is the child who might also have CMT. In such a scenario, there is a risk that pyridoxine could\u00a0interfer with the early development of CMT. With very high doses that would almost certainly be the case, with low doses nobody really knows because it have not been studied and in any case it would be difficult to quantify any such interference.\n\nI would reccommend you to ask the question on the CMTa \"as the experts\" page as an extra source of input.

I find that very little alcohol hits me really hard, could it be due to the lesser body mass? I am the same way but so are my siblings that do not have CMT. We have always thought we have some weird alcohol allergy. \n\nI definitely think body mass has something to do with it. CMT makes it nearly impossible to gain weight and all drugs, not just alcohol, have a pretty strong effect on me. I have found my hangovers to have increasing physical effects as time goes on. Even after ~3 drinks I will wake up the next morning and will have pain in my hands and ankles. Yes I can only have one or two drinks without feeling completely hammered. I have CMT1A and do not lack body mass..I believe it is just from CMT I am exactly the same way. I am worthless after just one drink... Never noticed the amount hitting me hard. The effects the next day and while sleeping is why I stopped drinking. Cramps and dealing with scraped up arms and legs. I was a bit of an alcoholic though, so I am not sure if I ever would have noticed. The leg cramps are times one billion worse. Though, take a pickle back shot in between. Boom. No more leg cramps. It sucks because I am viewed as a lightweight, but it does not bother me too much. Thank God I do not feel this way after eating chocolate or something else. If I had to be cautious around something, I am glad that it is alcohol.

Thanks so much for the tip! I can deal with a bowl, maybe 2 max. A blunt or so. It does ease my neuro shocks and most of my pain, but if I over indulge, I end up unable to move and/or have very restricted mobility. It is nice, yeah, but not without trusted people. Alcohol does nothing in the ways of pain, and it is not legal here yet, so my use is sparce, which could deal why it effects me pretty well each time. Thank you for clarifying, so no long-lasting issues afterwards correct?\n\nI also could not move at all when I over did it once, (I thought that was my own fault, but maybe CMT has something to do it, so that is interesting).\n\nI travel a lot and have found that Vegas has the best dispenser stores. And the gummies are absolutely the best deal. They always give the same results and I personally feel so much better afterwards too. No, nothing long lasting.

I actually have some CBD cream with lots of menthol used for athletes, (about 80 bucks) and I also have some THC cream, (about 40 bucks) and I apply them both to the bottom of my feet on nights when they really hurt.\n\nI will say that the pain is almost completely gone after 30 minutes.

A year ago I started developing tingling in my toes which spread up my leg, into my head and face, forearm and fingertips. I was diagnosed with a axonal sensorimotor neuropathy.  Nerve conduction shows slightly reduced velocities and significantly reduced amplitudes in the legs - arms OK. 12 months on I lot of that has dissipated but my feet and lower legs have gotten worse. My feet feel like leather and burn. I have tingling and stinging pains from my knee down. I havent noticed any muscle weakness yet but I had an EMG test last week and it showed my right calf with major fibrillations (level 3) and myotonic discharges. My neurologist was amazed that clinically that there is no calf weakness given the EMG findings. Initially we thought the neuropathy was caused by medication (humira) but the fact it is getting a lot worse so longer after I stopped the medication he now thinks it may be CMT2.  Does this seem consistent with your situations. The deterioration in my EMG seems very quick.  I have not coped very well with this. As said earlier I was already at my limit. I am already extremely uncomfortable and terrified of what the future holds, particularly the ability to walk. How were you able to deal with this. Your electrophysiological findings seem consistent with CMT2 though the sudden onset and at such a late age is unusual. A genetic test would seem to be in order to clear this up. Are you having one done now? I have not heard of it hitting anyone so fast. \n\nHammer toes, high arched feet and skinny calves seem to be the most common side effects and the first thing my neurologist looked  for when diagnosing. \n\nExercise, physical therapy, psychological therapy are how I cope. Some other types of neuropathology have treatments. \n\nYou already know that if it was the drug you were on, stopping that should help. If it were, say, diabetic neuropathy then keeping your blood sugar in the right range would help. If it were a B12 deficiency then B12 shots would help. I am not saying that it is any of these, they are just examples off the top of my head of peripheral neuropathologies that can be controlled. If you do NOT have CMT2 you can search for another answer, which could lead to a treatment. Thanks for all your replies. You are very knowledgeable on this stuff and I hope you dont mind if I pick your brain further in the future. I have done a lot of research myself and I have been tested for everything that I can be tested for and its all come up negative. The medication was the obvious answer but it has been out of my system for 9 months now and the neuropathy is getting worse which is why I think it maybe something else and the only thing we havent tested for is CMT2. Yes, it does matter. A great deal.\n\nEdit: Spelling Sure. I see a therapist and also do group therapy. Most therapists are out of network for insurance but some will help you with paperwork etc, which is helpful. I used Zocdoc to find appointments.

I feel this is better for weight loss, and maintaining muscle mass. My thinking is gaining muscle is more difficult than than retaining. I am a regular cyclist as well for cardio pre-workout. For cardio I either walk outside (usually around 3 miles) or I use an elliptical for 40 minutes. \n\nFor strength I do: \n\n1. lateral walk with a resistance band \n2. standing rows with resistance bands \n3. wall push ups \n4. glute bridges.  \n\nThe lateral walk in particular has helped me. I picked it up a few years ago when I was having intermittent hip pains and not only did it fix that issue it also made my walking somewhat steadier. \n\nI also try to stretch a bit and I have a cheap balance board that I balance on (carefully between my bed and the wall) for few minutes 3 times a week. \n\nIncidentally when I was skimming some CMT papers a couple of days ago I saw some mentions of hip flexor muscles being particularly problematic for CMT folks so I am intending to find a new exercise targeting the hip flexors and add it to my routine. Currently I am going to the gym 5 days a week, hitting legs twice in a slightly different way. I use an app called Strong (on Android and iOS for free) which is great for exercise tracking. You can see the templates I made below:\n\nCheck out my routine 'Legs v1.0' on Strong.(\n\nCheck out my routine 'Legs v2.0' on Strong.(\n\nThough when I was starting out, I was doing the below to get used to resistance training:\n\n(\n\nWith regard to gaining vs retaining, with CMT you are combating both at the same time. The neuropathy will result in a wasting of muscle mass due to fatty atrophy, while at the same time preventing hypertrophy, resulting in what can feel like an uphill battle to see even the slightest improvement in strength. While everyone is different, I can say the only thing that broke me out of a 10 year weight plateau were SARMs. \n\nCycling is perfect for cardio as it does not put any pressure on the joints, so I would keep that up. Stretching is also key to any routine when you have CMT, especially as you workout which can cause the muscles to become tighter. Wow that is awesome. Once I was diagnosed, I got depressed and stopped working out. I was like, oh that is why I cannot put on weight and muscle. Which honestly, could be bullshit or true, not sure which. But I can definitely feel that I am less strong now. \n\nWhat are SARMs? It is real - a phrase I heard a lot in CMT communities was \"I have to put in twice as much work to get half as far as everyone else\". Only recently did a neurologist confirm to me that neuropathy hinders muscle growth, which would have been useful if I had been told 15 years ago...  \n\n\nSARMS are selective androgen receptor modulators. Feel free to read about them here:  (   \nIf you have any questions, feel free to message me here or on the forum there - I highly recommend them, but they absolutely must not be treated lightly; they are not protein powders or creatine.

Was definitely more effective than when my partner tried to get me on a \"gain muscle\" plan of high weight low rep, thinking it would be easier for endurance. I lift weights about 4 days a week. I do the typical lifting splits ( push,pull,legs). I start with a \u2018heavy\u2019 compound movement then do the additional work.

First is stability, then fashion. If you feel comfortable, start with long shorts and go from there. I have worn skirts, shorts, and dresses, mostly wearing boots or something that levels off with my afos, but not giving a flying fuck who sees or cares.

Hi! CMT1A also runs in my family. My mom who also has it has been wearing hearing aids since she was 40 which from my understanding if fairly young for your standard age-related hearing loss. Her doctor told her that it is most likely related to CMT since the disease also causes neurodegeneration in the cochlear nerves.

We investigated the psychoacoustical and neurophysiological aspects of auditory processing in patients with CMT type 1A (CMT1A) and CMT type 2A (CMT2A).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;METHODS: Forty-three patients with CMT1A and 15 patients with CMT2A were prospectively enrolled. All CMT patients had a normal sound detection ability by using pure-tone audiometry. Spectral ripple discrimination, temporal modulation detection, and auditory frequency-following response (FFR) were compared between CMT1A, CMT2A, and control groups.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;RESULTS: Although all participants had normal audiogram, CMT patients had difficulty understanding speech in noise. The psychoacoustic auditory processing was somewhat different depending on the underlying pathophysiology of CMT disease. CMT1A patients had degraded auditory temporal and spectral processing. CMT2A patients had no reduced spectral resolution, but they showed further reduced temporal resolution than did the CMT1A patients. The amplitudes of the FFR were reduced in CMT1A and CMT2A patients, but the neural timing remained relatively intact.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;CONCLUSIONS: When we first assessed the neural representation to speech at the brainstem level, the grand average brainstem responses were reduced in both CMT1A and CMT2A patients compared to healthy controls. Since psychoacoustic aspect of auditory dysfunctions in CMT1A and CMT2A disease were somewhat different, it is necessary to consider future auditory rehabilitation methods based on their pathophysiology.\n\nLink found via ( on June 1, 2020 ^(\\) And here is another paper (from the same author) on the subject:\n\n**Hidden hearing loss in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A**\n\nJuly 9, 2018\n\n(\n\n&gt;Results of this study showed that CMT1A patients had hidden hearing loss compared to healthy controls, although all participants had normal audiogram. Their difficulty understanding speech in a noisy background might be due to impaired ability to handle temporal envelope clues. We assumed that demyelination of auditory nerve cause defective cochlear neurotransmission and this cochlear neuropathy could be consider as different type of hidden hearing loss. Because auditory temporal envelope processing was related to median MNCV, temporal processing ability might be a suitable marker of disease progression. Therefore, temporal resolution testing could be performed in the clinical setting to detect hidden hearing loss and monitor the degree of neural damage. Future longitudinal studies are needed in this direction to assess the role of auditory measures as biomarker in CMT1A patients with mild to severe symptoms. My understanding is that it is a fairly common symptom (thank you for adding scholarly papers!). I experience it myself and struggle to hear when there is significant background noise or when someone is not in my immediate vicinity. All people with CMT may suffer from tinnitus, although it is usually more related to CMT type 2, but I have 1A and tinitus due it. My father and I have 1A, and he almost *totally* Deaf from age 25 on. He learned ASL and married my mother, an ASL interpreter.  \n\n\nAt around age 50, he was the first in the family to get a cochlear implant, and it works great! Three other people in the family followed, and all had similar results as far as I know. I will too, likely soon, as I am hard of hearing at age 30 - and have been for a long time.   \n\n\nIf you would like to see how well he can now hear with it, you can look at ( talking about the effects of the 'toilet paper crisis' on the medical field that he works in. Deafness (as in a total inability to hear) is not a symptom associated with the \"normal\" kind of CMT1A (normal as in \"caused solely by the duplication of the PMP22 gene\"). Deafness is however associated with mutations in the PMP22 gene. To make things more confusing, there are also rare mutations in the PMP22 gene that cause the symptoms of CMT1A but no deafness, as well as rare mutations that cause both the symptoms of CMT1A and deafness. And to top it off, there is one mutation (p.T23R  mutation) that cause CMT1A and deafness in one case and CMT1A and no deafness in another. The supplementary table in ( document lists several documented mutations in the PMP22 gene that is associated with deafness.\n\nHere are some relevant studies on PMP22 and total deafness:\n(\n(\n(\n(\n\n\nHearing loss (as in a partial inability to hear), is a symptom that *is* associated with the \"normal\" kind of CMT1A.\n\nHere are some relevant studies on \"normal\" CMT1A and hearing loss: \n(\n(\n(\n( Thanks for sharing! The CI seems to work great for your dad, hope it helps you too.\n\nMy dad actually was (and still is) the first person in our family to get a CI as well. It helped him a lot, but definitely not as much as it did for your dad. Is not that the darnedest thing? We have peripheral nerves in our ears! It seems the brand has a lot to do with results. Did your dad get the Cochlear brand? This is just incredible. I recently found this sub after years of denial. I do not have an official diagnosis for CMT, but my symptoms are all very much in line with it. I also had a neurologist tell me several years back I needed to be tested for it, but chose denial over everything. This inability to distinguish sounds in noise has been something that has bothered me forever. If there is noise around and someone is talking, I cannot always distinguish between the two and focus on the speech. It is comforting to know it could be another CMT symptom. No it is not uncommon yes there is things you can do and you will have doctors that will flat out tell you that there is no connection \u2013 that is not true. \n\nPlease be aware that Charcot Marie tooth falls under the umbrella of MDA Clinic\u2018s. They are almost everywhere and they can help you get help. I cannot describe to you the enjoyment of working with the doctor that actually knows what CMT is. The hard part about CMT hearing loss is that it is subtle and does not follow the progress of some other things that could be easily fixed by just jamming hearing aids in your ear.\n\nWhen you break down training in medical school and you talk about the neurological diseases and you get to the amount of time the doctor spend on Charcot Marie tooth \u2013 you realize that this doctor may have studied Charcot Marie tooth for possibly an hour during med school? (that may be exaggerating but I expressed my frustration to a doctor once and he talked about the general classes that a general MD goes through \u2013 I am very sorry to put this burden on you but you have to become your own best advocate. Learn to read and study medical studies -they can save you).\n\nDo your own homework, do not be afraid to ask stupid questions, do not be afraid to ask about a symptom that might be unrelated. I have yet to meet a single person with Charcot Marie tooth that does not have some form of hearing difficulty eventually \u2013 and yet that symptom is still listed as rare or occasional or it can pop up sometimes. Many doctors tend to hate anecdotal problems because they do not know how to solve them. Many doctors hate to work with degenerative problems there is no gratification or payoff for their ego. They cannot fix us completely\u2026 Yet. \nBeware of people that will toss move it or lose it at you \u2013 you can do damage to yourself by trying to push yourself too hard. \nAlso Charcot was a neurologist \u2013 his name is in several diseases -it is unreasonable to expect a doctor to remember every single symptom that goes with your particular brand of something that Charcot studied.\nThe best doctors are the ones that will admit that they do not know everything about it \u2013 or the ones that are neurologists and it should be in their wheelhouse. If a doctor takes a while getting into your room before he sees you \u2013 it might be because they are busting open their resources and reminding them self what the heck that is.\n\nDumbest questions asked to me by MDs-\nOh you have Charcot Marie tooth? What side is it in? (again referring to another disease that Charcot\u2019s name is in close but no cigar)\nSocial Security disability claim denied because no dentist records found to support anything wrong with my teeth\u2026\u2026 True story.\nOh you have Charcot foot?\u2026 Charcot foot is different than Charcot Marie tooth similar but not the same.\n Oh you are using gabapentin for neurological pain? That dosage is awfully high...... no it is not, you are just not familiar with it and you are not humble enough to know that you do not know what you are talking about. This particular doctor even went so far as to pull out her big book of drugs and look up the use of it..... it was years old and did not have any information about gabapentin being used for neurological pain and therefore she did not understand why I did not have a seizure condition. \nPractice using the phrase inherited degenerative peripheral neuropathy. That phrase can actually jar more memory cells in a doctor than Charcot Marie tooth because it is more descriptive in symptoms.\nIt will degenerate generation by generation sometimes -this is not to discourage you, but just because great aunt Bessie only had her feet ache once in a while does not mean you will not be in a wheelchair or have more severe symptoms \u2013 it also does not mean that you are not as tough as great aunt Bessie....\nDo not let Grant Aunt Bessie give you crap because your disease is progressing \u2013 literally that is how most of the genetics work out.\nAnd if your kid ends up with it use your head plan ahead be an advocate, do not waste time feeling guilty or beating yourself up on some thing that is essentially a genetic roll of the dice for most types. my children all have cmt along with the usual symptoms there hands shake ? Is that part of it Do you mean a tremor? Yes Yes this is common as well. My Dad has some hearing loss and wears aids. I had partial hearing loss as a child (no aids) but as a teen a neuro said he thought I had glue ear so I am really not sure if there is a link or not as it was not followed up. I personally think there is and the neuro was not efficient at following it up in my case but cannot be certain as I have not researched it. I went to an eye specialist who said cmt can also affect eye sight in rare cases which surprised me. Hand tremors are common with cmt in my experience. I get this regularly when writing or doing delicate activities on the regular (even more so if I am anxious) but can come at times like pouring a kettle I will miss the cup. Jumping in here but i have not in depth knowledge of testing. Do you have to have a specific test to find out the mutations re PMP22 or would they have found that out at the same time as a blood test? I was diagnosed with cmt 1A at 3 but that is all I know in terms of what type. My Dad I believe has other variations but he is not forthcoming so unsure of mutations Yeah, the optic nerve. Remember the eye uses muscles to focus Thank you This is kind of a relief to hear, I never knew it was connected! I have a lot of trouble hearing in bars, and when I did my college study abroad in Paris about a decade ago, I remember I could understand French in small groups but if we were out somewhere that was loud, it became impossible for me to hear. I have been told my hearing is about 80% of what it should be by an ENT, I also am a rock musician and have had multiple ear infections as an adult, not sure if that is at all related.", "Vitamin D and CMT OK.  I am newly diagnosed via EMG and speed tests to have CMT.  My father and grandfather also had CMT. There are different types of  CMT and each body is different. \n\nI started Vit D supplements for itchy skin.  Apparently I have a malabsorption problem with Vit D.  My primary doc monitors my d3 levels.  I take 5,000 units daily.  I noticed an immediate effect of the neuropathy symptoms in my feet.  The tingling and loss of sensation resolved over several months and I now feel pain on my feet pads were as before it was going numb. \n\nSeveral times I had GI problems that prevented my Vit D dosing for a week.  I also have run out of Vit D for a week.  I experienced a rapid loss of strength in my arms and legs.  I could not get up from the toilet or open stuck jar caps.  I could no longer lift my Segway.  The tingling and numbness returned.  It takes several weeks to recover and regain strength after missing my Vit D doses \n\nI can find nothing in the literature searches about Vit D and CMT.  It would seem that there must be something different about me?\n\nI am newly diagnosed and new to the group.  Thanks and good health to you. Thank you for sharing this. As someone who is brother, mother, grandmother, and great grandfather have/had CMT, I am always fearful that I will eventually have progressing symptoms. I always like hearing of different ways to possibly offset symptoms.  Some of the symptoms of low vitamin D are almost identical to CMT symptoms so it makes sense that you would feel it as an exacerbation. \n\nAs far as I know there is nothing in CMT that would cause low vitamin D, but a large number of people suffer from it (me included), there are probably people who have not had testing done who would blame symptoms on CMT, and plenty of Drs who just take the easy answer and do not test further.\n\nI supplement, I have been picked up with low D when I was hospitalised for unrelated issues, and am at risk of low vitamin D anyway due to lifestyle.  I have been on 5000 iu vitamin D per day for the last three months and cannot say I have noticed any changes regarding CMT1A.\n\nI have been on testosterone replacement therapy nearly 2 years and can say it is been a massive change for me.  Highly recommend guys get your T levels up as high as you can to help compensate for muscle wasting. I hit the gym 5-6 days each week.  Getting my T levels fixed was incredible.  It is not trivial to get all your hormone levels in check, but it is worth it.  Doing anything to prevent CMT from wrecking your body more is worth it.  Make sure your Dr prescribing testosterone understands CMT and that you have a strong desire to keep your blood levels higher than normal TRT patients because of it.  (Highly recommend 500IU HCG every one or two weeks as well, to keep your balls working)\n\nFor women with CMT, I would highly recommend getting on the anabolic steroid nandrolone decanoate at 40 mg/wk which will not be as likely to trigger virilization.  Women are lucky that they will not need any post cycle therapy if they stop treatment cold turkey on day.\n\n I have been lucky.  I had my testosterone levels corrected 8 years ago.  It has been great.  However my PSA scores are now climbing above normal and I might have to stop testosterone supplements.  Thanks for the reply. Testosterone supplements? They do not work.  Get testosterone enanthate or cypionate prescribed and inject.  If you have got rising PSA and it is from the TRT, by all means consider stopping ... But make sure it is due to exogenous testosterone and not something else. /u/SignificantPlantain got it right\n\nThe level of ( needed for the average person has been a point of debate for the last few years.  Simply being in sunlight for a few hours a day along with a few servings of fortified milk *should* be enough.  In reality, few people with CMT are active outside every day so supplements may help.  Please be aware that 600 IU is all normal people need.  If your system has a problem absorbing D^3 or D^2 then follow medical advice.\n\nRapid loss of strength is **NOT** a symptom of CMT.  \n\nn.b. - Vitamin D fortified milk may be US only, I do not know Have a look at this:  Have a look here; (\n\nI am not surprised that CMT doctors missed this as they seem to miss everything that is not researched by a CMT specialist.

With all of the news on the new health care bill, what does removing the protections mean for people with genetic conditions? Obviously if you are diagnosed with CMT and switch insurance, then it would be a pre-existing condition, but what if you are not yet diagnosed? It is a genetic condition, it is existed for as long as you have.\n\nWhat I have found online seems to indicate that it does not count as a disease until you have had manifestation of symptoms, even if there is genetic testing that says you have the disease. I am not sure how you would define manifestation of CMT, since the symptoms are so diverse and can appear essentially whenever. For example, my mom has had high arches since she was a child, had peripheral neuropathy starting in her 20s, and got diagnosed in her late 30s. Which of those would count as the official manifestation and therefore beginning of a pre-existing condition? Of course, that is prior to the ACA so that could change under the AHCA. \n\nI am just curious. I have not gone for genetic testing myself yet, but since I already have asthma I am curious as to how insurance is going to be for me once I graduate. expensive,unavailable,exclusions,denials ..imagine they can come up with something Growing up, a physical therapist told my parents that I likely had CMT, but not to get me diagnosed because that is when I would have trouble with insurance flagging my CMT as a pre-existing condition. I had a podiatrist tell me something similar years later, \"a diagnosis will not do any good because there is no treatment or cure. It would just hurt you as a pre-existing condition.\" I would guess any diagnosis via any route (blood test, nerve conduction, etc.) that got billed to insurance could be flagged, but that is really just speculation. I am not sure how it works. I got diagnosed after the ACA came into effect with its protections. I do worry about those protections going away. I am much healthier and happier now that I am diagnosed and managing my CMT with physical therapy and orthotics (previous physical therapy was for a knee injury due to a fall). I also think it is an important piece of the picture for a primary doctor to have so they can make informed decisions about your care. For example, my doctor ordered unnecessary testing for diabetes when sensation loss in my feet first started. She also gave bad advice about a tendon injury when I twisted an ankle, saying my muscles would get stronger over time to compensate. Ha! I myself did not start researching CMT and understanding how the disease really could/was impacting me until I started going through the diagnostic process in my 20s. Sorry if this is long winded. I just think diagnosis is so important and I really do not want to go back to the dark ages of avoiding diagnosis if the pre-existing condition protections get revoked.  The likelihood of Obamacare actually being overturned or significantly changed is remote at best. \n\nI only tell Dr.s when I have to, some report all info to the insurance company others do not, best to use discretion. There is a CMT clinic in Nashville I have been wanting to visit, but I am too wary of risking insurance profiling to ever go. ", "Over the moon to have found this sub! In my family there are 9 of us, out of those 9, 5 of us have CMT to some degree! It is me, my mum, sister, niece and nephew and I have not had my son tested for it yet as he is only two weeks old. \n\nSuper happy to have found this sub as I have never really spoken to anyone outside my family who have CMT and most doctors near me have no idea what the condition is! (We have to travel to see a specialist) Welcome! While this sub is good-there are some REALLY active Facebook groups that are really good to join, too. Or just browse without joining. It was amazing to see so many people deal with things that I feel so alone with. CMT is one of the most common neurological disorders, yet I have never met anyone with it in person outside my family! Why do you keep reproducing the gene? There are IVF routes available, they find the faulty gene of the mother and make sure its not passed on. \nSorry guys. Humanity is a shit show. Interesting. Why does it piss you off? How do other people\u2019s family choices affect you? Cause I know the suffering of having cmt. Why make other people experience it? Selfish. We did not choose to reproduce the gene? It was discovered in our family quite late on and we are all varying degrees of severity Dude, how in the world would we know about being able to delete the faulty gene when no doctor has mentioned it? Most doctors will only mention these things if it is possible, or if they know about it themselves. It is insulting to blame the person for their child given the disorder. How dare you. I often call it \"the most common disease you have never heard of\" That is not how this works...that is not how any of this works You do not need to justify yourself to that guy.

I am scared that someone will hurt me if they cut my toe nails...its hard to do myself but I would be afraid a machine or someone else would end up cutting me or twist the nail in the process.

She is a golden/lab/? mix and will likely be 50-70 pounds. Does anyone here have any advice for ways to make dog training easier?  It will be very important for her to learn solid impulse control and not to pull so he can walk her. I only got her last week so we have not practiced leash training yet but she is very smart! I will eventually consult with a professional trainer but have not found one yet. ( She is adorable! I had a lab growing up, and the thing that helped the most with walking him was probably getting a Gentle Leader. It looks like a muzzle, but it is only purpose is to lead the dog by their face instead of pulling against the leash. With a dog of that size, no one with CMT is going to win a battle of strength. On the other hand, labs have an extended puppyhood, which for me meant that if my dog wanted to pull me somewhere bad enough, I kind of just had to go along with it.  Luckily, they are very smart and food-motivated, so training is actually relatively easy. I trained him myself at the age of 11, and he learned all of his commands pretty quickly, so with the help of a professional, I am sure you will fare even better. thanks! she is cute when she is not biting lol Thanks, I got her a gentle leader but she outgrew it before I could train her with it! I just ordered a larger one. I think so long as we get her leash trained before she is huge we will do okay, we are a little behind because she did not have her vaccines. I had a shep/lab cross.

I have 3 young children. They have a hard time understanding that I tire quickly and that my body hurts and is \"broken\". I feel incredibly guilty. Does anyone have a children's book suggestion or movie or something? With my daughter, I just tell her mommy's tired, or redirect her. She sees my braces, she looks at my hands, she sorta gets I cannot do everything for her. She is starting to understand what I do, and what her dad does for her. I try not to say I cannot do something, because I have a hard time telling myself that, let alone my child. Do not feel bad, because it is harder for children to grasp these concepts. Repeat what you are able to do, or redirect them to your spouse, their grandparents, or someone who can do it for or with them instead. If they insist that it is you they want, try to redirect their attention to a different activity that you have little or difficulty with. Children (at least in my experience) are easily swayed to another activity as long as it involves you, if they are really set on you. I was just thinking about this. My wife and I are expecting our 1st child this January. I am following this post for suggestions It is frustrating. I was diagnosed until this year.

I am going to try to look up to see if there are any science experiments that I could do with my son in that vein. Thank you for the suggestion!", "CMT and MS Connections/Studies? I have CMT - type unknown (various genetic test have come back inconclusive, most recent one was in 2018). I have had symptoms since I was 12, was misdiagnosed with CIDP (chronic inflammatory demylineating polyneuropathy) at 16, and was correctly diagnosed at 27. \n\nPrimary symptoms are progressive loss of dorsiflex in the feet, high arches, drop foot, skinny calf muscles, hammer toes, and some slow loss of function in the hands. No pain and no loss of sensation.\n\nThere is absolutely no history of CMT in any of my immediate or extended family. I am an only child - but everyone from my cousins to my grandparents have no history of symptoms. However, my father does have MS - primary progressive. He was diagnosed when I was about 6, and continues to live with it now 25 years later. Our symptoms are not dissimilar, since his primary manifestation is loss of muscle control in the feet and lower legs. \n\nI have heard anecdotal talk about familial connections between MS and CMT - does anyone know of actual studies or reports on possible connections? We both go to the same neurology clinic (different specialists) and they seem really intrigued, but have not been able to point me to anything specific. I have never heard of a link but my  16 year old son has developed cmt symptoms with no family history along with inconclusive genetic studies as well. Whilst the symptoms are similar, the mechanisms that cause them are not so much, beyond both being nerves failing at their job for various reasons. \n\nThat said, my partner is in an MS study, and the neuro he works with used to do CMT research. Might ask if she has any idea when next in. I am unfamiliar with any link between CMT and MS and a quick Google Scholar search did not turn up anything in the journal literature. Which is not to say that there is not a link, but it does not look like anyone has found evidence strong enough to write a paper about it at this time. \n\nIf I recall correctly, about 10% of CMT cases are de novo--that is not inherited from a parent but a spontaneous mutation. Everyone has a mutation or two but the vast majority of them are silent, detectable only in genetic testing with no impact on anything. As mutations go I would give this one a 2/10 Do Not Recommend but glad I still have all my internal organs and such. Would prefer the comic book sort of mutation that gives super powers. I have not looked into this much, but I did a quick literature search right now and it seems like there are a handful of case studies reporting on a CMT + MS comobodity as well as at least one paper concerned with a possible association between x-linked CMT and MS. Glancing through the abstracts it seems like it is circumstantial evidence at best, and that if true GJB1 could act as a risk factor for developing MS in some very rare cases.\n\nHere is a list of the studies I found (the list is not exhaustive):\n\nA rare association between multiple sclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1B.\n\nA special association between Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A disease and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis\n\nRelapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in x-linked charcot-marie-tooth disease with central nervous system involvement.\n\nX-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and multiple sclerosis.\n\nX linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and multiple sclerosis: emerging evidence for an association.\n\nMultiple sclerosis associated with duplicated CMT1A: a report of two cases.\n\nDemyelinating neuropathy in a patient with multiple sclerosis and genotypical HMSN-1\n\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth type 1C disease coexisting with progressive multiple sclerosis: a study of an overlapping syndrome.\n\n\nLet me know if you are unable to find any of these and I will edit this post with proper citation links. If there are any other research done on this topic, it should be covered by the references/bibliography in these studies. Can I ask how you know you were misdiagnosed with CIDP?\n\nthe exact opposite happened to my mom. She has the gene for CMT, but had no symptoms until she was like 30. At that point, she suddenly lost everything all at once. Quad hands, complete numbness and weakness in her legs, etc. \n\nSeveral neurologists told her it was her CMT, because she had the gene. They also told her she did not have long to live because of how fast it was progressing. She went and saw Dr. Shy, who is the leading doctor in CMT research, and he offered CIDP as a possibility. A few IVIG treatments later and she actually regained some of what she lost. IVIG treatments have kept her alive the last 18ish years, and now she just had a stem cell transplant.\n\n\n\nHonestly, if you can, I would look into going to Iowa to see Dr. Shy. Maybe bring your father with you. He might either have more answers to what kind of CMT you have, or what else the issue could be. My mom has MS, while me and my son both have CMT1A. I have done online research to find things about connections between the two, and have not been able to find anything solid, but it is definitely been a curiosity to me. I have asked a few doctors about this. My mom has CMT1A and MS. She was symptomatic for MS nearly 30 years ago but it was passed off as merely CMT. My mom thinks I am going to end up with MS as well. \n\nMy physician, also a retired neurologist, explained that there *could* be a connection, but so many symptoms look the same that it is often categorized as one or the other without much investigation into whether someone has both.", "Hearing loss Hey, was wondering if anyone else has hearing loss due to CMT? I have CMT1A and just recently got hearing aids do to my hearing.. there is others in my family who has CMT but they do not have the hearing loss like I do. Yes, it is a common symptom. I have hearing loss in one ear, and it is neurologically based meaning that my ear is intact. It is a neuropathy, similar to the loss of sensation in the hands and feet. It is common but usually only associated with type 2. That being said, I have type 1a and hearing loss in one of my ears almost certainly due to CMT (occured before my actual diagnosis).", "Needing some advice on how to handle a situation So as many of you probably do, I go to a pain clinic to help manage my pain caused by CMT. \n\nWithout this pain management I would not be able to work or have a life worth living. \n\nWith that being said my state has extremely cracked down on pain clinics. Every time I go the patients are treated terrible. Even the ones with life long conditions like mine. Everything is scrutinized and I have to drug test at every visit, no exceptions.

I tried everything I could to push it off but ended up having to go. \n\nI am almost certain I have failed my drug test for marijuana. I rarely ever get to see the actual doctor who has suggested I try it (in the past) but every clinic now pretty much makes you see the nurse practitioner after your initial visit.

I guess I just need some advice on what to do if anyone else has been through something similar. It might help to mention what state or country you are in, since local attitudes and laws towards marijuana use vary quite a bit these days. Where I live, medical marijuana has been legal for a long time and even recreational is now legal and I cannot imagine that how someone would be treated for having marijuana in their system here would be at all the same as where you are. Even if consumed legally it is still a violation at the clinics here.

There is a controversial hypothesis that has been kicking around CMT research journals for ages called overwork weakness. Last I checked I think there was slightly more evidence AGAINST overwork weakness than for it but honestly it is not conclusive.  Overwork weakness is a phenomenon where a high degree of muscle strain that would lead to a gain of strength in a healthy person can instead lead to a loss of strength in a person with certain neuromuscular diseases. \n\nIf you had time, I would suggest trying to build strength in a slow, regulated program without extreme stress to your muscles. Since you are already in the middle of a situation where you are called upon to undergo this strain multiple times a week I do not think you have time for that. \n\nIs overwork weakness in CMT even a thing? If so, is it a thing for you personally? (it could apply only to certain types of CMT or only cases that are at a certain level of severity) If so, are these circumstances that would trigger it? These are all unanswered questions. \n\nI wish I had better news or even more clear and definitive answers but the best advice I can give is to be aware of your body and how it is reacting. Good luck.", "CMT and Family Planning Hey everyone! I am new to the group here, so I just kind of wanted to hear everyone is experiences or thoughts on the matter. \n\nMy mom was diagnosed last summer with CMT 1A after experiencing weakness in her hands, wrists, forearms, etc. and said since it is genetic that we might have it too. I (29f) have an identical twin sister that, as soon as we looked up what CMT was, felt like it was describing something we have long experienced, but never had a name for. We both went to a neurologist this past winter and did the EMG test to confirm that we also both have CMT (I presume also type 1A) but have not been officially tested for the specific type. \n\nGrowing up, I always felt frustrated with the weakness I experienced in my ankles, calfs, and feet. I was always uncoordinated/clumsy and had poor balance ever since elementary school, but I guess I just presumed that was normal. In addition, I have hammertoe and super high arches and slight weakness in my hands/forearms as well, yet I was never in any pain from any of this, besides not being able to physically do certain things I wanted to do, like jumping or running well, monkey bars, etc.\n\nNow that I am an adult, it is sort of been the same; no pain-unless I am standing or walking for long amounts or distances. I work out regularly and enjoy doing physical things like hiking, but I do feel hindered a bit by my CMT sometimes in that if I did not have it, I could be even more successful in any physical endeavors.  At the same time, I know it could be way worse and I am lucky to be able to do all that I can. \n\nThis brings me to my current sort of predicament. My husband (30m) and I have been talking about family planning and possibly starting to try for kids. But when we found out that my lack of coordination/muscle development was due to a genetic disorder that could be passed on again, we found our decision to be more complicated than originally thought. Everyone always tells me that of all the things that could be passed down, that CMT is not so bad, which is true, it could definitely be worse. But I have been curious, what have others\u2019 experiences with CMT been? I have not experienced much pain, but it makes me nervous that future generations possibly could. \n\nWe have met with a genetic counselor too, to learn more about IVF and possibly screening out the genetic disorder, but I am wondering if that is something we should seriously consider or not. It would be nice to not have to worry about for any future generations from this point on, but it is pricey and quite a process. Has anyone else been through this decision? What kind of advice would you offer? \n\nI think one of my worries in all of this is my child feeling weak like I did growing up, but unlike in my childhood, at least we would know why this is happening and we could maybe do things that could help rather than just constantly feeling confused and wondering. I think that the first place to start is getting a genetic test so that you know the exact type of CMT that you have. It is pretty painless (just a blood draw), just make sure that your insurance is ready to cover it. That will give you specific information about what to expect as far as passing the gene onto your children.\n\nBeyond that, there is so much more information now versus 30 years ago when people were first getting diagnosed. Neurologists and physical therapists are aware of CMT and have researched sources to help. Materials science has advanced so braces and ergonomic aids are not as clunky. Your child's experience will probably be vastly improved compared to the previous generation where patients and professionals were still stumbling in the dark. I have some daughters with 3 kids with CMT and would be curious about how much it costs to genetically screen embryos.  I know it may be pricey, but you also have to consider future health care costs/benefits if you end up having additional generations of children with CMT. I am in a similar position although I have had it since birth and had developed quite severely in childhood and adolescence - I am female and I have 50/50 chance of passing it on to my children (I have none just now but have been looking into it for the future so we can plan accordingly as I know somethings take a long time to happen etc.)\n\nUnfortunately my CMT experience is quite bad which I think is rarer for a female to have it quite severe and it turns out I am one of those unlucky few! It can affect everyone differently even from within the same family so it is difficult to pinpoint how badly your child will have CMT or if it will be a carrier of the gene. I am similar to you with hammertoes, high arches etc although I experience chronic pain and have done ever since 10 years old pretty much but again like you I can walk/stand for short distances despite have bad loss of balance and bad coordination. Pain can be very debilitating and awful but I am sure if your child is unfortunate to have the worst case scenario they will have a great amount of support from family which I know has helped me get through the bad days :)\n\nBut definitely look into speaking with a doctor or contacting someone who can properly diagnose you with your specific type and how this might affect any future children you may have :) that is what my mum did!\n\nWish you the best! I did PGD IVF to avoid passing my 1A on to my son. There is definitely a sentiment out there of CMT being relatively minor and not worth worrying about, and we took that into consideration, but ultimately decided that we were worried about it. \n\nEven within my family, CMT has expressed very differently - some are more severely affected, and some quite early on. I was diagnosed at age 9. I have had multiple surgeries and could never participate in childhood sports, but overall I have it fairly mild. I have still traveled around the world and pursued higher education, etc... Unfortunately, there is just no way of knowing what the severity would be in any potential child. Some people with 1A end up having amputations, for example, or needing medication for chronic pain. That is why we decided to proceed with IVF. It would be extremely expensive where we live, so we traveled out of state. We were lucky that it worked the first round - it can often take more. I am happy to provide more details by private message, if you (or anyone) are interested in more details. It was a difficult process and pricey, as you mentioned. \n\nThere are a lot of factors to consider in your decision and I wish you luck and clarity, and to be happy with whichever way you choose (it is a completely personal decision so do not let anyone else pressure you!). For us, there is a giant, constantly evolving list of other worries we have as parents and I am really thankful that at least CMT is not on the list. CMT1a here, I have know about it my whole life and explained it to me now wife early in our relationship. The symptoms vary throughout my family and growing up it is something I always faced (muscle weakness, lack of balance, etc), and passing it on is a concern but honestly not a big one.\n\nI have 2 sons now (1 and 3), and watch them closely for symptoms. We are ready to face it if it is inherited but if it is I have the knowledge that my parents lacked to really help, so much more is known these days. I will probably have then both screened soon so that I can better prepare.\n\nThat all being said I think you have to let your personal/family history help guide you. In my case CMT1a was not a hurdle that merited extensive deep conversations and expensive testing and screening. My wife and I know the family history, researched CMT1a beyond what I personally knew, and simply decided to start our family.\n\nIt can be a huge stressor, having CMT1a, but having kids is even worse! Take the steps you feel are best but try not to look for things to stress over if you can.\n\nAgain, this is just my personal experience with CMT1a, some people's symptoms/history are so different from mine that I probably sound crazy. You have probably guessed that I would say forego the ivf or extensive counseling; just do your research, prepare yourself, and be a supportive patent either way. I chose not to have any kids of my own. I had some extensive surgeries to correct my feet, and watched the pain my grandpa was in when I was younger. That was enough for me to say I was good not having my own. I fell into a pre-built family, though, so I have effectively removed the cmt genre from my family tree. You have a 50% chance of passing it along. Knowing that, I got snipped in my early 30's. Problem solved. :) To be completely honest with you, people born today with CMT or not going to feel the effects that we have. It is just that simple, they are way too close with the research. PXT 3003 already seems to stop the disease from progressing and they are now moving to trials to see about giving it to juveniles. This is just the beginning so I would not worry about it. Of course I have CMT, and I got lucky as neither of my boys got it. That being said it is obviously A personal decision but given where we are with research I seriously would not give it a second thought. As I said in another post, we are so far advanced with medical treatments now and research that the idea that we would not have this looked in the next 10 to 20 years seems virtually impossible. I certainly would not abort a child over CMT 180 that is for sure. It honestly never even occurred to me to test my children until they were born. &gt;80 that is for sure. It honestly never even occurred to me to test my children until they were born and I am now 49 years old with one of the wor\n\nOf course I would not consider aborting a fetus because it had CMT, however I do know you can fertilize a dozen eggs and then you have the choice which embryo to implant. Absolutely. I mean if you have the option and financial ability then by all means.", "Signs and Symptoms Hello all! I have a question for those of you who were diagnosed via signs and symptoms, rather than via known family with CMT. I am leaning towards those with more mild initial presentations, because that is why I have had, and it is what I am watching for like a hawk with my son (and yes, I am still coming to grips with a lot of things related to my diagnosis). \n\nI guess I am just sort of annoyed no one caught on that something was going on with me nerve-wise, until I had a series of random medical events completely separate from CMT take place this year. I have incredibly high arches. I have hammer toes and had toe surgery to correct it 8 years ago. I cannot squat with my heels anywhere close to the ground. I NEVER recall having any reflexive movement when the doctor tapped me knee (I faked it! I thought everyone was faking it! But that was my fault.) And it takes 3-5 seconds for me to feel a stubbed toe. \n\nEven medical doctors who treated my mom, who has very obvious symptoms but allegedly thought it was \u201csomething else\u201d until I was diagnosed, never brought up this condition, never mind in relation to it passing to her children. \n\nIs my experience unusual? Is CMT so uncommon that your average podiatrists and orthopedists would just never think of it? \n\nTHANK YOU ALL! That is a pretty similar experience to mine except my dad knew he had it and never even thought to tell me about it, I had to find out on my own. When I read about the CMT symptoms online I instantly knew I had it, similar to you, it was an aha moment that explained all these things going on in my body that I figured were unrelated.  \n\nI do not think it is that unusual, even though it is a common neuropathy many doctors do not know about it. I am the only patient with CMT that my primary doctor and my neurologist have. Often times when I tell doctors I have it they are excited because they read about it in med school but have never had a patient with it. \n\nSorry to hear what you are going through but you are definitely not alone.  Thank you to NixyeNox for the information supplied below! CMT is nowhere near as common as it is made out to be and I have learned something really helpful from their words. \n\nApparently they teach about CMT in medical school but most people forget. I only got diagnosed because my middle school made me train to do hurtles and I ended up with terrible terrible nerve and muscle pain all throughout both of my legs. Even though my dad\u2019s sister and her whole family had it it was never brought up as a possibility. If that incident had not happened I probably would not have been diagnosed until much later. \n\nYour symptoms sound similar to how mine are. I find that if I start an appointment by mentioning CMT and some common symptoms some doctors are able to recall learning about it and/or will do some quick research. CMT is technically a rare disease. It is easy to lose sight of that because it is one of the more common of the rare diseases, and because so many papers and websites and such start off with talking about how important it is and how common. Usually papers like to say things like \"it is the most common genetic cause of neuropathy\" which, true, but that is a big fish in a very small pond. \n\nA rare disease in the USA is one that effects fewer than 200,000 Americans; CMT effects about 150,000 people. A rare disease is also sometimes defined as one that effects fewer than 1 in 2,000 people and CMT estimates place it slightly beyond that threshold effecting 1 in 2,500 people or 1 in 3,000 people, depending which source you go with. \n\nMy current primary care physician is the first general care doctor I ever met who knew exactly what CMT was off the top of her head when I met her (she is good and I am keeping her). That explains so much! I have always heard of it as being one of the most common foot diseases, the most common neuropathy just all of these common things and yet nobody knows about it. Thank you so much for clarifying that it is like this weird weight just got lifted off my shoulders. I will edit my post I was diagnosed by the 3rd neurologist I saw because of my wide range of weird symptoms that my PCP attributed to MS but the first neurologist told me was anxiety. High arches, weird/no reflexes, loss of hearing, twitches, loss of sensation, pain and numbness, etc. \n\nMy mom has similar symptoms but, she is also someone who doc shops and likes to have things wrong with her that are fixable through medication/surgery. Since CMT does not fit that mold she is rejected it and often questions my diagnosis. They found mine out when I was 5ish because I had cafe au lait skin and my toes pointed straight down when I slept.\n\nEdit: and the whole tripping constantly thing Wait what direction are my toes supposed to point?! ::cries/laughs nervously:: I had the exact same experience! My mom just never brought it up. I once had a family doctor ask me if she could see my feet and asked me questions about the condition because she would never heard of it. Really? I have never met anyone else with that experience, though I know it can present extremely mildly in some families. \n\nI was so mad about it I did not talk to my Dad for years. I was actually on vacation with him in Mexico when I found out. I was using his laptop to google something that started with \u201cch\u201d (maybe Chechen Itza now that I am thinking back on it) and google auto filled Charcot Marie tooth. It sounded so weird so I clicked on it to see what it was about, after 5 minutes of reading I knew I had the disease and was so pissed I bought a flight back on my own and stormed out. Maybe an overreaction in retrospect but hey we live and learn. It is awful that he withheld that information  from you.  My dad did the same until I was 16. Smh,  I do not know that I really blame him because even though his dad had it too,  he did not get treatment for it aside from custom orthotic inserts.  His CMT is really bad now because he never got formally diagnosed,  nor treated till he was in far into adulthood.  He did not tell us or get us diagnosed because he was afraid of our reaction and insurance getting costly.  In a way that is health neglect though,  do not you think?  That is why it is so upsetting.  I always had known I was off physically,  but did not know why.  I just thought I was weird and was self conscious.  It wouldve helped me a lot to know then what it was.  I am in physical therapy  now at 19, working at getting what mobility and muscles I can now to slow it is progression. I really think it depends on your personality. The CMT presented mildly in my Dad, he did not even have any discernible symptoms until his 30s (according to him), so he never even thought about telling me. I had symptoms my whole life though. He is the type of person who never goes to the doctor and thinks if he pretends nothing is wrong with him that will somehow become true. \n\nIn my opinion, yeah it is neglect. I went to seek treatment, PT, supplements, etc. immediately after my diagnosis. I wish I had been doing so all along and I wish I knew why I could not get stronger or faster like my friends were despite working as hard. My Dad does not think that way though. \n\nI have still got a huge chip on my shoulder about it and I probably always will but I am trying to see it through the eyes of someone from another generation and with a different personality.  Great to know others had the same experience, thanks for sharing. I hear ya completely. Does one of your parents have it with symptoms also? \n\nI do not think you have got anything to worry about with your son. You have got the benefit of being able to not make the mistakes your parents made, and also, it is probably more like than not that some kind of treatment exists in your sons lifetime. Yes, very obvious symptoms now that I know what CMT is, but my family is of the mindset of \u201cwe do not talk about uncomfortable things\u201d so it was just weirdly ignored. Sorry to hear that. I really cannot get myself into that mindset, blows my mind when people act like that. I did not know hearing loss was a part of CMT until just now. I am working on getting an appointment because I think I do have it, though very mildly based on what I have read. I do have hearing loss plus particularly high arches, I am clumsy as hell (there is a million funny stories about all of the ways I have fallen or dropped something), and balance issues. I am adopted so do not have much info on whether or not I do actually have it without doctor's visits.", "Supplements for CMT? I have not gone into looking at what supplements might help me...it is all so confusing and discouraging to me.  Is there anything that helps you?  Any ideas on a way I can started thinking about this?\n\nI have recently started taking collagen powder that might help.  Who knows though. CMT type 2 but unknown mutation if it matters. Lecithin, magnesium, vitamin b, are all supposedly beneficial.\n\nLecithin shows the most promise:\n\n ( Arrggg Lecithin seems to only help with myleniation according to that link, but CMT Type 2 is deterioration of the axons ...I guess magnesium and vitamin B are easy enough though to try Yes, lecithin is theorized to improve myelination. Magnesium is mentioned a lot for people having muscle cramps in particular or possibly muscle aches. Not sure about the vitamin B. I just take a general multivitamin myself. Good luck! Exercise and eat like the omnivore you are.\nPlease just keep moving Lecithin sounds really interesting. Has anyone else tried this? What dosage? My families neurologist just had a few of his other patients recommend L-Serine, which is a bulk supplement powder or capsule. \n\nSomething about it stopping the immune system from attacking your CMT generated proteins. \n\nAnyone try this out? He gave us an article if anyone is interested. I would be interested in seeing the article if you have it Shoot, I have never shared a link on reddit before lol. I have the original in a PDF through JCI.org. \n\nIf you go to their search bar, the title is\n\nOral l-serine supplementation reduces production of neurotoxic deoxysphingolipids in mice and humans with hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type 1\n\nHave not read it just yet, but my neurologist did! These vitamins really helped me.\n\n\n How so? Did you have bloods taken? Most supplements are snake oil for CMT. The question is: what is your aim? If it is to cure CMT, that is not going to happen for a while. If it is to build muscle, help your joints, then there is plenty out there. I know CMT does not have a cure.  My\nGoals would be, to be in less pain, have more energy, possibly slow the decline. I am not sure what you mean by \"bloods taken\"? But I will say that this vitamin covers a myriad of cardiovascular, (on top of a normal vitamin) aspects.\n\nThat includes supplements already mentioned in the posts above.\n\nAlso this vitamin is as close to organic as possible, (meaning it is less processed). This is important for the CMT'ers finding out that certain drugs, or supplements have unsuspected side effects..., (and can really make life rough for days, or weeks after taking them).\n\nI have tested a plethora of supplements and will say that this vitamin covers almost all supplements you may be interested in, with little worry of side effects.\n\nThe cardio blend portion of this vitamin is really the area you get the most out of. CMT life for me is constantly balancing my energy. Workouts are required for muscles, (muscles help with overall energy) but workouts also use up energy.., that can leave CMT'ers feeling fatigued.\n\nThus is why this vitamin is so crucial to my health. It already has CoQ-10.\nThat alone should have you buying this Vitamin: \n\nAnd look how much people pay for CoQ-10 just as a supplement;\n\n\nBut you also get Hawthorne:  \n\nAnd that supplement can cost more than CoQ-10. \n\nThose two supplements not only increase your daily energy, but are amazing antioxidants &amp; inflammation reducers. If you want your muscles to have a fighting chance, (before steroids, or protein shakes) I personally believe the body needs to run at its best performance. Hawthorne is amazing for the Heart, CoQ-10 is amazing in so many ways I could create a whole post just for that alone...and these are only two supplements within this amazing vitamin. \n\nTry it for a month, (take the suggested amount of pills daily) and see for yourself. \n\nI have been taking them for a year, and recently stopped taking all other supplements because this one vitamin seems to handle everything I am looking for. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, I truly do not mind at all. Sorry, but the product is trash.\n\nFirstly, organic is nothing but pseudo-science. Mercury is organic, but you would not want to eat it, right?  \nSecondly, the dosing in the tablets is off. Way off to be any use. An example would be the uselessly low dosing of omega 3/6/9, the low dosing of the \"cardio blend\" which should also be labelled as bullshit.   \nThird, as a man, you DO NOT want to be taking an iron supplement daily. This can easily lead to iron overload, liver inflammation and ultimately cirrhosis of the liver.   \nFourth, a lot of the pill is a gimmick. Organic mushroom defence? What?!\n\nYou would benefit from checking out ( and checking the health value of each ingredient and the necessary dose required to make a difference. That multivitamin+everything else is a gimmick.  \n\nYou are obviously bias,  but let us check examine.com to see what they say about steroids \ud83d\ude44\n\nI guess *know it all's* have CMT too... Careful, this Joe guy post's history basically says he going to only offer you a single solution, (and not what you asked for).\n\nThere is nothing wrong with looking into PEDS, but that was not your original question... Really, PEDs are good for joint support? Stop talking. If you do not understand CMT, supplements and the research that is been done, please take your ignorance elsewhere. All you are going to do is post misguided subjective nonsense. Stop having a tantrum. Your post was based on zero knowledge and now you are trying to make it personal. Post facts, or keep your organic overpriced snakeoil to yourself.\n\n I guess *boomers* have CMT too... Actually you made the personal attacks 1st. Calling someone is opinion \"trash\" is pretty personal.\n\nAnd yet you have not offered a single fact yet, or sourced your own rebuttal of my opinion. \n\nNice projection though \ud83d\ude02\n\nBow I know why you asked me about my blood takes from vitamins \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThat is because all your posts here are about PEDS.\n\nYou came into this discussion to gaslight.\n\nI am Gen-X btw..., so far you have been right about nothing, but yet believe you have such sage wisdom to offer others. Read my response again. I said the product was trash, and it categorically is. I did not say your response was trash. \n\n Nice projection though \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI **literally** gave you a list of reasons why the product is trash - sells on the myth that being organic is good, it is underdosed in most areas, contains iron, which is a no-go for men, and contains snakeoil proprietary blends - and then I told you where to find out more info at ( I am not going to waste my time going through every ingredient, but here is a starter because clearly you are not able to look this up yourself:  \n (   \n( \n\nI asked for bloodworks because you have literally no evidence that the product helped you or your CMT.

No one is going to benefit from someone who neither knows what they are talking about, or is able to understand how to even qualify what they are saying.** \n\n&gt;!  \"Your post was based on zero knowledge\"\n\nThe OP asked about supplements, (and as you already stated, most are consider snake oil) so why are you attacking me for indulging OP's question?\n\nDunning-Kruger much? \n\nCalling out your hypocrisy does not upset me in the slightest..., but you yourself appear to have come *unhinged*.

An OT actually got me the version in the link below for free but you can buy them fairly cheaply if you cannot wait (also you can get vat discount). \n\n\n\nThey also do this version for multiple keys but I personally would start out with the basic version as the handle for the multi key may be harder to turn (I have not tried that version). \n\n\n\nI know how frustrating it is and limiting plus embarrassing to be an adult and not be able to open a door so I hope one of these works out for you. :)", "CMT 2N I am 56 years old and just found out that I have CMT 2N and was just wondering if anyone can give me any insure or information. CMT2N is pretty rare, it was described in the medical literature about a decade ago and to date there only exist a handful of papers about it. All other information out there on CMT2N is largely derived on these few papers otherwise it is going to be conjecture. There are a couple of different mutations all labeled as 2N, and as far as I know it can occur as a de novo mutation or be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The exact disease mechanism is still not fully understood, though that is to be expected when so little work have been done on it. The severity and age of onset seems to vary quite a bit and there are very few described cases. Interestingly enough, there was a ( published this year that indicates that valproic acid, a common epilepsy drug, is a potential drug for CMT2N. It is still very early days though so studies like these should be taken with a grain of salt. The same should this post by the way, as I am not a profession and I am just typing down what I know as someone having an interest in CMT wanting to help others in the same situation.\n\nMost of the information known about CMT2N is summarized in the ( It can be a bit hard to digest, but it is the best source of information when it comes to summarizing medical knowledge about genetic disorders. If you have not already, it is always a good idea to talk to neurologist and a geneticist, and if you experience bad symptoms also other professionals that can help aleviate them such as a orthopedist, physical therapist etc. As I understand it, if you visit one of the ( they will perform a total evaluation and all of this will be taken case or.\n\nThe CMTA also have an online service where you can ( I have used it several times and always gotten an answer by a professional in a field relevant to my question. It is a great service, though the answers can sometimes be a bit general. Thank you, I have had the generic testing done and met with the neurologist which has now sent me in to have the nerve conduction study and physical therapy.  Hello,  I also have a mutation on my AARS gene. I sought out genetic testing a couple months ago for myself after learning about Charcot Marie Tooth.  I am having a hard time finding a neurologist who knows what to do with me. I would definitely recommend the OMIM database as well because this type of CMT can present differently than the more common types and every person is different. For example, my NCS came back within normal range and instead of lack of a knee reflex I have hyperreflexia.  It can be really difficult sometimes, especially with the lesser known subtypes, and I recommend you learn as much as you can and advocate for yourself.", "Share experience with cmt and relationships I want to hear others experiences I am 18 m and have never experienced a relationship and I know it could be worst and I should not I have a lot of breakdowns revolving around cmt and just life fairly regular but one thing that always comes around is the thought I am going to die alone and never experience a significant other anyways share away :) My husband has cmt and we have been together 20 years, married 10 of those years. \nHe was diagnosed after we were married.  It is been an adjustment but we are okay.  Some days are better than others. \nYou will find the person for you. Just remember to be patient.   \n\ud83d\udc97 I felt the same way at 18, and I bet you many 18 year olds feel this way regardless of their condition. It is totally normal. \n\nCMT may make it harder for you to meet people, but it is not going to stop you from finding love. In fact, it can be a blessing in disguise. If someone does not want to be with you because of CMT, that is just letting you find out earlier that they are not a great person to be with. \n\nAnyway, the way you are feeling is normal, I felt that way too when I was diagnosed at 18. I had some much anger and resentment and fear. As time goes on, it gets easier mentally. Sending you positive thoughts! Whoa! Major run on sentence there! :-D\n\nYeah,when I was 18 I also had never had a relationship, had my first one when I was 19. I am now 45 and on my second marriage. It is one of those things that you have to work at to overcome. Finding out who you are and building a level of self confidence. What I have found is that there is someone for everyone. But, it will not be easy unless you work at it. And try to be patient, it can take a long time until you find that special someone. I have CMT and I actually met my husband when I was 18 after only having had one boyfriend before that! I was diagnosed when I was 20, and the absolute unconditional love and grace he showed me in helping to navigate that was one of biggest moments I really felt in my gut that he was the man I wanted to marry :) \n\nWe are both 25 and married now and life is great! We work out together, go for walks together, and he is always there for me even if I am having a day where my diagnosis frustrates me. Things are no different between us compared to the time before I started having symptoms, other than we need a few more minutes to strap on my AFOs before we leave the apartment haha. People joke about quarantine being too much time with their spouse, but neither of us have felt that way at all!\n\nI am not much older than you so I cannot pretend I have all of the wisdom. But, from what I have learned so far, I can safely say EVERYONE has their shit in life and in relationships. Ours is quite unique, so it stands out a bit more for sure, but it is not like our non-CMT partners do not have little quirks that sometimes require extra love and care too! Patience and a good sense of humor go a long way, so look for those qualities and it will rarely steer you wrong :) I am 30 and have never had a relationship. My doctor says it is probably because of avoidance behaviour that stems from the CMT. Being gay in a rural community probably does not help either. \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\n\nMoral of the story, it could be because of CMT. Know that it may lead to avoidance behaviour (not sure of the term, translated it from Dutch). Basically it means many of us will be wallflowers avoiding to be the centre of attention because of insecurities about how people might judge us. As for me, I have mild symptoms in that I walk a bit funny and have a constant fear people will think I am drunk all the time instead of sometimes. \ud83d\ude2c Also I do not like to be in crowded places because I am afraid the pushing and shoving might make me fall and people might assume I am drunk. Knowing it might stem from the CMT I force myself to put myself out there. Also, when you are afraid of what people might think, it is just projecting your own fears to other people. It does not necessarily mean other people think that way.\n\nThis does not necessarily mean however that it is the same for you. We must be wary not to attribute everything we do not like in our lives to the CMT. \n\nAnd this is going to sound patronising,  but dude, you are 18! It is way too soon to come to any conclusions. When it happens, it happens. Just make sure you get into situations where you meet people. Maybe swipe right a bit more often. \ud83d\ude09\n\nGood luck to you!  Do not despair (yet) \ud83e\udd23 Geez! You are 18! Your whole life is ahead of you and it can be amazing. Invest in yourself. Follow your passions and become the kind of person that people want to be around. And think highly of yourself - not \u201cI am going to die alone.\u201d That negative kind of thinking sets you up to settle for people that will not bring you happiness. I am happily married and live an amazing life. Yes, I have chronic pain. Yes, I use mobility aids. I also do theater and play in bands - and that look different than the way an abled would do it. Doing those things means I meet lots of people and am creating new relationships and friends all of the time. Now, right now all of that is out the window with Covid and I know it is SO tough. But use this time to explore thinking about what you might like for your life to look like. I am also a big advocate of volunteering for stuff to meet people. You have CMT. You cannot change that. But you can tell yourself that this is the body you got and then go get YOUR life and at your age that really means focusing on your own development - emotional, intellectual, social, etc.. My fianc\u00e9 has cmt, we have been together for several years now. He was diagnosed before we met. We do things together like play video games, play darts, and board games! Do not lose hope! You are super young. You do not need to rush into a relationship. The right relationships seem to just happen anyways, you cannot force it! Hey there! I (26F) met my husband (27M) when I was 22, we were really close friends and decided to take it a step further. I did tell him about CMT and the effects of it, that i May end up in a wheelchair later in life, that I would not have biological kids (my choice, I am not infertile) and that if he did not want that, then we probably could not be together.\n\nWe have been married for 3 years and he makes me coffee every morning while I try to wake up because I HATE waking up lol and he loves me unconditionally. Even if I am weird (unrelated to CMT) \ud83e\udd2a\n\nDo not give up, do not assume you will not find love, because it really has a way of sneaking up on you! The right person will love you, CMT and all :) CMT may hold back confidence, but it will not stop you from finding someone to love you. My best suggestion though would be not to look for that person; but to learn to love yourself and you will attract them.  I am still working on accepting my limitations and learning to love myself. I had someone who cared about me but my self hatred/ drug abuse pushed her away.  \n\nFelt like sharing a less peachy example.  Relationships are hard; with or without CMT you need to be ready to change to accommodate the relationship or (in my experience) it will fall apart. \n\nA last bit of advice is to not view yourself in a relationship through just your own perceptions; take time to ask and tell each other what you feel. If I did not know better, I travelled back in time and wrote this post.\n\nI am almost 43 and been with my husband since I was 20.  We have been happily married 18 years and have two boys - both of whom have CMT.  (ugh, genetics.)\n\nMy husband is my biggest supporter.  He always has my back...or more accurately, legs.  The dude even paints my nails of my super gnarled hammertoes.\n\nHe is also a stellar dad.  Our oldest needed nighttime stretching from the ages of 3-about 7.  My husband did them 5 nights a week, 30 minute sessions.  No fail, no excuses.  Always did them,\n\nI knew he was a keeper when I had to have surgery on my hand.  We had not been together very long.  About a week after my surgery, he got in the shower with me to help me shave my underarms.\n\nFun fact: I had one boyfriend before my husband.  He hated the smell of the A5-35 I would rub on my sore muscles and recoil whenever I put it on.  I should have known then and there he was NOT the one. \n\nTo summarize: find the one who shaves your armpits.  Ditch the one who freaks out over the smell of something you need to help you feel better.", "So happy to have found this sub! Hi everyone! You guys would not believe the relief I felt when I found this place, I cannot believe I never thought to look for it before lol. I have always felt pretty lonely in my own little CMT world, I do not know anyone outside of a few family members who have it. Not even my doctors knew what it was until maybe 5 years ago or so! I remember being a kid/teen (I am 24, almost 25 now for reference) and some of my doctors saying they had to go home and do some research first before they could help me!\n\nAnyways, I have type 1A, which I had formally diagnosed only last year. I was actually diagnosed without a specific type when I was 3 years old after a strenuous series of tests and false diagnoses of MD and the likes. I was the first of my family to be actually tested for this, and it was confirmed from my testing that other family members had it too, though I do not think they ever went to a doctor for it because it was so mild. Only my dad, who I got it from, and my younger brother who was less than a year old when I diagnosed, went to a doctor for it. My half siblings on my dad's side had it so mild that they never bothered, they would just have thin legs or a foot that hurt sometimes, never enough to really concern them. But my dad and brother have AFOs and have had tendons in their calves cut because of how badly their feet were curling up. My dad has pretty weak hands, painful and arched feet, and very thin legs. My brother has the same foot issues and scoliosis/kyphosis.\n\nAs for me, I was born with bilateral hip dysplasia and developed scoliosis at around age 13.  I had 6 surgeries on my hips from ages 8 to 12 to correct the dysplasia as well as mending broken bones (broke both hips one time each, had them fixed with metal plates), and I developed the scoliosis after my last surgery because my right hip was not set correctly from the surgery I had to fix a break, making my right leg ever so slightly shorter than my left. Imbalance made my spine go wack since my muscles were too weak to compensate. I had a back brace for 6 months before the doctor said it was pointless because of the muscle problem. This is all just a theory as to why I became curvy, but I do not know why else it would line up so well. And so because of the misalignment, I have a limp. Yay. My feet thankfully are not as bad off, I do have a higher than normal arch and my feet are wide with calluses on the bottom, as well as having the signature hammer toes, not to mention I maybe have 50% sensation left in them. My calves are also pretty thin. Probably the worst things I have to deal with currently is the slow loss of control of my feet, namely my right foot, and the pain from my hips sliding their way back out of their sockets.\n\ntl;dr on those two paragraphs: I have type 1A, got it from my dad, first in my family to be actually diagnosed, I have moderate severity of symptoms I would say\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have read this far, thank you for hearing me out because I have never gotten to tell anyone who understands, other than my neurologist, about these problems lol. It is nice to be able to write it down. I would love to meet some people here, I am eager to be friends with someone I can relate to in this way. :) Welcome to the sub! I just joined recently as well. Im very new to cmt and was only diagosed 5 months ago non specifically with a Dr. Appointment months in the future. Hi, thanks for the welcome! :D And wow that is pretty recent, I would be happy to talk with you about it if you want, even if you just need an ear to listen. How are you feeling about your diagnosis? Fellow 1a here We are not the most active sub, but hopefully we can help anyone who comes along! Welcome! Hey I am just glad this place exists lol, thank you! Hi! I also have 1A, with a pretty long family history of it. It makes me happy when people post here! Hi and welcome! 1A here as well. I very much enjoyed things that I can no longer do now. That coupled with a feeling of shame in public and a lack of social life is making it a tough burden to bear, if I am honest. Ah man, I am sorry to hear that. :/ I kind of understand the shame thing, I feel personally like I am at a point where I am just disabled enough for it to get in the way of daily life and where I need the help of others to a moderate degree, it can end up being a bit embarrassing. Like when I trip and fall, and people just watch me, waiting for me to get up on my own, but I cannot without help. Some kind soul will have to run over to help me if there is no ledge I can use lol. It is more or less just something to move on from when it happens, but it is very hard sometimes to not feel bad. Hello, thank you! :D I am part of the 1A club too now lol. Welcome to the sub! I have CMT1a and hip dysplasia as well (diagnosed early with 1a but just recently found out about the dysplasia). We are always happy to welcome another person here. If you have not had genetic testing yet I would encourage it; I know a lot of times the diagnosis comes from nerve conduction study and your symptoms but I like knowing for sure that my sub-type diagnosis is correct. This can definitely be a lot to deal with when no one else really understands what you are going through so feel free to reach out any time. Hi, thanks for the welcome. :D I did in fact get tested by a geneticist just last year! I only had nerve conduction tests when I was little and formally diagnosed, kind of weird how my parents never tried to help me find my sub-type after that, but whatever lol. And yeah it does sometimes feel like a lot of pressure, so I appreciate your offer. :) 1A here as well! When you were describing your brother, it was like you describing me.  Have almost the the same family history too. My cousins knees are affected so bad she needed a wheelchair for years. But with the right orthopedic shoes,  she is walking good now. Have you tried this for your hips?  They are not the coolest shoes ever, but they could help.", "It is heartbreaking watching son with CMT One of the saddest things to see is my son standing by and watching other children enjoy activities he cannot do.\n\nAt a birthday party, watching him stand at the bottom of an inflatable waterslide while he is looking at the other kids screaming with joy as they climb up and go down. Then watching his struggles to try and climb it himself only to give up.\n\nJust last week, I went with him on a field trip to a small children\u2019s museum, and I saw him suddenly stop and watch as his friends race to climb a small rock wall. \n\nHe does not complain. He just watches. And it breaks my heart because I walked in those same shoes, and I am the reason he is going through it now. but all people of all ages have set backs, misfortunes, burdens... and find they are not included sometimes\n\nhe has breath in his lungs and a loving parent\n\nhe is alive, able to move, to enjoy the day\n\nhis desires may be thwarted... but everyone is desires are thwarted at certain thresholds. His experienced of being thwarted by CMT is just a particular threshold.\n\nJust some words, this comment, but we are soon to have our first daughter, and I wonder how I will feel if/when she is in this situation!\n\n\n\n Just remember. He will come to realise he would rather be here with CMT than not be here at all. ", "Pre-existing conditions? Soooo, i have avoided neurologists. I regularly see a podiatrist. Nasty calluses, besides the point. How does it affect the insurance? Mine is pretty good, just scared to do more tests. Plus the neuro i saw was an a-hole, talked down on me. He did say, he wanted to do an e.m.g. maybe not the right acronym. Than i would have to do all the ground work, finding how much that would cost, than the genetic testing would be out of my pocket. Basically i am looking for some insight. Sorry for ramblimg! From your post it really is not clear why you think you have CMT.  Without that information the rest of your questions are difficult to answer.  Could you share?", "Independence I am 17 with CMT2D and as most 17 year olds are doing I am currently looking a collages to go to. I can move independently and can do almost everything for myself. My parents are convinced that I need to go to a collage close to home so they can take care of me because they do not think I can do it myself. I consider myself a very independent and self sufficient. Will I be able to life alone and be ok in the real world? What are the things that you currently rely on your parents for? What are you (or your parents) concerned you would not be able to do yourself? Not much truly. I do my own laundry, can cook really well, I can dress myself and everything. They are just afraid I will hurt myself and am not strong enough to really do anything. Sounds like you will be fine moving out. Maybe you can ask your parents for a list of their specific concerns, give yourself some time to think about how you would handle each situation, and present it back to them? \n\nYou may also want to consider living with a roommate for the first year. That may alleviate some of your parents' anxiety that you will be unable to do something and have no one to turn to, and also having a roommate can be a good way to start making friends in a new area/situation. College is a great time to learn how to live on your own. If you find out you need more help and want to go closer to home, that is a fine thing to learn. If you have to learn how to live on your own, learning to do that with fellow students will be invaluable. Good luck Check into the Disability Services at whatever university you are considering. I never needed Disability Services in my time at university but they do usually offer some assistance, if you need something. \n\nGenerally it sounds like you will probably be OK living on your own. You will need to learn how to do some things but that is a normal part of living on your own for the first time. If you are in a dorm you will probably have some help with that transition. Your parents may be nervous about it, but having CMT does not automatically mean you cannot manage. I lived alone for most of my 20s and would have no trouble doing so now in my 40s if I were not married. I was diagnosed at 15 and went off to college at 18 - I even spent a year studying in another country. Learning to manage yourself and know your own abilities is an essential adult skill. I do not want to say that you will never need help - but finding other people (friends, teachers, doctors) on your own, forming relationships, and coming to them for help is part of both being independent and an adult. \n\nSee what disability accommodations your school offers if you need them, such as first-floor living, help getting around campus, etc. Living with a roommate will also make sure people are around and checking on you in case you do need help. If you can setup a support system that will allow you some independence while also alleviating some of your parents' concerns that seems like the best option. \n\nBut it really does sound like you will be fine. If you need help, know where to go for it. Otherwise, have fun! Man you will be fine. In some ways the more people worry about your ability to do stuff, the more you are going to be aware of your symptoms and what not. Parents can be worry warts too so it is a good chance to prove to them you can ride solo and manage well. I am 30 and have type 2 as well As a mom (albeit of a 2.5 year old)... I think your parents are probably exhibiting a typical parent response: worry.  There are parents of non-CMT children out there thinking similar things, just without the \"I am concerned because you may have difficulties due to CMT\".\n\nI hope when my child is 17, he is looking at schools far away and that he feels confident in his abilities to live independently and handle it.  I am sure I will give him the same \"well if you go here, I can help you!\" run around that your parents are giving you, but deep down, I would beam with pride at my son's tenacity and independence.  Being a parent is really complicated! You want to see them thriving and independent, but you also want them to always need you. Based on your other responses, you will definitely be okay in the real world. Whatever college you go to should be able to accommodate any needs you have. For example, when I went to college I asked to be placed on a ground floor dormroom because many of the buildings did not have elevators. Additionally, I got some extra time on tests because of hand fatigue. Basically, if you ask for accommodations, the school will more than likely help you out with it. My parents were definitely worried about me too, but as long as you are prepared and ask for help when you need it, you will be okay. The important question that no one has asked: what is your current CMTNS value? If it is &gt;10 I would be cautious. Greater than 20, then it might be a good idea to stay close to your parents. I am not sure what that is, care to explain?", " Friday Feelings - Small Celebrations Little things that went right this week. \n\nTimes when CMT could not stand in your way.\n\nVictories that you want to share. I can still play blackbird on the guitar \ud83d\ude42", "Winter Shoes for Men? Hello,\n\nIn recent years I have found out which type of summer shoes work best for me. Summer time has become a lot easier for me because of that. I cannot find a picture right now but they are sports shoes that the usually known brands create but not the sports shoes that are very wide spread now, where the heels are quite high and of white color (that look a bit round like an half smiling mouth).\n\nI am wondering has anyone found a type of winter shoes aswell? \n\nI find most winter shoes almost block my foot and reduce my (foot) lifting abilities by another like 35%. Recently I am thinking maybe I should go rather to the trekking shoes section instead of the winter shoes section as chances are they might be made with mobility in mind. And probably are lighter aswell?! \n\nI found these to be good, very light weight (not the leather ones) and waterproof.  Good support without weighing a tonne. Personally, I switched a few years ago to Keens for most of my shoes. They work well for my feet: high arches, wide in the toes, and I do not wear AFOs. \n\nI also use an alternative lacing method to accommodate my high arches. It prevents the shoe from putting pressure on the top of my foot. You can see an example of this lacing here:  ( I am very happy with a brand called Aku. They are very stable. The sole seems to not get worn too easily compared with my other shoes that gets completely worn down on the outside within a month or two. Also they do \"orthopedic\" shoes that offer more space for soles etc :) oh, and made with full grain leather Thank you very much! Glad that you found something you are happy with.\n\nI had a quick browse and some do look like they could fit my feet aswell. Thank you, and yeah light weight sounds very good. \n\nI had a look at these \n\n(\n\nAnd you know what I normally struggle with is the toes area being too tight for me in the usual winter shoes because of the material, but shoes like these look promising because the toes area here looks like is more flexible and spacious because of the more elastic material. Oh, the toes area being wide sounds amazing. I had a look and some do seem to have more elastic material on the front, looks very promising. \n\nThank you very much! I will look for similiar ones here in my country.", "Suspected CMT. Mother has chronic CMT. (unknown to me which type)Need My mother was diagnosed with CMT approximately a decade ago. Soon after, she lost a toe, then another toe, and eventually Lost both of her legs due to infection. I am unaware of which type she has and i have yet to see a doctor myself, primarily because it never occurred to me that i could have CMT(i was completely unaware of the 50/50 inheritance statistic). \n\nI have been experiencing neuropathy in my feet off and on for an uncertain amount of time. it is something ive only just realized i was experiencing, mostly because i have had issues with restless legs which in a way sort of distracted me from the fact that i was experiencing nerve pain.\n\nI have a slightly higher arch in my feet , but it does not seem like its abnormal or higher than most. I also have slight hammertoe on my left foot for as long as i can remember. Again, it doesnt seem severe, but it is there. I have ALWAYS been clumsy and definitely fall more than most people. \n\nI am 23 and the only problematic symptom at the moment is the neuropathy. \n\nI am not sure why i am making this post other than the fact that i am scared shitless that i have CMT and i do not want my fate to be the same as my mother's in terms of the severity of her condition. i could just use some advice on how to deal with this mentally and how i should move forward to get a potential diagnosis. I know no one on here can say if i have it for sure, but i am absolutely seeking opinions from those of you who have CMT. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks You may have CMT but even if you do there is no reason to expect that your disorder will develop in a way which is at all like your mothers. Unlike diabetic neuropathy, CMT is not normally associated with the sort of infection you describe. CMT varies greatly in severity, even for people who are closely related, so how your mother's disease has developed is not going to be a reliable roadmap for how yours (if you have CMT) might go.\n\n If you get a solid diagnosis, you can rule out any other cause for your neuropathy, which is something you should certainly do. Once you know what is going on you can manage it properly to ensure the best possible health going forward. Thanks for the response. Im going to my primary doctor in a few days to see about having genetic testing done. Something I am unclear about: if I do have the genetic markers is that a clear diagnosis or does it just indicate a predisposition to getting/having cmt? I would think having a parent with cmt already is seen as being predisposed to having CMT. Last I heard (which, disclaimer, was the late 1990s) you needed both the genetic marker and to show some symptoms to be diagnosed as \"having\" CMT. Now genetic tests have come a long way since then (CMT1A was one of the first genetic tests available for patients) and the way a positive genetic test for CMT is regarded may have changed.\n\nIt is probably academic since you do seem to have symptoms unless a doctor finds another explanation for your neuropathy. \n\nOne last caveat though, your primary care doctor may refer you to a neurologist for a diagnosis, especially if your primary is not familiar with CMT, as many are not. So even with a positive genetic test you might be referred to a specialist for further evaluation of your symptoms and an official diagnosis. You are future tripping. Many of us live great lives with CMT. Go see a neurologist. You can find one in your area on the HNF or CMTA website if you are in the US. Someone mentioned your future tripping. There is nothing wrong with that to a certain extent. I spent 5 years and a lot of money even with good insurance genetic testing, muscle and nerve testings, multiple neurologists and the best answer I have is idiopathic (basically means they have no idea of the origin) neuropathy. I do have a afo now so that is cool it is allowing me to work all day without being miserable.\n\nNo doctor in this world can tell you how bad you are going to be. My recommendation is to look at all your mom's side of family as far back as possible for symptoms and know there is a possibility you will be somewhere between. Look at old family photos to jog your mom's brain... Maybe Grandma or her siblings\n\nHere is my current situation. I am about 12 years older than you right now. My symptoms are tripping, cannot stand on toes and cannot jump. Walking up stairs feels like I have on ankle weights. I do not have a formal cmt diagnosis, even with genetic testing.\n\nI am a big planner and worrier. I would have never promised my wife a family had I known about my genetic problems. My uncle has symptoms. My dad died a long time ago around the age I am now (I was 8) so he only started having symptoms. I really wish my mom would have told mean.\n\nThings would have played out differently. Now we are looking at adopting. It is killing my wife that I do not want her to bear my child. Even with adopting I think to myself how I am going to keep up and run around.\n\nMy biggest worry of all is will I be able to work at my current job to support my lifestyle and house? \n\nI picked a job where I am on my feet for 8 hours. Had I known where I would be now? I would have pursued a office job where I can sit most of the time.\n\nI wish I could travel back 12 years knowing what I know now about my family. Back then I was clumsy but I was able to stand for hours, run up stairs and walk for miles after work. Now I cannot wait to sit down. \n\nI am done trying to pursue an answer for now. I know it is in my genes and there is a good chance it will be passed down and that is good enough for me, for now, until technologies improve in the future. Thanks for the response. Sorry I am only just responding to you now.  \n\nI was being really paranoid when I made this post, though that is not to say I do not have CMT, just that I was \"future tripping\" a bit. I was especially anxious about my health when I posted this and I have realized all I can do is take care of myself now and stay active, while also considering far in the back of my mind that I might have to face CMT head on some day. But that is not now, and after asking people it actually seems I was paranoid and totally trippin about the whole foot arch thing. My arches are completely normal. I do have the hammertoe thing slightly on my left foot like I said in the post, but I feel like my toes have always been that way and maybe that is just the way my toes are. \n\nEven the neuropathy is not always there, but its definitely a real symptom that pops up here and there and Is the only thing that really concerns me(obviously besides the fact that my mother may have passed it to me genetically). \n\nI know this is totally a personal decision so I almost did not even say this, but do you really think it is morally wrong to have a biological child, due to potentially passing CMT to them? \n\nSomeone who is parents have perfect genes can be born with any medical issue you can imagine, and of course anyone can develop an illness or contract a disease later in life. \n\nI am really curious, not trying to pry or convince you. I did not know my real dad. He died before I even knew he existed, even though I was like 20 and this was 3 years ago when I found out(he died like 6 ish years ago).\n\n Just wondering what your thoughts are. As far as I know he never really tried to see me other than like maybe once when I was a tiny ass kid at a park or something and I know that no matter what issues I had(he had very serious addiction issues) or what obstacles, legal(there were none) or otherwise, I would have done everything in my power to know my son and have him know me if I were him. \n\nNot sure why I am typing this all as it is relevance is maybe obscure at best. He certainly did not mean to make a child(me) and apparently had no plans to be involved. He had diabetes and may have even had CMT. I already mentioned his addiction issues. \n\nI just wonder if the right thing to do is just not bring a child into this world. And I am not judging or even talking about your personal decision, rather I am really even considering myself if It would be immoral or selfish. I also have minor heart issues on top of everything else and have had my fair share of issues with drugs, though I have learned to manage my addiction and that is the least of my problems presently. \n\nAnyway, thoughts ? Tiny ass-kid\n\n(\n\n---\n\n^^Beep ^^boop, ^^I am ^^a ^^bot. ^^- ^^( Also, I am working 2 shit jobs just getting back on my feet and have no college degree. The idea you bring up about work is also concerning in the long run. About your morality issue, I think it depends on the circumstances. I am pretty sure your mom was not aware of the 50/50 inheritance statistic. She, like my family, were probably passing off their symptoms as a one off thing like maybe they were thinking they fell on the playground when they were little and that is why they always stumble, for example.\n\nOf course I am just supposing here and I really do not know all your circumstances. You obviously sound like you did not learn your morality from your father, of course, because your trying to plan for the future. Many couples do not plan, like to do risky things like not using condoms because they do not think there is something seriously wrong with their lineage.\n\nMy point being do not be overly mad at your parents for fathering you unless you have sufficient evidence that they knowingly knew they had a disease in their genes that could be passed on.\n\nWhen you start getting serious with a girlfriend, I think you should tell them sooner then later about your cmt, and children. Some people, like my wife, really wants kids and it is crushing her that this circumstance happened with me.\n\nYou are young, consider finding a desk job or something now before you have a spouse and house. Stay healthy, do not gain too much weight, it is harder to lose then gain, stay active and stretch. That do not mean do 5ks everyday, but park far in parking lots, put your ice cream in a small bowl and cut yourself off, etc... \n\nI really wish I was not at the top spot of my current job of 18yrs, walking 21,000 steps a day.", "Is there a way to improve grip strength with Cmt1a? I have felt it getting worse lately.  Check out \"therapy putty\". It is a resistive putty you can use to build hand strength. I use the Prohands Gripmaster Hand Exerciser that is much easier to use than the traditional grip strengthener. I just carry it with my all the time. \n\nI also stretch my wrists and forearms regularly which helps improve mobility and ease tension in your tendons. \n\nLastly, I try to play video games every few days for like an hour which keeps my hands active until they start going numb. Absolutely. You can do this in numerous ways, targeting specific muscles, or going for the full forearm and hands. \n\nFor fingers, a grip trainer that has adjustable resistance can be bought for a few dollars on Amazon, but for the wrist you may want to look into weights. I have found wrist curls to be fantastic, both incline and decline. For the forearm, reverse curls are brilliant for gaining strength and mass there. If weights are not to your liking, there is something called a \"powerball\" that is good for grip and wrist strength that is about $40 and does a great job. \n\nThe key is to do these workouts regularly e.g. every third day with high volume - 4 sets of 15 - 20 reps. I am not a trainer, but i have found this has significantly helped with my grip and forearm strength. Those chinese twin balls with bells inside, helps also with dexterity not only strength. I have also gotten very good results from reverse curls. If you have access to a cable machine (maybe difficult with so many gyms closed now) I like to do reverse cable curls. They have really massively increased my forearm strength and by extension my grip strength. My arms are much less affected than my legs though so I do not know how feasible they are for someone with a more severe case.", "Os this real? ", "List of TOXIC Medications for CMT I just wanted to post this here. I only recently learned from a geneticist that there is a list of drugs that are toxic to someone with CMT. \n\nI dont know the full effects,  so PLEASE consult your doctor. \n\n", "Cmt and muscle building ***This post is not about getting huge, this is not what I am going for here.***\n\n      I will give you a rundown of myself. I forget what type of CMT I have.  But my calves are skinny, I have that dip, or lack of muscle in between my thumb and forefingers, so my hands are not very strong. About 3 years ago I had a stroke, which left me a little more jacked up. I am still walking (thank God).  I always wore braces, I had two custom afos from hanger. Since my stroke, however, my left leg is a regular custom brace, but my right leg is a kafo, because along with that stroke I had major knee hyperextension.\n    Ever since about 28 years old, I have not been able to run, nor have I tried. So, my question is, has anyone found a fat burning muscle building program? I do not know if I would be able to do mountain climbers, because of my braces.  I am 40 years old, 510, and 184 lb. According to a lot of sites I am overweight by about 10 to 15 lb. My goal is to lose that 10 or 15 lb and I really really need to do some muscle building.\n      If no one has found a program, can anyone recommend a program that I could do at home?  Because we all have two choices, either let us CMT run our lives, or give CMT a run for its money.  I am not dumb,. I know we are going to have muscle deterioration and wasting, but is it possible to give CMT a little more muscle to waste, to maybe slow it down? The format of your post makes it very hard to read. Any chance you could change that or remove all formatting? \n\nI read your post by copying it over to a plain text window. \n\nHave you seen a physical therapist since your stroke? It is likely that you can build some muscle doing simple home exercises with resistance bands or other modest equipment but seeing a professional to get started might be very helpful. \n\nI have my own regular routine but I think it is a very individual thing, figuring out what muscles to target and what works for you. In fact, much of my routine is based on what I learned from a couple of rounds of physical therapy nearly 10 years ago. It only took a couple of months each time to figure out what I needed to be doing to meet specific goals. \n\nAs an example, one of my most useful exercises is a Lateral Walk With Resistance Band, which strengthens some of my hip muscles. I do not wear AFOs myself and while I think it would still be useful, I cannot swear that the AFOs would not be a problem. I am sure there are other variants of the same exercise that would work. \n\nBuilding muscle with CMT can be difficult but I can say from my own personal experience that it can be possible. I am in a program for people with conditions that cause muscle wasting. It is in Houston. But it is simple. It is personal training - mostly weight training. I have built muscle - even in my calves but I think that the ability for me to build in the lower leg is unusual. I work out 3x per week doing that and try to do some high intensity work outs (with lots of mods) on other days. One of the tricks is learning to modify what the ableds do and make it work for you. I do mountain climbers, for example, holding on to the foot of my iron bed so I am not on the ground. I do side jacks without jumping. I do lots of exercises standing between that iron bed and a high backed chair to have something to hold on to. This really helps for squats, step backs, that sort of thing. There are several trainers who have CMT. Look up Marc Daigle Fitness, Julie Stone with All Bodies Community  on Instagram and  on Instagram.  Some people report Ostarine as a breakthrough when it comes to muscle building. Sure enough it is worth a try. I appreciate your response. Have you seen the side effects to this stuff? I have, but I am not sure if they are faced by a large chunk of users - I think the percentile is rather scarce.\n\nI will be trying ostarine this year i think. Be careful with the stuff, Ostarine is certainly not a sports supplement and needs to be handled very carefully, from blood work all the way through checking your vendor is legitimate. Honestly, no one really has. The studies in phase II and phase III trials demonstrated a good tolerance at 1mg and 3mg doses in men and women, but the bodybuilding community uses doses \\~25mg. At that dose, the side effects are only anecdotal, and you would have to personally monitor your health to ensure safety. So basically you will not be able to build muscle for numerous reasons, the main ones being nerve death and inhibited HGH release. No exercise program or diet can fix this unfortunately. I have used it and other PEDs like it. Note it is a banned PED and not just a supplement. As with all PEDs it has to be done properly otherwise you can risk major health issues. It seems to me that Fasting, Intermittent Fasting, a ZERO sugar, zero processed foods, and for many a zero lectin diet that is based around eating grass fed and finished animal meat(especially the extremely nutrient dense organs) and fat can remedy a lot of symptoms of CMT. And getting out in the sun and getting Vitamin D is important for every one let alone people whos bodies are betraying them. I feel like my DI-CMT is genetic but brought on or exacerbated by 1) Nutrient deficient diet, 2) insulin resistance, 3) Leaky Gut disease, 4) Lectins and other plant toxins. 5)High Linoleic acid diet. I am a 21 yr male, diagnosed at 17 but had issues as a pre-teen. I have never eaten a healthy diet, I constantly ate sugary things  like sweets and tons of pop which resulted in me getting insulin resistance. When I fast for multiple days, I feel good. Fasting is a natural way to produce a lot of Growth hormone. Shockingly, high levels of insulin in your blood suppresses growth hormone production! Also, when you fast, for the first day or so you burn through whatever you last ate(glucose is stored in the liver until needed, kind of like your immediate fuel source); once your glucose gets used up your body turns to autophagy! For about a day or two you are body will eat up different junky pieces in your cells, it is like cellular recycling! But you do not do much autophagy unless you are fasting! (The autophagy could potentially help heal CMT, for example, some cmt is supposedly caused by a mutation in pmp22 that keeps misfolding proteins and they get clog up their pathways. The autophagy may help recycle those shitty pieces. Insulin is a \"regulatory hormone\", it suppresses lots of other hormones. It had multiple extremely important functions in our bodies, you can very easily become insulin resistant though! That means your body will not respond to insulin properly. It is like it gets broken. There are insulin receptors on most if not all cells. There could totally be some deeper mechanisms related to how often we eat, what we eat, and how well our bodies are working. Sleep, especially R.E.M. sleep, is important to production of myelin and probably lots of other things. As far as pain management, I use cannabis, high THC cannabis is useful for pain, especially emotional pain, CBD, the second most prominent cannabinoid in cannabis. It is anti-inflammatory and non-psychoactive, so it does not give you a high(that is what THC does) (beware other cannabinoids named similar things, they do not necessarily do similar things and not as much are known about them.) Lion's mane Mushrooms may help with production of myelin. But again I want to stress how important fasting, eating good nutrient dense animal and whole foods and avoiding shitty foods is (sugary stuff, polyunsaturated fat, Linoleic acid). Some good references for this stuff are Paul Saladino(carnivoreMd), Jason Fung(the fasting method) and just another little anecdote, at my first diagnosis I asked my doctor if my diet/lifestyle could have anything to do with it, without even asking me about my diet, he said no. He assured me that nothing I have done could have caused this. Let me ask you this, if you had mice in a lab and you never gave them the nutrients their species evolved eating, then you fed them junk foods made of sugar and useless carbs, and you kept them over fed, never making them fast, would you be surprised that some developed neuropathies? I would not be. And a SARM I have seen that seems like it could be helpful is LGD-4033, tho there are not long term studies.to my knowledge and some people had their testosterone plummit after using it which can cause a bunch of awful side effects So an interesting thing available to those wanting to increase growth hormone and IGF-1 would be to start taking Ibutamoren.  I have had great experiences with it and really enjoy it not only for HGH and IGF-1 perks, but I tend to have much better sleep and improved dreams.  It is a definite win for CMT1A IMHO.", "Alternative AFOs? So I have foot drop, drag my feet and always tripping. I got the Allard ToeOff Flow 2.5 but I think I am too rough on them. Plus they were very expensive, $2700 after insurance. My 3rd pair in 13 months is (replaced for free) is starting to break again (delaminate) after only 2 months.\n\nI work in Frozen Foods, on concrete for 9 hours a day. I think the 0\u00b0 floor is what is wearing the carbon fiber down so fast when I am in the back room.

I do not want the awkward stares and I also do not want to answer any questions. I know it is a silly thing. It looks comfy though, I will definitely consider these in the future. Maybe I can cover it with baggy and long pants.\n\nI really like the energy return in my current afo, it gives me a nice spring in my step. I totally understand the vanity aspect, I am 32 and the stares do bother me at times. I wear them under my hospital scrubs but in general they are on full view.\n\nIf you ever get the chance to try a pair on though, give them a quick test. The bounce and lift are amazing Thank you for your advice", "Are health specialists ignoring me/ what to do about it/ lumps in my leg? So I have had CMT since I was 3 and have been passed around different neurologists, physios, orthotists, OT's etc for much of my life. When I was 16-18, I was under one neurologist who is pretty high up within the neurology department so I believed I would be seeing someone who really knew their stuff. I had lots of issues with her, primarily that I felt she was ignoring a lot of crucial stuff I was mentioning. Notably, I had developed 2 lumps down the outside of my right calf, one at my knee and one at my ankle (I say lumps because after 6 years of investigation, no one knows what they could be). I think they are connected to the peroneal nerve and cause unbearable pain down the length of my leg. Being a teen, they were very flat lumps and I just sort of noticed them one day so thought I would mention it. I took me 3 attempts in that appointment with her to get her to even look at them. Nothing really happened as result though.\n\nFast forward to me now (22) and the lumps in my leg are pushing through my skin quite visibly and frequently cause significant swelling of my entire lower leg. There is this pain like my leg is being squeezed, it really is terrible. I cannot help but feel like if she had taken me more seriously when I was younger, we could have prevented them from getting to the size they are now or at least figure out what they are. I am back under the same neurologist today and spoke with her on the phone. I told her that these lumps were really unbearable and making it difficult to really do anything but she did not have much to say at all. In the same phone call, I mentioned the fact that I started to develop symptoms back in August/September last year that I believe are associated with cognitive fatigue (difficulty thinking, organising, memory is pretty bad etc) that have never ever been a problem for me. I expressed that it was impacting my life daily and academically but she just told me that everyone is struggling with memory at the moment due to Covid-19, and did not recognise that my problems started much earlier.\n\nI am kind of at a loss - I do not feel I am being taken seriously and it feels like my health is being left to worsen all it likes. I am not expecting a miracle cure and I definitely appreciate that healthcare is somewhat on hold at the moment, but I also understand the importance of early interventions and actively trying to prevent things from getting worse. I guess I am asking if anyone has experience with this and what to do about it? Of course I have seen lots of different specialists but ultimately I have been referred back to this person because she is the most specialist neurologist available. \\. \n\nTLDR - neurologist ignored 'lumps' on my leg when I was 16, at age 22 they are now huge/super painful. Also attributes new symptoms that started months ago to Covid-19 - how do I help myself most? You do not say if you know what type of CMT you have but I am not aware of any lumps like you describe having anything to do with CMT. Do you keep getting referred back to this neurologist for these lumps specifically? What do people say when they give that referral? It sounds to me like what you need is a different sort of specialist entirely. \n\nFatigue can be a symptom of CMT and physical fatigue can lead to mental fatigue but you only mention the cognitive side. That does seem like something else is going on and I am sorry this neurologist is not listening. You definitely need to find someone else to talk to. If anyone tries to refer you back to this person, request someone else. \n\nIt is tricky to get medical attention right now but perhaps you can find a way to do some telemedicine appointment to find someone who can help. Thanks for your reply. So I am told I have 1A though I nor anyone in my family has ever actually been tested. I am referred back to this neurologist overall I think, not specifically for the lumps. It seems I frequently see specialists who have no idea what to do with me as I am an 'interesting' (aka confusing and complicated) case so I am passed around and inevitably end up back with her again. I have mentioned that I also have a family history of MS which may be more appropriate given that I do not have the very obvious physical features of CMT like my family do. This neurologist has requested that I get tested for CMT but she explained that most tests come back negative and should be regarded as inconclusive. So if this was the case for me, she says we should still assume that I have CMT regardless. \n\nI am not 100% sure on the purpose of me posting. Essentially I feel very overwhelmed and that every day is a losing battle to my symptoms. I am at a point where perhaps reaching out to those within the community would be more beneficial for me than to reach out to health professionals. The test for CMT1A specifically is one of the oldest genetic tests available for patients, and has been refined over the years and is in fact quite reliable. If your family actually has a different variant it might be harder to catch but I would be very distrustful of a doctor that both told me that I had CMT1A specifically without giving a genetic test and also told me that genetic testing was unreliable. How do you even separate CMT1A from the other CMT1's without the genetic test? All the CMT1s have very similar symptoms. They only got subdivided into As and Bs and such after genetic testing allowed us to see that they have different root causes. Did you have the Nerve Conduction Test done? (that is the one where they stick electrodes on your legs and zap you)\n\nI would like to think that health professionals are a better resource than random people on the internet but I do not think you have been getting great care so far. If you are in the USA you might consider contacting a CMT Center of Excellence. I have heard very good things about them, though I have never been to one myself. That is mostly because I think it helps to know as much as possible about one's condition rather than addressing your immediate issue, though.\n\nThe lumps on your leg might be weird (as in, hard to diagnose) but I do not think they can be waved away as part of either CMT or MS, so you need to find a doctor interested in making an actual diagnosis of the problem which is causing you distress so that you can get the treatment you need and deserve. It is absolutely infuriating when dealing with such people, regardless of occupation. I am 3x your age and over that time I have learned a few things when it comes when it comes to looking out for oneself when the 'specialist' are not so special - regardless of career.\n\nYou are a customer. They are a hired contractor.  \nEven if they are 'the best' they may not be the best for you. If they ignore you, dismiss you, your questions, input, whatever. Speak up. Do not be rude. But definitely be firm. \n\nBefore you go into an appointment, ANY appointment, prepare.\nWell in advance of your next appointment, ANY appointment, ALWAYS write down your questions.   Your questions should be succinct, clear, to the point. Do not waist their time, Do not waste yours.\n\nYour questions should be orderly. Do not jump all around and then back again to Q 1. Go, Q1, q1a, q1b. Q2. q2a, q2b,...\n\nStart with the most important question on YOUR mind.\n\nWhen the meeting is coming to an end. YOU should summarize what was discussed. \n\nIf they stand up to leave before answering your questions, YOU REMAIN SITTING and say something to the effect, we have not finished, my question, issue, ... is still open.\n\nOn to what you can do. THINK!\n\nYou can and should get copies of EVERY test, report, image,...\nYou should get copies of every lab result before your next appointment. Ask, as in TELL,  the lab, tester, imaging office, whatever you want a copy of the report. Imaging, ask for a copy of each kind of image that was taken and for the report from each image.\n\nRead and know your lab work and other test before you go into the appointment. It is your responsibility to be your own medical advocate. And it is your best interest.\n\nIf your neuro is not, will not, look at or do, or whatever it is you would like them to look at, do, make an appointment with your primary care dr. Check your insurance if you need preauthorization.\n\nAs far as your lumps, visual exam by A doctor, does not have to be your Neuro. Then labs, and perhaps imaging. Perhaps biopsy. Take it all in order,.\n\nHope that helps a bit.\n\nGood Luck! I totally agree with what you have to say. When I was diagnosed aged 3/4, apparently a group of specialists (neuros, paeds, geneticists) did a physical exam of me and determined I had CMT 1A because this is the type my father has (he was diagnosed in the same way but in his 20's), so none of us have actually been tested, yet this diagnosis has never once been questioned until now by me. I have been referred for Nerve Conduction tests but that has been cancelled due to Covid-19 which is understandable. It seems that from talking to you, much of this should have been arranged by doctors when I was still young but for some reason it has not.\n\nUnfortunately I am in the UK and I do not think we have an equivalent of these centres. I have been to major hospitals in London though which is a very big deal for me but the conclusions determined and the level of care I received was not much better. It definitely seems like they do it differently in the US! I thoroughly enjoyed reading your reply, thank you. I have only just reached an age where I am beginning to be independent and no longer rely on parent support with healthcare issues. I am quickly realising that you are very right! I am living in the UK so not sure how it works regarding obtaining my imaging files. I certainly know there are a few MRI scans of mine floating around which have not been reported on yet. As for the lumps, they have been scanned a few times now but each person i.e. surgeons, neurologists, radiologists, have had very different opinions on what they might be. It does not seem that they are communicating between themselves about what could be the cause of them either. But I will certainly take your advice and make clear Qs/statements for each appointment I have. Thank you again for you advice, it was very much appreciated. You are welcome. I wish someone would have given me such advice when I was 22, or even 32. Just think, you got all that, FOR FREE!\n\nA few suggestions. Always take a notebook and pen or some digital note taking device to every important meeting. (Notice I did not say Doctor appointment. Regardless of what it is, school, interviews, business, ... get in the habit of note taking.)\n\nKeep a Master Notebook. Digital is preferred, many advantages, however, old school notebook and pen will always work. Record important info for important meetings.\nWho, What, When, Where, Why, Outcome, Questions.\n\nExcel works great for such a master record. You can create tabs for specific, people, projects, events, and you can easily search and share as you need, wish. Side note, as you most likely know, Always back up. I do not use the cloud, too dangerous. Lets everyone put all our money in one place so the criminals can get to to it faster and easier! NOT!\n\nYour lumps. It is up to you to, DRIVE the issue forward, YOU are your best medical Advocate. You know THEY are not doing it, sooooo .....\n\nAsk, as in TELL, The lumps have been examined by Dr. Who, on this date, Dr. Strange on this date. Dr. No on this date and we are no closer to a diagnosis. It is time to move to the next step. If they can not agree on a diagnosis it sounds like the logical next step would be a more thorough assessment. A biopsy. If not a biopsy, why not? What do you suggest? \n\nIn other words, you have to drive your own bus!\n\nGood luck! I am sorry you are being ignored. One of the top neuros at an MDA Clinic near me had to be reported for how he treated me, so I feel your pain, literally and figuratively.\n\nIf a doctor keeps brushing you off, see a new doctor. It is unacceptable for this doctor to at least not refer you out to someone if they do not know what to do with an issue. If these lumps are causing swelling then you need them to be seen immediately. I am appalled for you that you have been ignored for so long. Unfortunately, there are some real shit doctors out there. I was misdiagnosed or brushed off by doctors until I was in my mid-twenties. Now, I am still brushed off by some but I have a diagnosis.\n\nAs for the fatigue, that is one of the most common CMT symptoms for your type (I also have 1a). My neuro prescribed me low-dose Ritalin as a stimulant  for the bad fatigue days. I am not a fan of drugs but the fatigue gets so bad that I feel like I do not even have energy to breathe some days. I cut them in quarters and have zero side effects. It helps so much. And I take them as needed so I only need to fill the prescription a couple times a year. My CMT gives me horrible POTS/dysautonomia and that is the most debilitating of all my CMT symptoms and it is what puts me in a wheelchair even though I am ambulatory.\n\nGood luck. I hope you find answers ASAP.", "CMT 1A and rapidly feel worse Hey all! I know all of our experiences are going to be different but I was wondering if anyone else suddenly feels worse than before as far as symptoms? I am 37 and in the last year, but particularly the last 6 months, I feel as though I  getting \u201cworse\u201d rapidly. Mostly-my hands feel much weaker and as if my foot drop is getting more pronounced. While I used to be able to wear sandals or other non-CMT footwear, I feel like I am constantly going to trip and that\nmy feet (particularly my right foot) are \u201cdead.\u201d I have gained some weight recently, too-so maybe that does not help lol. I am not even sure what I am asking at this point-but I guess just venting that I suddenly feel like I have CMT when I have otherwise been able to be in denial. I guess I have to face reality of my future! :( I am 37 also and the past 4 years I have felt like I am getting a lot weaker. Do what you can to keep the weight down... your body will thank you. And lol you could wear sandles? God those made me trip when I did not have CMT. Maybe the rapid worsening of symptoms could be related to some food or activity that is aggravating your CMT.  My CMTX symptoms got a lot worse when I was eating (and drinking) anything with nutrasweet, an artificial sweetener.  My symptoms also got worse when I was over-exercising.  When I gave those things up, I got a bit stronger and more stable.\nGood luck to you as you adjust to the changes CMT makes in your body.  It is a tough transition to recognize that you are disabled. It got easier for me over time. This is so true! I changed my diet to include more protein and noticed a huge difference. I am 25 with 1A, and I too get random spurts of symptoms worsening. It does not seem to be a slow build so much as sudden thing that will change, or it will be so subtle that I will not notice it until it becomes bad enough to be noticed. My feet are partially numb and most recently, my ankles have begun to weaken to near uselessness and I fear not being able to fix them on my own. Cannot wear flip flops anymore because I can hardly move my toes to hold onto them and I just walk right out of them lmao. It is very scary to watch as abilities just vanish before your eyes. \ud83d\ude43 Yes! I think it is just that I ignore the little symptoms until it is a much bigger one.  And lol on flip flops! I cannot stand anything between my toes lol. And I think with how pronounced my foot drop has become-I am scared! Thank you for your reply! thank you for your reply! I think you made some great points. the only thing that is really changed is my employment-I am working full time on my feet. And I know not getting enough sleep really makes a big difference. I will see if I notice anything else. I was actually filling out some paperwork and it asked about being disabled and it gave me pause-as I do not know how much longer I will be non-disabled. (A little dramatic, lol). Yes-working on the weight now lol. And I know with the sandals! I cannot walk for long in them-I felt like I could not walk. Ugh. I appreciate your words-I need to really remember them! Have you tried trying to the gym and improving the strength of those muscles giving you problems? I have not and I do not know why I did not think of this. I am on my feet a lot and I feel it from my shin into my ankle-or have a lack of feeling. I will definitely look into some ways to strengthen that area. Thank you for the suggestion! I totally understand. I also have felt that and asked my doctor why. \n\nHe responded with: Nerves have plateaus, so even though things feel like they are getting worse all of a sudden it is not fully the case in sense of the nerves themselves. The rest of your body is just catching up. \n\nSince nerves deteriorate at normally such a small pace with CMT your symptoms your feeling can be great for a bit but then can feel like they are hitting all at once because the nerves have past that point that your muscles cannot keep going or the information is not getting there anymore. \n\nI hope I explained it as well as the doctor did for me. I hope it helps. That makes so much sense! Thank you for taking the time to type it out! It gives me a different perspective! My Cmt went from manageable to completely unbearable in a span of about 3 years. I thought I could do only 1 foot and be good. Daily pain that opiates did not really touch so I cannot recommend surgery more! This is how I first was diagnosed. I gained about 30lbs and I broke my fifth metatarsal by just walking with flip flops. The nurse did not believe that I could just break a bone by just walking. And I am not a heavy person. I was only 180 at the time. So after a bunch of x-rays, EEG, and blood tests I was diagnosed at the age of 15. Now at 32 I am finally finished with surgery! Keep that weight down! Quality of life is better in almost every way if you are not overweight. \"Beauty at any size\" is not good for anyone.  Obesity is bad in all situations, I do not care if I get downvoted, it is 100% true. Lol... nah I agree 100% My pt and doctors and orthopedist growing up had no qualms with telling me to stay light in the weight department. I am very blunt when people ask what to do when their feet and legs hurt... because that is how I was raised. I always follow up with \"sorry if I was blunt and rude... just what doctors always told me.\"", "freaked out My CMT has gotten a lot worse in the last year. Before I did not even know I had it. I got diagnosed because I had sudden nerve pain and numbness.  My family has 1A.\nIn the last year I have lost all the muscle between my toes and the muscles between my fingers are starting to waste.  My calf muscles so far are fairly normal and I do not have foot drop.\nI am concerned by my fast progress, especially that my swallowing or lungs could be affected.\nAny thoughts? I went to a CMT clinic a couple months ago but I think I have gotten worse (especially with my hands) since then. Previous studies have shown that CMT1A progress slowly over time. There is some evidence that indicate that the rate of progression increase with age, however as far as I am aware, it has yet to be verified in a large cohort. If you want to monitor your own disease progression because you fear that you are progressing faster than what is normal, you can ask your neurologist if he/she can help you do a CMT neuropathy score (CMTNS). If you do this once a year, after a few years it will give you some reliable data points about your progression that you can compare to longitudinal studies on CMT1A disease progression that are using the same score. \n\nKeep in mind that if you do progress faster than normal, it could be because 1) You have modifier genes or other unique characteristics within your physiology that affect your progression, or 2) Your're exposed to something that worsen your symptoms or underlying disease, or 3) You have something else than CMT 1A (unlikely with a family history of 1A).\n\nYou should try to rule out number two as much as possible. If you have been taking any drugs, check if they are known to be neurotoxic. Make sure you are not being exposed to things like mercury, lead, mold, laughing gas, non-pasteurised foods that might contain toxin producing bacteria etc. Make sure you get enough nutrients by eating a varied diet.\n\nCould you explain the symptom you are experiencing with your fingers and toes? Because we do not have any muscles in our fingers and toes, if you are experiencing a decreased circumference of your fingers (If I understand your description correctly), it is difficult to relate that to a loss of strenght in the muscles of the hands. Why should nitrous oxide be avoided? Exposure to N2O should be avoided because it can induce vitamin B12 deficiency or worsen an otherwise mild deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with myelin damage, and although as far as I know there are no described cases of people with CMT and very low B12 levels, it is likely that any myelin damage caused by low B12 in a CMT patient would not heal properly.\n\nI would advice anyone with CMT who know they are going to be exposed to N2O (such as mothers giving birth, fathers assisting during birth (a lot of the gas is exhaled unchanged increasing concentrations in the room), doctors or nurses working in maternity units where laughing gas is used, dental workers, anyong having surgery or dental work, etc) to check their B12 levels before exposing them selves to laughing gas, to make sure they do not expose them selves if they have low B12 levels.\n\nRecreational use should obviously be avoided by people with CMT.\n\nVegetarians are especially at risk of not getting enough B12 in their diet, and so people with CMT who are vegetarians should be extra adamant about this issue.\n\nSome more information here:\n\n\n\n ##Vitamin B12 deficiency\nVitamin B12 deficiency is the medical condition of low blood levels of vitamin B12. A wide variety of signs and symptoms may occur including a decreased ability to think and behavioural and emotional changes such as depression, irritability, and psychosis. Abnormal sensations, changes in reflexes, and poor muscle function can also occur as may inflammation of the tongue, decreased taste, low red blood cells, reduced heart function, and decreased fertility. In young children symptoms include poor growth, poor development, and difficulties with movement.\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ( ^| ( ^| (   ^] thanks for the thorough reply.\nI have muscle wasting in the small muscles of the hands, not in the fingers themselves.  and in the small muscles on the foot.  I believe that is what they are called.\n\n^ not actually my foot but notice how her tendons stand out? that is my issue footwise, and has developed this year along with moderate hammer toes. I have always had the high arches.\n\nI do not believe I take any neurotoxic drugs. I have gone down that list and checked in with the CMT clinic nearby.  I have felt paranoid about my apartment but I really do not think there is anything toxic lurking.\n\n Those are typical symptoms for 1A though; I have the same thing. High arches, hammertoes, visible tendons just like the picture. I also have reduced sensation in my big toes. For me it is been gradually worsening over many years though. \n\nHave you noticed any other symptoms besides those you have mentioned? Most external factors that have the potential to worsen CMT will also have other side effects. \n\nThe only way to really know if you are getting worse at an abnormal rate is to track it. If you do the CMTNS, the EMG results (CMAP+SAP) are also good indicators on their own.  Just curios here, did you/anyone in family have diagnosis confirmed with genetic testing? mom and sister both have tested positive for CMT1A so far. My test is now in progress.  Pretty sure I have the mutation (though i could have something else too) I am assuming you have seen a neurologist?\n\nMy mom and I have CMTx. She had no symptoms, then she was like 30, she suddenly had numbness and weakness, and it hit very very quickly. It was way more severe than what you are describing for yourself. Neurologists kept telling her it was just the CMT and that something must have \"set it off\" per say.\n\nShe ended up going to the CMT clinic, that at the time, was in Detroit. The doctor there thought it could be an auto immune disease called CIDP, they started treatment, and it worked.\n\nI am not saying you have CIDP/GBS, but it is very possible to have multiple neurological issues.", "Vaccines and CMT? Are we really supposed to believe that injecting neurotoxins into a patient with neurological degeneration is safe? I do not think this is the place to be discussing this. Yup, because there is a WHOLE list of medications that they tell CMT patients not to use, most of which are chemotherapy drugs. So clearly, the physicians associated with CMTA are not afraid to tell us not to take lifesaving drugs that also net WAY more profit for pharmaceutical companies. They would tell us if we could not take vaccines.\n\nGet allllll the way out of here with the anti-vax BS. Even if you were correct (and if you pull up any peer-reviewed research on the topic, no mommy blogs or InfoWars, you can rest assured you are wrong), better alive with slightly worse CMT than dead of measles. Never heard about the chemo thing, what is up with that? Not an anti-vax here, but my doctor also told me to be careful with vaccines and CMT. yes, stop being stupid.  Vaccines are safe and helpful to everyone. Yes. Yes, we are. \n\n\n\nYou get more exposure from eating a pear or a can of tuna than your one or two injections. Except the pear will not keep you from dying of polio. Some chemotherapy drugs such as Vincristine and others have been shown to exacerbate peripheral neuropathy. Patients who have CMT who have received these drugs have seen their CMT significantly worsen after administration. Therefore these drugs are contraindicative for people with CMT. CMTA and other CMT patient advocacy organizations maintain lists of all known medications that are ( Doctors are often but not always aware of all the contraindications of a particular drug, and they are trained to check this before a drug is administered to a patient, but it is also a very good idea to keep this in mind as a patient and also independently verify that a new drug you are going to get is not on that list. My mother who had CMT 1A had to recieve Cisplatin some years ago, which is in the \"moderate to Significant Risk\" category. But it was decided that the potential benefits (killing cancer) was more important than the side-effect (worsening the CMT). So in some cases when there is no alternatives a decision has to be made. But some times there are safe alternatives to the neurotoxic drugs, hence why it is important to be aware of this listfor both the doctors and the patients with CMT. Yes. I did a quick search of research papers for \"vaccine\" or \"vaccination\" with \"Charcot-Marie-Tooth\" and found two papers:\n\n( is from 1989, where a previously undiagnosed boy developed symptoms and was diagnosed with CMT after a smallpox vaccine. This vaccine is incredibly uncommon nowadays, so this is not a worry.\n\n( is from 2010, where a child developed symptoms after a DTaP vaccination and was diagnosed with CMT2. This is the only paper I could find on this, so this event is extremely unlikely. A single case has been reported, out of everyone who has been vaccinated. \n\nSo that is it. Since 1989, there have been two cases where a vaccine brought out symptoms in a person with CMT. Two cases out of the billions of people vaccinated in 31 years. Your risk is ridiculously low. Same Eating a pear and a can of tuna is also completely different from injecting the isolated neurotoxin among other toxins into one\u2019s body. Is there a possibility that there have been more cases of adverse side effects that were not reported? Why the downvotes? I was vaccinated as a child, asked my GP about yearly flu shots a few years ago, and was told it was not recommended. I cannot remember the reasoning given for it, and it was not important enough to follow up. Except the pear and tuna will not cause Guillain-Barre Syndrome :) Not likely. Doctors like to write papers. They get prestige from it, as well as boosting the knowledge of the entire field. If they saw the effects, they would want to write a paper about it. Care to elaborate on how it is different? Disagree. This is a nice public place where others who possibly share this concern can come and see a lot of comments explaining why everyone should be vaccinated. Personally, I have never been told this by my doctor, nor has anyone in my family. We get flu shots every year. \n\nWithout even knowing what reasoning a doctor could have for saying this it is just vague fear-mongering. Perhaps there is something specific to your case, your type of CMT, or perhaps your doctor was confused. No way to check with only this to go on. I wish we did not have to discuss it here but if people are concerned I am glad to see that so much of the community here has a firm grasp on science and can address why vaccines are safe and valuable. Since they brought up polio, let us focus on that one. When we ingest a can of tuna or a pear, we are not intramuscularly absorbing isolated components of eagle MEM modified medium, calf bovine serum, M-199 without calf bovine serum, vero cells (a continuous line of monkey kidney cells), phenoxyethanol, formaldehyde, neomycin, streptomycin, and polymyxin B. When we ingest a can of tuna or a pear, we are not intramuscularly consuming a cocktail of concentrated animal derivatives, allergy irritants, antibiotics, and human toxins. Just because a few of the ingredients are found in commonly consumed items, does not mean they are not harmful to some people. In fact it has been suggested that people with neurological conditions may benefit from avoiding products and foods that contain preservatives and neurotoxins. I personally do not consume non-organic produce or canned foods. There is also the synthetic vs non-synthetic component, many vaccines contain synthetically manufactured toxins whereas in consumables they may be naturally occurring. I just want the \"oh no, it is retarded\" dog in response. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have reached the point of listing the ingredients of one like they are scary (oh no, not formaldehyde), whilst minimising the potentially scary sounding bits in the pear. You have extended \"ones injected and ones swallowed\" without really adding anything that actually supports your position. You are perfectly embodying the general anti vax talking points.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; In fact it has been suggested that people with neurological conditions may benefit from avoiding products and foods that contain preservatives and neurotoxins.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year on here, there was someone fiercely suggesting people with neurological conditions should fast to induce remylenation. There is lots of stupid things suggested by unnamed source. Before that, it was suggested we all mega dose on vit c. Give us something more than just \"it is suggested\".   \n\n\nYou keep up your organic diet, and I will stick to vaccines. I have had one relative told to be cautious about the flu shot by the neuro. It made sense, given the treatment from said neuro was an immune therapy and the advice was \"we do not really know how it interacts, in theory it should be fine, just watch out for worsening\". They always give a reason. Not just \"be careful\". Yes, if you have a known immunological problem, that is a whole different story from someone who only has CMT. In fact, folks who have immune problems are part of the reason why it is important for everyone else to get the flu shot and other vaccines, to protect them through herd immunity. This is not an argument, it is just a salad of scary looking words. Exactly. But the other key thing, every half way competent doctor has given a solid explanation for \\*why\\* something could be a problem. In this specific case, it got to the level of \"this vaccine causes an X cell response, so should be fine since you are on Y cell treatment; this one is fine when you are not being treated but not during treatment; this uses live culture so avoid\". It is never left at just watch out for shots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nETA: derp, new account. I am the one with CMT and spouse with MS. So, neuro condition treated by creating immuno condition. Given how often MS info get's appropriated (poorly) to CMT, it comes up... You asked if I cared to elaborate on how the injection of a vaccine differs from the consumption of a can of tuna or pear and I simply did just that. Nothing I said was factually inaccurate. Yes I listed the ingredients in the polio vaccine because aside from one being injected and one swallowed (which is already absorbed and broken down differently hence why vaccines are not orally administered) the polio vaccine cocktail of ingredients are not found in produce or canned fish. I am merely exploring the possibility that injecting neurotoxins may have negative affects on someone with a neurodegenerative disease such as CMT. \n\nIt is common knowledge that consuming foods that are ridden with preservative and neurotoxins can be harmful to the human body. \n\nAs far as fasting, I suggest you look into intermittent fasting. There is a phenomenal study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that explains how fasting reduces inflammation, helps clear out toxins and damaged cells. Will fasting induce remylenation in CMT patients? Neither of us have the answer to that because there have been no studies. However, there have been studies on the role of fasting in relation to multiple sclerosis, one study found mice that fasted every other day were less likely to develop signs of neurological damage such as difficulty walking, limb weakness, and paralysis. \n\nAnd to touch on your point about \u201cmega dosing\u201d vitamin c, there was actually a study conducted on the effects of high dose vitamin C in CMT patients, In 2004, it was reported that ascorbic acid reduced the severity of neuropathy in transgenic mice overexpressing PMP22, an animal model of human CMT1A, compared with untreated mice. Though the human trials did not exert the same results, there were discrepancies in the study involving how the vitamin C was administered, \u201c As oral vitamin C produces plasma concentrations that are tightly controlled, only intravenous administration of vitamin C produces high plasma and urine concentrations that might exert supranutritional health effects\u201d. \n\nYou are clearly here to argue which I refuse to further engage in. \n\nGood day. \\&gt; You asked if I .\n\nNixye and I are not the same person. Good start here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;cared to elaborate on how the injection of a vaccine differs from the consumption of a can of tuna or pear and I simply did just that\n\nBut you did not. Well, you only did in so far as you said one is a shot and the other food, but that really did not add to the conversation. Everything around that was, to quote, \" salad of scary looking words \".\n\nShould I dig up the thread where everyone broke down how irrelevant that NEJM article was? Either Nixye or pmp22 went in to a lot of detail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the vit C bit, I am aware of the study. The frustration was telling people to act on mice models, which do not translate to humans well enough to skip every other bit of the medical research process. The flu will however give you GBS more often than the flu shot.  I have been a reddit user for approximately 2 weeks forgive me pressing the wrong reply button. \n\nAre you implying that you trust the validity of A Reddit thread over an accredited medical journal, also validated by Harvard doctors with multidisciplinary degrees in public health? \nInteresting. \n\nYes mice have the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid, whereas humans do not. However the discrepancy in the studies were mainly accredited to the medium of administration. \n\nPerhaps if you were to make simple lifestyle changes such as avoiding consumables containing preservatives and toxins, you may see an improvement in nerve function as well as cognitive function. I am not calling you out for pressing the wrong reply button. I am pointing out that you responded to Nixye's post whilst attributing the things I said to him as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Are you implying that you trust the validity of A Reddit thread over an accredited medical journal, also validated by Harvard doctors with multidisciplinary degrees in public health? Interesting.\n\nNo. I was (apparently erroneously) assuming you were smart enough to understand someone explaining why the research does not apply to us. The research is fine, the problem is the unfounded leaps the... optimistic lay person... makes with the research. You know what they say about assumptions. Yeah, totally. What would \"watch out for this\" even mean, without a reason? If I do not know what I am watching out FOR I am just twitchy now, not very useful. I most certainly did not ask you anything. That you did not notice I was not the person who asked a question pretty much sums up your level of attention to detail. \n\nAlso, you are not \"exploring\" anything. You are listing words which seem ominous. You are not researching scientific literature and finding out how and why things work, you are recycling old anti-vax arguments you read on some forum or another. I have a degree in molecular biology and I do quite a bit of scientific journal reading, I can tell the difference. \n\nI do think the fasting thing is mildly interesting. Not that it is particularly relevant, but I think it is worthy of study, if only to elucidate the exact mechanics of the cellular processes involved. The chances that it will help CMT'ers are remote, but it is a worthy subject of research nonetheless. \n\nThe rise and fall of the Vitamin C hypothesis wrt CMT treatment should be a lesson to us all in how science advances, and how initially promising ideas do not always pan out. \n\nFinally, I think it is pretty funny that you are \"not here to argue\" when as far as I can tell there is little other reason for you to have started this thread \\*except\\* to argue. Like I said as a two week reddit user forgive me for selecting the wrong reply button. \n\nYou have been here for six years. \n\nYour only argument is that my response is a...\n\nWhat were your words? \u201cA salad of scary looking words\u201d? \n\nFor someone with a degree in molecular biology I would hope your vocabulary would be slightly more sophisticated. How else am I supposed to respond when you did not make a coherent argument? I have had more than the usual number of vaccines throughout my life due to traveling. No affect on CMT symptoms. But other people's anecdotes should not be the deciding factor, scientific consensus should be. According to CMT experts (neurologists and researchers who study CMT): \"There is no medical evidence to suggest that any vaccine, including the flu shot, would be inadvisable for a patient on account of his/her CMT.\"  \u201cWhile there is no evidence that vaccines affect the CMT genes directly, the issue has not been studied.  When an immune attack on nerves is triggered in a CMT patient, any nerve damage may add to the underlying neuropathy.\u201d \n\nI know someone who has had significantly increased neuropathy and rapid progression after receiving the meningococcal vaccine as a child, and it was not reported by the patient or the patients family. The doctor and neurologists the patient was being seen by had very little knowledge on CMT at the time. \n\nIf it cannot be disproven, it is not scientific. As the website you linked mentions, \u201cthe issue has not been studied\u201d. Therefore neither you or I can make conclusions about this topic based on scientific consensus. Thus why I am asking individuals to share their experiences. Find a more sophisticated way of calling someone an idiot? \n\nGo through line by and point out exactly how it makes no sense? I do not know about neurotoxins, but many vaccines have been associated with edge cases where people experience demyelinization. In the peripheral nerves, this would produce symptoms like CMT1. (See \"The spectrum of post-vaccination inflammatory CNS demyelinating syndromes\" by ( and\u00a0( PMID: 24514081 DOI: ( \n\nSince CMT itself is not all that well understood and is frequently not diagnosed to a genetic cause (or at all) \u2014 and it can be caused (or have similar symptoms caused) by pharmaceuticals \u2014 it is possible there is some higher risk associated with vaccines for some people with CMT or conditions predisposing them to some type of neuropathy. That is purely speculative and poorly reasoned. \"If they saw the effects\" is a big filter, and there are plenty of disincentives to doing this kind of research as well. CMT is an umbrella category of neuromuscular diseases among a larger set of neuromuscular diseases that are often idiopathic. If a particular vaccine or anything else was quickly followed by the onset of new symptoms in a lot of people, yes this would be noticed and studied, but not if the apparent connection is obscured and relatively rare. Your entire comment boils down to 'There could be effects we do not know about'. This is true. I cannot prove a negative, but there is no evidence of the positive, i.e. that vaccines have a negative effects on people with CMT. \n\nAll the evidence we have indicates that vaccines are safe and beneficial for the vast majority of people, including those with CMT. The paper you have linked specifically addresses vaccines and the Central Nervous System (CNS), but CMT is a disease of the Peripheral Nervous System. PMP22, the protein that is overexpressed in CMT Type 1A, is expressed in the cells that make the PNS myelin (Schwann cells) but not in the cells that make the CNS myelin (oligodendrocytes). From that example alone, we can see that diseases that demyelinate the CNS may have different effects on the PNS.\n\nAgain, while it is possible that vaccines could cause an adverse reaction for people with CMT, **we have no evidence of that happening** on a systemic level. I was raised by anti-vax parents, and was not administered most of my vaccines as a kid. My parents think I had one dose of TDaP. Never had the MMR or flu shots. My parents stopped vaccinating by the time my younger siblings came along. \n\nMy siblings eventually cought whooping cough (pertussis). It was absolutely horrible, ending in chronic lung problems for all of them. I would not wish that nightmare on anyone. Watching my siblings struggle to breath is among the worst memories of my childhood. I was the only (partially) vaccinated one, and the only one protected and spared this misery. I did not have all the doses (if my parents are correct), but apparently I had enough antibodies to keep me safe.\n\nMy siblings and I got ourselves fully vaccinated as adults, and we are major proponents of vaccinating after experiencing preventable disease first hand. This meant many shots for me in a short period of time in college. I have CMT1a as does one of my brothers. We saw no changes to our CMT following vaccination. Though, even if things had progressed, I would accept more neuropathy for protection from these preventable diseases. The potential damage from the diseases themselves is worse.", "Stomach problems and nausea Hi People, \n\nI was diagnosed CMT1A since I was 3 years old. My legs started to deform when I was 10 years old, but as this dissease is in our family I learned to live with it and dind't really mean a decreased quality of life.\n\nI am now 38 years old and around 7 years ago I started to have some strange problems with my stomach. It all started when my first son was born. I stayed up several days whole night with my wife as he was crying. One day when I woke up I felt suddenly nausea like before vomitting. I was  dizzy and felt like my heart skipped a beat. I went to the emergency, they said I had a panic attack.\n\nAfter this experience, I started to have these problems regulary several times a month. Strange thing was the major symptoms has dissapeared the next day, only what stayed was stomach problems. The aproximate process has the following flow (although it slightly varries): \n\n* first I start to feel the nausea /diziness\n* than I start to rapidly yawn for several minutes\n* my stomach turns upside, down \n* I have to go to the toilette several times in few hours (have a flex stool) \n* occasually (not always) my heart skips 1, 2 beats\n* occasually I have a very short vertigo moment, such as that I nearly fell down, but in the last moment I always gain back my balance, so never fellt like really on the floor\n* oft it happens in the morning after I wake up\n\nOnce I am able to get  sleep the next day it feels much better. What stays for longer time are the problems with my stomach. It feels weird for several days, sometimes hurts a bit, I do not have any appetite, although I try to force myself to eat something. Unless doing so sometimes I start to shake and have I guess low sugar attack kind of and suddenly feel a huge hunger from one moment to another.  Than I focus eating healthy getting enough sleep, and after 1, 2 week all the problems dissapear.\n\nOf course I went to see a doctor, did all the checks, and final diagnosis:  Indigestion alias dyspepsia and too much stomach acid. As this went on for several years, symptoms got worse as I have developed also panic attacks. But thanks help of my wife and family I went to see a psychotherapist and managed get the panic attacks under controll. \n\nBut the original problem with my stomach keep comming back and dissapear, for as long as 7 years. Sometimes there are 3-4 months when I am symptom free, but than the problems comes back suddenly. \n\nThan I thought prehaps it could be somehow connected to my CMT1A, so that is why I would like to ask you if anybody had a similar problems or could give me a  tip what to do. \n\n&amp;#x200B; I do not know the answer.\n\nI gather CMT only impacts the peripheral nervous system. I wonder if these nerves service the stomach (I do not think so).\n\nI have read a great deal about the stomach being \u2018the second brain\u2019 - it even has neurons in it. How the digestive system works is connected to our brains and how we think and feel - stress levels, anxiety and so on. \n\nI wish you all the best!  The stomach actually is innervated by the peripheral nervous system. I am not entirely sure how CMT1A effects would manifest here, but it could be impairing the ability of your stomach to push food into your digestive system.\n\nI do not know if it will help any, but I found this forum thread from a few years ago including several people with similar stomach issues:  I am sorry this is happening to you. Stomach issues are not something I have heard associated with CMT, butI know there is one type that affects breathing and the diaphragm. I wonder if you might have that type? Wishing you the best. Thank you for the wishes and the forum link. I am checking it. If I find out more will post it here.  Just looking at the symptoms it all seems to point to the vagus nerve to me, but I am not a doctor so take my opinions with bags of salt. \nPanic attacks and Indigestion are typically diagnoses that are given when the underlying cause is not clear, they are basically just describing the symptoms and nothing more. It is also important to remember that the symptoms could be caused by something other than CMT, but without a proper diagnosis it is impossible to tell. If the cause is CMT, and it is neurological, it could be difficult to diagnose accurately, however If I were you I would keep pushing for a better diagnosis. If you have the time and the money and you have not already done so, I would seriously consider getting a CMT Evaluation by Michael E. Shy at the CMT Clinic at the University of Iowa. If that is not possible, then at least I think you should bring it up with a neurologist who have some knowledge about CMT, just in case (s)he thinks that your presentation warrants further testing.", "What are small items to add around the house to improve quality of life I came across this thread in r/homeimprovement a few weeks ago and meant to ask the mods if it would be ok to post the link here.

It is like an instant little pick me up when my feet walk over those and I do not even have that much sensation in them Music, warm socks, books. Sounds great! Just taking a wild guess here, but I am guessing you do not depend on a walker or rollator to get around? I would LOVE to put some area rugs down, just for the reason you mentioned. However, being TOTALLY dependent on a rollator just to move about, rugs are like being stuck in a muddy bog. I have to work harder to just move. Not currently no. I have a lot more pain and sensation related issues than mobility at the moment. Do the tighter woven rugs give the same issue? Jar opener and a key turner. These help me a lot. Oh, and grab bars everywhere, falling down is not fun. I have some Adidas Slides that I wear around the house. Really comfortable and help  when I have to stand for awhile, like when cooking.  \n\n\nNot these exactly but similar  \n( In my experience, any rug, tightly woven, indoor/outdoor, berber, low-pile, ... For me, it is like going into an immediate crawl. I, too, have a lot of pain related issues and carpet just seems to make it worse as my muscles have to work harder. I also use a cane in addition to a rollator. The cane is to assist in forward momentum when my legs are too tired, week, to generate the necessary strength, such as going up even a slight incline. Those look super comfy! How do you keep them on? I have drop-foot in both feet and cannot even keep socks from working their way off. I have some super comfy slippers I got at Costco a few years ago, slide-ons, but, alas, anymore it is just impossible to keep them on my feet and more often than not, I end up tripping and or falling. Ahh, I think my case of drop foot is less severe, so while they slide off a bit I can wear them pretty easily throughout the day.   \n\n\nPerhaps something like this with a foot strap might be more useful, but I am not sure how your hand dexterity is and if they would be difficult to get on. (Note, I have not tried these) (  \n\n\nI hear you on the comfy slippers, for me the slides had thicker padding on the bottom, which was great for the high arches. I end up wearing through a pair of slipped in a couple weeks lol. I second this! I use similar ones both at home and at work. \n\nThey provide some insulation from the floor, as well as some cushioning if you have hard floors. And they provide a little bit more grip than socks.  It is worth it to buy the brand name ones over cheap ones in my experience. I am not sure I know what a jar opener is. I am envisioning a round piece of rubberish material that fits over lids and makes it easier to grip a lid? A key turner? That, too, is new to me! WOW! Those look excellent! They would probably even help keep my sock on! Now, I have to see if they come in Sasquatch size. 13/14, 4 Wide! You can use Google image to find the pictures. \"Jar opener\", the one with the crank handle is the one I use. The \"key turner\" I use is the one with the blue curved handle and holds two keys. My sister got them for me a few months ago from Amazon, I think. Sorry I do not know how to create a link. I use a shower chair for my own safety and 3 suction cup handles in the shower. Regular cushioned house slippers for my hammer toes that are developing. A good pair of warm slippers or warm socks, depending on how much you are looking to spend. An electric heating pad, big enough for both feet. Soft drink bottle opener, a can opener with a ring puller (mine's a combo with a drink bottle opener), an adjustable jar opener. May I add my current favorite are the small faux fur throws in Bed Bath and Beyond? We are not talking cheetah print, these are faux WOLF, and I watched a \u201cmaking of Game of Thrones\u201d documentary where the costumers used little rugs JUST like this to make some of the Wildlings\u2019 costumes. I feel like a Jarl Viking Queen every time I swing my legs out of bed and stand up! So, this is just a dohickey I discovered on some Buzzfeed stocking stuffer list last year, now I buy one for all my friends that wear glasses. They are called Peeps and they replace disposable alcohol glasses cleaner wipes. It is a little bigger than a lighter, and when you pull them out, they are shaped a bit like bbq tongs with felt pads on the inside. Kind Of clamp and swirl around the lense, and when you put the \u201ctongs\u201d away, the pads get cleaned for next use.\n\nAlso I LOVE... um... I do not know what it is called. My friend makes them, like a tube sock filled with jasmine rice and herbs, and you can microwave for 30 sec to get hot, then drape around your neck, or stick in the freezer. I carry all my weight in my neck and shoulders so this is the best. \n\nTennis balls. Surprisingly useful. Cut a small hole in one, stick your toothbrush handle in, and it is SO much easier to hold. Use as door stops to keep from scuffing where the knob hits, pad corners you constantly knock into/make yourself more aware of.\n\nAn Echo Dot!!! Worth the money! I have an echo in my room and have my TV and various lamps plugged in through smart plugs. If I am reading in bed and ready to sleep, I just say, \u201cAlexa, I am ready for bed!\u201d and she turns everything off for me. I can also play music from my phone through my Dot, listen to the radio, get questions answered, etc etc.\n\nExtra grab bars in AND getting out of the shower. Just make sure to use a stud finder when installing. Throw rugs are dangerous for me, since I have toe drop. The edges of the rugs are a tripping hazard. Those faux fur throws sound like just the thing for beside the bed!\n\nAre any of these the one you are referencing?\n\n( I can feel for ya! I cannot seem to find a happy middle-ground.\n\nHard floors are easy for the rollator but OMG do they hurt my feet!\n\nAnd carpeted floors feel wonderful on my feet but my feet, legs, rollator have to work harder to go slower because of the drag created by the rug!\n\nThere does not seem to be a happy middle-ground that I have yet to find.\n\nI am open to suggestions! i found these 2 items on google - are they close to what you are referencing? Both look ideal for anyone - CMT or not. Perfect gifts or treats for oneself!\n\n\n(\n\n\n( I am looking for a shower chair. Any recommendations? What should I look for? Avoid? Any particular location have the best prices? AND, do you know if Medicare will cover the cost of such aids?\n\nAlso looking for a vertical shower-head holder so the shower head can be moved up or down based on the preference of the person using the showerchair?  Again, any recommendations? Look for? Avoid? &gt; A good pair of warm slippers or warm socks, depending on how much you are looking to spend.\n\nWhat do you consider a 'good pair' and how much should we be looking to spend for a 'good pair'? WOW you are full of ideas! I Googled Peeps and came up with the marsh mellow chicks for Easter. Had to add lens cleaner to the search and came up with this. Any of these close? (\n\n\n&gt;a tube sock filled with jasmine rice and herbs, and you can microwave for 30 sec to get hot, then drape around your neck\n\nThis sounds interesting! How long does it stay warm and fragrant?\n\n&gt;Echo Dot\n\nI am not quite there yet. Something about these devices being 'on' all the time, the HUGH mega data farm buildings, the data mining of everything and anything we do or say or type or view, ....\n\nI am just not there yet, but i can totally understand how they can and do make life easier! These are exactly the ones I have. they work and make life a little easier for me. Lots of good stuff on this post, thank you and take care. Good is subjective but I would consider a pair of warm slippers good if they are comfortable, keep my feet warm at home in winter, and durable. I have a pair of Ugg slippers that I love, they are suede and natural fleece and cost 120$. Very comfy, warm, and still great after 2 years. I had cheaper (30-40$) slippers that wore out or fell apart after less than a year so I would not consider them good. Seems like durability is a gamble at that price range. I do not think they are too expensive. Just find one that fits your shower. Someone else might have mentioned a grab bar. I did as well in the form of suction cups in the shower. I forgot to mention the one in front of my toilet as a grab bar. It is one that screws in to a stud. Took care of that after I ripped the towel bar out of the wall when standing up. It helps greatly. My Pleasure! I keep wondering what little doohickeys, inventions, work-arounds,  solutions, ideas, purchases, hacks, ... people have come up through their CMT or other disability. \n\nPersonally, I find it fascinating and mentally stimulating to find/create/invent ... a 'solution' to a problem.\n\nSuch as the reference to carpets I made above. I would LOVE to have rugs on the hard surface floors, So, I came up with an idea. \nSnow Tires for Rollator's!!!!!\n\nAnyone have access to a 3D printer? I think I havev a way to make it work!\n\nAgaoin, my apologies for typos, I can only see  a tiny portion of the left side of the screen. Damn Drop Feet! Hey, /u/pmp22 , do you mind if I ask which ones you use and recommend? And, from where do you purchase them? Thanks for the response! I have looked on the net for shower-chairs but there are so many styles, designs, options, with or without this or that doohickey, it became a real hassle to determine if the seat has enough, or the right kind of drainage holes, or if it goes this hihgh or thast highm ,,, I just stopped looking for everything. Over the years I have been using many different ones, mostly various models from adidas. The plain black ones with three white stripes are my favorite, currently they go under the name \"Adilette Comfort Slides\".\n\nYou can see them here:\n\n\nSize is important, as I have found that too small ones cause the strap to rub against the top part of the foot. If you have very pronounced pes cavus, an alternative could be the models that have an adjustable strap.\n\nI know there are models that are made with some softer materials than these, which are also an alternative if chafing becomes an issue. Hammer toe separators. These things are amazing. They stop you from busting your nails. \n\nSkin softening lotion. For calluses. Along with a good callus scraper. \n\nA bench in the bedroom for putting on shoes. \n\nA high quality shower mat. &gt; Hammer toe separators. \nWell, that is a new one me! Definitely have to look that one up!\n\nA bench in bedroom has always been a good friend. Even well before I know I had this thing they call CMT.\n\n&gt;A high quality shower mat.\n\nWell, for me, I am afraid to say, those days are gone for me. Now,I need a high quality chair and a high quality multipositional showerhead pole so I can adjust the height as well as the spray/force of the shower. Standing in the shower, other than getting out of the shower, is in the past.\n\nAll excellent ideas! Thanks for submitting! You are welcome. This is the link to what I use. \n\n", "CMT makes me want to die I (25f) have 4C and I have managed to live a semi-normal life. I had the post tibial surgery at 12, I cannot run and my gait is abnormal which has caused me some embarrassment but more or less I have been relatively lucky. I am like many CMT people mortified about the way my feet look and always wear shoes and socks where possible. \n\nDoctors have suggested I use splints in case of injury but I just cannot bring myself to. I am so ashamed and embarrassed and I cannot handle drawing more attention to it. \n\n\nLast week my foot fell asleep and when I walked on it without realising, I rolled it. I knew I had done damage the next day when it was bruised and swollen but an X-ray said it was not broken and I was sent home from the hospital. \n\n\nA CT scan  revealed today that I have ripped the whole ligament off the bone on both sides and I have been walking around on it for 8 days. I feel like my life is about to end honestly. Like this is the beginning of the end of everything. I know that the time it is going to take me to heal this injury means all the muscle I have built around my legs and ankles will atrophy. I feel like I am going to be forced to wear leg splints, and I am sooo deeply ashamed of this disease that I want to kill myself. I just want to not exist anymore. \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out. You can find help at a National Suicide Prevention Lifeline\n\nUSA: 18002738255\nUS Crisis textline: 741741 text HOME\n\nUnited Kingdom: 116 123\n\nTrans Lifeline (877-565-8860)\n\nOthers: \n\n There is hope. Surgery at Cedars has helped my son greatly.\n\n How old is your son? Do you mind if I message you to ask some questions about the surgery? Sure thing. He is 7. I am so sorry that you have had this injury. You must have a lot of pain from that, compounded by the stress of being uncertain about the future impact of this. \n\nYou cannot really know how this will impact your future mobility. Yes, there will be a recovery period which is going to suck. During that time, can you find a way to exercise your uninjured leg, so that you at least retain muscle there? Perhaps using resistance bands?\n\nLeg splints are not the end of the world. I get that you do not want to draw attention to yourself by wearing them. Would long skirts be an option in circumstances where you particularly want to hide them?\n\nPlenty of people, with CMT or other physical issues, wear splints or even (looking at long term worst case scenarios) use a wheelchair and lead good, meaningful lives. Suddenly confronting a possible transition to something like wearing splints is a lot of stress, but it is something you can adapt to, if you have to. Your worth as a person is not defined by having good ankles. \n\nGive yourself some time to breathe, to recover from the initial shock. An injury like this is significantly traumatic for anyone. For the moment, you have a serious acute injury and everyone gets injured at some point. Anyone will understand you making whatever accommodations you need to, to get through your initial healing period. Try to focus on what you can do to help yourself heal and retain strength now and take the long term impacts as they come. I was pretty suicidal a few years ago. CMT had run me through the grinder my whole life and I did not want to continue suffering. I contacted a suicide prevention agency, and started a plan to change my perspective. I took every opportunity I could to make my life easier. Instead of \u201cmanning up\u201d and walking with crutches and not using leg braces, I started using my medical equipment. Went to the gym, and got a wheelchair (best decision of my life). No longer did I perceive myself as a diseased cripple, something to hide and be ashamed of. I now embrace the fact that it is just how this shit is.\nI am not older than you, but I know that as you grow older, you realize that nobody is paying attention to the small things you are ashamed of, because they are to busy worrying about what you think of them. You will not draw unnecessary attention to yourself by using medical equipment. You will not be less of a person for doing so. You WILL be more mobile and have more freedom. You WILL feel safer and fall less. And most importantly, you will not let this disease conquer you and control your life. \nFUCK THIS DISEASE! You can hate it but do not let it drive you to suicide. It is only a small part of what makes you unique. I use my disease as the butt of jokes and an excuse to wheelie wherever I want. People are kinder to those with disabilities, as they do not see a disgusting cripple, they see a strong individual with a will to continue. Some people empathize and will assist in your daily routine. I love having the door held open for me, or bus drivers stopping waves of people to ensure I get on without a hassle. \nWhen I was in grade school, my disease was something a hid from the view of others, now as a young adult, my disease is hidden by my attitude and personality. \nAnd so what if you draw the attention of some lazy asshole, who is whole life is built on degrading others. SCREW THAT NOISE! You got shit to do and people to see. \nWhat I am trying to say is, do not let CMT control your life. Do not let your perception of yourself be that of someone who is weak. And do not feel shame is using medical equipment. \nI hope you get over this hill in your life. If you would like to talk more, feel free to shoot me a DM! \nGL &gt;When I was in grade school, my disease was something a hid from the view of others, now as a young adult, my disease is hidden by my attitude and personality. \n\nI really love this! We are only a small community here on Reddit but I am sure any one of us will be glad to listen if you want to talk or vent more about the frustration of living with cmt. I have had injuries and lost mobility because of it, but I have also had amazing recoveries beyond what I thought was possible from exercising when I recover from my injuries. I do not want to write you a speech if it is not what you need to hear right now (though I could if you think it will help), but I want to share something I remind myself of when I feel the urge to end it all. I have experienced so many wonderful moments in my life despite my disease that I would have missed out on if I ended it. And I got to share those moments with my family, friends, and loved ones. I have made career advancements and great accomplishments despite this condition and I just think how many more of these moments will I miss out if I give in, not to mention to deprive my loved ones of those moments too. \n\nI understand what a nightmare it is to go through this, but please remember that you and your life still have value and a lot of amazing moments ahead, often in spite of your struggles. We are here if you want to vent more or just talk. It shocks me to read your post. There is no shame in being disabled.  I walk with braces and a cane and sometime use a wheelchair. They are tools that I use to live my life to its fullest. The fact that you would rather hurt yourself than wear braces is hugely dysfunctional. Please, please, please get some help. Acceptance and a positive attitude are key to living a great life with CMT and it is possible. Altough I am less affected than you, I had similar thoughts and still sometimes do.. Being just slightly affected is a challange in itself... When people see you as a perfect functional person and then your hands start to shake when you pour water in a glass.. How can you explain that? Beyond embarassing. And anxiety makes this disease even worse, so just a vicious circle all around.\n\nOthers probably gave better advices than I will, but what keeps me going is knowing it is likely a treatment will be available in the future decade.. Until then I keep trying to keep my mind shut through meditation and mindfulness. Helps with the shaky hands aswell. I wish you the best of luck. Your response is less than helpful for someone struggling - \"hugely dysfunctional\"? How about: \"It is going to be okay, here is what has helped me:... \" Hey! I am 31f with type 2. I am with you and have felt these thoughts at times as well. I am so sorry you are struggling. Some days can be so difficult and it is hard to find people who understand.

My diagnosis was an unwelcome surprise despite the history of CMT in my family tree. Unwelcome and shocking. Up until the verdict I had thought that I would dodged the bullet but when it was made official I realised that it was obvious that I would always had it. I am having a difficult time with not only the news but the physical signs now so that it is an ever present entity in my thoughts. \n\nI am not entirely sure what the purpose of this post is other than a vague reach-out. \n\nAre there any of you out there who have some advice, stories, opinions that might lighten the load? My story is kind of similar. My symptoms did not seem obvious until now that I know I have it. What type? 1A", "Muscle twitching? Hey everyone-\n\nI have posted here off an on the last several years, I have CMT 1A confirmed with a genetic test. For the last two years I have been having some new symptoms which I do not believe are related to CMT. The big ones are:\n\n-tinnitus in left ear only 24/7\n-shoulder and neck pain and stiffness on left side\n-lightheaded all the time\n-as of 4 months ago 24/7 muscle twitching, moves around areas of the body \n\nAll vestibular tests have been clean, brain MRI, cervical spine and lumbar MRIs are clean. Blood test shows elevated levels of creatine kinase (could be the CMT) but otherwise clean. \n\nI am most curious about the muscle twitching, does anyone else have this? I know a lot of things can cause it but now I am worried about other neurologic conditions and hoping I can explain it away somehow.  You are not alone. The muscles in my legs twitch constantly. It is not dependent on time, activity, or environment. They are just always twitching. This has been happening so long that it has become a \"you do not notice it until you think of it\" problem for me. Is it just your legs? For me it is my entire body, and not limited to things I would associate with the peripheral nervous system, which is why I am curious (i.e. my eye lids, abdomen, neck muscles, shoulder muscles).  I have only had the occasional calf muscle twitching after being on my feet most of the day, nothing super irregular How high is your creatine kinase? In CMT1A slight elevations (~500 U/L) is fairly common. But if you are a lot higher than that I would keep looking for an answer other than CMT, especially concidering your other symptoms. It is just my legs. Those symptoms sound like something that is outside the scope of CMT and should be discussed with a neurologist. Yeah, agreed completely, I have been seeing neurologists for the last 2 years to no avail unfortunately.  One month ago it was 634 U/L, I had another test last week and it is down to 400... my neuro did not seem to think it was related to the CMT though I am not sure what his reasoning is. \n\nAlso, I had an irregular EMG, but only in my left shoulder. It showed spontaneous muscle activity, this shoulder has been stiff and sore throughout all these symptoms as well. Did they check your CRP? Have you hade any tests for immune responses? Vitamin and micronutrient levels normal? Do you still have neck pain? Not totally sure on CRP as I am waiting to get the blood test back that they did on Friday (which was for autoimmune issues). All I got was a call from my neuro saying everything looked normal but that creatine kinase was still slightly elevated, I suppose if CRP was in that panel then it came back normal. \n\nVitamins looked normal, but, the tests were not super comprehensive. They did not look at Vitamin D which I am going to ask for, the usual suspects (magnesium, B12, B3, etc.) were all normal. \n\nStill have the neck stiffness and pain, I am sorta worried there is something going on localized to my shoulder/neck, the abnormal needle EMG has me freaking out slightly, but, like, there is no way I could have CMT AND ALS right?? CMT hits hands, eye lids, arms, I have seen neck twitching as well, yep.  Not just lower legs. On the surface all your symptoms apear to suggest that it could CNS related. It is also possible to have CMT and for instance ALS, sadly having CMT is no get out of jail free card for other diseases. Until you get a definite diagnoses,  there is no point in worrying about the bad posibilities, the symptoms could after all also be unrelated and have benign origins.\n\n Totally, night time lets my anxiety get the better of me sometimes. Thanks as always for the dialogue, I am living a pretty isolated life right now (nonstop travel for work) and it is seriously helpful just to exchange a couple messages. \n\nOn an unrelated note, Stanford\u2019s CMT patient conference is in a couple weeks. I am thinking about booking a last minute plane ticket, either way, I am planning to make a post here near the end of the month with the research updates they present, I think this will be a very interesting year.  I have muscle twitching, not 24/7 but pretty often. Also not only in my legs but basically everywhere. CMT 1A as well.  I am the same way, I always fear the worst of the worst yet it all has a tendency to work out fine in the end. :)\n\nI asked the CMTA back in June if they would be recording the presentations held at the conference this year, but they said that they would not due to heavy cost. I wish they would for people who cannot attend but I am hoping at least some abstracts or presentation material will be published. Either way 2018 is indeed an exciting year for CMT, though 2019-2020 and beyond is going to be even more exciting! It seems like the race towards a cure for 1A have been heating up lately and the number of papers on CMT is on track to beat last year which is also nice.  CMT 1A here as well. I have had my fair share of muscle twitching as well. I have not personally tried it, but I have been told that taking magnesium supplements can help this quite a bit. In some cases muscle twitching and numbness has been misdiagnosed as Parkinson's when in reality it was a magnesium deficiency.  I have tinnitus in my left ear as well, and constant muscle twitching in my calves (looks like small cramping). It is all related to CMT, although tinnitus is supposed to be only CMT type 2, but I am 1A, so go figure...As for the cramping, there is new research suggesting that RLS and CMT have a lot of similar symptoms, so the underlying mechanisms may be related, hence the muscle twitches.  You might ask your doctor about testing for breathing issues ( \n\nThree things you mentioned are symptoms of hypercapnia: muscle twitches, shoulder and neck pain, and in one of your comments you mentioned anxiety at bedtime. \n\nMy dad suffers from severe hypercapnia and I have mild hypercapnia symptoms, including constant twitching throughout the day. One thing that helps me get rid of twitching is breathing deeply and making sure to exhale really well. Maybe try it when you feel a twitch to see if it helps?\n\nYou might not have it, but it might be worth mentioning to your doctor.  Thanks so much for the advice. I will look into this. I did have a blood test show high levels of CO2 in my blood about a year and a half ago, but, it was still in range.  You are welcome and good luck. I hope you are able to find some answers.

I wonder whether a protein-only diet could help the muscles affected by CMT grow or strengthen (muscles=protein, right?).\n\nI would be very interested to know whether anyone has any experience with **keto (low-carb)** or a **full-on carnivore** diet and how it affected their symptoms. I generally ready very high amounts of protein normally as it just so happens that the foods I like the most happen to be high protein. That alone did not help my muscles, but hitting the gym religiously did.  Woaw, congrats! What kind of exercise does have such an incredible effect? I am 25yo \\ and in process of putting together a diet and an exercise regime for myself, any advice counts :) My workout looks like this:\nMonday:\nBench Press\t\nIncline Press\t\nMilitary Press\t\nFlys\t\n\nTuesdays\nLat Pull-down\t\nPull-ups reverse grip\nSeated Rows\t\nStanding Rows\n\nWednesday (basically all shoulder because I want more here)\nFront Raise\t\nSide Raise\t\nRear Raise\t\nCrunches\t\n\nThursday\nShrugs\t\nCurls\t\nTricep Extensions\t\nPreacher Curls\t\nTricep Dips\t\n\nFriday (legs and some core items)\nCalf Raises\t\nBarbell Squats\t\nGlute Bridges\t\nGlute Kickbacks\t\nRoman Chair\t\nDead Lifts\t\n\nNow in my case I am working based off what I have bought for a home gym, so some of these are modified to work with the equipment I have on hand.  I am a 37yo male who also had low testosterone.  I started putting on some muscle once I started replacement therapy for the testosterone, and then started hitting the gym pretty hard.  I have been at it for about 2.5 years now and though I do not have hard numbers, I can say that I am definitely better now as I weight about 5lbs less, but my waist size is down 2 inches and my arms and chest are much bigger than when I started.  One of my first weeks at the gym I got stuck under a 90lb barbell after just a few reps (that was embarrassing) and today I am using 65lb dumbbells in each hand (converted for a barbell, it is about 150lbs since I do not have as much to balance as I do with dumbbells).  I do not have a lot of comparison numbers handy, I just remember that one because of the embarrassment. :)  Do not be afraid of lifting weights - it is been one of the best things I have done in a long time. Thank you very much for answering, keep up the good work, you have inspired me :) I think you are better off just making sure to stay hydrated to prevent muscle tightening and cramps.  Eat potassium rich food and drink a lot of water.  I am not a doctor but I do not see a reason why excess protein would help you feel better outside of not being hungry, unless you work out as well.  The lack of muscle growth resulting from CMT is not caused by protein deficiency, but by damage to nerves.  \n\nI think exercise is important and you should try to eat protein to build muscle.  But too much in a diet is bad for your liver and I do not think would make you feel much better than if you ate a balanced diet including carbs and fats.

", "Wearable Dress Shoes I (23m 1A) have never had much luck with shoes and I am wanting to find a pair of non-running shoes. For the past two years, the only shoe I have really worn is the ( and I go through at least five pairs a year. I really just want something I can wear on rare occasions to dinner, a job interview, or something.\n\nCurrently I do not wear any special inserts or a hard brace, but I do wear the ( on my left ankle. My arches are a bit high and my feet are rather small (mens 7 US).\n\nDoes anyone have a good suggestion for a nice looking business casual type shoe? Something with decent support that is not too narrow or too wide ideally. How about the Dunham Burlington?  I will give those a shot. Have you personally had luck with this shoe or brand? Yes this is the only show I have found that fits me and looks at least passably dressy enough for work, weddings, etc. I posted here a while ago asking if others had tips for finding cool/fashionable options but it did not yield anything new for me. Idk what you are budget it is but if you are willing to spend a little on some good shoes for one pair, I would try Cole Haan. \n\nI have one pair from there that I use for interview and special occasions and it was so worth the money. I have also had them for about 2.5 years. They are durable, have arch support, look good, and are comfy! For nights out and stuff like that I like to wear suede dress shoes because they do not eat up my feet like regular leather shoes tend to do. But they are no good for use with a suit. I have found some leather dress shoes that works for me but I have had to try a lot of different ones until I found them. They are not anything special but the leather is a bit softer than normal leather shoes so that is what I would look for when you are trying out shoes. I will give them a shot. Thanks for the suggestion! I will look into getting a pair of those. Leather hurts my feet a lot ever since I had a few surgeries so perhaps suede would be a good fit for me. Try Sketchers (the memory foam versions or gel cushioned are best rather than the go foam). They have been a god send to me. My feet would always blister and bleed after a short while but the memory foam makes a big difference. You can often buy new ones on amazon or eBay for cheaper than direct. Sports direct also often do discounts. You can get many different designs now/ some slip on without laces which make them more formal. Some of them are also incredibly light and you can get wide versions. Heavy shoes make my foot drop more obvious and walking harder so for me a light shoe is perfect.", "Does anyone here wear a brace at night to keep their foot straight? I am considering trying to get one bec there are times where I feel like someone is pulling my foot down (the foot drop feeling) and it is so uncomfortable and keeps me up all night. I do not have that but I do become hyper aware of my right middle toe (like someone is touching it) and that keeps me up sometimes. I wear my braces all day, off at night. There is also these wrap around braces for foot drop at Walgreens,  Walmart, CVS, they work very well for nighttime as they are more breathable. My son does. His PT makes them for him out of the same material you create casts for a broken bone.  He velcroes them on before going to sleep. They have an acute angle to help keep his calf muscles stretched. As an adult that will be useless.  Learn to sleep on the side that does not bother your foot.  As a child it will be traumatic for life and probably useless.\nSource : my experiences I do! I do not use braces throughout the day, but I cannot sleep if I do not wear them at night for the same reasons you mention. There are some very cushy ones. Check it out, at least for me it makes a big difference in comfort. I did preop Do u have any u can recommend? I used to have an orthopedic technician who would built me one from scratch but I have to say that nothing compares to that one cheap thing I got from amazon.

It was horrible for me personally, could not have it on for more than 5 minutes. But ymmv. It takes some fidgeting around. If i pull the straps to tight it becomes uncomfortable, if ita too loose I slip through.. but after a few trials I found the perfect tightness, maybe that was the case for you too", "Footwear Find I found a pair of shoes that I have been living in and wanted to share as I know shoes can be so dang tough to find. They will not be for everyone as they can be difficult to get on (especially when they are new!!) and are pricey, but they have helped me significantly. They tie up high enough that it helps hold my foot so it does not drop. I have had CMT2 for 16 years, primarily affecting my left foot/lower leg, and find with this higher top shoe I do not need a brace. I am sure down the road as the disease progresses they will not be as helpful, but for now, I am happy to say they are. \n\nDoes anyone else have any footwear finds they can share? For the past bunch of years I have been living in Converse, but they are getting a bit too heavy on my feet and I am looking for more options. Thanks for that I have bought a pair of allbird shoes, several years ago, still using them  \nThey are quite flexible/breathable too.  \n\n\nI have a more mild form of cmt, and have not needed to use braces yet, as I am only 21 years old. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut i would recommend them I just found  \n\n2 weeks into it, but I love zipping into the shoe and it being tightly laced. Thank you!! I have actually always wanted a pair so I will try them out. Appreciate it. Amazing! Thanks for the suggestion. Are they heavy on the foot at all or pretty light? They are likely as heavy as the pair in your picture. The benefit is getting them on and off easier. I also have a hard time with laces even if I could get my foot into a high-top at all. Got some meindl extra wide shoes. They do not go up past the ankle, but the padding is awesome, and I do not need to bend down to put them on or take them off.

Day 2 for me, should I be worried or it goes away eventually? I was just exhausted for a couple of days and then I was fine. I would not be worried about anything that might happen for the first two or three days. \n\nI have heard of a very wide range of symptoms for people. My neurologically normal spouse got nerve tingling, for instance, but only for a day or so. I sent my doctor a message, \"Do you have any known cases of covid vaccines causing extra weakness, inflammation, or pain in patients?\"\n\nHe answered, \"Yes.\" \n\nPersonally, I tried to take out the trash shortly after the second shot, lost balance, and sprained an ankle. I have not felt balanced since and still feel fatigued. Be especially careful not to exert much at least for the 2 days following. My issues are actually more hand-related, the legs are for the most part the same as before. I am in my 30s and have CMT1A. For about 2-3 days after receiving the 1st Moderna covid vaccine dose, I was very sick with a 103 fever, drowsiness, and had severe numbness in my legs. I was unable to walk without support. After the third day, I was back to normal with no after effects.\n\nThe 2nd dose was more mild with the weakness/numbness only lasting half a day. \n\nMy mom is in her 60s, also has CMT1A, and had a very similar experience of leg weakness while recovering from the vaccine.\n\nNote: I am very much in support of the vaccine and this temporary side effect was totally worth it. Thanks for the input. Unrelated, but how is your mother? In regards to CMT I mean. I am always curious to know how older people handle the disease, how bad it can progress, etc. Sorry if it is a sensitive topic. Do not mean no harm. She wears an AFO brace and takes 2400mg neurontin daily, but she is still pretty active. The atrophy in her hands and calves is visibly very noticeable and she struggles with nerve pain and general weakness sometimes. She has been retired for a few years and goes on a 2 mile nature walk daily. What about you? How do you fare these days, friend? Are your symptoms similar to what your mother experienced at this age? I would say I am doing pretty well. I work out at OrangeTheory fitness 3 times a week and really enjoy it. The coaches are sympathetic to my condition and find ways to modify activities when needed. It is the first type of group exercise class that I have not felt like a failure in for not being able to keep up, because progress is recorded through beating your own personal records and \u201ckeeping up\u201d via heart rate instead of speed or strength. (For example, if I am working at 85% of max heart rate while walking at 4 mph, while everyone else is running at 6-8 mph, it is treated as having a similar level of effort.)\n\nI was told at age 25 that I would never be able to run, and at age 32 I recently ran 1 mile in 13 minutes without stopping. I am very proud of that achievement. My first ever \u201crun\u201d in my life at age 27 was 400 ft. \n\nMy balance has also improved a lot, although I am still clumsy, I still cannot really wear high heels, and I still cannot jump. My high arches bother me. In my 20s, I wore flats and fashion sneakers without support. Now, I wear supportive walking shoes all the time. I was just falling too often in anything else. \n\nIn general, people that I know would not guess that I have muscular dystrophy unless I told them. They would just think was I was not athletic. \n\nI was diagnosed at age 10, but my mom was not diagnosed until age 40, so we have lived very different experiences despite having similar progressions of the disease. Her CMT worsened more dramatically around age 40 and I expect mine to, as well. My mom was more active physically in her life than I have been overall, though I have been better in the last few years. What an interesting life story, loved to read it, thanks for sharing! Hopefully by the time you are 40 we will have something to at least stop the progression of the disease so you never get worse! May you live a long fulfilling life.  I (31/F) have had CMT2 for 16 years, affecting only the lower legs, primarily in my left. I had my first shot of Pfizer on May 29, and on June 21 I experienced hand weakness for the first time ever, to the point of being unable to write. It is still bothering me a bit but not as bad. I have a cousin (same family) who has never experienced CMT or any neuropathy symptoms and she is currently in the hospital being treated for neuropathy symptoms after her AZ vaccination on June 23. My partner who has mild neuropathy in his family noticed a difference in his limbs after his Moderna vaccination. From what I have read the symptoms tend to go away after time, but what if they do not? I have not had my second vaccination and am afraid to now. How are you doing atm? It passed away after a couple of days, so not a biggie.

When i was 13/14 I went on a trip with my mother, brother, and 2 younger sisters to Kingsport, TN so my brother who just graduated high school could tryout for MLB team. While staying at a hotel and playing in the pool with my two little sisters my mother noticed my feet and legs look strange. My pinky toes were raised and went over the next toe (later i was refered to as a reverse velociraptor which i thought was awesome since i was into dinos back then) and my archers where extremely high. She also noticed I walked on the outside of my feet. \n\nUpon returning home my mother made an appointment with my pediatrician who then refered us to a podiatrist. The podiatrist did x-rays and exams and was unsure as to why my feet did that or why. My feet and legs hurt so much (what my parents persummed was normal growing pains as my brother and I are both tall 6'3\" for me and 6'4\" for my brother). He referd us to a neurologist.\n\nThe neurologist was cool we did a couple of exams with him...he spoke in length with my parents and decided that due to cost of things that he wanted to take me as a patient under the MDA (Muscular Dystrophy Association) clinic he worked at. Due to the process of that clinic funds and what not id go and see him every few months I think maybe 2 or 3 times a year.\n\nAt the MDA clinic he ran numerous test ranging from hands on examination, blood panels where they drew so much it was like I was donating blood, an MRI I feel asleep during, a nerve conduction test with electrodes that was odd, an a nerve biopsy surgery as well.\n\nNow because it was so long ago I may misremember or my parents misinformed me of my diagnosis. But as i recall I was diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy type CMT. \n\nShortly after being diagnosed (about 2-3 years after seeking answers) I completely quit going...my all star of a brother became ill and was diagnosed with brain cancer so that kind of took a lot out of my parents and that is where thier focus went.\n\nWell fast forward many years I met my wife and she has been working on convincing me to go get treatment for my md/cmt and ive always played it off until recently...earlier this year my brother was diagnosed with CMT. Now my wife has used that as leverage lol so when i went in to see my primary care physician for my annual checkup I asked for a referal or whatever to get my md/cmt thing looked at...well that appointment finally happened.\n\nThe appointment with the neurologist was intense...i go in and the nerse takes normal vitals then puts me an exam room letting me know someone will be with me shortly. A medical field person came in (idk if it was a nurse or doctor) and took me to do a lung breath test thing i had to exhale really hard into a tube and hold it...she sends me back to my room. Two more ladys come in ones an occupational therapist and the other a physical therapist the look at my feet watched me walk a bunch normally on my toes on my heals and what not...well the O.T. wants me to get some kind of low profile braces to wear when i walk and a pair of braces to sleep in as well...after that the O.T. left and the P.T. took me to another exam room for grip testing and fine motor testing with my hands she said everything was satisfactory. I again go back to my exam room and then a Social Worker came in and talled to me...i thought this was odd but it seems like a rutine mental evaluation...after her was a dietician who was really nice. \n\nAfter the dietitian finally the doctor came in with two other doctors. All 3 of them were working on my case...all 3 of them had worked with the First neurologist I seen all those years ago who is now retired. We swapped some funny stories about him in sure he would smile at. I discussed with the doctor about the MD type CMT thing and how they are both different and upon review of my old file she believes that CMT is definitely the correct diagnosis. Now as far as what type we dont know yet. She set me up with a check swab test to figure that out some kind of awesome genetic test.\n\nWell that is my story so far...got an appointment soon for braces on my legs and im waiting to hear back from the doctor about the test and where to proceed after that.\n\nSorry for the long read but thank you for reading and any advice you may have. I hope you have a great day. I do not get why they did not do the genetic testing earlier when they were suspecting CMT? I was diagnosed in utero, which was 27 years ago, since it was known that my grandma and my mom have it. The genetic testing is the only eay to be properly diagnosed with CMT.\n\nBut good for you that you finally got some answers. I dont know either. My mother was tested but she came back negative as a trait carrier and theres no history of anything like this in my family it seems me and my brother are the lucky ones Maybe you got it from your dad? Or grandparents and it skipped a generation?\n\nBut yeah, genetic testing is important. I hope you will get your result soon I guess that is possible I vaguely remeber being told that this could only be passed by the mothers genetics...idk how accurate that is anymore. Im learning a lot of things from that time frame told to me was inaccurate. \n\nThanks I am planning on posting an update when i get my braces and my test results... I am kind of excited and terrified at the same time about the braces That is false. That would only be the case, if the mitochondria were affected as their dna is always from the mother.\n\nCMT can be passed on by either parent and only one set of chromosomes with the mutation is necessary to develop the disease, as CMT is autosomal-dominant. So you could have gotten it from your mother's side or you father's. How skipping a generation works I am not familiar with. There is a form of CMT that is mitochondrial, but it is uncommon and without a genetic test to indicate that form specifically it would be very odd to assume that is what OP has and not one of the more common forms. \n\nThe most common forms of CMT are passed along in an autosomal dominant fashion, and equally likely to come from either parent. \n\n\"Skipping a generation\" is not exactly a thing. It is how things were described in a pre-genetic-testing era when you either had a common recessive disorder or someone just had a mild case in one generation which went unnoticed. With testing, we can now describe things more accurately.  \n\nThere is also a form of CMT that is recessive, but in that case you must inherit the gene from both parents so that does not seem to be what is going on here. \n\nInheriting it from your father seems like that most likely scenario, based on the information here. \n\nThe genetic test will hopefully bring you solid information soon. \n\nLots of people here wear some form of braces for walking. It helps to stabilize them and is very beneficial for many people. \n\nI have not heard about anyone wearing braces to sleep in for a long time though. From what I recall, there was a bit of excitement about this possibly helping, back in the 80s but it was found to be ineffective. Perhaps this is a different form of bracing than the one I am thinking of, though. Can you tell me more about what they are suggesting for your nighttime braces and why they are supposed to help? Good to know, thank you! I have type 1A and assumed that the other types have the same way of inheriting it. Glad to hear you are getting good support! Mega-appointments are a classic. I was diagnosed at age three so growing up I had a whole squad of like, 7 doctors I would see at the children\u2019s hospital. Did not remember half of their names and did not even know what some of them did but my mom sure did! Thanks for the info inreally appreciate it. From what i recall as that appointment was very overwhelming, the OT said it was in order to help perserve current muscle shape? And strength for muscles and ankle joints. I will post more info as soon as i have my apointment with the people who make them. Other than an emergency or surgery I havebnever had a mega appointment and it was both exciting but also very overwhelming for me lol I can imagine. A notepad comes in handy. Sounds like you have got good care Yeah I think i do, Andi will definitely be taking a notepad for future appointments lol", "Personal Experience Taking Creatine Supplements? This is one of those things I have tried to look into only to discover that the scientific literature is inconclusive. So if you have tried taking creatine supplements before, please consider sharing your experience even if it was \"I took it and nothing happened.\"\n\nWhat type of CMT do you have (or is it unknown)?\n\nHow much did you take and for how long?\n\nDid it seem helpful?\n\nIf you stopped taking it why?\n\nDid you see any long term effects, positive or negative?\n\nI am not looking for advice on supplements in general (though if this prompts you to want to talk about that subject you can start a different post) just creatine. Thanks! Hello! I take creatine, but I started taking it because I am powerlifting and not for CMT specifically. To answer your questions:\n\n1) CMT 1B\n\n2) 5g/day of creatine monohydrate since early this winter.\n\n3) Hard to say because I have also been increasing my calorie intake and following my training program, so I would definitely have improved strength over this time either way.\n\n4) Have not stopped.\n\n5) Certainly no bad side effects for me! Evidence of the use of creatine for improved exercise performance is solid and demonstrates it is generally very safe: \n\nFrom my understanding, creatine could be helpful specifically IF you are active. The supplement increases your muscles' creatine stores which are used for immediate, short-term energy. In practice, this \"extra energy\" is roughly equivalent to the difference of being able to do one or two more reps in a set while weightlifting - not super significant at the time, but being able to do a little bit more volume consistently over time can help you build a bit more strength/muscle than you would have without it.\n\nAt the very least, it is a pretty cheap and safe supplement, so it likely would not hurt to try! But I do not believe you would notice a huge impact in general day-to-day function, particularly if you are not weightlifting.  Type CMT 1A\n\nI have tried every pre workout and supplement going.\n\nI can sum up very quickly and say Creatine is not even slightly potent enough to compensate for the motor and muscular issues CMT causes. Also any more than a few grams per serving will only help you get to the toilet quickly. When I was 18 I took creatine for a few months and it seemed to make a noticeable, but not life changing, difference to the unaffected muscles and very little difference to the neuropathic muscles. I have basically CMT1A (actually not quite but it is the closest genetic variant with a name). Unfortunately I eventually stopped working out so I cannot speak to long term effects. CMT1a\n\nThe recommended dose on the container (beast creature) was the brand of creatine.\n\nYes. I took it after weight training sessions and it helped my muscles not be sore for so long, typically my muscles are sore for 2-3 days after working out and with creatine it was usually 1-2 days.\n\nBecause I stopped working out haha.\n\nNothing long term that I noticed. Thank you, this is a wonderfully detailed answer. Thanks for your answer.\n\nCMT which is just like type 1A but which is caused by an unknown/unnamed genetic variant would just be \"Type 1\" by the way. The various letters refer to specific genes but the number describes the kind of damage, with Type 1 being damage to the myelin sheath, Type 2 damage to the axon itself, ect. We even have a flair for CMT1 that does not specify gene type. Good to know. FWIW I have a PMP22 Point mutation but on EMG I have both demyelination and axonal damage. Oh, that is an interesting one. Close to both CMT1A and also HNPP but really its own thing. \n\nIt is rarely a good thing to be medically interesting although--fun historical fact--early CMT1A research was given a big boost by being the first known example of the \"dosage effect\" (having an extra copy of PMP22 leads to producing more of the PMP22 protein) in humans. CMT 1A and tried not just creatine, but different types. \n\nFor me, at higher doses it can cause bloating but in terms of helping with muscle growth? Hah, it is like trying to take out a tank with a BB gun, it is not going to do anything. CMT is a muscle wasting disease and as such, basic sports supplements are going to be barely noticeable at best.", "What is your CMT story? I am the first person in my family to be diagnosed with CMT type 1B at birth. This cake to be discovered when I was unable to walk on my own at the age of 1 without holding/grabbing onto things. I would also have difficulty using my legs to get/stand up. \n\nIt is a bit of a mystery on how I ended up with CMT since both of my parents and their families have no trace of CMT. I also have two younger siblings that do not have CMT.  Much like me you were probably a sponeous mutation. Like any genetic disorder spontaneous mutations can and do occur. I hereby formally invite you to join the X-Men.  Are you also the only one In your family to have CMT? And which sub category do you have ? Yes, A1 What kind of symptoms do you experience ? Idk anything about A1 I have general weakness, mainly in my extremities. My form is fairly mild. I also experience nerve pain related to fatigue and lots of small, funny things like arched feet.

I could go into more detail but it is a lot to cover I see you have \u201ctype unknown\u201d. Why is that? Is your moms type known? I was diagnosed when I was in preschool by my moms neurologist.  I havent ever really asked her what type i have, but I 100% have some type haha.  I did not even know there were different types until a few years ago Oh wow interesting ! How do you manage your CMT? I have found that losing weight and eating less sugar have helped a lot with my body.  I go to a gym to stationary bike and do back/ core exercises, as well as stretch.  I made a post a little back about foam rollers, they help with my posture.  \n\nBut I still get tired quickly, i just feel a bit less pain than before my last surgery, which is nice I am (23M) also a 1a mutant. First person in my family and I even have a twin brother with no signs of CMT. I had symptoms as a baby and my parents got me officially diagnosed when I was only 2 years old. As far as CMT goes I am very fortunate- I have only had one (albeit major) foot reconstruction surgery and I mostly live without pain. My mom is 1 of 10 kids. When she was 16 she had surgery to \"correct\" her feet because they were deformed. Into her 40s is when she was diagnosed with CMT1a and then had all of her kids tested. She is the only one in her family to have it - so it just developed in her. \n\nFor our family, we are 4 kids (three girls, one boy). All four of us have that lovely 50/50 lottery chance. All four of us have CMT1a. \n\nI have a daughter. It took almost six years of arguing with doctors to test her. It is a blood test, and we know exactly which of my chromosomes the mutation is on, so I figured, cannot they just look there (I know even if that chromosome was not mutated there was still a chance she would have it - but I really just wanted the original blood test done on her). Anyways, daughter also has CMT1a. She is 10, and it is just starting to \"appear\"... twisting her ankles, falling down.

I believe at that age my feet were already very arched but I only have mild type 1a. Thanks so much. My nephew is 3, walks on his toes complains about tingling in leg and lacks reflexes in legs. His diagnosis is very recent. Age at diagnosis can depend on a lot of things and can just be an indication that someone knew what to look for, whether due to a known family history or having a doctor who is unusually familiar with how CMT looks in children.

Actually pretty good because of the sturdynes of the shoe. Good stability.\n\nBut they are kind of too sturdy, they hurt my feet a bit.

Everywhere I seen was either too far, not in the country or only treated children. After some time I decided to open up to my mother about my decision to perform surgery and my anger because I could not find anywhere nor anyone for it. She helped me by contacting someone I regurlarly met since early childhood at the hospital I was followed for CMT (children only tho) whenI was young. Since she knew me well me and my brothers, she helped me and gave forwarded me to a fellow specialist that I already knew who could perform the surgery, but he works on people under 21 only and since I will be turning 21 in November, he decided to recommend and forward me to one of the best orthopedic surgeon near me and I have been put on a list, said it would take a few months before I hear back. Hope it will not take too long \ud83d\ude4f Good luck :) Best of luck to you. In the meantime I would keep up with any fitness training you might be doing. The fitter you are the quicker you will recover if and when you get your surgery. If it helps with morale I got my first tendon transfer when I was 23 and I am doing pretty well now my left foot is much better off than before when more than a year on the inactivity from furlough has affected my strength but I am confident it will return once this is over.\n\nBtw anaesthesia rocks before I lost consciousness for my spine untethering for a brief moment I knew what it was like to be a shooting star.... Can somebody tell me more about the surgery? I have heard talk but do not actually know what it is You can read about it here  I am in a similar boat. Mine is for a pinched nerve but my CMT specialist does not want me to get the surgery. I am going to lose my left hand function without it so I am stuck.", "Unearned Pain I have had this problem for a really long time now, ever since I was little where CMT causes me awful pain, cramps, soreness, I am sure you know. Even though having this pain I never felt like I earned the pain - like how someone who works doing physical labor \"earns\" the pain they get.\n\n (Earned is not the best word but idk how else to decide it)\n\nI have always felt, and still do feel ashamed for being in pain for the littlest things like standing for 5 minutes or walking barefoot on tile while there are people out there who break their backs. this hit toooo close to home. The only thing i can tell you is to not let things like this affect your emotions. Know your limits and work with them. Life is what you make it I know how you feel.  I felt guilty for years this way too.  But everyone starts where they are.  You \u201cearn\u201d your pain at a different rate than other people.  5 minutes standing is painful, rather than 5 hours working hard labor.  But really, I do not think earning is the right frame to look at these things.  We all just do what we can. And people do not understand this because our pain is internal. Sometime my friends forget I even have CMT. As a CMT'er, I am not going to preach to you about things you should be doing, (because I am sure you are already aware).\n\nI will just say that I can relate...\n\nMy only defense against really bad cramping..., is a steady flow of drinking water, and stay away from Soda, Alcohol, or anything that dehydrates you.\n\nI also stretch my legs much as possible.\n\nIf you do not mind putting in some extra effort, (this is the long game) work your legs. The stepper is your best friend that you will hate. It will take months before you truly appreciate it, but the more muscle you have in your legs... , the better blood flow, simple.\n\nThe tingling all but almost stops in my feet if I am working out my legs. \n\nI am not saying you are not doing all the above, or that all the will even work for you..., but I can stay personally that the pain in my legs has dramatically lessened due to the steps above. \n\nAnd lastly..., (on days you cannot handle the pain anymore). I myself eat THC/CBD edibles. \n\nAs always, I asked people to share what works for them. The more info, the better! 2nd post here, apologies, I truly do not mean to derail your original thoughts.\n\nBut you mentioned your back. Is it always the exact same area?\n\nMine is always my lower right /to mid area.\n\nIt usually acts up when I am cooking dinner, (like doing very small movements in a small standing area).\n\nI can walk &amp; move around all day with hardly any pain, but ask me to stand still and just chop vegetables for 5 minutes..., and I am stretched out on the bed in extreme pain. Unearned pain?\n\nIs the pain from cancer earned?  Is the pain from migraines earned?  Is the pain from living earned?\n\nPain is never earned. Pain simply is. \n\nMay you stop worrying about why you have pain and start finding was to mitigate it. Oh gosh I know what you mean. It is hard to have something like going to the grocery store for a few items turn into 2 days of various cramps and aches and pain. Like nothing happened there is no \u201creason\u201d for it. I have felt guilty for the way my body reacts for many, many years. And a lot of people will not take it seriously or end up feeling resentful or aggravated that it is the way it is.\n\nDo you have the ability to have a self day? I try and give myself a day where I forgive my body. I will stay in bed as long as I feel like being there, wear the most comfy things I own (even if I end up looking mess), and just breathe. Everything is done at whatever pace feels good. I may not feel like I have done anything worth the pain but we still need to fight the guilt to give our bodies what they need sometimes &lt;3 Hey, have you tried medication yet for the cramps?\n\n2 years ago I had leg cramps every night. My legs were always sore and in so much pain. I could barely walk most days I was in so much pain. My neurologist prescribed me trileptal, and my cramps were completely gone. Most of my leg pain was soreness from the constant cramps, so most of my pain went away. I literally got my life back for a while. \n\n\nMy new neurologist has not seen trileptal being prescribed for leg cramps often, so I am not saying that trileptal specifically is your answer. But if you have not tried medications yet, I would definitely look into it. I am in pain every day even if I do not do anything. I feel like a badass because of it. Like, I am killin\u2019 it. Not because I am \u201cbreaking my back\u201d but because I am living a happy life. Our society puts way to much value on physical work but that is ableism. Reject it. Do things when you can. Stop when you cannot. And find an exercise program that work for you to stay as strong as you can. Compare yourself to yourself. Not to others. Shame has been worse than pain, in my life. I got therapy to deal with shame, and it really helped.  EMDR is the kind of therapy that worked for me.\nI was surprised to realize that my whole CMT-ridden family tree was ashamed about having a hereditary disease. \nNot my problem any more. I \u201couted\u201d the whole tribe.  No more misdiagnosing the CMT, and no more shame around that topic. \nI do try to conceal the fact that I am in pain, because I do not want to answer questions about it or have my friends and family focus on that. \nIt is just not interesting to talk about pain with anybody that cannot make me not hurt. Since pain and fatigue are all part of my situation, I use fatigue as my excuse if I need to avoid an activity. I tell folks I want them to come back and tell me about their adventures. \nIf they ask, I tell them I do not like to talk about pain. Then I question them about something they like, to change the subject.", "Pfizer vaccine Has any of you gotten Pfizer vaccine? What were your side effects? I am getting my first dose next week, I will post my experiences afterwards.\n\nEdit: Maybe we should add a poll? I had both doses early on. No problems. You good fam I had no issues with the Pfizer. Just a sore arm like most people. No issues with Pfizer, you should be good. I was tired and my arm was sore for about a day. Got my second shot on Friday. The side effects have just been the feeling of an obvious immune response. Bit achey and tired for a day. But nothing specifically concerning food cmt. I had my first shot of Pfizer on May 31 and three weeks later I could not hold a pen/write with my writing hand. I have never experienced CMT symptoms in my hands, only lower legs. It is since subsided with occasional weakness, but I do think it was vaccine related. I am seeing a neuromuscular doctor about it. I have only had the first dose at this point, but no symptoms so far! Did you go for the second shot? I have not had the opportunity yet, and since my hand issue a few weeks ago it is been on my mind because I do not know what to do about my second. I have a few ill people in my family that COVID may kill if they got it, and an increase in symptoms will likely not kill me so it is probably best I do. Most strong cases of neuropathy symptoms subside from what I have read. Really tough decision though, and I am glad to hear most people in this thread have not had a similar experience to mine.\n\nEdit: adding that my cousin (of the same family) had AZ and the day after her second shot she could not feel her legs or arms and had trouble walking, and has since been diagnosed with Guillain Barre. Reading the Government of Canada\u2019s website and there has been an increase of GB diagnosis of people who had the AZ shot. She had never had neuropathy symptoms before that. No problems at all. It may not be the vaccine directly what caused those problems. The shots make everyones arms sore  so maybe with CMT the pain is more noticeable. Tips for dealing with the pain and reduce severity are icing and heat the arms. Do exercises that lift them it also reduces swelling. If you dont get the second shot you can get covid which is way worse for your body. I have not had any pain, it is weakness that I have experienced. But good point, it may not have been. No problems. I have read some studies of adverse reactions for those with neuropathies\u2026assess the risk to you and those around you before deciding for or against. And could you link those studies? I will try and find them\u2026my neurologist had cautioned me, so I was looking for my own (not trying to convince anyone). I have had COVID and get tested for the antibodies every 6 weeks or so. Over 5 months and still have them. I will be waiting for you to link them as I searched on the internet and there was no study for vaccines and neuromuscular diseases so I would like to read those studies myself. Second shot knocked me off my feet for 3 days with a 103~ fever. Suddenly felt way better on the night of the 3rd day though Have you had any lingering effects for a long time? Or you are fine now? No lingering effects whatsoever, just the burst of fever/chills Minor soreness after each shot, headache and mild nausea the day after the second shot. After that, everything was back to normal! Is there any data in how those with neuropathie respond to CORONA? Does it set people back? Zero problems. However, getting Covid can kill you so it is really a no brainer No problem for me neither sister or brother or mother. We all have cmt1a. Was the weakness in both hands or just one of them? If only one, was it on the same arm as you recieved the shot? Any other symptoms other than muscle weakness (loss of sensation, pain, decreased joint mobility)? I have also seen reports linking a few of the vaccines to Guillain Barre, it seems to be a very small risk, but of course we are hyper aware regarding neuro symptoms.\n\nI have not been able to get vaccinated yet (low supplies in my area), and it wont have any impact on my decision, like you the small risk of a temporary increase in symptoms is not worth risking covid or the potential of passing it on. It was in my left hand and I got the shot in my right arm three weeks prior. No other symptoms aside from the weakness. Strange is not it. It is pretty much back to normal now. I just had my first dose of Pfizer about 6 hours ago. I have the same symptoms, a sore arm at the injection site and tiredness. Will update this post if I experience anything else. I hope you feel better soon! :) Thank you! :) Was horribly sick after both doses, for about 2-3 weeks each. Still having some trouble walking but that might just be from the lack of exercise.  Agree with this. Additionally, my doctor and I believe I had covid and when I was sick I lost feeling in my right calf and never regained it. You are more likely to get covid and suffer damage than something happening from the vaccine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAll that happened when I got the vaccine were the expected immune responses: a mild fever, fatigue, and my shoulder was sore for a few days. I actually had lingering bronchial spasms from when I would been sick and they totally disappeared after I got the vaccine. Hoping that is over for good lol. The first one was more rough for me than the 2nd, but immune responses only lasted 1-3 days. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was very adamant about getting it(because of this and I was in the thick of my eating disorder at the time) before I found out that the news stories about neurological symptoms were on cases that were found to have no relation to the vaccine, symptoms just occurred simultaneously by coincidence. \nYou should be fine OP, I think we are in a high risk category and nothing in the vaccine is neurotoxic. I would definitely discuss it with your doctor. ", "Stuff That Works There is a new website called Stuff that Works. They are creating an online community where people with different diseases and ailments can join the appropriate group. \nIt allows you to share stuff that works, or does not, dr info etc\n\nPlease consider joining:\n(", "A few questions if possible About to get diagnosed I am seeing a neurologist soon and think all my research points to CMT.\n\nDoes this sound familiar to anyone?\n\nAt age 24 I noticed my feet would go numb after I exercised (30m) I also developed a tingling in my toes or when I stretched my feet out. Later on age 44 I noticed my feet went numb in hardly cold weather after 5 minutes.\n\nAt age 46 I noticed suddenly enough loss of sensation to feel uncomfortable and trouble walking. Even comfortable shoes make me lose sensation and feet burn.\n\nHow can this be anything other than CMT?\n\nI also have Kyphosis and I think hammertoes. It certainly sounds neurological to me and CMT is obviously the neurological difficulty we are most familiar with here. It sounds like it could very well be CMT but there is a reason doctors examine you and do not go off a checklist of symptoms: a trained eye might spot something you are not even aware of. And there are other rare neurological difficulties that a neurologist will want to rule out before making a diagnosis. \n\nIf you get a genetic test done that will not only confirm that it is CMT but also let you know what type. Thank you NixyeNox, I am planning to ask my Neurologist for genetic testing of the condition. From what I understand, knowing the type may help give some guidance on the rate and effects to come. I am open for it to be another condition but this sounds right. Sounds very CMT-like to me. Have you had an EMG? Did have a EMG 2.5 years ago that came out normal", "Country music star, Alan Jackson, has CMT  I am telling everyone that we are cousins. I would say \"Oh hey, that is cool\", but it is not a cool thing. But people read this and we get some exposure which *is* cool. Wow! Maybe he will start a foundation or something! This exposure is good!", "Daughter with CMT 2A Hi all, long time lurker, so I guess it is time about time. \n\nMy almost 4 year old daughter was diagnosed with CMT Type 2A about a year and a half ago. It is been a rollercoaster of emotions and appointments since then. Her main symptoms are her ankles/legs. Major drop foot symptoms and her left leg has started twisting inward bad. She essentially has no function of anything below her calves. Her Achilles\u2019 tendon is extremely tight as well. Originally she was fitted with AFOs (night time and day time ones that she wears religiously) and things looked like they were progressing. We were excited. She was excited. She started to improve, she could actually walk. Then her left leg started twisting and her ankles got so tight she could not fit in her braces. Then the casting started. 6 weeks of casts and she took it like a champ. Casts came off and she had gained back the ability to bend her ankle to 90 degrees or less which was a huge deal compared to before. Things were going great. Then about a couple of months or so ago her legs massively digressed. She was at the point where she cannot fit her AFOs and could not walk again. We went in to her specialist and they started her second casting series however due to the rapid digression they are looking at surgery pretty heavily to extend her Achilles\u2019 tendon. She is about to have the casts removed tomorrow after being in them for about 2 months with this series. \n\nAs a father I am struggling, she is taken all of it with amazing stride though. She thinks the braces/casts give her super powers. Honestly she is handling it much better then I am. However I am starting to see that she is gaining a very basic comprehension as to the gravity of what is going on. I want to protect her as much as I can. I know I cannot snap my fingers and make everything change but is there anything you as a community can suggest to make even the smallest difference? Any quick tricks you have towards bettering quality of life with AFOs and CMT?\n \nThings I have done so far:\nSo I have gotten her these high ankle shoes that zip along the sides and down to the toes. Those make helping put her shoes on easier and seem to do wonders for her. She is about to get her casts off tomorrow and I saw somewhere on here that someone suggested putting dr scholls in the AFO to reduce arch pain so we are going to be trying that as well. \n\nLike I said anything and everything helpful is greatly appreciated, even if it is just an FYI regarding this to look for in the future. \n\nThank you all. Doe she wear any braces when she sleeps?  I had similar (but from the sound of it not quite as bad) problems when I was younger.  I had to have Achilles lengthening surgery when I was 8 because I could not put my heels down and could only stand short amounts of time.  The surgery helped a lot and afterwards I had to wear these big black boots on both feet when I slept to hold my ankles from tightening in my sleep.  I had to do that for years, i think i stopped finally when i was 14 or 15. I would look into tendon transfer surgery. (Aka triple arthrodesis) when I was a kid I had severe problems with my ankles and feet. I had the surgery when 14 and 15 and it changed my life. I became much more mobile and was no longer in pain. The positives of the surgery lasted another 20 years and then I started losing some of the positives as the disease continued to progress. But I got 20 years of pretty amazing mobility out of it with little pain. It is a popular surgery for kids with CMT. \n\n She does, she has night time AFOs that are majorly padded for comfort at night. From talking to doctors surgery is 100% in her future. They are trying to wait until she is 8 at this point. \n\nThank your for your response. That is amazing, ya surgery to assist with the tendon is for sure in her future. They (doctors) are wanting to wait until she is 8 before they do the surgery though. \n\nThank you for your response. Have you contacted Dr. Glen Pheiffer? I have a three year old that is just now starting to grasp the reality of her condition also. We are super new to this and everything is happening so fast. God bless you, stay strong your an angel. I really know nothing, and we have not contacted him ourselves but we are only a couple months into diagnosis and only frustration and confusion had fallen on us. We e are on our second specialist and geneticist. We have a special case and cannot get definitive answers so our next hope it is Dr. Glen. Stay strong and try not to think about the negatives, make memories from any situation, live and love. You need to laugh often, your the man. Is she seeing a physical therapist regularly? Physical therapy and occupational therapy really help my son. It is play-based therapy, so he enjoys going every week.\n\nAlso, I do try to show my son pictures and stories of people with disabilities. I do not think it needs to be success stories of a disabled person who faced adversity due to their disability and overcame it. But just a cool article and the person happens to be in a wheelchair or has AFOs. I do not want the focus to be overcoming the disability, but normalizing the idea that people with disabilities can be successful without being defined by their disability. I hope that makes sense Has your daughter had much physio? It sounds like she is quite severe but daily exercises could really do wonders for her range and motion and building up some strength too. I was diagnosed at 3 with 1A (I am now 22) and I remember it being quite intense with physio, check ups, AFO castings and the like (though I was not as bad as you are daughter is). For me, it took a long time to build up any kind of strength and I would fall over multiple times a day. I think when I went to physio consistently for a while, I was able to get stronger and did not struggle quite so much with it.\n\nOn the flip side, your daughter will grow up remembering how much you have been involved in her health and trying to make her life easier. Though it is hard now, getting these early interventions in place for her will only better her situation in the future, and no doubt she will be incredibly grateful for everything you have done to help.", "Need help for my father who suffers from CMT Hello everyone! I just found this community and you all seem like pleasant people so I was wondering if I could get some insight. \n\nMy dad is 60 years old and suffers from CMT. The disease has progress to the point where he has difficulty standing and walking and the neuropathy has begun to effect his hands as well. He was an artist and outdoorsman his whole life, so he is been pretty depressed now that he is been physically struggling to do things he used to love doing. \n\nI know many of you here suffer from this illness, so I wanted to know: what is the best way I can help my dad? I keep the house clean and do the shopping and whatnot, and I really want to make him as comfortable as possible. I do not know what to do. I do not want him to feel like he is a burden or that I pity him or anything. He is my dad and I love him. I just want to know what I can do to help. This all depends on your dad's personality, but if he is receptive to it: offer to help with seemingly menial but hand-focused tasks. Like, if you are handing him a water bottle, pill bottle, container, etc. open it before you hand it to him. If he is not tech-savvy, trying showing him the potential of a computer- videos on outdoorsman-y things, ways to make art digitally. Computers work wonders for those of us with CMT- as his hands become worse and he struggles to handwrite, typing is way easier. Absolutely handwriting is much more difficult as it progresses. So sorry to hear about your dad. I am pretty much in the same boat at the same age. I miss hiking like crazy so I am trying cycling (a cruiser bike with flat-foot technology) and also volunteer at an amazing state park one of the historical buildings. I get free rides around the park on the golf cart too. I am also an artist and have a lot of trouble hanging on to the charcoal (pen, brush, etc.) and standing at an easel. I have not really figured out a good way to deal with this unfortunately. I now have just a small sketchbook and a few pens I like. I just do my best to keep it all in perspective. One of my best friends has post-polio and the best sarcastic sense of humor. Humor helps. Good luck to you and your dad.", "Hi Just wanted to say hi , I am 40 years old have cmt got the age when it is becoming harder . \n\nThought I would join so can support each other . \n\nRichard from the UK here, currently at the stage when I am finding it hard find trainers . Walking in the countryside  is becoming harder also . \n\nAnkles losing weight,  and signs strength is going in my hands  \n\nAnyway love to share.  Anything ot tips or just want to shout out and say its hard let me know am here Hi Richard! I know that finding shoes (I am from the US, assuming you mean trainers as in shoes) is also a struggle for me, but in the past couple of years I have had great luck with Clark's brand shoes. YMMV, though, I am female so it is a completely different shoe set. Welcome! I do not have extensive knowledge of what shoes are available in the UK but I generally wear Keens shoes or hiking boots. They are wide in the toes which I find important--apparently it is common to need a wide toe area when you have high arches, as so many of us do. Hi thanks for spending time to reply really nice of you.  \n\nWill have a look , its such a horrible and awkward experience  purchasing shoes my partner does not quite understand it. \n\nAnd its great to talk to you guys about this among other things of course. That is great thank you ill have a look wide  seems such a better option Hi Richard, for shoes check out the UK brand Hoka One One - they were recommended to me by a specialist for CMT. Also, you can get insoles prescribed for you under the NHS which I highly recommend, although the prescribing doctor needs to understand the basics of CMT otherwise they can make matters worse. I have put some tips here:\n\n  \n(\n\nFor improving strength, you may want to try to quickly see if you can improve strength in your lower legs and hands:\n\n( Hi. I can recommend meindl shoes. I just love them. Stable, very good quality, durable, wide toe area especially the special version med+ or so. It is easy to take out the inner sole to replace it with a special insole. I wear one pair without problems a full year daily until I have to get new ones. I only wear meindl the last 10 years. Try them. Thanks is it me but my feet seem narrow and high arch went to sketchers and found that all the shoes were soon comfy but just too wide.", "Need some insight on CMT4B1 test result as 'uncertain' Happy to see this sub reddit group. My husband was diagnosed with SFN 4 weeks back and the genetic testing results that came back yesterday showed the result as 'uncertian' for CMT4B1. Did anyone had this type of results ? Did you do further tests to confirm the disease ? Thank you! I am guessing SFN is Small Fiber Neuropathy? Was he diagnosed with one of the genes for that or was the diagnosis based on a physical exam and then a genetic screen found only the CMT4B1 variant? Yes, they did a skin biopsy and confirmed small fiber neuropathy. His physical symptoms are tingling and numbness in the legs, specifically after a bowel movement. The nerve conduction tests did not show any problems. Then they did a genetic test where it showed that the variant for CMT4B1 was of uncertain significance. Thanks for taking the time to respond. A lot of people with CMT have small fiber neuropathy but it is not something that usually comes up because most of us do not have a skin biopsy done and it is just one part of our overall condition. I am guessing your husband got this done because at first glance his symptoms are not typical CMT symptoms. \n\nA \"variant of uncertain significance\" is a tough diagnosis to deal with since basically they are telling you that they think the problem stems from this particular gene but they have never seen this particular version before--or perhaps they have seen it a couple of times but they just do not have enough information to say exactly what to expect this gene to do. It is hard because when you get a diagnosis you think the doctor will then tell you what to expect and with something like this it is hard to predict. \n\nCMT4B1 is generally a quite rare and serious disease. The good news is that your husband's version sounds as though it is more mild than most people who have a problem with this gene. A geneticist may be able to look at his full results and compare them to other known cases to get a better idea of what to expect. Thank you for such a detailed explanation. You are right, it took nearly 10 years to even diagnose SFN. Your words are consoling. Hopefully it stays mild and not progressing. We will get in touch with geneticist. Ten years? It must be a relief to have at least the beginnings of an answer after so long. The correct term is probably Genetic Counselor (if you are in the US) btw. Good luck! Phoo.. it was misdiagnosed multiple times as the pain associated with the herniated disk he had before..I am in US, thanks again, will get in touch with genetic counselor The good news is that CMT remains relatively dormant through adulthood, but muscular atrophy can occur so staying on top of that is essential where possible.  That is a great news. Thank you! We are new to CMT. Can you please share some of the things you have done to help with the muscular atrophy ? My husband also has tingling and cold feet after bowel movements and even sitting for 15 mins.  I see your flair as CMT 1A , how different is CMT4B1 ? I have never heard anyone describe CMT as remaining \"relatively dormant through adulthood\" before. I think that would come as a bit of a surprise to the people here who progressed in various ways during their 20s, 30s, 40s, ect. \n\nCMT is typically a slowly progressive disorder. It follows a path which is often predictable based on the age of onset of noticeable symptoms and the degree of impairment at that time. There can be surprises--typically legs are impacted first and more severely but some people find their hands are worse. Usually people have high arches but a fair number of people have flat feet instead. This is all based on people with the more common types of CMT, of course. \n\nCMT4 (all subtypes) is far more rare than CMT1A. CMT4B1 is typically more severe than CMT1A but since your husband has an unknown variant I would not worry too much about that. He does not appear to have had a severe early onset as is typical of the known CMT4B1 cases so there is good reason to believe his disease course will be better than other CMT4B1 cases. Thank you! Hopefully his course is better. He is 33. His symptoms of tingling , back, leg pain and cold feet started 10 years back. He often complains of his back aching even after sitting for 15 mins . His job  demands him to sit though. Did any of you experienced cold feet and tingling after bowel movement? (\n\nAll the research is very clear with regards to CMT progression. The nerve degeneration in adulthood is minimal at best and the disease has literally been described by researchers as being effectively dormant.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; It follows a path which is often predictable based on the age of onset of noticeable symptoms and the degree of impairment at that time. \n\nDo you have any sources for that? The research I have come across states the opposite - the majority of damage is done in the first decade of life, and the rate of decline from there on is relatively slow, albeit this is using the CMT NS which is frankly an utterly unacceptable and archaic way of monitoring the disease. In short, I have had to resort to using ( for any sort of muscle growth. Why muscle growth is impacted in people with CMT is not known, but it is known that muscle growth naturally can be severely limited by the disease. My guess is that it may be lower levels of IGF-1 which is seen in some other neuropathies, but that is just a guess. \n\nAll CMT's share some similarities e.g. distal muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, and frequent high arched feet, although CMT4B1can usually appear more severely in  childhood with other symptoms such as breathing issues, facial and vocal cord weakness, although it is worth noting that CMT subtypes can have a lot of unexplained crossovers e.g. hearing loss in type 1A, even though it should only occur in type 2. I am sorry, but can you link to some actual papers/research on that. Also it is my understanding that the various types of CMT often work very differently, and I am not sure you can say that the research on CMT 1A is the same as that for other forms... The papers are on the page - the references are AMA format, underneath the Key Point section. Feel free to dig more into it, I would recommend starting with the paper \"Clinical Progression in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A duplication: clinico-electrophysiological and MRI longitudinal study of a family.\" It is very interesting with a wealth of good references. CMT1A is a disorder which impairs muscle impulses by thinning and weakening the myelin sheath which acts as electrical insulation on the wires of the peripheral nerves. CMT4B1 is a disorder which impairs the signaling molecules which transmit messages between neurons in the peripheral nervous system. There are similarities in that both impair the ability of nerve impulses to transmit properly in the peripheral nervous system. \n\nThere appear to be fewer than 100 cases of CMT4B1reported in the literature. I would like to stress that all of these cases appear to have reduced nerve conduction velocities, which your husband does not. That plus his later age of onset, milder symptoms, and unique variant means that the reported cases are only a weak guide to what he can expect. \n\nJoeBob the Steroid Guy and I have some differences of opinion about CMT1A impacts and disease course and I frankly do not have time to address them today. However, I would urge you to take any advice relying on CMT1A with a grain of salt and to consult a professional genetic counselor rather than taking advice from Random Internet People including myself. \n\nI hope someone else with CMT4B1 comes by and can comment on this but the rareness of his condition makes it somewhat unlikely, unfortunately. He may want to consider registering to participate in research studies like this one: ( as his variant is not really known yet and knowledge of his symptoms may be able to help guide others in the future. Thank you for the detailed response! He scheduled an appointment with the neurologist and genetic counselor . I will ask him to register in the link mentioned above. It took a decade to find out he has SFN and hopefully we get something sooner now to start his treatment Thank you ! We will explore on SAMS. No problem - if you want any guidance on SARMS and CMT, please feel free to reach out to me or the forum on CMT Central. I have used several over the course of the last few years and had really meaningful results from them, although they are not without side-effects.", "Keyboard Piano I recently bought a keyboard piano to teach myself how to play. My hands are not too affected by CMT but I do still have mild symptoms. I am excited to teach myself how to play and also know that perhaps this can act as a form of OT. \n\nDoes anyone here play a musical instrument? Have you seen it benefit you in any way? Dexterity for sure. I play tons of instruments :)  \n\n\n\\*I mostly produce through FL now though (Fruity Loops) &gt;:)\n\n:) I grew up playing piano from about age 8-18. I bought a piano again when I was 30. I never was going to be a concert pianist. But I do love it. It does help with hand strength and dexterity, definitely.   \n\n\nI also play guitar, and a variety of other random little instruments that might be laying around. My parents put me in lessons as a kid but I did not like it (maybe because of CMT) so I stopped. Picked up the drums instead. Now I regret it because I have reached my limit as far as how well I can play and the piano is just such a more versatile instrument. No one ever says \u201coh you play the drums? Come serenade us in our living room!\u201d I used to play the cello. I was in orchestra all through school. I have been teaching myself guitar for about a year and a half now. I feel like it does help my hands some but at the same time it is really frustrating because I feel limited some days. My friend started probably 6 months after me and he learns so much faster that I do as well as do lots of things I feel like I cannot. Maybe I am just impatient with it I am not really sure. I am a professional musician and gig quite often. I mainly play guitar and sing. I think my hands have definitely kept nimble because I play guitar, though they are definitely fading with time I have CMT type 2a, my symptoms are pretty mild. Some days I have slight fingers spasms but nothing too major. Ever since quarantine I picked up my ukelele and I have not played since I was in junior high. It is been about 8 years or so. It is super fun and rewarding rather than going on my phone. I noticed I have to really apply pressure which is a little tough, but nothing two fingers down cannot help :) I have learned how to play on a cheap-ish Yamaha keyboard. I can only play for a little while until my hands get tired, but it is mostly because most of the music I play have very wide chords. It is especially pronounced when I have to use the little fingers often to get enough reach. I have reconciled with the fact that I will never be the next Rachmaninoff and that everything I learn is probably temporary because of the relentlessly progressive nature of the CMT, but that is okay because I knew that from the start and I only play for my own enjoyment. I do not see any benefit in terms of muscle strength or fatigue, but I have noticed that if I take too long breaks from playing it takes a little while to get back into it. Clarinet since the age of 10. It benefited, but also frustrated so badly. Mentally I was getting good and wanting to play with better groups, but physically was not at the level. So, moved to bigger instruments with less intricate parts. My CMT has affected my hands a lot but I play the piano. It has definitely kept my hands from atrophying too much and has kept them stronger. It is really good exercise and was my replacement for OT for years. I highly recommend.", "Best friend made me a cane my birthday. I am a cane guy now. It is a goddam beautiful cane though.  That is a ripper of a cane!  What a great friend! Can I ask what braces you are wearing? I need to get something different. Soon!", "Anyone else had their legs described as Pringle cans?  My calves are really well suited to the classic description: inverted champagne bottle legs. \n\nI have super thin ankles and pretty bulky upper calves. It is like you can almost see exactly how far the neurons can get their messages through reliably :P That is a new one. Chicken legs was always the go to for me. I have little to no calf muscles.

Thanks def will check them out Loving the 'Homer wearing a muumuu' tattoo. They look ok to me. Not in proportion to the rest of me haha THIS! Burning feet!I have commented several times about the pure hell of burning feet and many have said that is not a classic CMT problem. Now, I need to find those shoes in a 13/14 4EEE", "Babies I am starting to think about baby #2, and the first after I learned of my CMT diagnosis. Really wrestling with what to do \u2014 IVF and pre-implantation genetic screening? Natural conception and then prenatal screening, with the attendant risks and difficult decisions depending on results? Just get pregnant, proceed normally, and accept whatever the outcome is? Im thinking about my age, and money, in addition to the medical and emotional factors, too. My insurance does not cover any assisted reproductive measures. \n\nHas anyone gone through this process? Would love to hear your thoughts. I do not have any children but we did consider IVF at one point. The process is lengthy, uncomfortable, and expensive. Which is not at all to say that you should not do it but you should really know what you are getting into with each of these options. \n\nI would suggest making an appointment with a fertility clinic and having them fully outline the processes for both IVF with pre-implantation screening and prenatal screening so you know what the options really look like, such as the number of months of hormone injections to try to get eggs for IVF, what the surgery to do that is like, and the costs involved. \n\nIf you have CMT1A then you know it is a 50-50 chance without interventions. If you have a more uncommon variant you might also want to discuss the odds of passing it along. Thank you! Yes, I have CMT1A. It is hard enough not knowing my child\u2019s status (I am struggling with whether to do genetic testing when he has no signs currently, but will be talking to a pediatric neurologist next month). Giving him a sibling is extremely important to me for several personal reasons (too much to go into here), and I am also not opposed to adoption, etc. No matter what choice I make, it is a lot. Thank you for your comment. This may be completely none of my business, but curious if you have any issues with balance and being pregnant? My CMT got significantly worse about a year and half after my son was born (did not have a dx until then). Now that I have more difficulty walking/balancing I really question if another pregnancy is even an option? Hi! That is totally fine! I did not notice any major differences; I was diagnosed very recently, my son is 2, but it was not related to symptoms so much as a random series of unrelated medical events. I would be curious to know if there is any predictability to CMT and pregnancy, but my guess is like everything else with this condition, everyone is experience is different. Ugh. what is your cmt type if you do not mind me asking? Mine is 1A \u2014 if you are asking me! I do know someone in my family whose CMT (type 1A) got worse during her pregnancy, though I am not sure if it was because of the pregnancy itself (hormones?) or just because she was unable to get any exercise at all the last couple of months. Pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) will not test for CMT. It only looks at the chromosomes to make sure there are 2 of each-- no more, no less. You would need Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to test for CMT. Both you and your partner would need genetic testing, then they make a probe to check for the mutation. This can take up to 3 months and costs like $5k - $10k in the US for just this test. IVF costs vary. My husband and I shelled out about $100k and we opted not to do PGD in the end (but still required IVF). \n\nOnce pregnant, the only tests that you can have to detect CMT are invasive tests where you run the risk of miscarriage. The risk is minor (for amnio it is about 1 in 900), but that is too large a risk for me personally when it would not the outcome. You would have to wait until your second trimester to have this. The non-invasive first trimester tests only look at chromosomes. True! Thanks for the info, and best of luck :) That is an important distinction, thanks. The money is a huge factor. I know, obviously, that a child is expensive to raise, and I am prepared for that, but I do not know if I can also swing a $100K \u201cdown payment\u201d beforehand. I also had to do 4 rounds. I was 41 and 42 and had lost an ovary, so I was going to need more rounds. But testing for CMT could lead to more rounds unless you get a lot of eggs. There are some clinics that do it all way cheaper than my clinic too, but meds can be super expensive (it was about $5000 per round for me). Everything has to be paid up front too. It is rough financially, physically, and emotionally. But it can totally be worth it! \n\nIf you do decide to move forward, check out the IVF subreddit. There are great groups on Facebook too. There is so much to learn in the world of IVF! And I think it is a very powerful feeling to know you can make sure your child does not have CMT! So potentially unpopular opinion, but I have always thought I would just go ahead like normal regardless of the CMT and accept the outcome. I might be biased though. Almost my entire family has CMT, and we are a huge family. A few of us wear AFOs and have trouble with our feet/hands, but otherwise I do not think most of us feel as if this has radically affected our lives in any way. Pregnancy is not fun from what my relatives have told me (I have not been pregnant yet), but personally I would still risk it rather than spend $$$$ on procedures or adoption. That is just me though, and no judgment on anyone else for choosing differently. Totally get your position. I wish I could feel the same, but with the way my family has dealt with medical stuff (let us pretend nothing is wrong even when it is staring us in the face), I want to do everything I can to control the things I can, knowing how much I cannot. I also struggle with how I will feel about sharing the complicating factor of CMT with any potential partner/baby daddy (I am a single parent to my son). I do not judge you for your position at all, I envy it! Best of luck with whatever you decide, I do not have kids, and it gives me a bit of peace knowing that CMT in my family does with me, my grandmother had it my father has it, and now me. Luckily my brother and his 2 kids do not have it. My wife and I did IVF with PGD.  The entire process took about 3 months from start to pregnancy.  Our insurance covered about half of it.  We paid about $12,000 out of pocket to produce embryos and another $2,500 per implantation. \n\nOnce cycle yielded 27 eggs fertilized.  Of those 27, 9 matured to be genetically tested.  Of the 9, 5 of them had CMT and 1 had other chromosomal issues.  This left us with 3 viable embryos.  2 of the 3 were successfully implanted in my wife and we have a 4 year old and 2 year old that are CMT free. Thank you! Congratulations on your kiddos! Those money numbers are huge. It helps me to see then spelled out, though. &gt; it gives me a bit of peace knowing that CMT in my family does with me\n\nJust One of the reasons I too chose not to have children. Personally, I could not live with myself if I passed on any of my genetic neurological problems to my child.\n\nHappy Birthday!", "CMT Treatment Report --- a page I made that automatically keeps track of new &amp; upcoming treatment options for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease... links to the latest News, Research, Clinical trials, Projects/Grants, etc ... organized, all on one page, non-commercial ...

Thanks for the feedback! You are the second person to suggest adding source next to link, recently, and I think you are right. It makes it easier to choose which articles / items to click on. Plus it is easier to remember what you have read.\n\nI will be experimenting with source and also small auto-thumbnails.\n\nThanks again! Thanks for making this. Was recently diagnosed with CMT based on EMG/NCV and pes cavus/atrophy. Still waiting on genetic testing for confirmation/type but this resource is really encouraging to see that their hope. You are welcome :)", "How worried should I be? Just a bunch of questions for people who were in similar situations: I am a 21 male, got diagnosed rather early (had trouble during childhood like most people with the disease have I would reckon, fell often and so on) but so far I had a reasonably good life. I have a somewhat athletic body (in spite of that, I should add that I am not all that athletic, mostly due to feet general weakness, although that does not really bother me with casual exercise like walking). My calves are pretty big for a CMT person, many doctors having told me on first sight that I was wrongly diagnosed (later revealed to be just a bad first impression). Hands are mostly ok, but they tend to tremor pretty heavily when I am anxious or stressed. Some reduced mobility with precise movements (tying necklaces or so) but nothing too severe. I do not know how relevant it is, but my mother and grandfather (both with CMT) lived a mostly normal life, with minor inconveniences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the question is: what can I expect from this disease in the future? Will I be able to continue living a somewhat normal life, does it go downhill fast? Should I be worried? Also, I do not know the type, I generally think of this disease as taboo. I am not a sensitive person, but I simply avoided looking into it out of fear perhaps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for future help and apologies if I sound spoiled or offensive to people with worse symptoms than I have. Generally speaking, CMT is slowly progressive. You should have a pretty good idea of how your symptoms will develop over your lifetime by the time you are 21 and it is generally good news in your case. Since you are still walking OK now there is a good chance that will continue for quite some time, particularly if you keep active in simple ways like walking every day and maybe see a physical therapist who specializes in neurological disorders if you start to have trouble doing that. \n\nCMT is not typically a disease which surprises people. It is characteristically a disease that develops slowly and without big jumps. Now there can be events that provoke a sudden increase, like if you broke your legs and could not walk for months, that would be harder for you to come back from than it would be for someone without CMT. Less obviously, there are a few drugs that can worsen CMT and it might be a good idea to look over that list:  (  Mostly these are prescription medications so you might just want to direct your doctor to the list if it looks like there is a conflict with any treatments. It sounds like you are doing okay for yourself so far, progression of the muscle-wasting part of the disease can be slowed down by stretching and working out. I would go get tested though and find out your type, it is a simple blood test, super easy. Especially if you plan on having kids in the future, it is good to know as much as possible about this. Severity in the disease can vary greatly, even between family members. For example, my dad is moderate-severe (mostly due to age) and my half-siblings are very mild with just bad feet and mild weakness, but me and my brother are far worse. I am 26 and have congenital hip dysplasia, scoliosis, partial feeling loss in my feet and moderate general weakness. My brother has very high arches on his feet that required surgery, kyphosis, scoliosis and weakness. So we got it a lot worse lol.\n\nAs mentioned before, it is a slow developing thing, you should not really be caught off guard by symptoms especially if you keep on top of your physical well being. Do not feel bad for having this condition, my friend, you are not alone and you are supported! I only suggest getting tested so you can arm yourself with as much info as possible to prepare for the future. It all depends on how you go about it. You can think \u201cwoe is me\u201d and you will probably get worse. Or you can accept the situation and take it on as a challenge to overcome. \n\nAlso there is no better time to be diagnosed because of the amount of potential treatments and cures that are on the way. I agree with your input. I really hope that he finds a good doctor. I was diagnosed in 2014 and about 8 different doctors did not did  their due diligence and and read my neurologist EMG report. After a long painful 8 years, I took it upon myself to Google my results. Not until then EVERYTHING made sense. What did not make sense was the fact the no doctor ever took the time to read my report. One of the doctors told me that my EMG came back normal. 3 months later after my company went bankrupt and ran out of private insurance he told me the opposite. Are not came back abnormal and refer me to a neurosurgeon.\nAt this time I had to resort to government assisted insurance. The treatment with government assisted insurance Was immediately apparent.\nI showed up to my appointment and he was out of the office and I did not get a phone call to let me know that the appointment has been canceled. Since then I have been told that I am only seeking opiates. \nIt has been an uphill battle with many doctors. I hope that you do have private insurance because the treatment is definitely different. Thank you, Nix for the link. I will check it out. Thanks for all the support! I had some issues coming to term with my limitations.. I guess I still am to some extent. I had scoliosis too, but it was not too bad and slightly got corrected in time. For now I have no muscular cramps, pain, and the sensations are still there. I somehow also have decent reflexes for a person with CMT. I will pick up a more intense sport soon, I had reservartions in doing it because I would probably not be very good at it, which frustrates me. Being a perfectionist with inborn limitations sucks for me.\n\nAnyway, thanks a lot again. You rock Do you think any valuable treatment will be available in the near future? I do not closely follow news about it, so apologies for asking Oh yes definitely. PXT3003. ACE something something. There are a lot of treatments in phases 1, 2, and 3 of clinical trials. And cures are on the way not only for CMT but for most genetic and neurological problems. \n\nBut until then it is important to keep a positive mindset and to stay in control of your thoughts and feelings. Overcome your CMT. Exercise is your best medicine right now. Go walking, bike riding or jogging if you can. Lots of stretching too. You are welcome. :) I get the perfectionist thing lol, I am a digital artist and the hand shakes are annoying af to work around. Thankfully my art programs have stabilizers for line work, but it is not a 100% fix. But that is just what we do in the CMT world, we find workarounds and our own versions of normal, as would anyone! I hope you will not let this stop you from trying out stuff you like, because I am sure you will be great at it regardless of your condition. :P Best wishes!! I must admit I am not with others on \"it depends on how you take it\" or \"if you will not be active, it will be worse\". I know people who got worse even when the exercised every day, at a quite young age. There is simply no link today between exercise and CMT. CMT is related to damaged nerves (for different reasons, based on the type) hence exercise = does not cure or prevents anything. It does make people feel good and healthy, but that is not CMT specific.\n\nSo my answer is simple, but probably not what you were expecting for: no one knows how your future will look like. I am not saying do not exercise, I simply say do not get your hopes high on exercise preventing or slowing down anything. From a more scientific point of view, you should know that most people experience a critical decline after age 50. The good news: you are young + you are aware of your status. I am also optimistic about science finding some kind of treatment for CMT patients until you will reach 50.\n\nAnyway, go and make most out of life, until it becomes challenging and even then, I am sure you will find there are plenty of things left for you to do and enjoy life, simply in a different way.", " Friday Feelings - Small Celebrations Little things that went right this week. \n\nTimes when CMT could not stand in your way.\n\nVictories that you want to share. I finally did a full sit up in physio. Then did a set and wanted to die. That is a win, right? That is totally a win! went to the gym a few times this week for the first time in a while:) That is great!", "Best runners/trainers for working out? Does anyone have suggestions for good, supportive trainers/runners for the gym?? Ideally I would love anything Nike, puma, adidas but open to all suggestions Anything flat. I have been wearing Hokas and love them. Running stores carry them and I would recommend taking their quiz or go and try on some to get a feel for the them. They are very cushioned but lightweight; most expensive workout shoes I have purchased but 100% worth it. Merrel trail glove 4s have been the greatest shoe of all time for me.\n\nFlat shoes for sure, keep you flat and avoid rolling the ankle. \n\nTrail glove 4 has moved on to models 5 and 6 which unfortunately are not as good imo. Altra! They are flat and low profile so they do not contribute to tripping due to foot drop. They are also truly \"foot shaped\" so as not to exacerbate metatarsalgia. Highly recommended!  I find HOKAs to be nice and cushy which I thought was great at first, but the soles are so thick that they became a liability for me. Also still had metatarsalgia symptoms when I wore them. Came here to say Hokas. If you can get your hands on a pair of Bondi 6\u2019s, they changed my life. I cannot feel my left leg, but I do walk on it. Their shape helps me run and walk a ton more comfortably :) I cannot run without them or I trip.", "Video games and CMT Hi, I have got Type 1A fairly mild CMT (Atleast I think it is mild) and I have been playing video games pretty much my entire life and despite that, I am pretty bad at any shooters or anything that requires lots of fast, reaction type gameplay. \n\nThis has not really been a massive problem because I play for fun but I have never been able to break through this 'slightly above average' barrier in most games that require reflexes or 'skill shots' etc no matter how many hours I have put into the game.\n\nWell, since about a year ago I have been getting into MOBA's, for those who do not know, they are very complex, competitive pitched battle games with lots of different characters, strategy and require huge time commitments to be any good at them. My lack of ability to move my fingers fast enough and pull of complex 'plays' is really starting to show when  I hit a certain level and my 'game knowledge' is starting to so far exceed what I am able to do with my 'mechanical' skill that It is extremely frustrating.\n\nThis is most obvious when  I play the champion Sona, who has very little in the way of skill shots or aiming of abilities but like other champions in her role requires a deep understanding of the game and it is content to play efficiently.\n\nI am open to the idea that I just suck at video games, and it is got nothing to do with CMT but I was wondering if anyone had experienced anything similar and if they found anyway to deal with it. Hey there!\n\nFirst of all, let me say we have a lot in common. I still do not know my type, but doctors are certain that it is CMT. Like you, I have spent all my life playing videogames (I had a rough childhood and spent a lot of time in the hospital or at home). Now, I start to lose the grip of a controller and my thumbs get tired pretty easily. Controllers are forbidden for me, which is a shame because I really like to play FIFA.\n\nAs for Mona's (I play Heroes of the Storm), I share your experience. I notice that sometimes I think faster than my hand acts and get somewhat confused. Sometimes, I even lose the perception of the cursor's position and need to take a second looking for it. I have never played LoL, so I do not know Sora, but I tend to avoid characters who have a lot of skillshots or more complex mechanics (I rarely play Chromie and favor heroes like Raynor or Muradin).\n\nMy suggestion is to try and change your key bindings in a way that is easier for you to use them, changing your peripherals sensitivity or even buying new ones that may be more comfortable, ergonomic and that have soft switches (so you do not need to use as much energy/time clicking).\n\nGood luck :) I have type 2 and keep a lot of bindings on my mouse... for melee in fps or other moba games I will have my most used moves bound to mouse 4,5. I used to play competitively for a few seasons in tf2, but I mained medic for those comp years so not a whole lot of technical shots really. Is there a reddit sub for cmt/ disabled gamers? I have never been able to get good progression in FPS games. And it seems to be true for all games that rely on good aim. My strategy that works for me is to always rush, and rely on surprice to give me an advatage. If I am really close I can to some extent negate the aim advantage of others, and since most people play more defensively being really agressive can sometimes throw people off. I have always been better in rts games though, especially the macro aspect. 37 year old who has not played in years with 1A...dude...my frustration of being able to \"see\" something in my mind but my hands will not cooperate makes me feel like I am going to explode all the time....I do not, but my unresolved anger with CMT has made me walk (or gimp) away from things like video games that I once sincerely enjoyed. \n\nSide note: beginning about 3 years ago I did get back into backpacking. I go alone because I fall a lot, but I have found getting up to be immensely therapeutic and satisfying. It is impossible to be out there and not think about other people with CMT and what they would not give to be there too. I always come out of the woods with more gratitude than resentment.  Just thought I would provide my own opposite experience! I have cmt and am quite good at most competitive video games. Diamond in league and never had much trouble getting good at a game of having trouble with accuracy in FPS games. I am 39 and completely understand your situation.  The older I get the harder and more frustrating some games become, particularly those that require extra physical finger skill.  That is CMT's cryptonite.  I usually avoid games that are too demanding to save myself the disappointment.  I typically play stuff like madden or baseball.  But I love good shooters. So when I play them especially online against other people I go in with my expectations low and focus on just having fun with it.  What else can I do, shoot stem cells into my hands? 25 year old gamer, unsure of type as I have forgotten.\n\nI know exactly where you are coming from when it comes to not being able to break the barrier of above average. I also used to play league (I quit for unrelated reasons) and Sona was super fun to play because she did not have any aiming involved beside her ultimate. Unfortunately I do not have any tips or tricks to help with mechanics, but I guess it is nice to know other people understand your struggle. \n\nI am not sure how far along you are hands wise, but I personally have quit console gaming since the controllers are too difficult to use. One thing that has kept my interest in gaming, despite the issues, is setting a difficult but achievable goal and just slowly working for it. Mine was beating the original Dark Souls with a mouse and keyboard. Finally on the last boss after months of on and off play.\n\nJust do not let this take your love for your hobbies :) &gt; I go alone because I fall a lot\n\nDoes not this increase the danger? I suppose, but it also increases my caution and sense of awareness. I am lucky that I have not had my CMT impact my hands much yet. I am curious if a gaming keypad would help. I have one that was given to me that I did not really end up using, but it has a hand/palm support and buttons are arranged to be pressed easily. In my pre-planning stage of what to try when I get there, I have figured I would start with that. I also love computer games. Hey! I have 4C and play Battlefield 1 on Xbox and have had issues with my hands for year, especially when it comes to fine-tuning my aim with my right thumb. This might sound funny but I have grown a (bad?) habit of using my chin for those moments you need dead accuracy or need to push the analog stick in real fast to melee an enemy that sneaks out of nowhere. My friends make fun of me lol but then they shut up when I get most kills :P \n", "Wonder if this has implications for CMT as well...  Not to be that guy, but quite possibly not. The myelin in the brain is different to that in the peripheral nervous system. This focused on oligodendrocyte precursors, where we fail at mylenating  schwann cells. Edit: moved to reply. Be that guy, because you have an excellent point. In the brain, there is an age related gradual loss of oligodendrocytes (cells that wrap myelin around the axons in the brain). In the brain, oligodendrocytes that die will normally be continually replaced during your life time, although with time there will be a gradual decline in the number of oligodendrocytes that are replaced. This study looked at why the number of oligodendrocytes that are replaced gradually declines, and if this could somehow be rectified.\n\n\nIn both healthy humans and in humans with CMT, there is no gradual loss of Schwann cells (cells that wrap myelin around the axons in the peripheral nervous system). The Schwann cells wrap around the axons in the peripheral nervous system once during our early development and stay there for life. In CMT, the Schwann cells malfunctions which causes malfunctions in the myelin sheath, however the Schwann cells them selves do not die and are not replaced by new ones.\n\nBecause there is no loss of Schwann cells in CMT and therefore no need to replace the lost ones, this study is not directly relevant for CMT.\n\nThere are some diseases that cause Schwann cell loss, for instance autoimmune diseases where the Schwann cells are erroneously attacked by the bodys own immune system, but those diseases are not CMT.", "Presents for someone with CMT Hello everyone,\n\nI have CMT type 1a and it is moderate, so it is an annoyance but does not inhibit my day to day life.

When he used to cycle I tried to find him some folding crutches to no success. \n\nIs there anything which you have bought yourself or a friend/family member with CMT that helped them?", "Neurotoxic medications Has anyone taken metronidazole?

My doctor suggests I take it for a week and the neurotoxic list says it is only moderate risk with extended use so I feel like it would be okay but I am not sure It is an extremely commonly used medication so I would be amazed if there were any side effects. You only have to run a short course of it as well so that would reduce any potential risk. I have taken it in the past without issue. When I queried it I was told the warning is more for IV use over a long period. For me the benefit out weighed the risks, but I did keep an eye out for any cmt style worsening. The only side effect I had was it making me really nauseous.", "(CMT1A) Experience with SARMs? Hey everyone!\n\nI am 20 years old and i have been working out for about a year and a half now. I came across SARMs last year and i have been reasearching them since then.\n\nI was wondering if any of you have any experience with SARMs and CMT.\n\nHas it helped you? What side effects you got? And so on...\n\nAlso, can you recommend me some exercises for legs. I cannot squat at all :( so i have been working out my legs on machines.\n\nThanks! Hi there, I have several years experience (good and bad) running different SARM cycles. I have put some basic info up here regarding them:\n\n \n\nHow much success have you had in the gym so far? My only concern would be at 20 that SARMS can cause hormone issues. Feel free to message me here or post on the site forum for more detailed info around cycle lengths, vendors etc! Haha nice to see someone else with the same gripes in the gym. I have submitted to the fact that I cannot do squats either.\n\nNothing to write home about, sarms do what they do. Maybe they will help enhance leg growth, but I would not expect much to change with our condition. We simply cannot recruit the motor units necessary for localized growth ie. In the ankles Thanks for the reply!\n\nI am aware that SARMs will not help with my motor abilities, i was just wondering if you guys had any experience.\n\nThought about using them to help me get a bit stronger, i assume that would help, especially with my twig legs. Gym has been going great actually!\nMy upper body developed quite well, but i am struggling a lot with my legs since i cannot do most leg exercises.\n\nStrenght wise, i am way weaker than my friends that are the same size as me, but i am not really bothered by it, i just want to look and feel better How is your diet? That has to be on point for SARMs to work well although if your legs are already suffering from large amounts of atrophy, MK-677 (not a SARM) may be worth trying as it may increase hyperplasia (new muscle fibre growth). However, I have yet to give that a try so I am reluctant to suggest something I have not tried given the challenges of finding safe sources and making sure there is not any unknown interaction for people with CMT! I started doing glute bridges a couple of years ago and I am a big fan of them. They target many of the same muscles as squats but are much easier for me to do while maintaining the right form.\n\nI am also a big fan of the lateral walk with resistance band, an exercise I picked up from a round of physical therapy years ago. I was doing (still am) a lot of walking and I did not know my hips were weak but they were and this really helped me. Hip muscles being weaker than you might expect is apparently a thing with CMT so this is a good one to be aware of. Thanks for replying!\n\nI will give those exercises a try and see how it goes. I have found SARMs to be incredibly powerful given that for some reason (I suspect CMT), I am unable to normally gain muscle through strength training. SARMs for me are the difference between hitting a plateau 8 weeks into training which can never be surpassed and phenomenal strength gains in an 8 - 12 week period that actually remains for the next cycle. \n\nAs for motor units, I am not sure this argument holds true if you increase the impact of hypertrophy by 50%+. That way, you can utilise the motor units that do work and induce hypertrophy where muscle still exists. Of course, this does not reverse fatty atrophy, but IGF-1 could help with this by inducing muscle hyperplasia. Definitely have to second the weak hip muscles - they can be weak and also over-utilised by the hips as stabilisers which can lead to severe pain if exercised too heavily. One such instance left me bedridden for several days after a days hike. SARMs? Never heard of this. Just looked at the links provided by u/JoeBob85 , thanks, JoeBob85!\n\nSo, at 66, I really do not want to hit the gym. I have enough things going on, being relatively new to CMT and acclimating myself mentally, emotionally, financially, physically, .... BUT, my both my legs, including the thighs, are atrophying. Especially the left leg. I have lost a LOT of mass in both legs from the glutes down, unfortunately, not so much from the waist up. \n\nWill taking Andarine (S4) be beneficial to me in any way?\n\nAlso, it is advised to consult a medical professional before starting. What medical professional would one consult?\n\nThanks! I am actually debating whether to keep the Andarine section on the page as it is one of the least researched SARMs and may potentially have unknown side effects. As a start, I would always recommend Ostarine as it is milder, but at your age I would look into TRT as the hormone suppression from SARMs may be harder to keep under control at an older age, or at least not without using a form of androgenous testosterone as well. \n\nWould a SARM, or TRT, help you? Well, both have been shown to improve muscle mass, whether it is post-surgery or with strength training, but neither can reverse fatty atrophy which will become more apparent later on in life with CMT. If you were younger, SARMs would be a good option to use in order to gain muscle mass to offset weakness that occurs due to CMT, but once you have passed a certain threshold for muscle weakness and move into atrophy, it is harder to change. It may be possible with Growth Hormone, but their is not any definitive answer about that - i will be a guinea pig over the next few months giving it a try so will keep people posted!\n\nI would talk to a doctor about your options for testosterone theraphy and, if possible, an endocrinologist. Neither will probably understand SARMs as they are relatively new drugs still in research trials, but the latter should be able to look into TRT for you which should help all around. Thanks for the response. Although I am older, I am relatively new to CMT. It was only a little over a year ago my pain mngt dr. suspected something called CMT? How odd to go about 64.9 years without any diagnosis from any dr!\n\nBoth legs, especially the left, pelvis on down, have begun to atrophy. In less than 10 months,I went from walking independently to needing a walker just to move few feet! Goblet squats, it is easier to balance with a \"counter weight\" (the dumbbell)\n\nSarms, I looked into it. Really, you want to have your doctor on board. You need access to recovery drugs and regular blood tests to do safely. Which can be very expensive.\n\nAnd really you do not need them to be healthy. If you want to be a body builder that is another story, but to be healthy and lean and have a decent body you really do not need sarms. You will not have 10 percent bodyfat naturally with cmt, but you can still look good.\n\nYou are young now but when you get a bit older, there are much more fulfilling things in life to do. Go to the gym to be healthy, but do not let it define you and go crazy with hormones to get the perfect body. It is overrated and imo not worth it.", "Questions about genetic testing This is the asteroid I did not see coming. The whole CMT thing is new to me.\n\nAt 65, being told I have Muscular Dystrophy in the form of CMT, I am still reeling from the news. At this point, I am unsure as to which kind I have.\n\nQuestions as to genetic testing: Did your medical insurance cover the cost of the genetic counselor and the cost of the genetic testing?\n\nI have scoured the Medicare website for answers but I am not finding anything definitive pertaining to CMT and genetic testing.\n\nI have called the Medicare help number and they were less than helpful.\n\nI have called the state insurance office, leaving a message as no seems to ever actually answer the phone. Have not received a return call.\n\nI am just trying to determine if the counseling and/or testing are covered by medicare or do I have to pay everything out of pocket?\n\nI understand the counseling and testing are quite expensive.\n\nDid your insurance cover any of the cost?\n\nHow much am I looking at if I have to cover counseling and testing?\n\nThanks I do not know about Medicare, but on my BCBS plan it was covered with a doctor\u2019s letter of medical necessity. The genetic counseling should be the cost of a specialist visit (probably a few hundred dollars if not covered at all), and they will have a lot of answers for you, including the insurance codes for the tests, which make it a lot easier to get straight answers about cost.\n\nThe cost of the test varies depending on what you end up having. They typically start by looking at PMP22, and if they find an abnormality they stop there - which is cheapest. In my case, (CMT 1B) they had to move on to myelin protein zero, where they stopped. It would have been pretty expensive without insurance, though. Thank you very much! I really do appreciate the information and your time to compose such a helpful and informative response.\n\nMy mind is running all over, every direction at once. On April Fools Day, April 1, 2019, at one doctor visit, I was told:\n\nI have stenosis of the back and will require back surgery;\n\nI have stenosis of the neck and will require neck surgery;\n\nI have 4 nodules growing on the thyroid and will need a biopsy (biopsy completed 5/1, awaiting results);\n\nAnd, oh, BTW, every test thus far indicates I have CMT..\n(I never heard of CMT prior to that day)\n\nAs I said, at the age of 65, I am just trying to determine cost, what my life will be like with CMT and do I want to continue if CMT is confirmed.\n\nWhat I do not want, is to spend every last penny I have saved for retirement on medical care and end up living in a shell of a body.\n\nI realize I am not thinking clearly right now, but this is something I never saw coming.\n\nThanks again for the information. I have been on this crazy train since my early 30s, and I have lost the finger strength to play guitar and the ankle strength to play team sports. But I still walk everywhere I can, play with my kids, and work full time.\n\nEvery different subtype of CMT is different, but for the majority of people it is an annoyance and adjustment more than \u201cliving in a shell of a body\u201d. Orthotics, braces, PT, and some self-care make a world of difference.\n\nSo: my advice would be to take care of those nodules and acute concerns, and get whatever care you can that is covered by Medicare. Educate yourself on CMT and care for the symptoms that bother you. But do not let it stop you from enjoying your life \u2014 after all, you have had it this whole time, so it does not change anything other than helping you explain why certain muscles are the way they are!\n\nHang in there! My insurance covered it, but I did it through my surgeon. My sons medicaid covered his too, so I would think Medicare would. Thank you very much for the responding and the information. It is greatly appreciated! Hey, late to this. Have you been tested yet? I am 60, and am on Soc Sec Disability for chronic migraines, so I have Medicare and Medicaid, neither of which covered the genetic testing for CMT. My neurologist found a drug company that did genetic testing for another disease, but also tested for CMT. It was free. I believe they are running a trial for their drug. I do not recall the name of the company at this moment but I can definitely ask her if you are interested. PM me if so! Thanks. I have not yet been tested. Thanks for the info. Would definitely be interested in the name of the company! Bueno. I will contact my neurologist and find out what the inside skinny is! I am pretty sure it was for a drug trial of some sort.", "Let us talk PXT3003 Who has decided to get their primary care physician convinced on prescribing naltrexone and baclofen?

How long have you been on that dose of baclofen?  Was it for spasticity?  Have you tried titrating it lower?\n\nThere is lots of data on clinicaltrials.gov as well as in publications from Pharnext.

Even though I am in a wheelchair, my hammer toes on my right foot are rolling forward, giving me cringe type pain multiple times a day... Is this what you mean by \"Small Irritations\"? If it is irritating you but you did not think it warranted its own post, it qualifies. \n\nThis one sounds very annoying, I am sorry you have to deal with it and I wish you the best of luck working out a way to make it stop happening. I had to go to a wedding because some newer friends invited me and it was super nice of them to include me.  Barely knew anyone and I know it is rare but I think my cmt has affected my hearing. I can never hear anything at loud events like this. Felt obligated to dance but I feel like I either stumble around or I am stuff as a board.  Just felt really awkward and anxious.\n\nAll in all it was still nice but I hate feeling like a weirdo. I have been noticing little things at work lately that suck. My feet hurt like always, but last night my fingers cramped while I was counting out a customer\u2019s change and I dropped it, had to redo it while he stood there watching me. I work in a coffee shop and I keep dropping stuff, which makes me worry that it will happen with a hot drink at some point.", " On My Nerves - Small Irritations Weekly thread for the little CMT things bugging you this week", "CMT diagnosis Hi, my father has CMT and his symptoms are very severe, he started noticing it until his mid 20\u2019s. He thinks he has type 1 but is not really sure as in my country (Costa Rica) those kind of test were not really posible in the 90s. I am currently 18 (I am XX, or well... girl) I am pretty active. I go for 7 miles runs everyweek as well go to the gym and do ballet, this makes me ignore some kind of pain i get on my ankles or skinnier wrist. My question is, Is there a way to get diagnose when symptoms are not showing that much? Can you only do it like by genetic DNA examination? Should i wait till I am on my 20\u2019s? I want this to prevent lots of things in the future, specially cause i want to be a mom. Thank you all\u2764\ufe0f A genetic test can be done at any age and would be definitive even without symptoms.\n\nAlternatively, you can see about getting an examination done by a neurologist even if you do not think that you have symptoms. A neurologist could run, for instance, a Nerve Conduction Velocity test, which can discover if your nerves transmit impulses more slowly than healthy people, which is characteristic of CMT (at least most types). A neurologist can also potentially spot symptoms that you are unaware of, if you have learned to unconsciously compensate for some weakness. \n\nBeing female is only relevant to your odds of having CMT (or your odds of showing symptoms) if it is the X-linked type. The odds of a parent with the most common types of CMT passing it along to any given child are 50-50 no matter what gender. Just seconding what is been said here, I have CMT type 1A and had a genetic test done when I was 5 years old before any symptoms were showing. You can get them  done now.\n\nI think it would definitely be worthwhile for you to know now instead of waiting because then you can start to get ahead of symptoms, (Learn how specific stretches etc.) and it would encourage you to keep an eye on treatments. (There is no drug treatments out now, but some drugs may come out in a couple years that might help manage symptoms and prevent it from getting worse) My mom told me my father has CMT2 do not really know which subtype (letter) so I think it is necessary first to clarify which subtype my dad has before do the test. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc It may not be necessary to know the subtype first. When I was tested I already knew I had 1A but they ran the test for all common types anyway because it is all on one chip and it would actually be more expensive to set up a chip to test just one type. This is totally dependent on the test maker and they could have changed it since I had my test but I suspect not.", "Clinical trial of neurotrophin factor 3 in CMT1A I made a comment on one of the weekly thread but looks like it got buried... figured I would make a dedicated post.\n\nMy dad has CMT (negative genetic testing) and I likely have it too. I was doing a literature search and came across this clinical trial and thought I would share it here as I did not see any posts on it. It looks promising and NTF3 could be beneficial in all forms of CMT. A prior study showed benefit in both mouse and limited human treatment.  I am in no way affiliated with the study or endorsing it, but figured I would share it here. Looks like they are still enrolling. If you have any info or are participating, please share!\n\n( I am curious what u/pmp22 and u/nixyenox think about this. i might be interested in applying for the trial. I wonder what ever happened to PXT3003 phase 3 trial is starting again. I know cus I am hopefully going to be in it! How exactly does it work and what are the benefits its meant to do. Reverse cmt? improve nerve function or muscle? They still have yet to raise it is only the baclofen that helps. Here is the full text article for the trial. The author Sahenk has done previous research with NTF3 both in mice and humans. NTF3 stimulates the repair process in injured nerves.\n\n(\n\nIn the initial trial:  \" In a small cohort of CMT1A patients, we demonstrated that exogenously delivered NT-3 by a subcutaneous route promotes nerve regeneration in sural nerves and improves the Mayo Clinic Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) and reduces the clinical sensory deficit after 24 weeks of treatment (( However, further clinical trials of subcutaneously injected NT-3 are thwarted by limitations that include: a short serum half-life, high production costs, need for repeated dosing, and discontinuation of the product. \"\n\nReference: NT-3 promotes nerve regeneration and sensory improvement in CMT1A mouse models and in patients. (\n\nThe author switched to using a gene therapy method of delivering NTF3, by using muscle cells to generate the protein from the transferred gene.\n\nI am a bit short on time, but I am happy to read both studies in further detail and provider more info. I was really quite disappointed by the amount of active research into CMT treatments, so this trial really stood out. Plus as the author notes, there is a final common pathway for all peripheral nerve disorders, and hopefully stimulating the repair process may help many of those with CMT, not just a specific known mutation. Thanks for sharing this article! I have not had time to dig into it as much as I would like to but the 2020 paper JohnnyBallgame7 linked is very well written; the theory seems solidly supported. How well that will translate into results in human trials in the long run, I do not know but it is intriguing. When I find the time I would like to dig more into NT-3 in general but I am not sure if that will happen this week.", "Recently was told that my options are gradual correction and reconstruction surgery totalling up to 5 surgeries, or get an ankle/foot amputation. Has anyone here gone through with amputation that is willing to answer some questions about their experiences and what to expect?  There are several cmt groups on fb that follow the foot reconstruction surgery and recovery for different people. I have not seen anyone amputate . Thank you, do you know the name of the groups by any chance? I have seen people do the above knee amputations but never an ankle one so that is what had me curious \n\nSeveral people have posted about their surgeries in here Thank you again! &gt;I have not seen anyone amputate .\n\nI have seen a few people on the fb CMT groups who have amputated actually. It blew my mind had never heard of anyone doing that until then. Are you in the USA?\n\nDr Glenn Pfeffer performs literal miracles for feet like yours. Look him up before you let people take off your limb. I am in the US on the east coast. I have never heard of him before, but where is he located? He is in LA but if you have insurance it might apply with him. Search charcot Marie Tooth surgery on instagram for some of his work. The dude is a god for people with severe cmt cases. I will definitely look into seeing if insurance would apply with him and also sent him an email. Thank you so much! I did look through his IG and it really is amazing what he has been able to do I am so so happy for you! I wish you the best of luck. Here is an award to lift your spirits and fingers crossed your insurance covers it \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb I am sure you know this but PLEASE get at least two, better three, opinions on this. It is a BIG deal. Do not just go by random doctors mentioned on Reddit. Im in Sydney and have had reconstructive surgery Dec 2019, although all mine was done in one surgery on my left foot and 12 month recovery. I am 33 as well for clarity.\n\nAmputation was discussed and while at first I considered it I opted the surgery path and was lucky it worked out When I had my reconstructive surgery (on my left foot) they were able to do it all in one go as well and I had a 12-13 month recovery from it, but this was in 2011, and I have not had any issues with that foot since honestly besides pressure pain, my right foot is a hundred times worse then my left one was though which is why I would have to do the gradual correction surgery, stay in that brace or whatever its called up to a year, then break down the reconstruction surgeries into 3-4 surgeries due to the level of deformity and a recent injury, and it just seems like that is a hell of a long time to try and withstand something that might not even work in the first place which is why I was considering amputation honestly. I am happy that it worked out for you though! I know I cried when I woke up and was told they did not have to fuse my ankle and that everything went good haha! Your story mirrors mine tbh, my left ankle is essentially your right by the looks of it, although yours looks worst tbh (no offence). The reconstruction surgery on the left  still involved all the bones being fused that did not bother me I was just sick of getting injured from falling. I also wear the ankle foot orthoses (AFO) 24/7 but hardly notice them anymore and actually welcome the additional support. I got some photos ill dm u if u want Go ahead and dm them!\nNo offense taken, I am not saying mine is the worst but I will say I have not seen many that looked even remotely close to mine.. Kind Of had me feeling like I was a lost cause at this point tbh. I dont have any braces at all at the moment, I had afos when I was younger but I was stubborn and never wore them which I fully regret. And I understand that, I have honestly have been lucky and havent fallen much, but the few times I have it always ended up injuring my right foot more until this last time it was the worst since I actually fractured it in a few spots Hello. I just had a surgery on my foot 2 weeks ago. They did 5 \"things\" during 1 surgical procedure. You should ask them to clarify if you need 5 separate surgeries or 5 operations during 1 procedure. If its just one I would really recommend you to try to save the foot before you chop it off (without knowing any details on your situation of course). Feel free to ask any questions you might have about surgery and I will answer as best as I can. Please be aware that I am European and there might be some things that is done different here (especially things concerning financial and insurance issues) Hopefully you have a quick recovery and that you find some more comfort now! I have asked about it due to my first surgery being done in one go, and he said it would be divided into 5 different surgical procedures, one for the gradual correction brace, one for the tendon transfer and arch lowering, one for the fusion of my ankle and toes, one for the actual reconstructive aspect in the foot if I remember correctly. I have unfortunately been stubborn and put this off for close to a decade since I had my last surgery on top of not wearing any leg supports. I do want to know about your surgery and what all had to be done, I am willing to try and save my foot but I am also at the point where not having to worry about the deformities and progression seems like it would be a way to have a better quality of life but honestly I am just stuck in what I should do lol Yes, so far everything has been really good. The surgery took 140 minutes.and they did the following:  \nCalcaneal Osteotomy: basically, they cut of my heel and reattached it with some big screws. It makes my heel stick out the back of my foot rather than in a banana shaped inwards turn.  \nTendon transfer: Posticus tendon to collum tali transfer (i dont really know what tendons these are, but i think they sit a bit further down from the ankle in the foot. Im not quite sure why i did this, but i think it was to extend some tendons and shorten others. Maybe to get rid of the hammer toe or the high arch?)  \n\r  \nCC-Arthodesis: This is something they do to attach 3 joints in my foot. \r  \nI think it is to lower my foot arch.\r  \n\r  \nBrostr\u00f6m procedure (modified). So this procedure has its own wikipedia page. I think what they did was to fix the tendons on the outside of my ankle so i would have less drop foot.\n\nSo on all 4 procedures (2 reconstructive, and 2 tendon transfers/shortenings). \n\nSo far after 18 days, i havent had any pain, the only discomfort i have had has been during the night where it felt as if the cast (air walker/plastic cast) shrinked. I dont know why. This discomfort was not really a big deal, but its the only think i would mention as discomfort. Other than that recovery is going well. I can put 10-15 kg of weight on the foot which makes moving around on crouches quite easy. I am looking forward to testing my foot after some months. Surgeon says the foot will have healed after 6-12 months. But im guessing that after 2-3 months i will allready be alot better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI completely understand your concerns. All i can say is that i am pretty sure you will not regret having tried surgery first, whereas you might regret an amputation. You could always do an amputation afterwards. Reversing an amputation is more difficult (impossible i guess, unless you could attach some dead person's foot to your ankle).  \n\n\nAgain this is just me thinking out loud without knowing all details regarding your situation. If you still want to go through with an amputation, I think you at least should consult one or two other doctors. I needed to go through 3 orthopedists before i found someone who actually did something to help my situation. The previous orthopedists seemed to just push whatever treatment they felt comfortable selling without considering my specific needs. I am sorry\u2026just have to chime in here. He is not a god, but has been heavily promoting himself to the CMT community. I was warned off of him by two different surgeons. Just please do your homework. Listen, surgeons 'warning' you are also trying to do business. Pfeffer is a multi millionaire and could retire but chooses to help cmt patients. His results on the other hand speak for themselves. Enough with this negativity. He changed lives of hundreds of people with CMT. Ok, you have your opinion, I have mine. I have met him and I will not go to the guy.

Type 1A. Been programming for 20 years and this is a new development. kind of worried about a day that it does not go away quickly... Probably you should be taking breaks and doing wrist stretches. They recommend that for everyone, not just people with CMT. Admittedly, I could benefit from following my own advice... You can also look in to ergonomics and make any necessary changes to your setup. \n\nAlso, just based on my experience, you may have an acute inflammation that could be resolved with an anti-inflammatory. I had something similar (in my foot though) and got a prescription for naproxen and that worked for me.

Which includes me, dangit.\nAfter being tested for Carpal tunnel several times and eliminating the easy culprits (wrist rest, bad posture, lack of resting time) the only thing left was the fact that CMT targets peripheral nerves.  \nIn my experience the best solution was an enforced keyboard break every two hours which did not eliminate the issue but seemed to be the best mitigator.", "DAE have facial weakness? Some backstory: I have known that I have probably had CMT my whole life- one of my parents has 1A and 4B2. Up until a few years ago, I only lost feeling in my extremities temporarily for months at a time and would then regain feeling. I have always walked on my toes, have flat feet(I guess this is a more rare symptom?), have had sore, twitchy muscles, etc. Fatigue and foot drop have been the most long lasting problems. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI recently went for another EMG and am about to get the gene test. Due to my symptoms,EMG, and family history, my doctors are assuming it is CMT. One of my legs has been numb for 4 years, the other is slightly numb after getting extremely sick last year, and recently both my hands went numb and my face around my mouth also went numb. Initially, the numbness was at the back of my head, it subsided, and then I lost feeling in my face after using MMJ for sciatica. I can still move most of my affected muscles, they are just numb and clumsy. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have never heard of facial numbness with this. Has it happened to anyone else ? What type of CMT do you have, if so? Interested in finding out more, but I cannot find much of anything about it. had what people thought was bells palsy when I was younger. Dont really have anything anymore. got cmt1a Could be Hnpp with the numbness that comes and goes. Ask for a dna genetic test its the eadiedt way to figure things out. I have HNPP and have occasional facial numbness, weakness, and twitching. I have 2b1/4c1 and type 3/dejerine sottas. I get the twitching and face tingling/numbness. Eye shake, lid twitching. Just some of the cmt fun. It comes and goes, can last for weeks. I walk like a drunk and my words slur. I cannot feel temp on my lower legs, which can sometimes give me quite a suprize when I sit in the tub, but are not numb. \nMy brother in law has cmt, but no pain. I have hurt my whole life, especially my hips. \"Hot poker\" pains in feet and lower legs for years, that would make me scream. If I use a muscle, it would not relax back. Rib spasms that last up to a week, so far, and can cause me to scream. \nNow I am older and the nerves are dammaged enough, so the pain seems to be changing to chronic aches. Fatigue, weakness, insomnia and vision trouble.\nI will be old enough to get medicare this year, so getting treatment is looked\n forward to.\nAhh, the golden years. Forgot to add, I too am flat footed.", "Does this sound like CMT at all? Hello, I (30M) recently went to my yearly physical. During that time, I mentioned to my doc that I have been having cramps in my calves for about a year now, it is pretty annoying. I was also born with very high arches. Doctor wants me to see a podiatrist but also mentioned that it could be CMT because I also have sleep apnea. Did anyone else have symptoms like this? High arches and leg pain tracks. Thin lower legs and curled down toes are also common symptoms. If you want to know for sure see a neurologist. If you want help with foot pain or getting foot support, go to the podiatrist. There are some physical tests they do for diagnosis you might be able to look up and do at home. It could be but it could also be other things. \n\nIt would be reasonable to see a neurologist who can perform a variety of physical tests to determine if you have CMT. They would be looking for things like specific muscle weaknesses, weak reflexes, and nerve conduction velocity. If the neurologist thinks you have CMT they will likely proceed to a genetic test to determine what type. \n\nProper diagnosis is important because if it is NOT CMT but something else you do not want to be ignoring that. And if it IS CMT then you want to know what to watch for, how to get any interventions you might need in the future such as ankle braces, and what to expect if you plan to have any children (or what to watch for if you have children already). Saying someone might have CMT because they have sleep apnea is odd. While I know of lots of people with CMT who also have sleep apnea I also know lots of people with sleep apnea without CMT. Obviously the Dr also see\u2019s the high arches but again that does not mean it is CMT. \n\nYou need to see a neurologist and have a nerve conduction test to really find out what is going on. Unless there is history of CMT in your family I would not jump to any conclusions just yet. Thanks for the input. By any chance remember what any of these tests are? I cannot find anything online :/ Did you have calf pain? I was \u201cdiagnosed\u201d loosely by a surgeon at 19\n\nI was diagnosed by a neurologist after physical examination in my 30\u2019s\n\nI was diagnosed by a neurologist with CMT2A in my 50\u2019s after genetic testing\n\nBTW, with insurance (in the US) the genetic testing was very affordable. PLUS with the positive test results, that company (Invitae) also tested my children for cheap!  They had 50/50 and both came back negative. \n\nI am currently recovering from my 3rd round of reconstructions (feet). 33 years ago, 11 years ago, and now. How has it progressed over the years? How were your feet when you were younger? I am glad to hear insurance helps cover genetic testing Its some but you need a DNA test and a nerve velocity test. Anything less is a guess My toes have been curled since I was a kid. My middle finger on my right hand started curling when I was about 8. My arches started getting higher in my 20s. When I was a teenager, I noticed that my ankles and lower legs wet skinnier than my calves, and I used to have excruciating cramps in my calves. Mostly when I was asleep. It would happen as often as three times a night and probably five nights out of the week. In my late 20s my right ring and pinky fingers started to curl and my left middle, ring, and pinky started to curl. \n\nI was not diagnosed until I was 31, and did not know about CMT until then. I have only had nerve velocity tests and not genetic testing. I have not had insurance since shortly after I was diagnosed. In childhood I always walked and ran funny\n\nAt puberty I really started to atrophy in my legs.  Lots of ankle twisting and falling. Very high arches, hammer toes, &amp; foot really rolled out (first round of surgery)\n\nActivity levels slowly declined in lots of areas over the years.  I still did stuff, but was obviously limited more and more as time when on.  In 40\u2019s was still activeish but no longer able to really be athletic\u2026no more running without falling, etc.  Dropfoot become more prominent, foot shape was changing, doctor said the foot is like three legged stool (and I had 2 of those legs messed up). (Second round of reconstruction)\n\nNow I am 55, I spent last summer in PT and OT, really discovered the difference that AFO\u2019s could make on my walking gait.  Shape of my feet and certain pressures did not allow me to wear them for long. Not longer can walk barefoot on hard surfaces and real unstable on all but the best and most stable surfaces (third round of reconstruction)\n\nI have had both of my feet done over the COVID season\u2026am in a walking boot from the second foot being done, so getting closer to recovered.  Hopefully will be able to wear AFO\u2019s for extended times when possible and be more stable on more surfaces.  Running of any sort is done for me, walking on steep inclines is done for me, walking on treacherous terrain is done for me. BUT, I can still walk and am thankful for that!\n\nOn the genetic testing, my neurologist said that costs have come down lots in the last 5 years and that more and more insurance will cover now. I have had pain everywhere from my toes to my thighs  Now that I think about it just see a doctor., neurologist. They will be able assess. Likely they will do a series of physical  things like a heel walk. Gently poke you with a pin starting at you knee and going down to your toes to see if you lose sensitivity. Test various reflexes. Have you push in different directions to see if there is reduced strength. Their  expertise in seeing how you do these things is the point though. Look at the muscles for atrophy etc. Then they will use electricity to read nerve signals. Blood work. Can do genetic testing to see which gene mutations are present. Idk, whole thing was pretty interesting and was by far the most time I have spent with a doctor. Yes. All \u201cclassic\u201d. All of it \u2013 thankfully you sound in a range that could probably be really helped by a knowledgeable Physical Therapist or at least one that is willing to say I do not know about that let me study it.\nApnea is one of the things that you are going to find as an anecdotal symptom - in cynical layman\u2019s terms that means it is something that yes you will find a lot of people with Charcot Marie tooth have but if doctors do not understand the interaction and the components they will say it happens sometimes or it is an anecdotal symptom.... Could not I just skip the nerve test You could, but the nerve test can also indicate what severity you have. The test is also much better then it use to be due to improvements in the testing. They no longer stab you with spikes but just use pads instead.\nAlso I think there are over 2000 genetic mutations linked to CMT which is why there are so many types of CMT and it is pretty much different for everyone. The nerve test helps narrow it down. Sorry to chip in but was wondering how painful this is? I went to a genetic clinic and she suggested having this done but I am highly frightened of needles. I have had blood work done and have cmt but I think this testing is maybe more specific for ruling out risks of passing it on. There are no needless involved \ud83d\udc4d\nIt is not bad at all and it is done up to your pain tolerance. How often is the cramping usually? Symmetrical? Thankyou very much for your reply :)", "What to do when people make fun of you? I was walking down the street; when I realized that a girl was making fun of the way I walk. How do you deal with that? I am in a very bad mood right now. ", "Just had a chiropractor constantly refer to it as \"my tooth disease\" I told her like 8 times that it does not affect my teeth, it was just part of the name... She continued to call it as such.\n\nShe adjusted my neck and that felt good, but definitely not going back to someone who cannot listen when the damn patient tries to describe a possibly relevant disease.... Ooof, yeah \ud83d\ude1e I always call it CMT, and only say the whole name if asked what it is, then add, \u201cNamed after the three guys who designated the diagnoses\u201d \n\nSome people, though \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Yeah, I am definitely just writing CMT on it from now on. I have heard stories like this but never had it happen myself.\n\nI am always in an awkward spot because I do not look sick. My feet are mostly fine, as are my hands. I have some foot drop, but if you are not looking for it you will not see it. I am pretty lucky so far. But it also means that doctors either do not take me seriously when I say I have a neurological disease, or they immediately blame my issued on it and say there is not much they can do.... For how advanced or Healthcare seems to be, we are still sooo far behind \ud83d\ude14 I would never let someone who did not take my diagnoses seriously treat me. Someone unfamiliar with how diseases are named shpuld not treat anyone, period. That said, I would never set my foot inside a chiropractors door, either. Yeah, honestly, i felt like she never really gave me a chance to say no. I am a pretty anxious person and I do not like interrupting people. Other than correcting her several times I never really got to speak.\n\nNeedless to say I am not going back there.  I can relate to that, I am like that as well. I know from experience that it is so important to be concious about it though, because otherwise if you are unlucky and end up with the wrong person you can end up getting a treatment you regret afterwards. It is easy to say but not so easy to do when you are in the middle of it but I think for every enounter like that you learn how to avoid it in the future. If you do not get good vibes from the person you see for treatments, walk out the door and find someone else for a second opinion. I like to say things like similar to muscular dystrophy or hereditary sensory and motor neuropathy. Or describe how it affects me. Whichever I think will be best received. Saying what CMT stands for shifts the conversation and I prefer to take control and drive the discussion to the outcome I want.  I get so sick of medical professionals who cannot be bothered even making an effort to know the condition they are supposed to be treating. I have got the blank look and confused comments when mention neuro then Charcot-Marie-Tooth... So it effects you teeth then?\n\nI probably over react to it now. I have walked out on Drs and refused to be treated by them when they could not get the condition name right on a referral. I have had enough crappy medical advice from people who seem to know what they are doing. I wont put up with those who obviously do not.\n\nI actually love it when a Dr looks it up in books, or online journals, it shows me that they are more interested in providing the right advice, and are willing to investigate, rather than those who just pretend. Right? I am not mad for doctors not knowing. I am mad when they do not listen, or if they know I am coming and know I have a condition they do not know about, and they do not do some research. ", "Awareness month is here. Even though we are affected, any contributions help. Please share link. ", "For those of you diagnosed with CMT as a \"big kid\" or adolescent, what are you glad your parent(s)/guardian(s) did to help you or what do you wish they would have done differently? Our only child (10 y.o. daughter) was recently diagnosed with CMT1a from a nerve speed test, gait (foot drop), and raised arches. We are starting the ball rolling for the genetic test for final word, but our (very experienced) pediatrician is nearly certain. In hindsight, I have noticed my daughter's symptoms for several years (slow running, more falls and other injuries than her friends, early foot drop signs, etc.) but am trying not to be too hard on myself for not pressing her old pediatricians about these things. \n\nIt may be just timing (her age and having an initial pediatrician check-up), but I feel like perhaps CMT is taken more seriously where we currently are (in Germany) than in the U.S., or perhaps it is just slower, more thorough doctor's visits here. But I digress ...\n\nAnyway, I am interested to hear what those of you diagnosed with CMT as older children or adolescents (long ago or more recently) appreciated about how your parents/guardians helped you (or what you wish they would have done to help you) to navigate the new reality of a CMT diagnosis. I apologize if this has been addressed at length before in other threads or if this is not the appropriate board. I have already learned so much just from reading just a few of your posts and I look forward to reading more. Guten tag. Short on time right now so I apologize for the limited response. \nDiagnosed aged 10-ish 1995-ish. \nGood-mom told me I need to think of a career that is a \u201cdesk job\u201d. I did. They got me custom orthotics for stability, less pain. Got me access to resources and people that could help, like neurologists and specialized PTs. \nBad-I did not actually use those resources because I was too young to understand. Doctors advised to pull me out of gym class. Terrible idea. In middle school there was no alternative so I ended up spending gym period hand delivering notes to classrooms. Lol the 90s. In high school it was okay I took extra classes. But guess what? I am bad at exercising and discipline to do it. Parents should have helped me develop better habits fit my health. \nUnclear-Parents also feared what would happen if this knowledge was known by others- would it create problems for me for the rest of my life with employment, insurance ... maybe it was like that in the 90s? Also, fuck the US healthcare and employment laws. They were not wrong, US still dealing with these issues. But yeah they told me, never tell your employer about this. This is too much for a kid. Made me feel more isolated. Not worth it, just tell everyone make it known and let your kid and family benefit from support of others. \nIn conclusion, I would do the following: they must build good habits and understanding of self health care- exercise, stretching, eating right, pain management, give them access to mental health support. Other good ideas-connect with others, get community support from school, friends  and family. I have a lot more thoughts if you want more let me know and I will continue. Thank you for this. I needed to know the answer too! This is super helpful. Thank you for taking the time. I was a teen in the 90s so I remember some of this social/political stuff, esp. around insurance. Anything else you feel like adding is welcome! &gt;. Doctors advised to pull me out of gym class. Terrible idea. In middle school there was no alternative so I ended up spending gym period hand delivering notes to classrooms.\n\nDamn. I was pulled out and would help out with lower grades during that time. I am 15 and I got diagnosed this year, I took it really really bad. The tips i would say to you is:\n-be there for them if they need you\n-give them some time to self-reflect and to realize what they need to do\n-buy them equipment they need, but buy it with them and let them choose the design or color\n-ik it is important, but do not remind us everyday(at the beggining of finding out the diagnosis) to workout, we are aware but we just cannot bring ourselcves to it, rather, ask gently or offer to work out with them!\nThank you for asking this question, it means a lot! Thanks so much for your thoughtful reply! This is really helpful for me to hear. Thank you for sharing this, I really appreciate it! I am speaking as an outsider looking in so to speak..   most of my family has been diagnosed..   the biggest difference I see in mobility with everyone getting older ..   EXERCISE EXERCISE EXERCISE..    and I mean now \u2026.  Even before it might progress.   From what I am seeing in my mom and aunts and uncles ..  it makes all the difference in the world.   Not sure about the gym class as I know my family experienced bullying ..  but definitely at home. Being a person that did not get diagnosed until age 60, let me say the sooner you are diagnosed, the better. Being called a liar, lazy and faker for 60 years does tremendous dammage to a persons soul!\nI have 2 forms. One axonal and one demylanating. So much for my faking, lazy, crazy labels!", "Achievement Post Thought I would share a small achievement of mine. \n\nI have been going to the gym for the past few months in hopes to build stronger muscles in my legs. I go about 4 times a week and I have recently started seeing results related to my walking and balance. It is been difficult staying committed but I am proud of myself with what I have achieved and will continue to stay committed. That is great! What does your routine look like? I go every other day and will generally start off weight exercises for the legs and glutes. After, I do an hour of cardio and will either walk (cannot really run) on the treadmill with a high incline at fast speed or I will go on the stair master. Well done...keep it up! Thanks!", "Nike Flyease are amazing for fitting in AFOs My daughter got some new splints, these have a heel on the outside, they are huge and bulky. But the Nike flyease still fit! It is the Nike Revolution 5 FlyEase, the whole heel area unzips and the splint can just slide right in.\n\n\nShe can actually have some normal looking shoes for once. One very happy child and a less stressed out mum. Thought this might help for some other CMT sufferers who are struggling with shoes. Shopping for shoes was always extremely embarrassing as a kid. I am happy you found something that works well for her! I heard about these being an excellent design for disabled and pregnant users alike. Also just for those needing convenience. It is great for disabled youngsters to feel like they can still fit in. I remember wearing my splints always made me feel boyish and old fashioned. How is the width look in the toe box area?  Pretty standard or extra wide? They do seem pretty wide, there is a lot of flex as well as the fabric is very soft. They do these on adult versions too. They sound really nice,  I will have to check them out cause my current shoes are split open in multiple places.  Thank you for the recommendation!", "Solo Trip - Update and Questions Hi everyone,\n\nI recently posted this question about doing a ( and thought I would share that I have officially booked my first one to Prague! I will be going for 3 nights - 4 days. \n\nI decided to buy some trekking poles to help with walking/balance in case I need it and I am also planning to pack as light as possible.\n\nI am honestly pretty nervous/scared but I am excited for this challenge and I know I will learn a lot about myself. \n\nHas anyone here done a trip to Prague? If there is any advice/suggestions you can give, please do :) I was there in 2015. Prague is an amazing city and perfect for a first solo trip. There are a lot of cobblestones so the trekking poles will be helpful. The \"royal route\" ends in a long walk uphill to the castle so be prepared for some elevation changes. If you want advice on packing I recommend r/onebag. Rick Steves' ( is a good way to get hyped for the trip (but always keep in mind that you are traveling for *you* and do not set your expectations based on other's experiences).\n\nEnjoy your trip! Ahhh my worst nightmare - cobble stones lol. \n\nThanks for the heads up about the hill! I will definitely check out that video as well. I have never been to Prague, but it is on my to-do list! Since this is your first solo trip, going for 4 days sounds like a good choice to me. It is long enough to see and experience some great things but not so long that it is going to get overwhelming.\nI obviously cannot give any travel advice for this city, but some general advice I can give is to spend some time in advance reading up on the practical details so you know what to expect. On my second solo trip (Italy) I had \"walked\" from the train station in Pisa, Florence, Rome and Naples to the respective Hotels I would booked in those cities, using google street view in advance. When I got down there, I already had a rough idea about the direction and streets I was going to take and it made it much less stressful to find the hotels. I felt pretty clever about it at the time.\n\nOn the top of my head, these are some things I would figure out in advance:\n\n* The address of the hotel\n* The phone number to the hotel, the phone number to your country's embassy in the city, the country's calling code\n* The hotel Reservation code / Confirmation number for the booking\n* How to get from the air port to the city center and then to the hotel\n* How often the train(s) from the airport leave and if it is operational at the time of your arrival\n* How you buy tickets for the train and how much it is\n* How taxis work over there\n* How the metro works\n* What the check in and check out times for the hotel is\n* Where the nearest ATM is from the hotel\n* Restaurants you want to eat at (Tip: in google maps search \"best restaurant in Prague\" and sort by rating 4 stars and up and pick someone in your price range and you will be almost guaranteed to have some good food experiences)\n* \"backup\" restaurants close to the hotel in case you are tired and just need to eat something without walking too far\n* How convenience stores/kiosks/what have you work (where to get water bottles and snacks) \n* The power plug standard (do you need an adapter?)\n* What you want to see the most and where those things are in relation to the hotel and how to get there\n* If you can buy tickets in advance for some of the attractions so you do not have to spend as much time queuing\n\nI always make an Excel spreadsheet with some basic information, mainly an itinerary with dates, the city I will be at a given date, the activity I plan on doing that day, the hotel I will be staying at, the check in/out hours of the hotel, the card I used for the reservation, the hotel address and phone number, the confirmation code and a column for if the hotel was prepaid in full or not. It might seem excessive but it fits on one A4 page and it makes life a lot easier. I usually deviate from the itinerary once I am there but it is nice to have as a reference for things to see and do. I also make a packing list in advance because it is really easy to forget things. And such a packing list can be re-used for future trips. Over time I have refined mine to suit me perfectly, and it contains the following:\n\n* Visa debit card\n* Mastercard\n* European Health Insurance Card (Only applicable if you are a European or Swis citizen) \n* CMT toxic medication card\n* Passport\n* RFID blocking paper sleeves for the passport and credit cards\n* Vaccination card\n* Digital copies of my passport and vaccination card\n* Some cash\n* Tickets bought in advance\n* Toiletries\n* Clothes (bring at least one extra pair of socks, ankle socks are great in warm weather)\n* Sunglasses, sun screen\n* Basic medkit (paracetamol, single use ethanol wipes, skin colored medical paper tape and band aids)\n* Technology (Phone, charger, a camera perhaps, etc)\n* A very thin jacket that is wind and water proof\n\nI use a small suitcase with 360 degree rotating wheels and a backpack. I use a small padlock on my backpack to prevent pickpockets, it has worked well so far. I usually use thin long sleeve linen shirts during the daytime in hot weather, and roll up/down the sleeves as needed. I love linen. I always use shirts with a breast pocket, because I can put some euros and/or a credit card in them for easy access.\n\nSorry for the long post, but maybe some of it can be of use! I also support looking at Rick Steves videos, what a great guy. :) I have been to Prague a couple of times now and the biggest piece of advice I can give is to NOT exchange money at money exchange stands/stores ever. You will almost always get a scam tier rate; what you should do is to find out which banks are partnered with your bank and only use those atms b/c they will give you the real rate minus a small fee. (And do not forget to give your bank a travel notice)\n\nThat aside, I recommend that you go to the Sedlec Ossuary b/c its a really cool sight to see. For restaurants, I highly recommend Pepr a Sul. The quality of food is like youre at a really fancy restaurant except its cheap as all hell(usually in the top 10 on Prague Tripadvisor). For most things, use tripadvisor b/c its a pretty good resource overall. Another good place to go is the Hemingway Bar and the Absinthe bar. \n\nFor nightlife, you NEED to go to crossclub. I have had so much fun there and the inside decor is really cool, they have like motherboards in the walls lol.  Use Resident Advisor for finding club/rave events, and Facebook events is good for anything else. \n\nOverall, everything is pretty damn cheap, the food and beer are amazing, and the people are beautiful and friendly.\n\nOne more thing(drug related): &gt;!Do not buy cocaine there, locals and other tourists have warned me that its usually just some type of amphetamine/meth; and its overpriced as all hell. !&lt; Well that is a really inspirational post. I have never travelled alone before, really want to but have so many fears I never am able to. How did your travels go? Thank you! My travels went great! And I know what you mean by fears, I also had many. However, all my fears were proven \u201csilly\u201d after this trip. \n\nThe one most important takeaway I got from this trip was that it is indeed possible for me to be on my way own despite my CMT. Sure some things were difficult, but in those situations, I was forced to have to communicate to people exactly what I needed help with. Being on my own also pushed me to struggle a bit with things that I normally would get help with and the struggle ended up being a good thing. At the end I was able to achieve what it was I wanted to. \n\nI highly highly recommend trying a solo trip if you can! Do some research for the best cities to visit depending on your capabilities and just book the flight. Do not even let yourself think twice about it. Lol.", "Tarsal Tunnel Release (for the second time) Has anyone had a tarsal tunnel release? I have had them done bilaterally and am now being advised that redoing them might be beneficial (and, of course, I have read up on risks and everything else).

Any thoughts on the recovery of it? this is the fist time I hear about this surgery in the context of CMT. did the first time you had it help you?

Is it possible that I have inherited CMT from my grandmother and these are minor symptoms that will get worse as I get older? \n\nI know the best way to find out is to see a doctor, but since I often worry myself into thinking I have things I do not (in the past two years I have convinced myself I had blood poisoning, a blood clot, and a concussion... none of which I had \ud83e\udd17) I thought it would be better to ask here first. I would say it is probably worth getting checked out on the basis of the sprained ankles and altered gait (people telling you to pick up your feet) alone. \n\nMost types of CMT do not \"skip generations\" however, I assume you do not know what type your grandmother has and I suspect that your dad has not been tested, so it is possible that he has CMT but a very minor case that has not been diagnosed. \n\nSome good news: even if you have CMT it is very slowly progressive. Symptoms vary a lot from person to person but if you made it to your mid-20s without knowing you had it, you are likely to have a very mild form, if you have it at all.\n\nA lot of people with CMT get cold easily but so do a lot of otherwise perfectly normal people; Reynaud's disease is a thing where your hands and feet tend to overreact to cold. \n\nGetting tested for CMT is not really an urgent thing from what you have said, since it sounds like you are doing OK. CMT will not surprise you with anything overnight; it is very slow to develop and there is no real treatment anyway. I would say it is worth discussing with your doctor but if testing is going to be very expensive for you right now, you could easily put it off for years. The main advantage would probably be peace of mind, knowing if you do or do not have it, and if you are considering having children you could make more informed decisions. Nobody here can tell you sorry. It is going to require a medical diagnosis without more family history. You list symptoms that are common in CMT, however correlation does not equal causation. Thanks! Yes, I do not know what type she has and my dad has not been tested as far as I know. I do not plan on having kids, so no problem there. This has reassured me :) Yes, it is \u201cpossible\u201d. Some forms of CMT are dominant, some are recessive. Also people can demonstrate severely or mildly. If you have insurance, genetic testing has become much more affordable. I have known I had CMT for 30+ years, but had genetic testing this summer to find out I have CMT 2A. We then tested my kids (who were 50/50) and both came back clear. \n\nYou can hunt for a neurologist near you through the CMTA.", "CNN: Heaven over hospital: Dying girl, age 5, makes a choice  ", "Anyone give fake joke answers for your visible afo\u2019s?

Same end result, this shitty thing to help the calf\". Seemed to understand without ruining the mood. How is this related to CMT though? No offence, just asking. Apparently, it is more common in folks with CMT. My doctor thinks that part of why it is so pronounced is because my weaker core muscles did not pull it down as strongly as I was growing. We actually did a test and when I flex my abs it lowers almost an inch. How did you even get AFO's? My gf is 29, CMT-1A and her physiotherapist ordered her a walker... No help whatsoever, it just adds more pressure to her hands which are one of her most affected areas. She needs to go to her GP, or general practitioner, or her local doctor, and have them look at her feet and her gate, and get a prescription for orthotics from an orthotist. It is a pretty easy process, insurance will often cover all, if not most of the cost. Have her find a good Physiatrist (Rehabilitation Doctor). They will work with her on mobility aids better than a GP or Physiotherapist. Neurologists that specialize in CMT might also be helpful. I work 48+ hours a week on my feet. I have not told anyone at work I have neuropathy. I wear them under my pants so they are pretty hidden. Even though I am sure people see me stumbling and always holding on to things or my odd gait nobody has mentioned anything to me.\n\nI have worn them with shorts at the boardwalk and I do notice people staring but again nobody says anything to me.\n\nI actually think they look pretty neat, I have the Allard ToeOff Flow 2.5. That is what mine look like as well. I live in Florida so shorts are standard every day, so catching people glancing is very common for me. Agree regarding getting a referral to a orthotist from the GP. But I will warn, I have pretty good PPO insurance and since I was below my deductible it was still 700 f\u2019n dollars for my\nAFO\u2019s so. Be prepared. You live in Florida and have not blamed a gator attack?? Oh fuck, that is good. Thanks for the idea. Wait I have this too! I never knew someone else who had it! Or that it was related to CMT! So cool to not be alone\u2026 Well, howdy! My mom has been known to tell people who ask questions that it is a highly contagious condition she has ..   seems to send them away quickly. ;) My partner tells kids he is a cyborg. I say they are a fasion accessory", "Forearm Skin Discomfort Hey all!\n\nI (26F) have just recently (in the last like 4-5 years), developed very sensitive skin in both my forearms on the underside. Sensitive meaning, it physically hurts when I or anyone else brushes the skin on my forearm. Does anyone else experience this?\n\nLike it is an immediate retraction of my arm like someone sliced it with a knife. I have neuropathy in my feet and cannot tell when they are cold, but no pain when accidentally brushed against something.\n\nDiagnosed when I was 13 they think with CMT1a. Just curious if anyone else experiences this! I have never heard of this symptom before.  Have you considered trying oxandrolone at 7.5 mg morning and night each day?  It is been shown to cause reinnervation.  Men would take a higher dose of course.\n\nGive it several months to word.  Nerves grow very slow. I am not familiar with this exact symptom but I wonder if it is related to how some of us have very sensitive feet? That is, if I get what should be a very slight pain to the bottom of my arches or to the top of my foot it actually feels very, very painful. Perhaps the sensory nerves in your forearms are suffering a similar level of nerve damage. Oxandrolone is a controlled substance with potentially serious side effects. OP may wish to discuss something like this with their doctor but I do not think it is appropriate to casually recommend taking a drug that could cause cancer, liver failure, birth defects if OP happens to be pregnant, ect. as if it were no big deal.  \n\nThere \\*is\\* some slight evidence that oxandrolone could help, but it is in the same category as a ketogenic diet or taking lecithin right now--some tenuous hints that it might help, nothing solid. And the oxandrolone is probably more likely to do damage to someone than cutting out all the carbs or eating more eggs. Hello!\n\nI appreciate the input :) I probably would not take this drug without consulting a doctor first, but for sure will be doing some research! Thank you for your input! Yeah, I definitely would not just take a drug willy nilly without consulting a doctor first. I appreciate your feedback though on this drug! \n\nI am fairly low carb and do notice a positive cognitive and physical response. Nothing yet in terms of nerves, but I do like how I feel when strictly low carb :) Could be! Never thought of that. I do have severely weakened hands and forearms (cannot flex my hand back). So it would not surprise me if the nerves are just started to get more damaged. This definitely isnt a drug that should be taken lightly, or can even procured easily due to its legal status in most countries, but I would say it expands far past tenuous hints as a treatment for CMT and that it is practically criminal that neurologists the world over are ignoring this paper:\n\n\n\nUnfortunately due to the politicising and subsequent legal barriers put in place around AAS', doctors are reluctant to study oxandralone further, even though that initial paper is incredibly promising. \n\nIn terms of its safety, contrary to popular belief that steroids kill (they rarely do), oxandralone is extremely well researched, having been used on adults and children alike for numerous issues e.g.\n\n\n\nTo quote the above, which itself is filled with references confirming this following statement:\n\n\"This is a safe, inexpensive, and easily administered anabolic agent, and it is likely that it could benefit a wide range of surgical and medical patients.\" Of course consulting with a physician is wise.  She would not be able to acquire the medication in most countries without a script from a doctor.  It is listed as a controlled substance in the USA because Congress got together and said \"steroids are ruining our baseball\" and they wanted it banned, except they could not ban it because it had so many positive medical studies for people with muscular wasting (and other diseases).\n\nThere is actually a bit of evidence of nerve biopsies showing (  The nerve conduction velocity improvements in that experiment were fantastic! 9% faster nerves! That Is huge!  There are of course muscular gains as well which help with stability and health in general.  Oxandrolone in small doses has proven quite liver-safe and it has been well studied outside of CMT.\n\nI have been using oxandrolone for a while now and have not had a single fall, slip, or trip like I did before.  I used to sprain my ankles pretty bad two or three times a year and slip on various surfaces because of the slow nerve conduction velocities.  After oxandrolone for several months, I have not had a single issue other than the atrophies I already had and deformed foot structure.\n\n\nAs for Ketogenic diet -- I think you are confusing completely different metabolic actions.  Ketosis is absolutely nothing to do with how oxandrolone works.  Confusing the two completely differently things does /u/thelittlespoonsite no benefits. Literally every possible treatment that has been suggested on this forum has had someone who says it is practically criminal to not be investigated faster or for everyone not to be trying it themselves at home. \n\nThe paper on oxandrolone--which is exactly the paper I had in mind when I said there was some slight evidence that it might help--is interesting but it is a single case study. It absolutely does not prove that this can be an effective treatment. I certainly hope it is investigated further, but that is all. I am not confusing the two, I am saying that as far as scientific evidence goes there is just as much literature to support one than the other. The mechanisms are different. Through the years I have worked with multiple doctors treating CMT.  When I presented my current Primary Care Physician (PCP) the PXT3003 phase 2 results, he agreed to write a script for the components and allowed me to try the dose for several months to see if I have any improvements.\n\nUnfortunately I did not see any improvements after 6 months and eventually stopped due to the cost. He made me get the naltrexone microdose compounded, so it was costly... even though the drug itself is dirt cheap.\n\nAnother doctor I have been working with for an unrelated thing actually called me up during our routine followup call and suggested I should start to take oxandrolone specifically for CMT1A.  Since we already had updated bloodwork with great liver enzyme values among other things, he wrote me a script.\n\nI wish that call happened 10 years ago. That is a very patronising tone to take, especially given that almost all your statements regarding Oxandrolone are completely wrong - it is barely hepatoxic, certainly not carcinogenic, and is actually very safe when used correctly. While I am not advocating home-research, can you give a logical reason as to why in the past 5 years a safe, cheap, well-tolerated, extremely widely studied drug that showed promising results in a patient who had CMT has not been studied further?\n\nIf my, sadly, leading neurologist is anything to go by, it is because of academic snobbery and sheer medical ignorance. To quote her: \"But who is the author?\" Last I checked, a peer-reviewed paper is peer-reviewed to make sure such arbitrary conclusions are not drawn. She also said the same nonsense of the drug being dangerous, but that is just the result of people who hear \"steroids\" and instantly think of people who \\*abuse\\* steroids, such as Ronnie Coleman or  Paul Dillett while making the same false claims of the drug being dangerous because that is what they were once told. I think when steroids are mentioned, a lot of people get a knee-jerk reaction and have to state/believe that they are dangerous etc due to decades of political misinformation rather than taking it upon themselves to do the research. What literature is there that supports a ketogenic diet and CMT? ( and I cannot find a single paper that has tested this out. Personally I do not understand how myelin formation would be any way connected with ketosis.  I am not saying keto diets are bad.  As far I see it, they are a pretty neat metabolic trick!!!  But I just do not see how ketosis would change malformed myelin sheaths, improve reinnervation, reduce axonal damage, etc.  But it does seem to improve nerve growth in some situations.\n\nInterestingly there is a paper I found about central nervous system myelination and ketosis for Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (I have no idea what it is, so do not ask me) : \nIts important to note that this is about CNS -- Not peripheral nervous system like CMT1A.\n\nThere is also this paper: \n\n\nIts about peripheral nerve growth and I think this paper might be much more interesting for  /u/thelittlespoonsite because it talks about allodynia which is pain from stimuli that is not painful.  What she is describing here.\n\n\nLove the quote:\n&gt;\"We hypothesize that a ketogenic diet and ketone bodies themselves may alter neuronal metabolism that promotes axon integrity and/or axon growth. Future studies are needed to determine if a ketogenic diet has similar actions in humans and the intracellular mechanisms that may stimulate axon growth.\"\n\nThis is what I love about /r/CMT ... Super interesting paper, thanks for sharing - I would like to see what would happen if done on people with CMT, or diabetic neuropathy and whether the positive results are translated over to people! Cause cancer? Well that is just nonsense. Long term studies have shown a lot but that is not one of them.\nAlso you really cannot be comparing a keto diet to an AAS?! That is really misleading to OP I would advise that doctors, unless they are endocrinologists, are likely to be extremely poorly educated around oxandrolone as it is an anabolic steroid, which makes most people, doctors included, think of some meat head in a gym, thrown together with phases such as \"heart failure\", \"liver damage\", \"kidney failure\" and other horror stories which just are not true \ud83d\ude02\n\nIt would be worth going to a doctor prepared for such a knee-jerk reaction with a handful of papers that show it is an extremely safe, commonly used drug with very few side effects when used correctly, safe enough that it is given to children where appropriate. That way you should be able to either get a referral to someone who understands the pharmacokinetics of oxandrolone, or at least have the doctor rationally and logically evaluate oxandrolone as a treatment based on the current evidence that it can help people with CMT:\n\n( I get this sometimes, usually on my arms too, but sometimes other places like my thighs. Usually goes away after a few hours but is awful at the time! It is super weird who and what you decide to accept as an authority on any particular subject. There was a discussion on this forum last winter, perhaps in January, about ketogenic diets and also lecithin. I was simply thinking of that discussion when I commented about them, not trying to push a ketogenic diet or anything. \n\nThere were some papers linked then I believe, which I read and found interesting. I simply find the actual scientific evidence very lacking. I had to read this twice to savor the irony that you find my tone patronizing and then go on to contemptuously list all the shortcomings, in your eyes, of a leading neurologist. Certainly you are the pinnacle of respectful discourse, good sir. \n\nMy problem with your posts here is that you certainly do seem to be advocating home-research, if by that you mean pushing people to try this drug themselves without adequately considering potential negative effects. Perhaps the site I looked at was exaggerating about it being carcinogenic; it does still have real risks. \n\nThe first thing any doctor would reasonably ask about a paper is the author, because that allows you to look up the paper and no one can really give a comment without reading the paper for themselves. All peer-reviewed papers are not the same, but I really do not have time to explain our whole research literature system at the moment. \n\n\\&gt;  She also said the same nonsense of the drug being dangerous... \n\nI cant speak for your doctor but I do think there is a solid chance that her knowledge of this drug is based on more than seeing some case on the news once. So I am going to take that as a \"no\" in regard to having any evidence that suggests a ketogenic diet may help with CMT. \n\nI am not sure what is \"weird\" about what I accpet as an authority. Here is some reading because the value of peer-reviewed work should speak for itself, whereas unsubstantiated claims, even from doctors, could easily fall foul of being a fallacy:\n\n (\n\n( Your attitude really is unpleasant - please do not engage in this conversation if you are not willing to discuss this with an open mind. \n\nThe title \"leading neurologist\" does not make someone instantly right (that would be a logical fallacy), and, if you had taken the time to read the papers I linked, there are many, many papers showing Oxandrolone to be a well-tolerated and safe drug; it is literally been given to children without any adverse effects. **Doctors can be wrong**, and my story was to highlight the knee-jerk reaction of people ignorant about AAS'. The doctor dismissed the paper based on the author, not the content, which is inexcusable. \n\nAlso, **I did not recommend Oxandrolone to anyone** \\- **that was another user**. However, to instantly dismiss it, when other users here have had success with the drug under supervision of a doctor is absolutely the wrong attitude and is going against what research has shown, while you are also making completely false claims about the safety of the drug. If you are unwilling to accept that your preconceived notions of Oxandrolone are wrong, then that is down to you. Either way, claiming it is unsafe and there is little evidence is **wrong and helps no one.** \n\nFinally, let me ask you a question: where did **you** get the idea that anabolics are cargenogenic, dangerously hepatoxic etc? Did you get that from papers studying specific anabolic compunds, such as trenbolone or winstrol, or was that simply what you heard from years of media misinformation? I agree its nonsense fear mongering.  The \"steroids are bad, mmmmkay!\" attitude caused by years of propaganda in media and government, but not actually seeded in science.\n\nThere are literally millions of body builders who **abuse** anabolic steroids of all different types and formulations. Never have I heard cancer being a side for any of those users.  Remember they are dosing several times the doctor recommended amounts of various medications.  A body builder might be using 500-1200 mg per week of testosterone cypionate when a normal male might only use only 150mg per 2 weeks.  Trenbolone, which is not even a drug approved for human use, was developed for cattle livestock. It is heavily used by many body builders yet it has never shown evidence of causing cancer. &gt; So I am going to take that as a \"no\" in regard to having any evidence that suggests a ketogenic diet may help with CMT.\n\nYou are so close to getting my point. Ah yes, the old \"do not talk to me unless you agree with me\" truly a classic. \n\nWhat I have is a critical mindset. I do not leap to assume any new proposed treatment idea is right just because I wish it were. I evaluate the evidence skeptically, as I have been trained to do in the western scientific tradition. Maybe there is something here, maybe not. The evidence has only reached \"mildly intriguing\" hardly conclusive. Seriously, what is your problem? You are incredibly aggressive and negative. The petty personal attacks are uncalled for, especially from a moderator: \n\n* You made a serious of unfounded and completely incorrect claims about Oxandrolone\n* You mistook who recommended it\n* You are unable to even speculate why the paper was not followed up on and instead just make patronizing remarks. \n\nYou absolutely do not have a critical mindset, evident by your unfounded claims regarding Oxandrolone and the next steps that should have followed that paper. It demonstrated a strong hypothesis: Oxandrolone can help people with CMT-1a. Then, further, long term studies should take this hypothesis and expand upon it, as was recommended in the conclusion of the paper. What should not happen is the dismissal of the paper **for no good reason**. People in this subreddit have personally recommended it after having it prescribed, so to write it off because it does not fit your preconceived notions of what might be beneficial **helps no one**. \n\nYou gave OP bad information and seem unwilling to admit that. **Are you going to explain why you claimed Oxandrolone is extremely hepatoxic and carcinogenic or just carry on with the back-fire effect mentality?** I am not sure you have a point. Peer-reviewed work vs anecdotal evidence is not a point. It is a misunderstanding of the scientific method. \"Western scientific tradition\"? What the heck on you on about? A) it is called the scientific method B) from someone who actually has published work in a world leading journal, I can tell you are not basing you are view on facts, but scepticism and fear. \n\nAlso something is better than nothing. I think everyone here can agree that we have all been lied to for years by doctors claiming \"there is something great just around the corner\".... And that was 20 years ago. In the meantime you either have to be proactive and take risk, or wallow and pray for a miracle cure. Here are some of the reasons why I do not feel like you have ever been engaging in good faith or as someone who wants to be a part of this forum community, and therefore why I do not feel inclined to devote significant time and energy to answering your questions: \n\nYou have been active on Reddit for years but only became active in this forum once you had something (your own website) to push.\n\nMost of your posts have been pushing that site.\n\nYou have never come here and laid out your experience with using SARMs. You constantly say that you have knowledge about them and then point to your own site, which does not itself have any details about your experience but only affiliate links to buy. You must have had a personal journey, discovering SARMS as an option and probably trying different ones to arrive at whatever it is you are doing now. This might be interesting and relevant, more so than your page of sparse information and plentiful affiliate links. \n\nYou are highly critical of all doctors, researchers, and all other CMT sites but your own. \n\nYou seem to hate suggestions that medical professionals can help people or that people should exercise caution in trying alternative treatments. \n\nYou dislike cautions that people should be fully aware of potential side effects and take them into consideration when making a decision. You do sometimes acknowledge that there could be side effects but do not seem to take these potential side effects seriously. \n\nYou confidently spout errors that should be obvious to anyone who has spent any time talking to other CMT'ers, such as that everyone gets diagnosed as a teen or that everyone has high arches. You do not ever acknowledge that you are wrong when confronted with lived experiences which differ from your own. \n\nOverall I get the impression that you are here mainly to exploit this community to drive traffic to your own site rather than to contribute here. I think you are reckless in pushing SARMs as an option without always acknowledging the circumstances where they could be counterindicated or what side effects could result. Further, your disdain toward modern medical practice and the people who follow their doctor's advice is disrespectful to a huge number of people here who are doing the best they can, with the best advice available. I did not mean to confuse you. The western scientific tradition includes the scientific method but also many other things. In modern times it includes our system of publishing in journals. In the context of medicine it includes the concept of \"First, do no harm.\"\n\nI am skeptical, yes. Skeptical of all newly proposed treatments--or indeed skeptical of any new ideas in my field. Such is my training, to skeptically evaluate the evidence rather than blindly embracing something just because I want it to be true. \n\nI absolutely do not agree that \"we have all been lied to by doctors\". My doctors have never told me that there is something great just around the corner. If they had I expect they would have said it because they believed it, not because they were trying to fool me. There is active research ongoing and it is the nature of such that we cannot know for sure how it will work out until the work is done. Doctors can hope, too.\n\nFollowing the best available medical advice is NOT wallowing. You can choose whatever you want for your own health but coming here and insulting our community members for following their doctor's advice is crossing a line. \n\nIf you have done any biology research I expect your IRB reviews were very lively with the attitude you have here. I am not going to address anything you have said there as it is an absurd series of claims aimed at deflecting the question. So let me ask again:\n\n**Are you going to explain why you claimed Oxandrolone is extremely hepatoxic and carcinogenic?**\n\nInstead of writing a 400-word personal attack, can you answer the question? I am not confused.\n\nI have stated some of my background in this field so please do not belittle me, especially when you have not stated your own work.\n\nWell I, and many others, have been lied to, placated etc, by lazy doctors who just want someone to research a miracle cure rather than doing their job. CMT has many ailments that could possibly be alleviated by current medicines via off label usage. However the overly cautious approach has led to a stagnation of progression (in medicine as a whole). Look at how far all other fields of science have progressed, yet medicine is lagging behind drastically. The aversion to any risk will always hinder its progress as progress is inherently risky.\n\nAlso I am not the one who has insulted anyone, nor would I ever intend to. Please do not make such claims. And to note, my paper was reviewed with much enthusiasm for the potential it could open up into that field of research. How about yourself? You certainly appeared to be confused about what the western scientific tradition is, so I clarified. \n\nSince you are curious, I have published half a dozen biology papers in peer reviewed journals. Plus several book chapters, but those are not peer reviewed but editorially reviewed. \n\nBiology has made amazing progress in the last few decades. The translation into medicine is a somewhat bumpier road for various reasons but I would hardly call it stagnant. I did answer your question. Your question was \"Seriously, what is your problem?\" and I answered it. \n\nYour other question I ignored for various reasons: as stated above I do not think you are engaging in good faith for a real discussion, the question you asked rephrased what I said to sound more extreme, and my point was, and is, that someone should talk to their doctor before taking steroids. So you are going to ignore the important question, leave incredibly misleading information in the post and pretend that you had a point. Shame on you. Saying \"check with a doctor\" is not the same as claiming something causes cancer, and you are not convincing anyone otherwise.", "Does Cmt affect posture? Hey I currently have cmt and terrible looking awkward hunchback posture (along with scoliosis). Been trying to correct it for years with little luck. I think I need to be more committed but I was wondering since I have watched many videos online with people who have cmt and many of them have a similar awkwardness looking upper body and I was wondering if that is really common and if there is even any hope for me to fix it. Thanks! Following bc I also have scoliosis and terrible posture It is hard man. I used to have the same hunch in the upper back and when I would try to stand straight it would hurt/ get fatigued very fast. I recommend only sleeping flat on your back on a firmer surface as well as doing stretching/ strengthening which I am sure you are already doing. Try to spend as much time as possible every day with a straight back and avoiding going back to the hunch. If you have CMT and scoliosis (a sideways curvature of the spine) then there is a probability that you could also have (or are developing) kyphosis (an excessive outward curvature of the spine).\nStudies have shown that between 10% to about 40% of people with CMT have scoliosis, and a large percentage of these also have kyphosis. The prevalence is higher in some CMT subtypes than others.\nA bad posture does not necessarily mean kyphosis, but because of the high prevalence in people with CMT I think we should be vigilant about it.\n\nKyphosis in CMT patients can not be corrected or stopped from progressing with braces or other non-invasive methods (as far as I know), although in some cases the deformity does not progress to a point where surgery is needed.\nMonitoring the curvature to see if there is progression over time is advisable, and spinal fusion surgery is often needed if the curvature continues to progress over time.\n\nAs far as I understand it the cause of spinal deformities in CMT is not understood, but I have discussed it with an orthopedic surgeon who specialized in spine surgery as well as with my neurologist and both hypothesized that it might be caused by a CMT-induced muscle imbalance.\n\nThe cause for idiopathic scoliosis (scoliosis where the cause is not known) is not understood, despite there being a lot of different data that points in many different directions. The current consensus for idiopathic scoliosis is that the cause is likely multifactorial and complex, and I personally think it is likely that the cause in CMT patients is also more complex than just a muscle imbalance.\n\nI am not a doctor, but I think anyone who has CMT and possible spinal issues should have it assessed by a specialist, especially children and adolescents because it usually develops from an early age and having data on the progression is important if it comes to a point where surgery needs to be considered. Also, get massage, it could help, but not on your back, on your pecs and rib cage It definitely does. I actually have a yoga routine that my PT has me on to help straighten my back out. I will come back and give more details later today. I have very bad kyphosis.  I am a hunchback, looks absolutely terrible.  But the pain is very manageable.  The doctors wanted to perform a spinal fusion when I was 18, but I had very minimal pain then so I refused.  Now I am 36 and the pain is still manageable.  It hurts if I sit at a computer all day or am on my feet alot.  A little stretching and I am as good as new.\n\n\nI still have doctor's tell me that I should have my back operated on but to me it is just a cosmetic surgery. I am trying to get an appointment with a Scroth trained physical therapist but they were shutdown during covid and are now backlogged with new patients. I need the good as new... What are your restorative stretches??  Two spine surgeries and classic CMT1a, not proven thru genetic testing. Hammertoes and foot are so painful to walk on. Thanks\n\nStanding up straight has always been hard, and doesnt feel natural.Always  thought it was because I was ( have I shrunk and find that ribs hurt if I dont straighten up.Never connected it to CMT. Thanks My feet are bad too.  Having my left foot operated on by Dr. Pfeiffer in Los Angeles this fall.  I really think muscle imbalances caused by my poor gait led to my kyphosis.  I really want to try Scroth method physical therapy, they try to target the muscle imbalances that cause back issues.\n\n\nHonestly it does not take much to resolve my back pain day to day.  I will foam roll back, lay on the floor on my back and try to straighten out my upper back and neck, then I lay on my stomach and do whatever that yoga pose is that arches your upper back and neck. Used to be worse when I worked in an office all day and could not really lay down on the floor and stretch.\n\n\nI am 6' tall and been told by doctors I would be 6'4\" if my back was normal. Yes, I also love the floor to stretch out. Will look into Scroth method for pt. I am in pt now,again, for foot pain bt leg spasms always stop any progress. Did you do genetic testing and find a result? Have you looked at the group Inspire/ CMT. They are great. I had genetic testing to confirm type 1A.  I also did had genetic testing done as part of invitro fertilization to make sure I did not pass it on to my children.  Two CMT free kids.\n\nI have not seen that group.  I pretty much only come here and Facebook CMTA group. Thanks! how do you prevent yourself from turning at night? I also got chronic back pain for the last few years not sure if its related to cmt or cmt the reason for it not healing but makes it even more difficult to stay in place. I went and had several xrays and showed nothing besides scoliosis. No kyphosis they said. wish I had the money :/ any update? No insurance coverage? My bad homie, busy weekend.\n\nSo I actually ended up going to PT for a bit for a variety of issues caused by CMT. For posture specifically I do cobra pose 10 times and then with a 6 inch back roller I put it a bit below my shoulder blades and try to get my head to touch the floor. This is really to straighten out that hunchback I am starting to develop. Breathing out is important when you are stretching the most. I do those two and then a variety of other stretches for my hamstrings and hip flexors at least twice if not three times a day. I also got lumbar support cushions for my car and my office chair and make an effort to sit up straighter. I had to give up my couch spot for about 3 months but it was worth it. I also do a standing desk for 2 to 3 hours a day at work. I want to start sleeping on my back but works been crazy so I have not started the transition yet. \n\nI can honestly say my back is doing much much better. I have had pretty severe scoliosis my whole life and always gone to chiropractors but my PT person was a life savor. I would recommend going to one if there is a good one in your area. I am happy to hear you do not have kyphosis! Physiotherapy can often improve posture in non-CMT patients so that would be the obvious next step. Especially considering the scoliosis, consulting a physiotheraphist is a good idea before attempting any exercise aiming to improve posture.\n\nThere have been many attempts at decreasing the curvature of idiopathic scoliosis with physiotherapy but so far the evidence seems to suggest that its not possible. However, physiotherapy can in many cases slow the progression of idiopathic scoliosis and improve pain if that is an issue. As far as I am aware of there are no studies on CMT-associated scoliosis and physiotherapy, however it is conceivable that some of the findings for idiopathic scoliosis is transferable. At any rate, physiotherapy is your best option when it comes to conservative management of spine conditions. I am naturally a side sleeper as it is far more comfortable and I tend to curl up which only made my back worse, I found on a soft bed turning was inevitable. I have been sleeping next to my bed on the carpeted floor for nearly a year now and for me it has made all the difference. Turning was a problem at the start and I would wake up on my side even stiffer and with more pain than before. I then started using a heavy weighted blanket (45lbs) and that stopped me from rotating. I am now able to sleep without it and not move. As far as the pain, I have been doing massage therapy every 2 weeks for a while now and I find it helps alleviate the soreness/stiffness a lot. They can be expensive but I was able to find a place that is more medical oriented and is covered in my hospital insurance.", "Combination of drugs shows promise for CMT1a in preliminary human trial ", " On My Nerves - Small Irritations  Weekly thread for the little CMT things bugging you this week.

I am not trying to be rude I was just diagnosed a year ago and have a really REALLY rare kind :( 1A for me. \nIf I recall correctly 70% of CMT patients are diagnosed with type 1A. X here. What is yours then? 1A here as well! \nKeep in mind that even though you have one of the very rare kinds, it could still be very similar to others in symptoms or even in it is biology! So in terms of hoping for a cure for instance, there could still be cause for optimism. I have known I have CMT for 30+ years, but just had genetic testing to find out I have 2A. 2A2 1B I have CMT Type 2N for anyone wondering. Apparently I am 'one in a million' Type 2N 2C 2S here Me too! Hang in there! A treatment for 1A is closer to becoming a reality than ever before. Really?? What treatment? \ud83d\ude01 There are several promising candidates in various stages of human trials and more in the pipeline that is undergoing animal and pre-clinical testing. Which one will be the first to market is still up in the air, but things are shaping up! I have 2A and am waiting on genetic tests to come back for my 2 children (21 &amp; 24)", "Is arm discomfort common? Hey! I have had CMT 1A for my entire life and was diagnosed as a child. I am 24 years old now and I am lucky enough to have fairly moderate symptoms. However, over the past couple of years I have noticed that my right arm feels weaker and it now it has a constant dull aching pain that gets worse with activity. For example, my arm hurts when I do simple tasks such as washing the dishes or even texting on my phone for long periods of time. It varies but it can hurt from my wrist all the up to my shoulder. So I am wondering, is this type of experience common for CMT? \n\nThanks for your help! Yes, have had pain and muscle weakness from my hands to my shoulders since I was diagnosed 34 years ago. It could be CMT related nerve pain I guess but it could also be something like carpal tunnel. In addition to my CMT 1A I have deQuervain's tenosynovitis, which is similar to carpal tunnel but for the thumb tendon. A constant dull aching pain that gets worse with use is a good description of that sort of thing. \n\nIf it is a repetitive stress injury like carpal tunnel or deQuervain's it is best to get it diagnosed ASAP. Mine was caught very early and as a result has been quite manageable. Delaying intervention makes it a lot harder to treat. I have pretty consistent nerve pain in my arms. what was the intervention in your case? Yep I feel that way too. It usually goes away eventually but comes back as well. Yes, I have a weird discomfort in my arms. Sometimes pain, sometimes numbness and pain together. Weather changes tend to have a big effect on pain as well. Yes! I have perceived weakness and numbness on the left side of my body and thought maybe it was something else as well. Will be keeping an eye on this thread. Ibuprofen when it hurts, not just as a pain reliever but because the pain indicates that it is inflamed and bringing the inflammation down reduces the damage done by moving. \n\nI wore a splint that immobilized my thumb for a couple of weeks to stop me from making the wrong movements. It was very annoying but also quite effective. Since I was not too bad off, after 2 weeks my pain was mostly gone and I had learned to avoid doing things that irritated it so now I can pull the splint on if I am having a flare up but mostly I just take it easy if the pain starts to come back. \n\nIce was also recommended for reducing inflammation but I hate ice packs and did not really use them. \n\nA physical therapist also gave me some tips like not to rotate my wrist while supporting weight. Sadly I cannot remember all of them or explain it as well as she did. This sort of advice plus a customized splint would probably be the things you would most benefit from if you do have something like this and pursue a proper diagnosis and treatment. I had two sessions, one the day I was diagnosed and one follow up two weeks later. Those appointments and a little caution in my every day life have averted a lot of pain. I switched to using a left handed mouse when I started having right arm pain. Different types of computer mouse hardware helped, too. Thanks plenty, appreciate all the info \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Yes I get this too. My hands fatigue quicker or get numb. The weather also seems to impact this. Can be frustrating when you are not mentally tired but physically your hands are.", "Hey guys just wondering... ", "Successful Tendon Transfer &amp; Calf Lengthening Well I just got home from surgery that was performed yesterday and by all accounts it was a success. Doc reckons that all is mended. Hurts but nothing crazy and I have to keep pressure of it for 10 days then I get a moon boot and hopefully I can start walking then. Very tricky getting about without use of my leg as I cannot use crutches as my balance is Non-existing XD still think my body\u2019s natural processes is slightly screwy but I hope the general anaesthetic will fully wear off after a nights rest in my own bed. \n\nI will keep you all up to date on how much of a difference this has made. Currently feels like my ankle is being grinded XD I would be happy to answer any questions if I can but it is still early doors yet. Glad it went well! Best of luck for the healing process! Very happy for you - I just got my surgery done 6 weeks ago! One question though, how do you/ your doctor know that the transfer was successful straightaway? Is not it something that has to be healed and trained? I had this surgery done in 1992. It is amazing to hear that it is still helping people. Well I think he is confident that everything went well as he says everything has been mended but your right the real fight begins after the cast comes off So is this surgery even remotely beneficial for very mild CMT people?  I have got no pain, but tight Achilles, which prevents squatting and range of ankle motion as well as affecting balance somewhat.  I assume this surgery is for worse off patients? I am looking into the lengthening without the tendon transfer. No foot drop from weak muscles, only tight achilles. Might be worth looking at? For me it was to try and nip it in the bud  or at the very least make it better off years down the line. It was only just starting to get bad for me with it slapping the ground so I decided that now was the best time to act. If you have not shown signs of foot drop or ankle instability maybe sit on for now cause those are the symptoms this surgery was designed to address. I would seek the advice of a doctor, friend. Could be that physio is all that is needed just now for your Achilles. The more I read people\u2019s stories the more I realise that CMT is pretty much a spectrum with unpredictable qualities. Well, the doctor suggested it. First comment he made was \"if stretching were going to help, it would have done so by now\". Waiting on the referral to see the surgeon. I had tendon transfers done on both legs 29&amp; 28 years ago. Those surgeries changed my life for the better. You will not regret it.", "My dumbass feet  They are pretty. Lol thank you! I know I am fortunate in many ways, even though I would never go so far as to call my (or any) feet \u201cpretty\u201d haha. I just want to stay as mobile as I can for as long as I can. I have a very small kid and not a lot of help. I have a seven year old I take care of by myself. He keeps me moving, which is good but I wish I had more energy. The pain I can deal with, it is the fatigue that plagues me most. And yes your feet are pretty. Not terrible., at least they are the same in length. Lol just try to stay as active as possible. That is always helped me. Also wearing high top shoes (I know they are not very fashionable) will give you more ankle support.   CMT in VA represent! My feet cannot flex like that at all anymore. I would say yours look pretty decent to me. When you say you want to help them, what do you mean? They look fine but if it bothers you put a shoe on,,, my sons cmt is much worse,,,, I am not trying to complain unnecessarily. I am dealing with a new diagnosis, and the context is that one of my parents was very mobility-impaired my whole life but she/we thought it was related to an injury (it is a long story), so I never contemplated it could be something that could be genetic and therefore impact me. We now know she had CMT, and I struggle with wondering if I could have/can still do anything to maintain my mobility for my child\u2019s sake. He does not really have another parent in the picture. I am anxious. And I do not know if my \u201cmild\u201d CMT now is going to take a turn for the worse. \n\nI know this is survivable. I know I can still have a great life. But as a child of a parent who was \u201cdifferent\u201d in a major way that made playing and running and joining in games very hard, it is been difficult to come to grips with my child having the same experience. I am certainly not accusing you of complaining. Please do not feel that I was. I understand it is stressful. :) I legitimately was wondering what you would like to do for your feet, and letting you know that they are not in as bad shape as you might fear. \n\nI do struggle to think of exercises or habits one could perform to help maintain dorsiflexion in their foot. But what has really helped me with foot drop (should you end up there) are AFO supports. I got carbon fiber ones and they really help me improve my mobility. I dont trip nearly as much and can move way way faster without getting tired. I also have a much easier time weed eating and driving with my AFO\u2019s because they stop my feet from going limp and getting in my way. If you have this issue I strongly recommend them. \n\nBut for maintaining strength I think a visit to a physical therapist might be a great bet if you can manage it. Even just a single visit they may be able to provide you exercises you can do for your feet and ankles to help preserve them I know they are not great for standing or running, but they are pretty. I always felt self-conscious about people seeing my CMT feet, but yours look nice - polish and everything! Well thank you. I just wish they flexed the same. It is so perplexing even though I understand the nerve issues, sort of. Flex, feet, flex! \ud83d\ude02 Stretch out your Achilles\u2019 tendon and just stretch your legs in general. I do calf raises and I rotate my ankles around 30 times every time I put socks on (convenient reminder for me to do it). Look at you, showing off, \u201cOOH! Look at me, I can still move my toes!\u201d. Just kidding, both my feet are just plain floppy these days, literally no response anymore, looks like you might getting hammer toes already? Exercise helps keeping anything affected in better working condition longer. How are your hands? So funny story for you all, I was disqualified from the military because I could not do this thing at the medical screening called a duck walk, it is basically walking on your heels while in a deep squat. I was in my early 20s then and was the only person who could not do it. And everyone was so nice like, just pick up your feet and I am like what the gd f do you mean pick them up, how do you even do that?! 10 years later I get diagnosed with CMT and feel so validated. Now I just need to track down that asshole CrossFit instructor who berated me when I could not do a squat... I think my hands are ok? I cannot really hang on the monkey bars when I take my kid to the playground anymore but that is not a super critical life skill haha. I do get some numbness sometimes. Can anything help my hands? Hmm, look up hand strengthening exercises. Like I said, anything that uses what is affected by the disease is good. Also look up hand strengtheners. I can still clench my hands really well, by flexing my fingers out there is not much strength at all. It is really not noticeable! If you have no pain, I am not sure what you want to address. Just make sure to stretch your feet. As the distal muscle weakens, it will get pulled on and other muscles like your calf can shorten and this will cause your problems. It is what I am dealing with right now...\n\nMy feet are severely internally rotated, have no muscle, hammer toes, very bad high arch, so I can only walk on the outside of my foot. Now I also have calf pain that is unbearable because I do not stretch. It is all regrettable. I have just started physical therapy for my feet. It is very helpful, they help you find excersizes that will help your feet and slow the progression of cmt as much as possible. I would start with that.", "Pressure Sore Offloading Options  I have used offloading boots, but they are too cumbersome. And honestly I hate people looking at me in public. \n\nSo I came up with this. I took a heavy duty insole and cut out offloading holes to provide room for the sores. \n\nI then used felt pads to add height so the sores do not touch the bottom of my shoes. You can see i added to my heel and around the outside of my foot because it was causing my to twist my ankle. \n\nThe felt pads and insoles do not last very long. Maybe a few months. \n\nI have shown my system to my neurologists, and they think it is pretty smart but still recommend seeing a pedorthist. I think that is how it is spelled. \n\nI am going to try it, but if you are in need, or cannot see s doctor, I thought I should share for the good of the community. That is a pretty good crack at making your own inserts!

Oh cool, I did not know the CMTA had these. Thanks for sharing. Excellent find! Thanks Much! Agreed! Well that is interesting! Will have to check these videos out!

Played sports, but that faded into high school. We always knew something was not right. During an ankle surgery a med student identified it in me. A neurologist later confirmed (by symptoms) and then much later verified and specified by genetic testing. If you have insurance, genetic testing is affordable now (in the US) He was confirmed by his symptoms. His genetic testing appointment was delayed by Covid and general health care overbooking.

As far as having kids go, w/most types there is a 50/50 chance a child will inherit but you can do IVF with PGD to choose an embryo without CMT. Wow current science really is amazing these days.

The Charcot Marie Tooth Association is a decent place to start for a general overview: ( \n\nI can only speak very generally, since I do not even know much about your fiancee, even his age or what type he has. Usually CMT follows a slowly progressive course. This does make it fairly predictable, absent something that could cause a sudden change like a big change in lifestyle.\n\nIf he has the most common type of CMT, CMT1A, then any children have a 50/50 chance of inheriting it. It is slightly more complicated if he has CMTX or one of the rare recessive types.\n\nCMT has a wide range of impacts on people's lives.

I am 21 and I have been diagnosed with CMT 1 year ago and I started to lose strength gradually and I am actually tight. I do not stretch frequently because I had no idea that it is important for people with CMT.. so I want to adjust my life and make it healthier by exercising since i never engage in any type of physical demanding activity always been lazy.. I am actually thinking of swimming and bodybuilding and some yoga at home but I heard that bodybuilding will not help much to gain strength and also it is hamrful to CMT patients.. What do you think guys? did anyone work out and get a good results?\n\nThanks, CMT varies a lot so it is hard to say. I recently set up an appointment with a Physical therapist via my doctor and I strongly recommend doing the same, as she basically told me not to exercise except for the program we developed for me (which is kind of contrary to what I was told back when I was diagnosed) I am just wondering when you got diagnosed did they ask for a nerve biopsy? or an EMG was enough for the diagnosis? \n\nThanks. They tried to do a NCS on me when I was a kid but I refused haha. I was diagnosed with type 1A by DNA testing when I was 14. haha yeah I did it and it was painful i mean i wish i did not do it but I had to :P may I ask you something? Do you have any problems with your balance and strength? and did your doctor prescribe you any medicine? vitamins or something? Exercising is very important but it is essential that you know your limits and do not push yourself too hard. If you hurt yourself in the gym it could take weeks if not months to recover. Swimming is definitely great and it is important to stretch (something that I need to do more). \n\nI have been lifting weights at the gym for several years now with a strong focus on strengthening my core. It has been very challenging to put on muscle, but I do have good muscle definition. I would recommend doing workouts that use your body weight first and to avoid weighted workouts that require balance \u2014 such as squats. \n\nI can go into more detail about what workouts I do for which muscle groups, but in general I would still highly recommend getting into a regular workout routine, especially while you are still in your 20s. I am 23 and I know that if I do not train my body now, the health repercussions I could have in my future will be much worse.  Thank you for your reply. Yes, I understand we have to be healthy now before it is too late and regret it. I actually have weak legs and arms and my body is kind of weak overall. I never play sport or do stretch.. I used to work out before getting diagnosed with CMT which was 2 years ago I worked out for a year.. I saw some improvement in my body shape I was so skinny but when I started hitting the gym I gained some weight but my strength did not improve much.. I cannot even do Squats, DLift, Pull up, push up (maybe 3 push ups only) and then when I got diagnosed I stopped going to the gym actually.. I was so upset and do not know what to do.. but now I decided to fight back since I am losing balance when i walk i swing right and left and I do not want this to progress so I thought of hitting the gym and doing machine workouts with low weight and doing stretches every single day. I would be really really grateful if you guided me through this.. Shitty balance, weak, pain. I have got it. No medication tho, do you mean like pain meds or what? Join the cmt athletes group on Facebook. It is uplifting and inspiring. There are also quite a few cmt athletes on instagram. #cmtathletes  I have been diagnosed with CMT at age 12. Ever since I have been going to physical therapy once or twice a week. I am 31 now, so I have been through a couple of therapists and treatments. I find that doing physical therapy helps with keeping your strenght up, helps to maintain balance, etc. Cycling is a good exercise for us with CMT. My biggest advice is do not go over your limit, as you will need more time to recover. It is better to guard your limits and listen to what your body is capable of day by day.  Thank you!  Done. No, I meant supplements such as CoQ 10, Alpha lipoic acid, Anti-oxidants? Righty, so here is my experience of going to the gym and stretching for almost 15 years (diagnosed at 15, now 29).\n\n- Stretching is very important as you do not use a lot of your leg and feet muscles correctly when walking. You have to do this as often as possible.\n\n- Every doctor is in denial about CMT and exercise. You categorically can not gain any muscle with CMT. I tried everything legal for 14 years and got no where. This is true of anyone else with CMT who has tried exercise. You cannot gain strength, mass, or improve your cardio regardless of diet, exercise program, or intensity. The only way to get gains is with PEDs, and that is a whole different story. What type of CMT do you have and how severe is it?  I am still doing on diagnosis.. I am going to do a nerve biopsy soon and determine what type is it.\n\nwell.. it is not very severe I mean I can walk and I can do daily tasks but I lack balance and strength as well as mobility. I can walk and run but balance is not there.  I also do not have claw toes it is fine but I have high arches.  hmmm... but is not exercising important? You are saying that I cannot gain any muscle so I should stop weight-lifting.. What about swimming? yoga? should I do these? It is a fallacy jackass doctors recommend because they are either stupid or in denial. The issue is that you will lose any muscle strength within a few weeks of stopping, so hope you do not get ill or go on holiday!\nStretching is what you want to focus on at the moment, and then look at PEDs in a few years as doctors should be prescribing oxandralone or nandralone decenate to compensate for the muscle wastage.  I have been diagnosed with (mild) CMT and I started exercising in earnest last year. I absolutely have gained strength and muscle mass.\n\nI took an extended break and got back into it two months ago and I already see a visible difference. The only place where really nothing I do matters much is my calves.\n\nThe main problem for me has been\n crossfit types who will try to pretend CMT is not real and push you too hard, because it takes longer to recover. That and some muscle groups will look a bit odd or disproportionate and you just have to be positive and accept it (example my calves but even they look better). CMT attacks muscle groups differently. You may find that gains in calves and forearms are difficult to build / maintain while biceps and calves are less so.\n\nThe idea that all people with CMT are literally incapable of building or maintaining any muscle simply is not true.\n\nThe fallacy is when doctors claim you need to \u201cbuild it now so if CMT gets worse you have it later,\u201d which is not how muscles work Hello, Id like to try and help.  I had a surgery back in May 2105 and it opened so many new doors for me physically, I am now able to do so many things in less pain than I could have ever imagined before.  I work out at least 3 times a week and sometime push myself too hard, but I am determined to achieve my goals.  That said I am very careful to not do exercises that give me lasting joint pain that I can attribute to resulting from having done the exercise.\n\nThe things I avoid the most are\n\nDumbbells \n\nNon-assisted squats\n\nHeavy Benching/  heavy weights pushing down on the wrists\n\nI wear wristwraps to help prevent forearm stress.  The biggest thing for me is being sure not to overwork my hands, so many upper body strength building exrecises are hard on the wrists and with CMT we dont have as much wrist strength, also the hands take longer to recover than most muscles and are important to everyday/ everything.  I have found dumbbells to be the biggest problem in causing wrist/ hand fatigue, I personally never touch dumbbells and stick to only bars/ 2 handed exercises.\n\nFeel free to PM me any questions.  If you need a fitness trainer to suggest exercises I really like AthleanX, Jeff is really knowledgeable and a PT.  He has tons of videos on Youtube.\n\nAlso last but probably most important is to stretch, I spend at least 20 min every time I gym stretching.  Yoga with Adrienne is a good resource for Yoga, and you get to watch her do yoga so its a win-win.    The first year is normally just muscle conditioning and starter gains. You will hit a brick wall and will not be able to get past it. Also you cardio will stop improving pretty quickly as well. Trust me, I have been at this for over a decade.  Sure, you may not be able to be a body builder, but building and maintaining even \u201cstarter gains\u201d is better than nothing. \n\n So CMT does not attack anything as its a genetic issue which means your nerves do not form properly. It is very hard to develop any upper body strength when you have a huge weakness in the forearm as it is means you cannot curl properly etc. Plus with muscle deconditioning that can be measured in weeks rather than months, this really limits and serious gains.\n\nWhen I see someone with CMT who can curl 25kg and has the vascularity of a ballsack then ill change my opinion \ud83d\ude01 However I only hear of people talking about starter gains and no one who is managed to train for over 5 years whilst maintaining some level of progression. CMT seems to cause extreme platoing which is not what you want when you know that coffee 50+ you will have pretty bad wastage to fight off.  True, however if this is the case, then doctors need to document this and understand the reason behind it rather than then just bleating 'exercise and you will be fine'. For all we know running anabolics could significantly improve our quality of life. It is their duty to tell us this if that is true.  I will agree that I wish doctors put more effort into understanding the ins and outs of the disease instead of just guessing.  I have actually never heard of those, nor has any doctor mentioned that I would need medication  As other people have said, an exercise regime will be very different depending on what cmt you have. I was diagnosed with cmt1a when I was 2 years old so I have had time to get to know my limits and strengths. \n\nMy biggest advice to you would be to strengthen your core. Because cmt affects your peripherals more it will be the easiest part of your body to make gains on and will help your balance. \n\nI saw that someone recommended watching athleanx videos and I agree that he makes great videos. I have used his videos to work on my posture which cmt has definitely affected. \n\nThere is a promising clinical trial occurring in the US involving increasing muscle growth in cmt patients, so there is hope that we will have some medication in the future that will help. I have not heard of taking the vitamins/supplements you mentioned. \n\nI really would not approach the weight room with the mindset of body building. Try to stay lean with the least amount of weight on your joints. If you work out and keep your body fat down you can achieve a really shredded look although your muscle mass will be low. At least that is worked decently for me. I have tried protein shakes and body building diets but nothings really worked. I havnt been able to break 150 pounds and I am 6\u20191 so I just expect to stay thin as rails my whole life.  My story was much the same as the OPs. I took up CrossFit. Its varied and covers a lot of strength and conditioning in one go. Plus, you have a coach on hand to help with form and scaling to your ability. It is been 3 years and Its definitely helped me stave off some of the decline. Just be sure to let your coach know you have a compromised CNS and if they are worth their salt, they will tailor the workout for you. Well.. I never thought of going for cross fit only bodybuilding because i think it requires much strength and stability.. why did you consider it? and that is good! did you gain any strength or see any changes in your balance and overall power? For context, I am male and in my late thirties and have CMT1A.\n\nThe fact CrossFit does require so much stength and stability is why it works, for me anyway. I cannot really jump or run so my coach modifies the workout. I will step up instead of jumping or use the bike instead of running. Honestly, I chose CrossFit because I needed something to build strength to combat the CMT and it was the only thing that appealed. \n\nWhen I started, I was so immobile from years of inactivity, I could not even squat properly. I remember not being able to lift an 8 kilo kettle bell above my head now I can lift 10 times that. My deadlift went from 60kg to 170kg. I am definitely stronger. I even gained new abilities like  handstands and skipping. There still some movements which I struggle with, like lunges, but if I am struggling with a movement, I just go slower, focus on my form and remember why I am doing it. I get a greater sense of achievement from having to struggle with a workout and overcome it.\n\nThe best thing about CrossFit though is the supportive community. They do not care what your ability is, and just want you to see you try your best. I thought I would not last 3 months, but here I am still going 5 days a week three years later.\n\nBest of luck in your search. I hope you find something that works for you. Niceee!! You can handstand!? that is cool. i actually cannot even do a push-up or pull-up always tried to but it is hard and bodybuilding never seems to work in terms of gaining strength..can you do them? pull and push ups? so I may consider crossfit but may I ask did you have any tremors or still have? I only suffer tremors when I am extremely fatigued and dont usually have a problem. I can do push-ups now but could not when I started. I cannot do a strict pull-up yet but it is close. I use bands to help with those.  I object to your speaking for \"anyone else with CMT who has tried exercise.\" I never worked out before my diagnosis at age 33. I have been exercising (cardio and weightlifting) and I have had dramatc gains in my strength and that is without PEDs. &gt; so here is my experience \n\nWell please go into more details. How severe is your CMT, what type is it, and how long have you been exercising for?  what is your type? have you ever had any issues with balance and tremor? I have type 1A. I have problems with balance but do not suffer tremors unless tired. Did you use any supplements while doing physical activity? such as BCAA, Creatine and whey maybe vitamins? fish oil? What about your body fat %, weights lifted etc? I am in the same boat in that I cannot gain muscle no matter my regime or diet, so am interested to see why some CMT sufferers can, and others cannot.  Actually my consultant has specifically mentioned that there seems to be heighted deconditioning in CMT patients, so the reality actually may be that CMT patients cannot maintain muscle.  That may be true \u2014 I think it just depends on everyone is specific case and needs.\n\nI am not saying that some cases do not have this issue, simply suggesting that less-severe cases may not. its so confusing man how long have you been in the gym?  My CMT categorically falls under the less-severe umbrella (4/20), but my consultant believes this is an issue in all CMT patients, not just a few.  7 years. I tried everything. Did the perfect diet, constant exercise using recommend plans made by PT's and nothing worked. Then I bought some Ostarine and for the first time in my life I am managing to change my body composition from \"prepubescent teenager\" to something more fitting of someone my age (early 30's). &gt; Ostarine \n\nThat is sad man.. It varies a lot a lot some CMT patients can build some cant i do not know why wish I knew man.. what about your balance and tremors? do you have problem with them? as well as problem with squatting and ankle dorsiflexion?  That is sad man.. It varies a lot a lot some CMT patients can build some cant i do not know why wish I knew man.. what about your balance and tremors? do you have problem with them? as well as problem with squatting and ankle dorsiflexion? Yeah I guess.. were you able to gain muscle? Balance is pretty good and zero tremours, yet if I look at my calf muscle, there is some micro movement in it, almost as if its cramping on a tiny scale \ud83e\udd14 Squatting is an issue due to tight calves and Achilles tendon, but other than that the CMT itself is very mild with still a lot of sense in my feet and no impact in my hands. Only by using Ostarine. In my first 6 months of weight training over 7 years ago I was able to lift up to 10kg more depending on the exercise, but any sort of setback such as illness or vacation would mean I would be straight back to the beginning. This only changed when I started with Ostarine, but want to try LGD as that seems better for muscle gains as opposed to cutting, which is my current goal. but when did not you use at the beginning? i do not know much about it does it have many side effects? SARMS did not exist 7 years ago, they have only become popular in the last few years. Plus, all this time I have thought it was something wrong with my training. I had not thought for one second that CMT may be the limiting factor for muscle growth, until I started asking around and then it became apparent that it is an issue with a lot of CMT patients, with my consultant then confirmed.  does it have side effects? did you have any? Body fat is hard to measure but I would estimate that it is changed from 30% to the low twenties.  I have not paid much attention to diet until recently. The issue I have had is getting below 15%, which would be considered a \"fit\" level of body fat. And by \"issue\", I mean it seems categorically impossible regardless of diet or exercise regime.  I am going to run bloodworks in about 4 weeks, but so far the only issue was acne outbreak on my shoulders (expected from PEDs), which has died down after I started with NAC and Milk Thistle for liver support (both proven to work). Other than that, no shut down, lethargy, anger etc, just overall better performance in the gym, though nothing insane.  &gt;there is hope that we will have some medication in the future that will help.\n\nWe already have medication that can help. They are called anabolic steroids, have been around since the 60's, are not dangerous if used correctly and categorically help with gaining muscle strength, while a recent study showed that Oxandrolone actually improved nerve velocity in a CMT patient.  Have you tried forearm and wrist exercises to strengthen those weaknesses? I usually avoid strength training my forearms, I have found doing other exercises such as curls fatigue them a lot and targeting them causes me not to recover well. My forearms have grown while lifting but I do not do anything for forearms except other muscle groups and 1 exercise that is for triceps but also hits the forearms.\n\nI do consistently stretch my wrists and fingers to help counteract the tightening from fatigue/ muscle growth(hopefully haha).  \n\nWrist and knee pain are easy to cause if you are not careful, that is why I like bars and machines.  I cannot make progress using dumbbells cause my wrists fatigue too much and it causes issues. But bars are not a problem.  I do wear very tight wrist wraps though. \n\nHope this helps  To much strain can be bad for cmt from what I have been taught, so I would not recommend bodybuilding for that reason. And, injuries are harder to recover from in my experience. If you push yourself and feel worse, you are doing too much. Swimming is excellent however, especially in warm water pools.  Doctors are trained to be conservative, and the consensus in the literature right now is that it is a topic that needs more research but that the body of evidence so far suggests that moderate resistance exersize is beneficial. There are exiting case studies and such with suggests a lot of interesting things, but your average doctor will not get the memo until long after it is been well researched. A neurologist who specialize in CMT will be more up to date and willing to discuss the latest developments in the field, but even they are conservative by training. I totally get where you are coming from, but for most people erring on the side of caution is probably the best way to go about it. The rest of us have to just wait it out or take matters into our own hands. Thanks! anecdotal but my 69 year old mom (CMT 1a) saw her upper leg strength improve recently from doing the treadmill religiously (my dad was doing cardio rehab after surgery and she was accompanying him for moral support). Now, to be sure, she was not trying to be a body builder or anything. Can s/he link this assumption to an actual study?  When a consultant in CMT notices a trend, I think we can assume it is more than an assumption, but there has not yet been a study on it due to lack of funding.  True. It is very frustrating. ", "Can you muscular with cmt? Now strength wise I can 100% say I have greatly improved from what I used to be minus my grip since I started seriously working out, and I am noticeably bigger at least compared to what I was.\n\n\nWhat I want to know is if it is actually possible to be muscular with cmt, I cannot find anything that can answer this considering most cannot even agree if people with cmt should work out at all. I am not super knowledgeable in any of this, but CMT affects people in such a wide range it is hard to generalize. Some people with CMT run marathons while others are wheelchair bound from a young age. So really, it depends how severely the CMT has affected you. It completely depends on where you are in your progression and your type. Some people live normal lives into their 60's and 70's before they find out that they have it. Others like me have trouble with walking normally at the age off 11 and lose a substantial amount of strength in the arms and legs by the age of 20. Now in my 40's building much more strength would be a pipe dream. Seeing pictures of people with CMT become bodybuilder or marathon runners makes me roll my eyes in all honesty. \n\nSo, the answer is there is no answer. Everyone is going to have a different result. I assume that what you mean by muscular here is an aesthetic, that someone who looks at you sees muscles and not fat? It sounds like you personally can build muscles, which is the tricky part of the process for CMT'ers. So you need to cut some fat for them to be more visible then? That should certainly be do-able with a good diet. You will want to be sure to eat a good amount of protein to protect your muscles while trying to lose fat, otherwise it is pretty much Calories In, Calories Out. \n\nBonus good news: CMT folks generally burn 20% to 35% more calories when walking (our difficulties make us less efficient) so that is a good exercise to be doing. Mate I trained for a 5km swim in my late 20s for about 6 months and was never truly ripped but was lean and defined, I believe that the muscle wastage is part of the reason why you would not look ripped if u reagulary exersice and eat more calories than u burn u will gain muscles and fat. when u gained musclesmass  eat less calories than u burn (calorie deficit) and keep on training, u will loose ur fat and keep the muscle lose to a minimum. It is a tough question that not enough research has gone into. A lot of people with CMT who I have talked to have struggled to gain any significant strength or mass even with years of correct dieting and exercise. Some people with the same CMT subtype, however, seem to have no issues at all. It is all quite mixed.", "Burning Sensation in Hands Hi there! I was diagnosed with CMT at a pretty young age (11) and am just now looking to others for some help and guidance (24). Does anyone else have random burning sensations in their hands? This just started happening, and it gets so bad, I need to run cool water over them.\n\nAlso, for years now, my mouth burns whenever I eat something after having not ate for a few hours. It is really shocking and burns a lot at first, but then goes way as I continue to eat. Anyone else? Hey - you are definitely not alone. CMT 1A here, my fingers burn (especially between the fingers) sometimes, if I try to stretch them out wide it worsens. I run them under water if it is really bad. \n\nWhat exactly do you mean when you say your mouth burns? My jaw tingles and it is very intense if I have not eaten in a long time, but I would not call it burning.  Thank you!\n\nThe mouth burning is like I just scalded my mouth with hot water - even when eating non hot items. A lot of times I have to mask the pain especially in public, but then it goes away. Does that make sense? My hand pain is excruciating. Before I was diagnosed, my doctors in town could not figure out what was wrong with me, they thought I had Reynaud \u2018s dz. I wore gloves almost 24/7 for about 6 years before I saw a new PA who put me on Trokendi, a control-release formulation of Topomax. I still have hand pain, but I have not had to wear gloves now for maybe two years? Taking Magnesium helps with the joint locking and muscle cramping. On my worst days now I also use Voltaren topical ointment, totally kills the pain for  about 2 hours.\n\nI am sorry you are in so much pain.

Do you find weather affects your level of pain? Definitely find the humidity effects my pain.

I have not livid in a humid climate for so long, but I do live in extreme cold, and I know that triggers pain. Existing.\n\nTo be serious though mostly just walking too much and being cold.  Sometimes it feels like I walk all day with minor pain, and then after sitting down for 20 min my body is like \"oh trying to relax now?\" And then injects stinging pains into my feet to make sure I felt all the pain. Blood circulation is the key to staying warm and preventing that 'cold' pain. Buy yourself some nice thermal base layers that are not too tight and layer up.

So, I need to either install some kind of lift system so I can reach my bedroom and the shower.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience in such things?

If you are hypothetically given a script for it then you will likely be way way below body building steroid cycle doses and will not need to worry about liver problems.  Your doctor will definitely watch your blood work every 3-6 months as part of the treatment if you are on orals.\n\nIf you are on injections like nandrolone or testosterone, like I am, then you will have similar regular blood work.\n\nYour lipids will definitely change over time.  Nothing wrong if they go slightly worse looking on blood work as long as you are aware and keep an eye on them.  Every person has different body chemistry.  I have personally never had to change anything due to worsening lipids, but they are worse than when I started.  I am also significantly healthier, stronger, and fall less.  Quality of life has soared in the years since I started.\n\nBest choice I ever made.  Wish someone took me and shook me awake telling me that the fear mongering \"drugs are bad, steroids are bad\" mantra is completely bullshit when you do it right and monitor yourself. Thanks so much for the explanation and more info. I am definitely going to check into them. The friends I have had since elementary school and high school usually remember in the sense that I require some accommodations to go out with them, but they also forget in the sense that it does not matter that I have it, and if they find someone staring, my friend has a really good evil eye for them. As for forgetting the actual name, yeah, they do but my husband, who is alot more in depth and takes care of me as needed, knows more than I do! And that is where it counts, for me at least. Friends, they are there for support and fun, and as long as they do not mind I am going to take a bit to catch up or they got to push my chair, I do not see a reason to care if they do not know what it is. Friends and family do not seem to forget about my cmt. They just do not seem to comprehend that it has gotten worse over the years and how much discomfort and struggle I go through everyday. I have had friends get frustrated with me because of not wanting to go out because I would have to do a lot of walking or be somewhere I would not be able to sit down easily. But as far as forgetting its hard to forget I have cmt because of my hands or the way I walk. It is pretty obvious and it can be pretty embarrassing too.

If so, are you prescribed anything for it and does it work for you?\n\nThe past few months the CMT and tremors combination makes it pretty rough trying to open things in public. It draws a lot of attention when a 20yr old is shaking like someone with Parkinsons and cannot open a water bottle. Been pretty bummed out with all the comments on it lately and wondering if anyone else is in a similar situation.  I experience this as well but not as severely as you, it is never been a large enough issue for anyone in my family that has CMT. I would really talk to your doctor or maybe someone else here has advice. I have a mild case of it. My doctor thinks it is related to my CMT. I get CMT from my mother's side, but tremors are something that runs on my father's side, so I am not completely convinced.  Propranolol!  Total life changer.  Significantly reduces pain and tremors. Out of curiousity, are you taking any other medication? I was taking Prozac and about 3 months after I started, I had tremors. I assumed it was the CMT. I went to my neurologist and he explained it could be correlated to the Prozac. I chose to keep taking the Prozac (I would rather shake than want to kill myself every day and every minute). He prescribed me topiramate, which kept the tremors at Bay. \n\nAfter about 2 years of therapy and working on myself, I decided to stop Prozac. About a month after I stopped prozac, I stopped topiramate, and my tremors stayed gone.\n\n\nSo I would look at the possibility of other medication causing it as well.\n\n\n Unfortunately no other medications are responsible- I have had tremors from childhood. That is really interesting with Prozac though, I will have to keep my eye out for medications that exacerbate them. My guess is that your mother takes propranolol? That is the go-to tremors drug. Does not help me much, though.  I thought the lamictal she was taking was for her tremors, but that is actually her seizure medication, and I do not think it doubles as tremor medication.\n\nI do not think it is propanolol because I do not recognize the name. I can recognize most if not all of the names of mom's medications because I have been helping her take them since I was real young.\n\n\n\nIf you have not spoken to a doctor about trying medication, I would. It could really help. Also, if you have not, the CMT organization has a list of drugs that risk causing the disease to worsen, so you should make sure you look that up and have it on hand anytime you talk about medication.\n\n\nAlso, not something you can get your hands on now, but Microsoft has made \"Project Emma\" that slows/stops Parkinson's tremors. It is basically a watch that sends vibrations to your brain that counter the tremors.\n\n", "my surgery made everything worse i dont know what to don hi my names kai im 13 and i have type 2a cmt, i had a tendon transfer on my left foot in april, im filly healed and had all my physiotherapy but the surgery made everything worse, i could walk without a splint pain free but now i cant even walk without a splint and i need a much bigger splint now its so restricting but i could walk with a splint before too but i can barely do that now i need walking aids but even still i find myself falling so much more, i also can walk not even half the distance i could before and i hate it, this was meant to help me not make my life 10000x worse than it already was everything is so hard and nobody will listen to me they tell me im still healing but im not i know im not even my mum said when she had this surgery the same happened to her but why the fuck did she let me have it in the first place if she knew it did no good for her, i begged her to not have the surgery but she said i needed it and now im worse than before and im more of a weird freak than ever and i begged everyone to not get it done but nobody listened and now everything is so much harder i want to have a normal childhood and i want to be a normal kid i dont know what to do im so angry and upset i wish i was never born with this stupid stupid disease it has ruined everything Cry. Breath. Talk to your doctors.  If things are not going as expected you can get a second opinion.  Sounds like you could benefit from getting involved with a support group or counseling with someone who specializes in people with chronic illness or the disabled. im talking to my doctors soon when i see them but if ill be honest i really dont want support groups and counselling stuff all i want is to be normal and have a normal life and be able to go places with my friends and just do what my friends can what everyone can I am sorry you have to deal with this. People not listening to you about your body sucks. \n\nI am old and not really the person you want to talk to. I second GoldenFlicker's suggestion that you see if you can find a support group that has CMT kids around your own age to talk to. If you live in the US, you might want to look into Camp Footprint: ( \n\nI hope you do continue to heal and even if you do not, I hope you can find a doctor who can figure out why the surgery did not go as it was intended to and can help. Hey Kai, that does really suck. I am a little bit older than you, but not so much that I do not remember having the same feelings. A lot of people have a really tough time identifying and relating to those of us that have physical disabilities. When they do not listen to what we have to say, it really cuts deep and makes you want to scream. \n\nWhat I can tell you is that you are NOT a freak. What you are feeling right now does not have to become all consuming for you, even though it feels like it right now. Take it from a lot of us on this sub that have been in the same spot that it will get better. You will get used to this new chapter in your life, and little by little things will start to feel better over time. And maybe down the road things will change again, and you will learn how to deal with that too. \n\nWhat helped me start to feel a little better was to find things that I could still do sitting down. I started writing down how I felt in journals, drawing and doodling, getting really into movies and TV shows, and then over time found people that were into those things too! I bet if you talked to your friends, they would not even think twice about the limitations you have. \n\nI hope some of this helps! And know that you are not going at this alone, and you will get through it, stronger and better than before. There is nothing that is going to get you that kid. Time to accept that fact and make the best of what you are able to do. Kai, I love your name. I hope you might write a message to Jonah Berger at the CMT Association. He knows a lot of kids and teenagers with CMT (and he has it too) and I think he could have some ideas for moving forward with your surgery aftermath.

I have not asked and do not know the sub-types they have, but it is advanced.  However, they are able to perform amazing feats and even surprised Drs  with being able to manipulate orthopedic locking features that the Drs believed were impossible without normal finger/hand dexterity.  I know this question is vague.  But they need a laptop.  They would want to physically go to a store to try some out, but because of Covid have been putting this off for over a year.  I think it is time I just get her one, they are currently using a friends laptop and write long, detailed, letters...though I do not know how difficult this is for them.\n\nIf at all possible, with people in this community with experience, what would be a good laptop model for someone in this position?  Any help would be appreciated, money is not an impediment. Hello. From my personal experience, there is not one type of laptop I prefer over another type of laptop because of cmt. I do however find it easier to type on a good keyboard, so this could maybe be worth buying along with a laptop :) maybe with a screen and a mouse too.\n\nEdit: I prefer low profile keyboards such as the mx keys from logitech. The low profile makes it easier so I dont have to raise my wrists too much when using it. This is a good point. Consider a good keyboard/mouse (if she can easily plug those in) or a good docking station, depending on her needs. \n\nAlthough, she will need to be able to easily attach those to the laptop, so there is that to consider as well if she is going to need to unplug/replug them a lot. Only 2 areas that I consider slightly more are keyboard - I personally prefer prefer low profile keys as I more \"drag finger across\" than \"raise \" them, and weight of laptop if I plan to move it around. &gt;unplug/replug them a lot.\n\nBluetooth? The mentioned keyboard has a bluetooth function which allows you to connect to any Bluetooth device. There is also a USB dongle you can connect to the laptop.

Is this a clinical trial or are we \u201clorenzo's oil\u201cing our selves now. I dont mean that in a bad way im actually curious No, it is ordering the exact medications that are used in the trial individually from a compounding pharmacy in the proper dosages and then taking them twice a day. Right on, glad to hear positive results! It is very slow but I am cautiously optimistic I do not really want to medicate myself but glad it working for you That is obviously an individual choice, but the alternative is to steadily decline and get worse until eventually you cannot breathe when you lay down so for me it was a no brainer. Yea I really hope they get it approved already damnit it seems to be clearly working. I also live in Canada so it may take even longer. I am only 19 so not really sure what to do. Its not awful right now but if I can prevent it and live a fairly normal life from not on that would be great. My suggestion would be to speak with your doctor. The medications involved have little to no side effects for most people, so there does not seem to be much of a risk or loss in trying something but I strongly suggest speaking with your doctor about it because they are the ones that need to give you the prescriptions anyway. This builds a bridge until the actual medication becomes available but from what everyone is telling me it is essentially the same thing so I kind of wonder if insurance companies will not just prescribe it this way anyway to avoid paying the ridiculous fees. I have peaked to some medical professionals about it and most said the equivalent of (well they do jack shit and will not be accepted for a long time anyways sucks to be you lol) So I will try it with my gp in the relatively near term though thanks for the advice :) Thanks for the update! I am glad to hear it seems to be helping. OK so here is the details of what I have had done. \n\nFirst, you literally cold call compounding pharmacy\u2019s to get the exact dosages of the individual medicines separately, they will not let you do it all together.  \n\nSo capsules with 420 mg of sorbitol, a capsule with 1.4 mg of naltrexone, and a capsule with 12 mg of baclofen.  This is for a twice daily dose.  To play it safe, use separate pharmacies for the individual medications. Once you have the pharmacy all you need is the prescriptions and most doctors will look at the medications, make sure you are not taking anything that is contra indicated, and then go ahead and prescribe it because as they put it \u201cnothing here is going to hurt you so why not?\u201c \n\nNow my next step is to see about getting everything in a liquid so that I am right in line with the successful studies. But in the meantime the capsules are what I am using. Hey interested to see how this goes, keep us updated please! It is now been over 2 months and my O2 saturation is now up to 98. Was 90. It is still to early to attribute this to the medication. Based on best case scenario calculations it looks like improvement would be approximately one percent per month, which is incredibly difficult to quantify over the short term. \n\nWhat I can tell you is there is been no progression. I am interested in trying home brew as well.  Please keep us informed your progress.  Hope you will see the positive progress very soon &gt; O2 saturation\n\nthank you so much for the response! Best of luck! I will check back in a few months. Going to get in touch with a neurologist too since I do not have one right now. UPDATE. It is definitely working. I am starting to walk better, my breathing is holding my o2 levels at 97 when laying down (Are used to be unable to lay down for more than five minutes without starving for air)  and my arms are a bit stronger. It is VERY slow but it is DEFINITELY working. Hey, thanks so much for the update! This definitely sounds interesting. I am going to reach out to a neurologist and ask them about their thoughts on home-brewing or trying to become part of a clinical trial. To be clear I am not really doing the \u201chomebrew\u201d anymore, I have had capsules made directly at the proper dosages through a compounding pharmacy.", "Protecting shoes from AFO\u2019s wearing the down  Duct tape running length wise maybe?

So I just found out about CMT in the past week or so after looking into why my right big toe has been partially numb for a couple weeks. Sorry for the long post, but this is the best platform I thought of to discuss &amp; try to ease my worries by sharing. \n24 year old female here. Upon reading into CMT, I recognized many of the symptoms that I have thus far chalked up to: being \"out of shape\" despite a moderately active lifestyle; physical issues from a car accident; them being in my head. I walk on the ball of my foot a lot, my toes are slightly bent up enough for friends to notice, tingling in my arms, I have a lot of hip pain and discomfort with deep popping in the socket, high arches, diagnosed with scoliosis as a child, and ankle discomfort &amp; weakness. Last night in bed I was having such discomfort from my feet up to my hips, like a dull, painful ache.\n\nI should back up a little and mention that I have been aware for years that my grandfather and father have had nerve issues. I remember as a kid my dad had horrible leg cramps now and then that would bring him to tears. I called him today to ask about it and he addressed his issues as peripheral neuropathy, including foot-drop, numbness (describing his feet as \"lumps of clay\"), and having 1/5 - 1/3 of feeling in his feet. Called my grandfather too and it seems he has not had as severe of symptoms, but did see a neurologist for numbness and foot-drop. He apparently was not diagnosed, but basically told, \"there is nothing we can do for you.\" after a nerve conduction velocity test. He uses a cane because of tripping, but also he is 85 so would probably use one anyways. My sister has complained of what she thinks is \"cubital tunnel syndrome,\" basically numbness, tingling in the arms &amp; hands. She has not noticed significant foot issues. \n\nSo.. I am wondering. From what you all know &amp; have experienced, would I be reasonable for thinking CMT may run in my family &amp; I am experiencing symptoms? I have been having a difficult time processing it &amp; wondering if I am crazy. Should I get gene testing, or ask my grandfather to? I read somewhere that having the diagnosis could affect insurance in some way. \n\nThanks if you made it this far, it feels good to write this out and hopefully make some sense of what is going on. Bless! I understand how frustrating it can be. But I think most people here (maybe there are some medical professionals who could weigh in?) would be hesitant about diagnosing anyone. Not only does CMT vary widely in how destructive/ disruptive it is, getting a diagnosis from a professional would be my only way to know. If there is a state college around you or a specialty hospital like Mayo you might start there, they are bound to have more knowledge of CMT than your average general practitioner (no disrespect to any gp docs). The symptoms you describe could all be explained by CMT, and there seems to be indications of a family history of peripheral neuropathy. But in line with what /u/Joeliosis just wrote, there is no way of knowing without a proper diagnosis and that has to be done in a clinical setting. And this being /r/CMT, I am sure we are biased ever so slightly in terms of seeing symptoms as being indicative of CMT. If you are unsure about whether or not you should pursue further testing, a sensible first step could be to have a chat with a general practitioner. If you explain your symptoms and the family history then he/she will be able to provide you with valuable input and be able to refer you to a neurologist if it should be deemed advisable. The insurance question is probably something you should look into before anything else, but I am not familiar with the implications of a CMT diagnosis in these matters as I am not from a country where we have health insurance. At the present there is not any treatment for any form of CMT, but there are some reasons to consider for pursuing a diagnosis. Removing the uncertainty of not knowing is one reason, so are the implications related family planning. Disease management options are also an important one, and in the case of a negative CMT diagnosis the implications that negative diagnosis has for a differential diagnosis in relation to the symptoms you have would be important for further testing.", "CMT and alcohol I was wondering what everyone is experience has been with alcohol. I am 26 and have CMT1A but am very functional today, my feet are numb and I have very small calves and poor balance but that is about the extent of it. I know that alcohol is neurotoxic and I can only imagine it is harmful to the peripheral nervous system.  I enjoy drinking and it is sort of unavoidable in my life. If I have, say, more than 3-4 drinks in a night, I sometimes wake up in pain in the morning, but I am unsure if this is because I am usually out and about and walking around or if the alcohol is playing into it. \n\nEverything I really enjoy in my life involves my feet (hiking, cycling, etc.) and I would hate myself if I willingly contributed to losing function in my legs. As I mentioned, I like drinking but the more difficult time I have is the fact that other people in my life also drink as a part of most of their social activity. My partner has admitted to me that she would not date someone who did not drink (though she did say that given my circumstance she would understand), and my friends all have a similar attitude. I work in outside sales and drinking with customers and suppliers is almost an implied part of my job.\n\nI am curious what others' experience has been with alcohol. Hoping I am not alone in this.

I have been lucky that my CMT is not very severe.I am 31 years of age now, and Im living a pretty normal life, with only issues doing sports and hiking in rough terrain. I am walking a bit funny and tend to twist my ankle or stumble from time to time. I am now 31 years old and I have started feeling a tingeling sensation in my thumb and index finger. I am wondering if this is a sign that the nerves to my hands are starting to get damaged. I am interested to hear with any of you who has allready experienced the progression of cmt from feet to your hands if it is similar, or if the tingeling sensation could be something other than cmt progressing. It tends to be stronger in the morning, and I do not think my fingers are any weaker, they are just uncomfortable to use. To describe the sensation it is like the tingeling feeling you get in your tummy when you are on an airplane that suddenly drops in height because of turbulence. Except its in my finger tips (right under the nails). This obviously makes my fingers extremely uncomfortable to use and I have to focus if i want to do something with my fingers when they are like this. Later in the day the sensation tends to disappear, but if I focus on my fingers I can feel that it is still there waiting until next moebing to get stronger. Does any of this sound familiar to you? If so what are your experiences with this, and how long did it take from you started having this feeling until your hands became difficult to use. Thanks for any answers :) This sounds kind of like how my feet are as I am definitely losing sensation in them. That being said, you are right, there are plenty of things it could be I think it does sound CMT related. However, I would not anticipate losing the sensation or use of your whole hand or even whole fingers from this. I personally have experienced nerve pain and tingling in lots of areas and it can be sporadic. I am 55. 3 sets of reconstructions on my feet. Still walking (though not with great dexterity)\n\nLast couple years my hands are showing (some weakening, reduction of fine dexterity, some cramping) Thanks for your answers. I guess it is nothing to be too worried about. It has just caught me a bit by surprise as my cmt is not that severe. I have always thought there would be alot more time before I would start having problems with my hands, and was scared this was the start of my hands getting worse rapidly. Articles I read do not really provide a good timeline as they all said that it varies from person to person, so I was interested in hearing about your experiences :) \n\nI am going to have surgery on my feet in October and will have  meeting with my neurologist before. He will probably have some insight as to what this is :) Sounds like our cases are fairly similar in terms of overall impact.  I had an EMG on my hands when I was 35 (just about 40 now) and the neurologist said she could see CMT-like results but nothing to be alarmed at. The EMG measured a difference that I do not think I was even aware of. I would gone in to ask the neurologist about it because of a single incident with one thumb.  \n\nSince then I have definitely started to feel a bit of difference but nothing that gets in the way of living a pretty much normal life.  It did not take long for me to think about my hands like my feet: I will adjust if I need to, but for now I am lucky because it could definitely be worse! I have definitely noticed a very rapid increase from unpleasant feeling to slightly sore all the time to sticking fingers when unfolding my hands from a loose closed fist to very stiff and painful, especially in the mornings, as someone above mentioned.

Her blood is being researched at the moment for further knowledge. The diagnosis came out of the blue since she has no real symptoms yet except not being able to squad while dancing and walking a little bit beside her (right) shoe and having arched feet.\nSince there is no family historie we can not relate to how other family members deal with things, have incorporated this into their lives etc.\nMy daughter for know does not want to know anything about it and it stresses her out that I do want to read about the clinical trials, supplements etc. My question is has anybody else here has a child/teenager that has just been diagnosed and how do you talk to them about this. And with what prospective do you look ahead. Is it likely that say the next 5_10 years will bring a cure of medicine to slow down the symptoms. Which is what we both are hoping for now and waht my daughter keeps telling herself. And how do you prepare your child for the time symptoms will start to show. I know so many of you have it far worse and I do not wish to seem like someone worrying about something (yet) so manageable where you have your daily struggles.

But I played sports that I could and had fun. \n\nIt is not all doom and gloom, stay positive, offer love and support and be there for when days are not so good. I do not have any children, but I have some general advice based on my experience with my own large extended family with many CMT folks in it: \n\nThe main thing I would do right now is to keep an eye out and make sure she remains active in a healthy way--that she continues to get some exercise, but is not overdoing it and injuring herself a lot. Staying active prevents her from losing muscle which can be hard to regain. \n\nAt some point you might want to see if you can get her an appointment with a physical therapist who specializes in neurological disorders. They could evaluate her and teach her some exercises aimed at most effectively maintaining her strength in the long run. I would not necessarily push her to do this immediately if she does not want to, though if you point out some select exercises could help her catch up with her peers and dance better she might be interested. \n\nThere is hope that the next 5 to 10 years may bring a treatment to at least slow progression. Since it seems you do not have the results of her genetic test yet it is hard to say more. CMT is a group of diseases, really. Each subtype has a different underlying cause that results in basically the same symptoms. Therefore, each subtype will ultimately need a different treatment for the root cause. The most research progress has been made on the most common types. Once you know her subtype, you can find out a little more but it will be at least a couple of years for any treatment to make it through clinical trials. \n\nIt is very understandable that you have a lot of questions. This is a confusing disease with a wide range of symptoms; even those of us with the same subtype can vary widely in how much it impacts us and no one really knows why. Research is actively underway looking for answers. I am not going to be all that much help really as my 3 year old is showing signs and has just be diagnosed, so I am freaking out at how young it is presenting in him. We are the first in the family to discover what it is. My husband\u2019s family all have it (aside from his brother). The second I read up on it I realised how clearly they all have it. \n\nIt may ease your mind to know that my husband started showing signs in his hands at about 12. They just knew it as a family weird thing with your fingers. He had a major operation on his nerves which helped which I believe is quite a small keyhole affair now. His mum cannot really feel the smallest few fingers on both hands now, she is in her 60s and it does not stop her knitting or crocheting or otherwise impact on her life.\n\nMy husband has always walked unusually when not wearing shoes. He is 42 now. He cannot walk on his heels and first thing in the morning when he climbs out of bed he sort of hobbles to the loo, but after a minute or two he is back to normal again. He is fit and strong and is pretty much unaffected by it. He can walk for miles, run several miles and cycle. \n\nHis mum struggles a little when walking on uneven surfaces and she needs to hold her husband\u2019s arm when walking on slopes or bumpy ground. But, she can walk for hours and is not in pain. Her feet look quite extreme to me and when she sits down on the floor her ankles and feet look like they are stiff and hard and unmoving, but she is 65odd and can easily walk 9-10 miles. \n\nHis sister is 38, her feet and movement are starting to look like her mum\u2019s but again she is fit and strong. She climbed Kilimanjaro!\n\nSo while I am not the best for providing comfort and I come here for comfort myself, because having a 3 year old with footdrop is terrifying to me. I want you to know that my husband\u2019s family, who all clearly have CMT1A are not incapacitated by it at all. In fact until my son\u2019s diagnosis they did not even know they had it. In fact I am not sure they know now. We only found out a couple of months ago and while my husband told his mum I am not sure if she is put two and two together. I am not sure if he is told his sister and it is kind of overstepping for me to ring her and tell her when I think even my husband does not think he really has it.\n\nSo if it helps, there are whole families, generations of families, who do not even know they have it because it is not enough of an issue to them to seek help.\n\nI am going to hope that this will be the way things go for your daughter too. Because hiking at 65, even if you are a bit wobbly on cobblestones, is not too bad at all.\n\nIn the meantime, if you are freaking out, well you can freak out with me, because I am freaking so bad I have made myself sick! Honestly, parenting for me seems to be 98% worrying my pants off. \n\n(Also as I wrote this my daughter informed me that she feels sick suddenly and as three of her classmates have come down with Covid19, I am now freaking out about that too...) I do not have children but I can share some of how I dealt with it as a five year old diagnosed in 1969. I wore metal braces back then up to my knees sort of like Forrest Gump. At age 13, I switched to plastic braces that slip into my shoe and keep my foot from dropping. None of that slowed me down. I rode bikes, climbed mountains, snorkled in the Mediterranean, made lots of friends and chased girls. Check out your local Muscular Dystrophy office since CMT is under their umbrella of conditions that they cover. They should be able to set you up with a doctor familiar with CMT and other resources. Do lots of your own research too. I agree with the others that exercise and diet are important. She should strive to stay at a healthy weight. I did not and I regret it. Be careful with exercise that she does not overdo it, which she can tell by a marked increase of weakness which might last a few hours. At least that has been my experience. For example, as a dumb teenager I decided to swing a sledge hammer at a house demolition and when I was done my hands became very weak. Weak enough that it took two hands to pick up a coke can. I chilled for a few hours and I was back to normal. CMT is a weird disease though. It affects everyone a little differently. Other than having trouble finding comfortable shoes your daughter may barely notice the disease until her 20's or 30's.  Stay positive and let her be a  normal kid because she is. My parents never treated me any differently than my little brother. They never, ever told me I could not do something. I knew my limitations so I did not play football or baseball because I could not run, but I did bowl in a league. I have said enough. Good luck to you and your daughter. She will be fine.  Please do not stress looking for cures, it is un-healthy, let it come in its own time.  For now just stay family and love each other, nothing has changed in that regard. I would say the positive way to look at it is to know that they got intervention early on versus later. This is a disease that the later you know about it the worse sometimes it can be. I would also say that its best to think of your child as your child first and all the things they enjoy and what makes them them and look at that and just add the disease to that. I am also not sure why your neurologist is telling you there is nothing they can do at this point. There is physical and occupational therapies that sometimes work. Sometimes it does not help once the damage has happened but if it has yet to present itself there is therapy your child can get to help prevent the progression.  I have HNPP and my son was tested within two months of birth and it seems that he has the gene and disease (right now he is 21 months) I am glad that he already has a neurologist who is looking out for him and she seems very positive and upbeat. I would not suggest going far away for therapies if its something that is going to stress your daughter out but what I would do is seek another neurologist's consult to see what they think and see if their message and bedside manner is more hopeful. I would also suggest I am not sure if your current neurologist's specialty is in this disease I would see if your plan can cover someone who has some better grasp on this.  If you ever need to talk or vent just reach out, the worst way we sometimes ruin our outlook is not reaching out to talk or think there is no one out there who can relate. What a wonderful and comforting thing to say. It has felt like loosing my girl as I felt we lost her feature and dreams for it. But through your words and all the wonderful reactions of all of you who shared your stories and insights here I start to realise that is not true. I will look into a neurologist that specialices in CMT but I do not know if our coun try has got one. However thank you (all) so much for writing. I find it very comforting to be here with the real specialists, people that know what this is really about. Thanks! I think you have to stay positive, but do not think about a cure - doctors have been bleating the same line of \"a cure is just around the corner\" for the last 20 years and sadly each trial has fallen through with no success or lessons learnt. \n\nWith regard to how the disease can progress, it varies person to person - I wrote a basic account of someone with mild CMT here: (\n\nMost of the nerve damage is done earlier on in a person's life e.g. before 15, and then accelerates once again in later life e.g. 50+, although mechanical issues can persist or get worse, such as stress fractures and stiff joints through lack of use. \n\nI would recommend for your daughter to stretch daily and have a schedule to do so, especially during teenage years where growth spurts can cause muscle tightness to be exaggerated. Insoles may also be a good option to pursue early as they can prevent issues such as bursas, stress fractures etc. Also, do not rely too much on CMT communities - they tend to be filled with \"woe are me\" posts from people with severe cases, or pseudo-academics making spurious claims about the disease with little positivity to be found. &gt; Staying active prevents her from losing muscle which can be hard to regain.\n\nNot really. Fatty atrophy is going to occur no matter how much exercise you do - it is not even known if muscle hyperplasia can offset fatty atrophy so staying active, while it is good in general, is not really going to prevent atrophy that is caused by CMT. I apologize to OP if I was unclear here. Exercise (or anything else) cannot halt CMT progression. However, just as any healthy person will lose muscle should they stop exercising, a person with CMT will too. And the person with CMT will likely find it harder to regain that muscle. I would stay positive, OP. I would not assume your daughter's experience will be terrible before she has any major symptoms. A lot of people have this disease and NEVER experience major symptoms, or only experience them very late in life.\n\nFor example, almost my entire (huge) family has CMT, and I would not say this disease has seriously disrupted any of our lives. A few of us wear braces, most of us are clumsy and bad at sports, sometimes there is a bit of pain, and we all have trouble finding shoes! But is any of that really, truly life-altering? We have gotten married, had careers, traveled, etc. I am in my mid 30s and pretty darn happy!\n\nObviously some people are very seriously afflicted, but I guess my point is I would not freak out too much or borrow trouble before any comes. Right now you say your daughter only has minor symptoms. I would stay informed and keep an eye out, but no reason to panic.  Just my two cents. :) Hi there,\n\nAs the daughter of someone with CMT, I grew up with my Mom constantly telling me that I probably have it too. It was not until I was in my early 30s that I got tested and found out for myself once and for all. It turns out I also have CMT.\n\nI want to share how important it is to not let CMT define who your daughter is. My Mom has defined herself by the disease. It is a filter that she sees her entire world-view through. And I also realize this was something being instilled in me too, far before I was ever officially diagnosed. I am now fighting this mental maze because I know that as a get older my symptoms will progress, but I simply do not want to follow in my mother's path and let it define who I am!\n\nPerhaps trying to be matter of fact about it with her will help. It is not great, but it is also not terrible. Everyone single soul is dealt a different set of cards in their lifetime. We all need to play them to our own advantage:\n\nOne thing I do to play to my advantage is to be totally open about using tools to help me go about my daily life. Cannot open the salad bag? No big deal, go get some scissors. Thinking about taking a walk? Great! Let me go put on my ankle-supporting shoes. One day I know I will probably need the help of a walker and/or leg braces. And that is fine \u2013\u00a0I have things that can help me continue leading an enriching life!\n\nI hope this point of view is helpful for you and your daughter.  \n\n\nBest,  \nAnother CMT daughter Thank you so much for your story, I read it often when I need a positive focus. It is great to hear how you and your family dealt with all this in such a positive way. In a time where things were even more unknown than today. I have tried to relax and be positive and keep my hopes on a cure for all CMT patients. Thank you. So this is a tricky one.\n\nFirstly, ignore the \"there will be a cure soon\" coming from any doctor. I was told the same 16 years ago and still no treatment. The best approach is to accept she has it, be grateful if it is mild and not some god aweful terminal illness, and look at how to improve day to day life.\n\nSo the hard part is the next few years. Normally CMT rears its head and progresses through the mid teenage years (likely due to growth spurts etc). But it normally settles in your early 20's so it is important she keeps an eye out for changes. \n\nStretching is super important. As you get older you can give in to bad habits and this makes mobility worse. The key is to start with a strict and dedicated stretching routine and never stop with it. You want to target every leg and foot muscle, ligaments, and tendons. Also make sure the toes stay mobile as the joints will seize as they are not activated when you walk with you have CMT.\n\nExercise is a no-go. CMT causes muscle loss which cannot be reversed and it also seems to inhibit muscle growth as well. So the only outcome is loss of time, money, and extreme frustration. The only solution would be performance enhancers and that is dangerous for a teenager. I have a two year old boy suspected of CMT with pressure point palsy. He is a toe walker and has high arches.  He gets around fairly well, until a pressure point palsy episode hits, at which point he loses sensation and function in his leg (sitting for too long usually is the trigger).  It is hard to navigate this with a toddler who cannot always self-report well! We have absolutely no family history of it.  Right there with you!  I just try to remind myself that I love everything about that little boy and I love his feet and where they will take him and the person they will make him.  Of course no mother wishes challenges upon their child, but I am there with him with the most ridiculous heaps of love, energy, patience and desire to support him in being whoever he is going to become! My teenage daughter has CMT. She attended CMTA's Camp Footprint and it had a huge impact on her. She spent a week having fun with other teens while singing silly songs about CMT. They had adults with CMT talk about their personal experiences and the kids would take a little time every night taking care of their feet together. Her whole outlook changed after the first time she went. She went from avoiding talking about CMT at all to being actively engaged in selecting her next set of AFOs. I recommend your daughter seek out role models with CMT via social media. My wife has 1A and connected with a surprisingly large network on Instagram of individuals with CMT who sort of self-discover the best means to maintain quality of life.\n\nThrough her instagram channel, cmt\\_and\\_me, she shares her journey grappling with the disease. Yes, I am shamelessly plugging her channel, but I am really proud of her. I think her strongest advice would be learning to be your own advocate with doctors, putting in the work to stave off muscle loss, and whole life health (she put a lot of effort into constructing a diet and supplement plan to reduce or eliminate several symptoms).\n\nBoth the CMTA and CMTRF are in works to produce a genetic treatment for type 1A, with funding being the biggest hurdle to push through phase III trials it seems. Thanks so much.", "Do any of you get anxiety when you are asked the name of your condition? I would love to hear your stories about having to tell your doc you having something that makes you sound like a crazy person. What have you learned to do when asked so you do not seem like you are a crazy person? I have had a few doctors who have never heard of CMT and before I knew better I would tell them I had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A and the looks they gave horrified me because just know in their mind I am completely insane and I just told them I have Shark-Teeth from some lady named Marie. Now I have learned to just say I have CMT type 1A and if they ask what it is I tell them I would rather write down the full name out and let them see what I wrote before I pronounce \"Charcot\" for them. Best case scenario they see why I asked to spell it out first and we have a good laugh. I would love to hear if any of you have had similar experiences. Also, I would like to hear what you guys to for pain, if you are not comfortable answering I would completely understand. I take methadone for pain and temazepam for the spasms, restless legs, and sleep. Sorry for the wall of text. How incredible to find a community of like-minded people. I am 22 years old and have had cmt 1a from a young age. It may sound cliche but do not ever let doctors tell you what you can and cannot do. That kind of negativity harbors into more than is actually tangible from the disability. I was told I would be in a wheelchair in my early teens, yet that did not stop me from taking a trip to Japan last month and walking miles and miles a day. I am a musician, bassist in particular who has played on stage and has aspirations like anyone. People will not understand you sometimes, shit I do not know always understand myself. But you can use that to fuel you. Mind over matter I still believe in that. I would love to hear from others I am in Dallas Texas and have never really met another person with cmt!  Anyone have tips on working our with cmt?  Just do not over do it. When i was a teen i could do push up on a hand stand up against a wall but now it is so easy to over do it just walking. How are your hands if you do not mind me Asking? Do you have 1a  Yes i have 1a I am 28 and my hands are not too bad yet my little fingers are both numb and show some weakness but my feet, ankles, and knees are where i have the most atrophy and pain. My pinky toes get stuck flexed in awkward positions and it gets to the point that they feel painfully tired but they stay flexed. How is your pain?  Honestly non existent. When I was four I was diagnosed with cmt 3 but later was rediagnosed with 1a when I was a teen. I seem to get better as i grow older, but in all practicality I fear hitting a plauteu. The main reason I ask is I am a bass player for a living and fear not being able to play my challenging parts on stage one day.  You cant do anything bro if you just commit. I honestly hold a little anger towards my parents bc im in pain you know and my gma had it my dad had it and so did my older brother, i cant see how they could have another kid knowing theres a chance of having a kid with it, i refuse to have kids because i know what they could go through if they had a more severe symptoms. My back, hips, knees and feet are constantly hurting. I realize other people with it have kids and im not bashing them but i just couldnt see myself doing that to a child. I heard all my life from my father that i wouldnt be able to have a police, emt, or military career even before i was a teen with stronger symptoms and i think hearing that all the time kind of fucked with me you know? You can do anything you want bro and dont let anyone say you cant...i dont reccomend skating tho lol. Very true bro sorry to hear about your pain I really think it will get better if you do not let others oppress you. Mind over matter I think you have a great view on life. I cannot imagine if my parents did not have me. Sounds so basic but all human life is precious and hardships can inspire others.

I finally am showing some typical HNPP problems, and I will be having carpal tunnel surgery on both wrists. Has anyone had these surgeries done? Did they help? My doctor says with a nerve disease there is about a 50/50 shot it will work, and if it does work I will more than likely have to have these surgeries repeated throughout my life. Any advice or pointers? How long did it take you to fully recover? My doctor also wants me to have this procedure done. I am anxious to hear people\u2019s thought on the subject. I for one am terrified of being cut on. My mom does not have CMT, but she had this procedure done due to her getting carpal tunnels in both wrists, and she said the procedure literally took about 5 minutes. Getting her under the anesthesia and out of it took longer than the surgery. She could not hold anything that weighed more than 5 pounds I think, and they did it about 2 months apart from each other so that she could use her other hand while the hand that was just worked on recovers. Her wrists recovered so well that its easy to forget that it ever even happened Thank you for the response! I kind of hope that I go under anesthesia. I think I will be too anxious and freaking out if they keep me in a twilight. Valum does not work for me, so being asleep is my optimum choice lol. They should not have any problem putting you under anesthesia, if I remember correctly the whole procedure took no more than at most 3 hours Had bilateral wrist surgery in my 20's. The Drs did not know why I got carpal tunnel as it is usually a repeatitive motion problem and I was a stay at home mom, not a factory worker. I had no idea it was a cmt thing. Course it was not followed up as to why. They just said I had some neuropathy and should keep an eye on it. 40 years later I finally got diagnosed with 2b1/4c1 and type 3/dejerine sottas. Thank you for your comment! It is so frustrating how dismissed patients were/are. Did you ever have to have a repeat surgery? And how long did it take you to recover? No I have not. That was back when they cut you down the palm of your hand , past the wrist. Then you wore a brace for weeks after. \nNow they do a small cut on your wrist with a small wrap around it, not even on your hand. No brace or anything. Took months, but I also have fibromyalgia and psoriatic arthritis. The surgery is not so much to make it better, but to stop it from getting worse. By the time I had surgery, I hurt all the way up to my neck. I never got any strength back, but it does not hurt so much.\nYour Mom should do just fine.", "Private Medical Insurance - Surgery Question I have been on the NHS waiting list for surgeries on both feet/ankles for 3 years now, and due to the covid pandemic and the standing down of orthopedic services the last year and a half or so I have been told it could easily be another 3 years.\n\nMy question today - Are there any private medical insurers in the UK that I could sign-up to that would cover my surgery for my \"pre-existing\" condition?

Thanks though - will keep this in mind for the future", "Coronavirus and cmt Does anyone know how the Coronavirus will effect the immune system of someone with CMT? I work with people all day and take public transport to and from work so I just would like to know if I should be avoiding where I can. I have CMT 1A Since this coronavirus is new and CMT is rare there is not any scientific data on it (yet) and the best we can do is make an educated guess. I would expect that CMT is not going to be a significant risk factor in and of itself, but with some caveats. \n\nCMT has a widely varying impact on people even those who have the same type. Some CMT folks run marathons while others are unable to walk from a young age, for instance. **If you feel that CMT has in any way impacted your lungs, your ability to breathe, or your ability to cough I would be concerned; otherwise your risk is probably about the same as anyone else's risk.** Most folks who are able to take public transportation to and from work and work a full day should probably have no additional concern over their CMT. If you have other health problems as well: anything that impacts breathing or your immune system specifically, or if you are prone to getting pneumonia those might raise concerns. \n\nHand washing is definitely your friend. Alcohol based hand sanitizer is also good, though not quite as good as a through scrubbing with soap and water. Avoid touching your face. Standard flu precautions, which sound boring but which can really help improve your odds. CMT is not an auto immune disease. Unless your breathing is affected by CMT, I do not see why you would be affected any worse than anyone else. I am not a health expert. I am not concerned at all for my own health as a CMT patient. I am relatively healthy other than muscle wasting and neuropathy in hands and feet. Educated guess - since CMT has no impact on the immune system, and only slight impact on the respiratory and other core systems in the more severe cases - there is no real risk beyond what the general public have.   \n\n\nWhilst we often compare CMT to other neuro conditions due to the relative lack of information (see MS mainly), this is one case where they have every reason to panic and we have minimal. I fully agree with the post by NixyeNox, but I will add my 2 cents. \n\nBreathing issues caused by CMT is probably the biggest risk factor when it comes to the new Coronavirus (\"SARS-CoV-2\") for people with CMT.\n\nAlthough rare, sometimes the immune response caused by a viral infection will end up attacking peripheral nerves by mistake. As far as I know the risk of this happening is the same for people with CMT and people without CMT. If such a thing occurred with detrimental effects in a CMT patient, for instance in relation to the seasonal flu, I am sure it would have been published in the literature by now. I am not aware of any such reports, and this could suggest that this effect happens very rarely in viral infections or it could suggest that if it occurs in CMT patients it does not cause permanent serious complications worthy of a case report. Of course it could also suggest that I have not looked at enough CMT studies, so if anyone know of one that is about this I would love to see it. I am also not aware of this happening in anyone with SARS-CoV-2. Still, I would argue it is reasonable to suggest it as a theoretical risk with regards to SARS-CoV-2 for people with CMT.\n\n\nAnother thing perhaps worth mentioning is that SARS-CoV-2 is a \"betacoronavirus\". Almost all the known betacoronaviruses are \"neurotropic\", meaning they are capable of infecting nerve cells. Several studies are suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 also have a neuroinvasive propensity and that it can in some cases invade peripheral nerve terminals and migrate along the peripheral nerves towards the CNS. If I were to guess (and this is pure conjecture and speculation) I would say the the biggest risk of transneural invasion happening with SARS-CoV-2 would be through the cranial nerves, either the olfactory nerves from breathing in the virus through the nose or the optic nerve from infection through the eyes, though in theory all peripheral nerves could be infected. If this would have any detrimental effects in someone with CMT is anyone's guess. There is reason to believe that for the majority of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 this does not happen, so I would say this is all pretty theoretical at this point.\n\nAll in all though I am not particularly worried about this my self, but I do take reasonable precautions to try and avoid being infected such as avoiding touching my face and washing my hands, etc, in line with the WHO advice for the public.", "Winter is coming Of all the things in life I detest, winter is right up there at the top. Winter has never been easy or good for me, mentally or physically. This is the first winter where I will be going through it with full blown CMT pain and damage throughout my body. Not just the nerves, but the actual flesh as well. Feet that are really nothing more than floppy flippers but still they hurt like hounds of hell have dug their teeth into the soles and  are tearing the flesh off with glee.\n\nI have no idea how to prepare for winter, let alone get through winter, with the degree of pain and damage done to my body by this cursid affliction.\n\nSo, what tricks have you tried and kept, rejected, invented, wont do with out?\n\nI am quickly coming to learn the necessity of having several trusty large heating pads strategitically placed around the house.\nWhat else? Heating Blankets? what are the best?\n\nWhat and HOW do you survive winters with this dreadful cursed affliction? Lots of warming instruments such as blankets, comfy sweaters, slippers that are impossible to keep on and are to dangerous to walk in, thick socks, lots of weed, and a positive head space. Winter sucks, but we cannot let it bring us down. \nBe extra cautious outside (I do most of my outside walking in a wheelchair which has the bonus of being invulnerable to falling) so take calculated steps. Ice is brutal, so look for thick, soft snow in the event that you have to choose between which one to walk on. Requesting assistance to walk outside can be helpful, as long as they are secure. \nMeditation has allowed me to overcome most of the constant pains, and as a person who is not spiritual, i understand that this might sound stupid, so find your happy place and build your tolerance (has the bonus effect of a healthier mind as well). \nStay in contact with people, and inform someone when you are going outside, as falling on ice can be fatal. Keep your phone on you, so you can call someone in the event of an accident. \nWinter sucks, CMT sucks, but these must be seen as minor inconveniences. Remember that we get weaker everyday, and that despite inevitability, we power on because fuck the dumb shit. That is a lot to take it and yet it all makes sense. I cannot help but get the feeling from not only this response, but your others, that you might be a bit younger than I. Having just turned 66, I am kind of just tired of all of it and everything. I get what your saying and it all makes perfect sense. For me, the cold is bad enough. It is the darkness, the isolation,  the loneliness. Most of my close friends have fled to warmer climates or have passed on to a better place than this rock. Like you, I shun the idea of any kind of benevolent, let alone omniscient entity. Thus, when I do find a moment when I am not in a panic of this crazy shit of a life, I find it difficult to quiet the mind and fool myself into believing their is a purpose to all this pain, this shame, this never ending humiliation of need others to do such basic life essentials such as grocery shopping, opening cans and jars, and being starved for companionship. I really do not know how I am going to handle months and months of this.\n\nThanks for your answer and the honesty. As you say, fuck the dumb shit. Rice-filled heating pads that you can heat up in the microwave are my current winter obsession. An electric heated blanket or mattress pad is my long time friend. And good light can really help a stupid amount so perhaps a full spectrum light. Look into heated foot baths. I lived in a mountain area for a few years, and the occasional warm foot bath was so nice to help get circulation in my feet/ toes.  It can be a nice relief from the constant feeling of cold feet. Get your feet warm from the beginning, then double socks throughout to keep them that way. Obviously easier said than done when you have to go out in the elements. I got battery powered heated socks last Christmas, but the only heat the top, wish it was at least the bottom. But get some hand or feet warmer packets, one brand is \u201cHothands\u201d they get real nice and hot. Put them between the underneath part of your socks and your shoes, work wonders if you have to go out for a while. Keep some in your pockets for back up, they are really slim. All excellent ideas, u/NixyeNox ! Thanks much. I have begun searching for electric blankets and throws. Generally, my first go-to source is Costco. When I read the reviews of both electric blankets and throws, either on Costco.com or other stores, it seems there is a constant refrain, they die or diminish output within a year.\n\nAny anecdotal experience you can share?\n\n&gt;electric heated blanket or mattress pad\n\nNever heard of electric mattress pad! Must add that to my never ending list of things to investigate!\n\n&gt;full spectrum light.\n\nThis is a definite MUST! What kind do you use? I have looked into them in the past but it quickly becomes quite confusing as to which are the best and which are just after any money they can capture. Excellent idea! I was just wondering if one of those gadgets that fit in a bathtub would be any good. Another excellent idea! Thanks much! I was just wondering about what we call \"Hunters Socks\" which are battery heated socks. Thanks again! When my last electric blanket gave out (after only a year or two of use) I went searching for a new one and stumbled across the electric mattress pad. I bought one, according to my online receipt, 7 years ago and it is still fine. Not sure if it lasts longer because it does not move around as much or what but I have been happy with it. It is a Sunbeam, though I think so was my electric blanket that did not last very long. \nMy lighting situation is odd and currently I am not using a full spectrum light so much as I have a lot of assorted lamps and plant lights. I should probably look into a more sensible set up than what I have honestly. Plants can help brighten up a space in winter, too, though. Again, thanks for the reply and insights. I was just looking at costco.com for electric blankets, sunbeam seems to be their primary supplier. Many of the reviews, regardless of model or price, all Sunbeam, seem to share the same fate. Either the blanket itself stops working or the remote does. In all fairness, there were far more reviews in favor of the blanket. However, even the most positive shared the same displeasure with the life of the Sunbeam before it went to the final winter for winter blankets. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 The cold sucks and makes my pain worse, but a few years ago I went on Cymbalta after trying several other things for pain. It really has made a major difference for me.  It is a hard drug to start or stop, so please do your research before you use it, but I highly recommend anyone with CMT at least look into it. I was not sure how long I could keep going with the pain I had before I started taking it and now it is so much more manageable.\n\n Aldo, coffee or tea with friends, even virtually or over the phone can be a nice way to ease isolation and warms you up. Thanks for your response! Like you, I absolutely despise,loath, detest winter! I HATE WINTER!!! Always have. Even before I knew I had CMT. \n\nI was on Cymbalta for some time. You are right. It is a hard drug. It made me feel like there was always something crawling on/in my skin. And the nightmares it induced were terrors. I kept trying it but could not adapt. My system refused to accept the drug. Come to find out, I had similar reactions to just about every mental health drug. Or, they were not effective reducing pain.\n\nI am glad you found something that works for you.\n\nI miss having coffee chat with friends. In person, phone, and virtual. Especially during the long dark winter days. Covid is bad enough for isolation. throw in winter AND CMT on top -well, is sounds kind of glum to me.", "Asking as a legit question but if I am just going to get worse anyways, what is the point of working out? (1E) I have a personal trainer but sometimes I just feel like I am wasting my time on it It is a good question. \n\n1) You can strengthen the muscles that do still respond well. Classically, folks with CMT have thin ankles and bulky upper calves. This is because the lowest leg muscles stop responding and start to atrophy and the upper calf muscles bulk up as they work harder to compensate. \n\nDifferent people will fit this classic scenario to a greater or lesser degree depending on severity of symptoms but the general principal is the same: strengthening the muscles you have will allow you to compensate for underperforming muscles. There are limits to the ability to compensate, but a good exercise routine can help extend someone is ability to perform routine tasks like walking by decades in some (not all) cases. I must say \"not all\" here because severity of symptoms varies so much on an individual level. But a good exercise routine can help anyone maintain their mobility as long as they, personally, can. \n\n2) Our cardiovascular fitness is just like anyone else's. We generally use more energy to do things like walking because our muscles are moving less efficiently. If you have better cardio fitness you can more easily expend that increased energy. In other words, if you make a habit of getting your heart rate up on a regular basis you can walk down the block without getting out of breath even if that walk requires more energy than it would for a person without CMT. \n\nFinally, if you are not seeing any benefits you might consider looking for a physical therapist who specializes in neurological disorders. A few sessions with someone like that might help you learn some things that an ordinary personal trainer might not know. I like working out.  It helps me clear my mind.  Gives me something to do and I have met a whole bunch of people and made some good friends.  I have competed  in a world wide strongman comp.  I have pulled trucks and carried stupidly over sized rocks.  It gives me enjoyment and a sense of accomplishment.\n\nYes there is the old it is taking my gains but I guess I have some twisted sense if sticking to it.  If it going to take it, I am going to make it earn it.\n\nI know what it is doing, but I am to stubborn to let it win.  I tell myself that I will break it before it breaks me.  I know somedays it is futile and I have plenty of set backs and heart ache and pains, and tremors and a few more fun things, but I cannot give in to it.\n\nThere are many many benefits to doing some form of physical exercise.  It is good for your health, it helps keep you active and fit.   It has mental health benefits.  It is a good thing to do.  It does not have to be huge weights or pulling trucks.  Exercise bikes or treadmills, yoga or using exercise bands.  There is a lot of options. What is the point of working out? Because you have a body. Everyone that can move should exercise unless there is a contraindication. My gym has people with all sorts of disabilities. Working out is a normal part of life. Core strength is so helpful. It is a fair point as there is a high likelihood that CMT may prevent muscle growth.\n\nThe solution is not to stop working out but to treat the issue. When you achieve that then you can work out and actually get somewhere that is beneficial. My doctor advised me to work out bc that my muscles are always at their strongest point they can be and use the best of them as possible. Also working out you get to clear your mind and just stay healthy!", "A step in the right direction Hey you all! I just wanted to post an update here, as this was incredibly helpful for getting my thoughts in order last time.\n\nMy appointment with my neurologist was very basic, but it was an intake visit so I was not expecting too much.\n\nI filled out all my new patient paperwork, had my blood pressure taken (I am remarkably consistent lol, 114/76 two different days in a row) and a slight consultation with the nurse going over my family history.\n\nThe neurologist asked the typical 'so why are you here today' and I gave him my symptoms list and went over how I discovered CMT. \n\nHe is scheduled me for an upper and lower limb EMG and NCV, and sent me to get about 12 different blood tests along with a genetic test. \n\nHe also encouraged me to find an ENT doctor for a hearing test, so I have that appointment booked now to go along with my podiatrist appointment next week.\n\nAll in all, I am just really happy to be listened too. I was absolutely expecting to be basically turned away with 'you are overreacting' but it did not happen! My parents were wrong and I should have been here much sooner! It is not definitively CMT yet, but my symptoms match up and I can finally start figuring out why I feel 80 at 24. You might want to find out why they are doing an EMG. Ask how it might affect the outcome of your treatment. This test is often diagnostic and if you already have a diagnosis it makes me wonder why they want the information. Some people really find this test quite annoying. Last time I asked my doctor about this test we eventually decided it is not necessary for me. I have already had one in the past. &gt; My parents were wrong and I should have been here much sooner!\n\nI have way too many medical conditions I can say that about. My parents were not big believers in doctors. I have never had one though, and I do not have a diagnosis regarding anything yet. The neurologist said it could be CMT, or it could be several things going on at once. I will definitely discuss it when I call them today to let them know I scheduled my blood work, thanks for the advice! The idea of it is a little scary, as someone who does not like needles lol Ah. Well, it does sound like you need one.", "CMT Subreddit Statistics ", "CBD and CMT Hi, my dad and I have talked a lot about taking CBD for CMT pain related I have not heard much about it.

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, not even in the medical field. A lot of internet medicine is full of shit.\n\nMy wife has 1A. Tonight I came across two journal articles talking about Lion's Mane (an edible mushroom) extract as a treatment for neutron health.\n\n(\n\n(\n\nWith further anecdotes here and there regarding CMT symptom improvements.\n\n\nHas anyone here had experience with this? Purely fact finding at the moment. You should not read this as medical advice. Not a doctor nor in anything close to a medical field but as I understand it:\n\n1a is a demyelination/wrong-myelination issue primarily, eventually the signal is so weak the axon dies. So not a cure no.\n\nBut many psychoactive (as in works on the brain) substances can help alleviate pain or enable temporary increased function. Stimulants like caffeine and b vitamins can give the day a bit of extra use. There are Neuropathic pain relievers like gabapentin and cymbalta, if you do not call it pain yet you might feel a static sensation.\n\nThe best and most sustainable treatment is probably exercise, tons of psychoactive chemicals are released from it. Also, the brain sends better signals and the axons get stimulation, preventing axon death and slowing muscle \"cell\" death. Once an axon \"dies\" both it and the neuron pretty much turn to fat and all connected muscle fibers are never activated again.\n\nAs far as Amyloid-\u03b2 blocking goes it may not be as straightforward for preventing neuronal death.\n It is an interesting line of thought but ultimately I doubt it would have a significant effect. \n\nIt is true that CMT1A does involve Endoplasmic Reticulum stress with the UPR\\* but the current understanding is that this is not what kills the neurons. Rather, as the myelin on the axons degrades and the axons cease to function the neuron will eventually die because it senses that it can no longer function. Rescuing the cell from death would do little without being able to improve axonal function.\n\nOn a purely speculative note, I have wondered if individual variation in the efficiency of the UPR might be one factor that impacts symptom severity. That is, if one person naturally has a slightly better ability to break down the improperly folded PMP22, if that might make their symptoms less severe and account for some of the wide variation in symptom severity in CMT1A people.\n\n\\---\n\n\\*Unfolded Protein Response: since CMT1A overproduces PMP22, and PMP22 does not always fold right when it is made (this is true for anyone, a certain percentage of the PMP22 produced just does not come out quite right) the cell then has to break down the protein that got made wrong. In people who produce too much PMP22, more of that protein needs to be broken down, more than the machinery of the cell was really made to handle, and that causes stress. Well stated. My hopeful approach is that such a treatment vector may help restore nerve function when combined with genetic therapy treatments currently being developed to reduce expression of PMP22. Or, at the least, reduce nerve degradation until such treatments are ready. I have tried Lion's Mane (large dose, powdered, I want to say 1g+ per day) in combination with Niacin and, this is probably unsurprising, it was hard to tell if it did anything. I cannot say I noticed any negative side effects either. I figured it would be worth trying even to see if there were some cognitive benefits, I gave it 6 months or so and then decided the cost was not worth it. I do not see any harm in trying it out though, I always find comfort in trying new treatments. Thank you for your experience! I would say consult a professional about anything. Nothing can treat cmt as someone said.", "I am thinking about tasking SARMs Hello,\n\nI am 26 years old, I have been working out on and off for the last 5 years and the last year I have really been pushing myself with a personal trainer (once a week, I workout alone 5 times a week and have one rest day.) Unfortunately I also have CMT1A, which cause muscle dystrophy. Generally, I have noticed that it is hard to put on muscle mass after my \"noob gains.\" Additionally, my wrists and balance really hold me back sometimes with squats - however I have mostly found a way around them (squat shoes / wrist wraps.) Also my recovery time, especially for my legs, can take a very long time - I have to do a very thorough warm-up for anything involving legs (squats, deadlifts etc...) I do count calories and my weight ( I am gaining ) but sometimes I just get really angry that I am sitting here struggling with a weight I should not be because my genetics blow. Yesterday I got half way through my workout and after struggling with 5lbs less than my usual lift just said \"Fuck it, what is the point?\" and left. Also I read apparently, with CMT1A I shoudn't ever be bulking due to my bodies difficulty with developing muscle? Or I should not ever cut? \n\nBasically, I do not want to take illegal drugs. BUT I need to do what is best for me. I want to be able to walk when I am 70 and I want to be able to build a decent body. I have read online that some Steroids and SARMS helps to combat the dystrophy. Additionally, I have discovered PXT3003 (which is fast-tracked for approval by FDA) as a treatmont for CMT1A. Ofcourse I am definitely going to ask my doctors about PXT3003 - and before I do any sort of steroids / SARMS I am going to research very thoroughly as to minimize the health effects.\n\nThe problem is, a lot of doctors still think exercise + CMT = bad. Theres also a phobia of prescribing steroids and it can be hard to get a prescription from your doctor. So I read online that Ostarine can help people with CMT recover better from their work-outs and develop muscle mass... and I am seriously considering it. It also looks like I can order it completely legally in Canada.\n\nMy ultimate goals are:\n\n - Do what is best for ME and my body and health. I do not care what laws I need to break.\n\n - Be able to walk at 70\n\n - Have a decent body form (I do not want to be a bodybuiler or powerlifter, but a nice body is part of my goal). Also I generally enjoy working out as a hobby.\n\n - Stay healthy, not damage my natural testosterone production etc...\n\nTo achieve those, I am thinking about:\n\n - Taking a regular dose of PXT3003 (or if it is not available, apparently you can easily order the three inregdients used to make it )\n\n - Possibly cycle Osterine (after doing more research into the proper and safe ways of doing it)\n\nI would like to welcome any opinions or cautions against this. I do not know enough about PXT3003, so I am curious what does it do help you gain muscle?\n\nAlso have you gone to one of the CMT centers of excellence?  Perhaps one of these experts can help you. As you said many doctors are not able to help because they did not specialize in this disorder. Do you know of any doctors in Canada that specialize in CMT? I do not see any in Canada on that website. However there are several near the border. Are you willing to travel? Thank you so much for your help. I am willing to travel to the US, I am actually quite close to the border. My primary concern ofcouse would be cost as I would  not have any health coverage in the USA. Hey! I workout everyday as well and one thing I try to do a lot when I am sore is increase my protein intake. Do you by any chance track your macros?\n\nProtein is pretty essential for building muscle because it joins the amino acids together inside the muscle after it breaks down. Hello, thanks for the insight.\n\nActually yes I do track my protein but not my carbs/fats per se. Just protein and calories.\n\nWhat has your progress been with your lifts if you do not mind sharing? Ie squat, dl and bench? I do not do anything with free weights because it is to difficult with a poor balance. However I do very intense cardio and the machines. I have definitely seen growth in my legs, gluteus, and arms but it does take some time. A method I have is each week I try to increase my weight by 5 pounds. If I am too weak to do the weight increase I do a smaller weight amount but many reps. I also make sure I stretch often and use a foam roller. \n\nIn terms of diet, i try to follow a low carb diet with high protein and I monitor the amount of fat I intake. A good 70% of building muscle is your diet so it is important to have set diet you can stick to. I think protein for us folks with CMT is pretty important so making sure we get enough of that is crucial.", "Living with this disease is depressing as f*ck Honestly man i dont know who will read this but ill vent here anyways\n\nAlright im 17 and im living a normal-ish life, i was diagnosed with 2A when i was 14 and even before i was diagnosed i already knew something was wrong i had tremors in my hands, kind of poor balance and a lack of muscle in my calves, and also my hands and legs are always freezing which makes my favorite time of the year (winter) suck so bad.\n\nEver since i got diagnosed i have been searching constantly for some kind of cure or real treatment that will fix me up but sadly no such thing exists still and maybe never will because i honestly lost hope, knowing that my body is slowly losing some of its functions feels like im slowly dying.\n\n\nIm insecure as fuck about my calves, the rest of my body looks fine but my calves are really skinny i always look at myself in the mirror and i hate it so much.\n\nNone of my friends know about this disease because i always wear long pants to hide it\nThinking about my future gives me little panic attacks to what will be my condition then.\n\nIm thinking about doing plastic surgery for my calves, but honestly its very expensive, i hope i will get the chance though.\n\nI feel that i missed out on so many things it really hurts me, sometimes i think to myself that dying is probably better than this and i hope that in my next life if there is one i hope I and anybody else would need to experience CMT and be this damn unlucky. Hello my friend. 34 year old dude here with 1A as well. I feel your pain. I was a volunteer firefighter for a while, (16-30) and I definitely had my share of issues because of my disease. For me, it was my arms I felt insecure about. Everyone else had huge arm muscles and mine were just small, and no matter what I did, I gained no muscle. So I totally relate. My only recommendation is, do the best you can while you are still young. Try and not feel insecure about what you cannot do, but celebrate what you can do. Sadly the reality is it is only going to get worse, so live the best you can while you still can. \n\nWe are in this together my friend. Feel free to reach out if you ever need to talk. Hello, 23 year old guy here, and I may not fully understand what you are going through and what you are feeling, but I want to say that all your emotions are valid and you are not alone in this.\n\nI have witnessed myself the struggle of having CMT physically and emotionally, my boyfriend has it. And although we wish for another life, we might only be getting one. So while you are still young and alive, do not let this disease stop you from living your life the way you want it too, with a few modifications here and there, my boyfriend has transitioned in a healthier diet to help slow down the progress of the disease.\n\nAnother thing would be surrounding yourself with good understanding people who will always love you and support you, it may be your family, or friends, or join CMT support groups. It definitely helps and inspiring to see a lot of happy beautiful people living their life, not letting the disease stop them.\n\nIt would totally be a roller coaster life,  and falling down is totally normal. Keep going my friend! There is a hope at the end of the ride. CMT is a part of you, but it will never be the totality of who you are. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude47 My wife has CMT also, and I have seen how hard it can be on her. I cannot say I know how you feel, because I do not have it myself, but I do have an idea of how difficult can be at times. If you ever need to talk, do not be afraid to reach out, and if you would rather talk to someone who actually knows how you feel, I can point you in her direction, I am sure she would like to talk to someone who can relate, besides her father\nNote: she is on reddit OP, please do not give up on yourself and your life.\n\nMy husband has CMT. We just celebrated our 15th anniversary, have the most incredible children, a beautiful home and wonderful friends and family. We have traveled and had incredible adventures together. My husband is a warmest and kindest person.\n\nCMT sucks and I will never know all that he has had to experience and all that he is missed out on. He was never able to do the active team sports he watched all of his friends do, but loves swimming and cycling. He gets sad when our daughter asks why he cannot do cartwheels or jump in the air but he is a really excellent juggler! He is had so many surgeries, periods when he is had to wear leg braces, and after a few decades of no changes the disease is starting to have more of an impact in his mid-40s - more frequent falls, increased difficulty doing things like buttoning his shirt.\n\nBut, he is the best man I know, and I love our life together. The thought of how many things would be lost if he were not here just breaks my heart.\n\nPlease reach out and seek help if you can, I think counseling with someone who understands and can help accept a life with a chronic disease might really help.\n\nAnd you have probably already heard this but adolescence and young adulthood, where you are in life, bring so many insecurities. It is natural in every one no matter what their abilities. I bet your friends would be totally supportive if they learned what you are living with.\n\nDo not discount the amazing life you can have. This disease does not make up the person you are. I was diagnosed at 13 so I can sympathize a bit.  I live in Michigan and I love winter as well so I definitely understand that part.  I highly recommend investing in some really good socks (multiple layers of them help me a lot) as well as some good bottom layers for your legs.  A USB hand warmer will also help keep the chill out of your hands and fingers. \n\nIt is hard not to feel like you are missing out some things, I totally get that.  I hope that as you get older you will start to realize that having a disease like this can end up giving you a better perspective on life than most people around you.  You are less likely to take things for granted, and hopefully you will value every day you are able to move around under your own power.  Even if my feet and legs are not having the greatest day I try to focus on \"every day walking on my own is a good one\".\n\nTry not to worry about how your legs look.  Most people will not even notice.\n\nTry to focus on now instead of always thinking about the future.  Most of the people I know from when I was in my teens did not have any of their plans work out the way they thought they would.  That is just life.  When I got into my 20's I started to realize I handled life's curve balls better than most of my friends because they had not had to deal with anything like CMT.  \n\nThere are promising treatments on the horizon.  Hell, when I was diagnosed there only four main types and that was in the 90's.  You have got a ton of time in front of you and who knows what they will discover?\n\nDo you work out at all right now?  I started working out more regularly when I was 18 and it made a world of difference.  You might be surprised by how many pull ups you can do compared to your friends because you have less weight to deal with on your lower half :)  Swimming is an excellent option for low impact exercise.\n\nDo not hide it from your friends and loved ones. I have been with my wife for 20 years as of this year and we have been married for 16.  When we first started dating I told her about my CMT and everything and her reaction was \"... so? I do not care if you wind up in a wheelchair someday.  I love you, and if you wind up needing a wheelchair someday we are going to get you a badass chair.\" \n\nHang in there, and just get through each day as you can.  Some days will always be better than others but you can do it. The better parts of life still outweigh the bad parts.  Does not always seem that way but when I look back on my life since I got diagnosed I am grateful for all of it.  \n\nFeel free to message me if you ever want to talk. I have type 2 and I am in my late 30s. Dying is not better. There might not be a next life. And if there is, it might not be better either. \n\nMy legs and arms are skinny. Luckily when I was in my 20s skinny jeans were in fashion. These things have a way of coming back in style, so you have that to look forward to. \n\nI never thought of myself as weak, though I probably am. Exercise and fitness go a long way and I wish i kept a regular routine going. And I wish I had started weightlifting when I was younger. \n\nDepression sucks. For me it is been far more detrimental to my life than CMT. If someone had a magic wand and I could choose which one I could get rid of, I would pick depression and I would do so almost instantly. \n\nPhysical therapy/training can help with the CMT. Behavioral/mental therapy can help with the depression and coping. Hey man I wore pants literally everyday from 5th to 11th grade because of bullying and bring called things like \"chicken legs\".  I got tired of it though and going back to wearing shorts was one of the best things I did back then. I got a few comments, but once you are part high school most people will stop mentioning it.  I guess what I am saying is to just accept how your legs look and enjoy the comfort of shorts, who cares if anyone else looks at them. Show yourself a little kindness. And examine your perspective on disability. Would you judge someone else with muscle atrophy? Why be less kind to yourself than you would be to someone else? Might help to find and hang out with other young people with physical disabilities. And find disabled role models to follow on social media. Once you fully accept yourself and no longer want to hide who you are you will be so much happier. And dying is not better. And there is no next life. This is your life. Live it to its fullest. There are meds to calm the tremors down. I take them and am able to play music in bands. There are leg braces.  I love mine and think they look cool like futuristic or something. I always wear them showing. Attitude is everything in how you get along and what you make of your life. Also, I want to add - please talk to a school counselor. Access whatever resources are around you for support. Sorry , but what meds exactly calm the tremors? Propranolol can help a lot and it does not dope you up Hang in there. I would not opt for the surgery as I think our biggest insecurities are not often as big to other people as we think. That said, if surgery will improve the way you see yourself, there is nothing wrong with that. I would recommend waiting til you are older but financially you could consider a go fund me type page. I am sure some people would donate. \n\nWinter lover here (and I absolutely cannot stand how my feet feel like frost bite during this season). Strangely I also get it in the height of summer when there is a sudden temp chance. \n\nI have not got the same type as you but I get so frustrated with my drops in energy levels and not being able to walk as far as others, and how overthinking everything before I even get to the event quashes my social life that I often feel depressed. I am lucky compared to most with the condition but there is no denying how it is subtly chipped away at my self esteem. \n\nI am not sure what words to offer to comfort you as we all vary so differently in terms of how bad our symptoms are. But we can all emphasis with you in some form. You are not alone, even when it feels that way.  True it is depresing i had this disease since childhood but diagnose to determined the disease is pretty late at 24 yo, im 30 now.\n\nTremor is part of my life, lifting my arm at certain position is out of question.\n\nas for feet thighs hardly develop, calf is small and hard, its kind of hard to walk as time goes by, now i can walk a few meters only, using shoes is out of question i cant stand up from chair with shoes or sandals on.\n\nI live in asia where the country does not have disability act like western country, im jobless its the biggest source of my depression ofc i had work years ago but only last 5 or 6 months since my body cant keep up.\n\nI dont know where u are but it seems u born in better place than i, even im not the right person to say this just keep it up &amp; enjoy every bit of your day, and dont think about next life since its mostly non existent Late answer but you cannot take that on a daily basis, can you? Absolutely you can. The experts at the movement disorder clinic assured me this medication is incredibly safe to take several times daily. I, like you, was concerned about taking it all the time as well. Now I have to try this.. My CMT is weird in the sense that my strength is not noticeably impaired but there are slight tremors that I would love to get rid of. Thank you Keep your chin up hun. I know it is definitely been hard dealing with it. I have got 1A and my wrists/arms have always been small and that always made me feel insecure. But there are people who are here for you and will do their best to support you", "Trouble goal setting after decline in health Hey folks,\n\nI have always had pretty advanced symptoms since childhood (so I am led to believe)\nPreviously this has never held me back and I have always found a way to push through to achieve the things I have set for myself. \nHowever, after what seems a very sudden decline in health, a lot of the things I wanted to pursue/loved taking part in seem unrealistic and incredibly distant possibilities at this current moment in time.\nDoes anyone else have any similar experience? Any tips on readjusting your life goals, whilst somehow finding peace with the fact you may never be able to continue the things you spent so many years working towards?\n\nThanks for reading\nCiao \u270c\ufe0f ... what decline?  Walking, writing, thinking? Of the general spectrum, the main thing pertaining to my question would be a big spike in fatigue\nI have always been very active despite pain and fatigue, but quite rapidly now I cannot even imagine doing any of the things I used to since just the regular day to day tasks seem take so much more effort than before, amd subsequently when I have made the effort to do something it is evident how limited capacity I can now partake compared to before hey friend :) What you are describing is depression in the clinical way, not the internet way, and you need to see a provider who can assist you.  I say this as someone who has been there time and time again.\n\nI will gladly do my best to help you find someone if you need. Hi :) \n\nI completely understand what you are saying. I think I am in the same place. \n\nI recently had a big decline after years of pushing through, staying healthy and active and energized. I feel I have gotten to a point that I cannot push myself like that anymore and it has made me stop to think about everything. \n\nI am working at coming to peace with it. This has taken a ton of journaling and soul searching. Reaching out to others and finding supporthas been essential. I still have days where I see someone move there foot and not think and get jealous. But it is about being kind to know that you are life is changing in a different way to others. And that is okay. If we are not accepting and kind to ourselves how we can expect others to be. That is been the huge part of me coming to peace with it. Is not comparing myself to others. \n\nI think finding your next goal that you can focus on has helped me with moving forward. Find a goal that is more attainable in you are new place. And knowing it is okay that it is now different. \nLife is about change. And embracing the changes whether they are good or bad can be hard. You are not alone in that feeling I promise. \n\nI hope this helped. I feel very similar to your post and am questioning some big life changes for my goals. \n\nHappy to be an ear. \n\nGood luck on moving forward. It is one step at a time :)", "CMT exercise videos? Hey all! I was thinking of something today that I thought might be helpful to people with CMT and just neurological disorders. I was diagnosed at 13, and have been trying to remain active since being diagnosed. I am now a certified personal trainer and am able to help all kinds of people with their goals. When I was at the gym today, I was thinking of the possibility of creating a site that provided information/videos on how to get stronger with CMT. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am nervous about it, but my husband encouraged me to post here to see if anyone would even be interested in something like that. It would be centered around doing strength training that is both safe and effective, while incorporating functional exercises to help with every day life. While searching for functional exercises that involved agility, all I could find were exercises geared towards people who want to become athletes, or to be in the gym all day. I want this to be for people who just want to improve daily activities, ie: going up and down the stairs, stepping off the curb, putting your shoes on while standing up, getting in and out of the car etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think? Be brutally honest with me! Yes please do it! I have all for functional training at the moment.  I tried the whole body building thing and just never felt right (as such).  Been getting into strongman training and having a blast.  Putting up content that shows how to or ways to do different movements can only but help.   It does not have to be all doom and gloom so showing everyday tasks or different ideas on strength movements might be all someone needs to get going.\n\nAlso, no one stands up to put their shoes on, that is just witchcraft :) It is a great idea, but do check out some that are already around and build from there. I think these ( are good, basic starting points. Do it! Yes, yes, yes!  I like the exercises on the CMT site, but I really need a few videos that lead me all the way through a CMT workout, with repetitions and timed durations. \nThank you for bringing up this topic! Also focus on showing how to target the muscle groups that lead to the day-to-day issues; how to strength your calf muscle, forearm, grip, develop your inner quad (they suspect a weakness in this muscle leads to common knee dislocation) etc. This is exactly why I want to do it! To help people through the process and also to teach them their capabilities in a safe and effective way. \n\nThe treadmill and stationary bike are good to help keep moving, but doing strength training will really help prevent muscle atrophy! Which, as you stated, you tried doing before, but were injured, thus you stopped training resulting in muscle atrophy. So I really want to create videos so show people how to do strength training that targets for CMT in a safe way! I laughed out loud at the putting shoes on while standing up haha thank you for the insight! I agree completely, does not have to be doom and gloom, but just a helping hand in getting stronger muscles, safely. Thank you so much! I will definitely look into those exercises and start a good base and build around it :) Got it! Yeah some exercises look really funky, especially the more specific ones geared towards functional, everyday strength! What great suggestions! Thank you for the insight, I really appreciate it :) I will definitely do my best to focus on targeting muscle groups that are big in every day activities and continue to learn and educate myself! I have been doing single press to help strength my knees which has been feeling better.  The inner quad muscle is something that gives me grief if I am not careful.  Lots of stretching and  resistance bands for that. Great idea, go for it!  There is no body better qualified than you. Are you familiar with the Made for Motus guy? Also, are you going to the HNF Movement as Medicine Summit in November? The Made for Motus guy has a webinar coming up in a few days  Yes yes yes! That sounds amazing!! Would you ever think about taking clients on long distance? \nI am not sure if maybe the thought of a work plan/training program would ever be an idea? \n\nJust thinking it could be helpful to talk to/go through a program with someone who understands might be helpful To lots of people :) Between the CMTA, a group of therapists in Australia,  and  a few You Tube channels there are numerous exercise videos covering the topics of balance, strengthening, gross motor, fine motor, proprioception,   hand strengthening exercises all led by PT and OT's.,  some who have CMT.   \n I think being a personal trainer is fantastic and between your training and your personal experience with CMT, I bet you have a lot to  offer. But there are things that working with a PT or OT can being that are unique and necessary.  Check out some of the videos. I have seen  some personal trainers who think they have  the skills and knowledge of a PT get themselves and their clients in trouble.   Be cautious but keep learning and seeing what you can contribute  to what  is available! Quick question: In your experience, do people with CMT develop muscle at the same rate as non-CMT people? I have thought about taking clients on long distance, but there are just so many different aspects that go into that, I would have to do some more research about what that would look like! \n\nI am hoping that providing these videos and insights and how they have affected me will help others to feel more confident going to a gym or doing at home exercises to help slow the progression down. Once I get that up and running, I will definitely look into what it would take to train people long distance! thank you for this! That is also why I have been a little wary about starting this up because I never want to injure or cause harm to people. And the fact of the matter is that i am NOT a PT or an OT, so I do not have that extensive background. I am a certified Personal Trainer, and I know what works for me and several of my clients, but that is not the same as years and years of experience and schooling.\n\nI will definitely be checking out the videos and have already seen some that are fantastic! I will definitely be using those as the base and build from there :) We do not develop or grow muscle nearly as quickly as people without CMT. The muscles that are more affected by the peripheral nerve damage are particularly hard to grow and get stronger. Most doctors will tell you that it is near impossible to grow muscle when you are diagnosed with CMT.\n\nThat being said, in my experience, you CAN get stronger. It will be minimal, but every little bit counts right? The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. Most strength training will be to prevent further muscle loss, rather than building muscles. I am definitely by no means ripped or have sculpted muscles (except when carrying groceries in from the car, because that def needs to only be one trip lol), but I am stronger than when I first started strength training and focusing on mobility and flexibility.\n\nDoes that help answer your question?\n\nI will definitely check it out! How awesome would it be to have a central location for all things CMT?! That is a super interesting reply. My consultant, one of the leading ones in the UK (clueless IMO) claims that muscle growth should not be impacted beyond the peripheral limbs, yet many people who I have spoken to with CMT (1A most of the time), all say the same thing: muscle growth for every part of the body seems to be massively hindered, with the saying of \"twice the effort for half the gains\" becoming commonplace. \n\nNow, time for a curve ball. I live in the UK where SARMS are legal, relatively cheap and high quality (by law they have to be). I am 5 weeks into a cycle of LGD-4033 and have gained roughly 2 kilos of muscle. Having focused on my forearms heavily, I have increased my reverse incline barbell lift from 10kg x 12 reps (3 sets) to 17kg x 15 (3 sets), as well as strength for everything else across the board (calves work in progress).\n\nGiven the above, and the fact that some docs in the US are now prescribing Nandrolone for CMT patients, is this something you have looked into? My personal feeling is that academics are too focused on the nerves when there may be a way for everyone with CMT to increase their muscle mass and thereby reduce the impact of atrophy. That sounds great! Anything I can do to slow the progression down is huge for me. I have been noticing so much weakness in the last 6 months and if I can help slow it down. I will try anything! \n\nLet me know when you get some videos up :) Kudos to people like you who try stuff like this and share your results. It is incredibly interesting to read. Have you observed any side effects since taking LGD-4033? Also, what dose are you on and if I can ask, what was your weight when you started? Thanks! Sorry for the delay in the reply; I was waiting on bloodworks to make sure I could give you an honest picture of what is going on! I took baseline readings where everything was near enough okay, so the issues listed below are the result of LGD (and common side effects):\n\n**Cons:**\n\n*Bloodwork (10 week mark)*\n\n* Testosterone is down to bad levels for someone my age. Not close to \"shut down\", but 7.25 nmol/l, whereas it should be high teens/twenties\n* SHBG is down\n* LDL is a bit high, HDL is a bit low, total cholesterol/HDL ratio is not great (6.49)\n* Liver ALT is 118.2 IU/L\n\n*Exercise*\n\n* Injured back Rotatory, slight bicep strain, rotator-cuff is not happy. Basically, due to CMT, there is likely to be a lot of weaknesses in your body which basic exercises may highlight, and if you are not careful (I was not), may aggravate. \n\n**Pros**\n\n*Bloodwork*\n\n* All things considered, everything is extremely manageable, far from what you see on steroids\n\n*Exercise*\n\n* lolgains. This stuff (8mg a day, split into 4mg morning, 4mg evening) has for the first time in my life allowed me to gain muscle mass, and at an astonishing speed. While the rate of gains seems to slow down after \\~6 weeks, I can effectively improve the strength and stamina of all my limbs and muscles; my forearms are larger, my wrists are larger, legs, biceps etc. If you are concerned about muscle wastage, this stuff in my mind is a genuine solution. \n\nWorth noting is that I am also taking things like krill oil and TUDCA to help minimise any negative side effects. That is very interesting, have you heard about anyone besides your self who have tried this? I am curious about the long term results as well, how long are you going to take them? Besides the measurable gain, have you noticed any difference in other areas? Have the bloodwork values stabilized? Yep I know of other people with CMT who have tried lgd and had the same positive effects. Long term it is hard to say, I will probably cycle it in 8 weeks on, 6 off, but some doctors have CMT patients on anabolics permanently, so clearly there is a precedence to be on PEDs long term. \nAs for other impacts, my digestion is not brilliant (bloating etc) but that could also be due to a protein heavy diet. Apart from that minor issue, everything else is improved, plus my feet are never nearly as cold anymore. \n\nI am still on gear so will update you once I am off cycle to see where my bloods are immediately post cycle and then at the 4 week mark to make sure everything is back to normal!", "Newly diagnosed CMT X Hello everyone, I am looking for some advice concerining the recent diagnoses of  X linked CMT in a 14 year old female. Almost five months ago my lovely 14 year old daughter was first diagnosed with CMT. I was quite shocked since there apparently is no family historie of CMT that we can relate to and we had no way of expecting this. Her symtomps are stil fairly mild, arched feet, that lean a little bit outside when walking and she uses her hands to get up and trips a lot when dancing on ome leg or bear to the ground (she studies modern dance).How ever the EMG showed progressed weakening of the nerves in her feet and right hand and also some sensory loss.. Now her bloodtest came back indicating she is CMT X linked. There is a  fair change she had this from me, I have had somewhat progressieve scoliosis since I was 14 and we have a female history of hearing problems that start in our early 50ties, cold hands and feet and all that kind of stuff that one deals with without further ado. So it could be she got it from us and is maybe some what stronger affected. I will get tested myself azap.\nMy question is if there are any other readers here with CMT X. How is your progression, is there any medical trials you look at (I focused om CMT 1A studies because that was going to be the most probable outcome and now have to start investigating in the CMT X linked direction), what is your outlook on your future, do you think there will h\u00e9 a cure? Is there any supplements you an suggest? Is there any experts we should see? (Our Dutch neurologist is very into there is no cure so just sit this ome out kind of approach wherry I as a patent want to stay active and do all we can).\nPlesse know that I read every post here and that I am aware of the pain and suffering many of you go through. My heart goes out to you all and I do not want to make drama over such light symptoms its just that I need to start somewhere and I was hoping for your knowledge and advice. Take care! I have CMTX. Usually it affects people later in life and females are usually not as greatly affected compared to males. I am 45F and am only mildly affected. Looking back, I can see some ways out affected me when I was younger, but it was not that terrible. I constantly rolled and sprained my ankles for one. But I was very active, and I think this helped. \n\nMy dad starting tripping and falling a lot in his 30s. The doctors diagnosed him and told him not to exercise. But he thought that sounded like horse shit and focused on building the muscles in his legs. I think that is why he stayed out of a wheelchair for so long. His sister and brother progressed much faster than he did-- neither worked out like he did. \n\nI notice a very big difference when I am focused on building strength in my legs. About 10 years ago I decided to start taking adult dance classes. Taking ballet greatly improved my balance. And tap helped strengthen my ankles. I was running at the time too and would always wear braces, but after a while of dance, I was able to run without braces and sometimes just use KT tape (except when I did longer distances). Note: I am a terrible runner, so it is always run/ walk, but I think this has helped my CMT as well. The more active I am, the more balanced I feel. I have not been as active the last 5 years and I really feel it. \n\nMy cousin sees Dr. Shearer at UPenn (one of the centers of excellence in the US), and she told me recently he indicated that he hopes for a cure to CMTX within about 10 years. I will believe it when I see it, but there has been a lot more research on CMT1A and CMTX. Since CMTX is the second most common type of CMT, it gets more research attention than the other 200+ types which is good news for us. \n\nOverall, life is not terrible with CMTX. But I am also glad I did things like traveling the world while I was young and more fully able. There is a lot I did while traveling in my 20s and 30s which would be a lot harder now. I have a lot of difficulty with inclines and uneven surfaces, so solo travel and more adventurous travel is tougher. But now in have my husband who always literally lends me a hand or let us me hold onto his shoulder for balance. \n\nMy best advice is to encourage her to stay active. I still fractured and sprained my ankles the more active I was, but it was worth it. A good physical therapist is key there. And podiatrist or orthopedic. Finding ones familiar with CMT is even better as they can help with exercises specifically tailored to the issues she is facing. My podiatrist also shows me massage techniques when I am having nerve pain (which she usually figures out where the nerve inflammation is occurring-- like when my bones felt like they were going to pop out of my foot, the inflammation was actually behind my knee. Consistently massaging that area worked wonders!). I was diagnosed with CMTX when I was a 16 year old girl, de novo mutation, nobody else in my family has it. I am 35 now and my symptoms have slowly gotten worse, surgeries in both feet, wear AFOs most of the time.\n\nMy biggest recommendation is to find a neurologist for your daughter who is optimistic and kind. As callagem notes in her comment, there is actually a lot that your daughter can do to modify the course of her illess, and having a pessimistic neurologist who offers no options for symptom management can have a really negative impact on how she receives this diagnosis and copes with it.\n\nTeenage girls often have body image challenges already, and getting this diagnosis at this point in life is hard. I was diagnosed by a brilliant scientist with absolutely no empathy or bedside manner - he scolded me for crying during the very painful EMG testing, told me to stop playing sports, handed me a catalogue of ugly shoes, and told me there was nothing more he could do for me. I developed an eating disorder and spent years ignoring my diagnosis before going to therapy in my mid-twenties, finding a new neurologist who specializes in CMT, and taking ownership of my illness and treatment.\n\nYour daughter is lucky to have such a thoughtful and caring mom. Supporting her now in learning how to cope with CMTX will serve her well in the years to come.", "pain management recommendations? does anyone know any good means for pain management? my meds are not working and i have not been getting much sleep. Weed before bed Good day/night. have you been watching what you eat?\n\nWhat I observed with my partner who has CMT, a *good* diet plays a very important role in CMT and countering its symptoms.\n\nBe sure to have vitamins and minerals supplements, especially like magnesium, vit B, calcium, amino acids and etc.\n\nWould be wonderful too to let go of *unhealthy* kind of food diet.\n\nHope this fragment could help you. \ud83d\ude47\ud83d\ude47\ud83d\ude4f\n\nPS. My partner does not drink any kind of pain medications, for they can be harmful to the body. Try to go **all** natural Do you know the type of pain? Nerve, biomechanical issues, fatigue/overuse pains? That can make a big difference in approach. If the (pain) medication are not working the best thing to do is to schedule a visit with the neurologist who prescribed them to discuss alternatives. Chronic neuropathic pain can be hard to treat, but there are some alternatives that can be tried. My mother was on oral gabapentin with some success, although it did come with some side effects.\n\nThe CMTA has a pretty good PDF about managing pain in CMT ( it is worth a read! If meds alone are not working I would ask your doctor to get you in contact with someone who can get you night time braces. I saw a physical therapist for a knee issue about 9 months ago. We spent about 5 minutes on my knee and multiple sessions on my feet. Turns out the root cause of my knee issue was my feet. She gave me a stretching/strengthening routine to do and that has helped me more than anything else. I still get pain on some days, but there are now many days without pain.\n\nObviously everyone is different, but this was the best thing I have done for my CMT in years Thank you so much for posting this, u/pmp22 !I just saw Dr. Scherer this past Friday and pain management was a prime topic of conversation. This was my first visit with him. He did say my level of pain is such that he has had only 3 or 4 such patients with such a high degree of pain. I see him again January.\n\nIn the mean time, I made an appointment with a pain management specialist with Penn MED as well, seeing him Sept. 28. Only thing I have to do is figure out how to get there from here as there is no way I can drive that distance nor handle the incessant breaking and gas two-step. Cannot do that any more. That sounds like the perfect way to send my pain from a tolerable but annoying 3-4 to a 8. There is no way to really give advice based on how little OP has said. &gt;they can be harmful to the body. \n\nOur bodies are already fucked. Half the pain is literally just nerves being all \" fuck this, lets send pain signals\". Do what you need to do to deal with the pain.  There was a reply in my inbox, but seems it was deleted too. No amount of good diet with fix nerves ffs. Sounds promising! Seriously. I would really like to try it for pain as well as a sleep aid. I can not remember what it is like to sleep through the night, nor wake with a modicum of mental clarity and not dread the simple daily chores of dressing, cleaning up, making my way downstairs. \n\nCan you elaborate on specifics of HOW and WHAT benefits you derive from nightly use? \n\nI am assuming your purchases are medically prescribed? So, may I ask the cost of each blunt or whatever delivery methodology you employ?\n\nIn Delaware, only specific physicians are authorized to write a script. Prior to writing the script, the patient must apply to the state, annually, and purchase a legal card for the purchase. Naturally, Delaware considers this a perfect opportunity to balance their terribly mismanaged budget so they currently, stipulate an annual 'fee' of approximately $125 before you can even step into a dispensary. Once inside, the sky is the limit, price wise.\n\nI would love to know more about the results you achieve using weed, how long they last, side effects, which blends seem to work better for you.... Anything you care to share would be appreciated! Well I am not to picky about \u201cblends\u201d. I usually go an indica strain pre-roll, below 20% THC. I purchase all my marijuana in a dispensary, as I am not a fan of buying from drug dealers. Prices range from $10-$15 per gram. Pots legal way up in the north, eh, so I have no problem buying up here. Most \u201cstreet weed\u201d is clean, if money is a problem.\n\nAs for the benefits of smoking marijuana: I felt that it helps reduce the cold I feel in my feet. Reduce any pain I feel in my entire body. The indica strain in known as the one that makes you sleepy, so I find it puts me to bed faster. My stress is reduced. My anxiety gone. My overall happiness and mental health go way up. Marijuana, when smoked, has a pretty quick activation time, and does not effect you for to long.\n\nNote that side-effects vary from person to person, the duration and strength of each side-effect differ greatly as well.\n \nSmoking to much before bed can give me a \u201cweed hangover\u201d, and as such, I take to little puffs and put the joint an air tight container. My tolerance for everything is pretty low so I find that is enough for me to get a 1 hour high. Thanks for the in depth rundown! Weed is something I have considered several times but always reject due to 1.The State of Delaware taking advantage of people in a weakened state turning a necessary medicine into a revenue grab. 2.overall cost of weed vs amount required to achieve any level of relief. 3. I have so many different kinds of kick-ass agonizing pains, I am not sure weed would be effective or would I have to purchase several different blends.\n\nI have reached a point with my pain management dr where we have very few if any options left. Propranolol, Clonopin, Marijuana. Alcohol on occasion. There is no permanent relief.", "Treatment for Neuropathy Other Than Gabapentin? Really looking for an alternative to Gabapentin (800mg 3x a day) and kind of wondering if anyone had mood changes while on it? I have found that my anxiety is much worse and impacting my life, but I need something to treat my worsening neuropathy. I took gabapentin for neuropathy and it made me extremely tired. I was on 900mg a day I believe. The doctor suggested doubling or tripling the dose. I told him I would rather not take it. That was 2012-2013 shortly after I was diagnosed. Fast forward to 2018, I was prescribed it for anxiety. It caused more problems than it was helping. It did nothing for my anxiety. If anything it made it worse. It caused me to have many episodes of derealization. That and a few other anti anxiety meds have done the same. \n\nDepending on where you live cannabis is a good alternative. I live in a state where cannabis is decriminalized somewhat, but I use CBD/hemp. It helps somewhat. I usually blend smokable hemp and cannabis for better results.  Doing so also reduces the paranoia/anxiety that come with me using straight cannabis. \n\nI gave up on using prescribed medications for my neuropathy. Every one of them that I have tried either did nothing or had I will effects that made it not worth taking. \n\nI hope you find something that works for you soon. It can be a frustrating process. CoQ10 seems to reduce my symptoms. I notice a difference when I do not take it.", "Difficulty swimming Does anyone else have difficulty swimming / learning how to swim? I have had swimming lessons on two different occasions in my life and each time nothing helped, I could not learn for the life of me. What did help me swim though was flippers. It is disappointing not knowing how to swim because I plan on going into marine biology and that is pretty much a requirement. \n\nIf you do have CMT and know how to swim, how did you learn? What helps you? How long did it take? If it helps at all, my daughter ( now 10, diagnosed with 1B at 2 yrs ) started artistic ( synchronized) swimming a few years ago. It is the absolute best exercise she can do and she loves being in the water. She has had the chance to perform for the US Olympic team and has won medals at novice level ( she has a great coach ). \n\nShe will never be able to swim as powerfully as some of  her friend but she is so comfortable inside the water and can tread water for a long time, using a variety of techniques. She is as capable as anyone else in the water. So do not let it hold you back. You may not become the fastest swimmer but you can become very comfortable in that environment. I have never been able to swim. I am an Eagle Scout and never learned how. It is not that I never tried, I have just never been able to. I enjoy water and mostly just stand there when I am at the pool or lake. I cannot even do a dead man float. My legs immediately sink. My wife has tried to figure it out for years now and mostly tells me that I need to relax. I keep trying to do the float, but the legs keep sinking. \n\nI do remember having a set of flippers one summer when I was younger and I was able to swim. You are not alone. \n\nAs far as wanting to go into the field of study you want to, there are ways to work around CMT. I have been playing drums for 25 years now and was not diagnosed until I was 27(39 now). I definitely have lost fine motor control, but I have found a grip that makes it easier for me. Not so much with the control, but with the pain I was having when I played. \n\nYou can find ways to adjust and still have a happy outcome with your work. Congrats to your daughter!!! It is wonderful seeing people with the same disability achieving great things, thank you for sharing! I used to be really good at swimming but I barely can at all now Was thrown in that whole ymca swim regimen,  I probably was not feeling the full on effects at the time,but probably liked it cause no one could see the odd walk in a pool. Swimming actually feels like a more natural environment for me. But I was started really young. Like when I was an infant. My mother would float me on my back in the pool.\n\nI like that balance is basically a non-factor even in shallow water. But I probably cannot tread water for as long as an average swimmer can due to fatigue. Actually thinking about it, yeah. I started young, everyone learns to swim where I am. But I do struggle quite a bit with getting propulsion from legs (which flippers help with), and not focusing too much on the arms. \n\nLegs - it was about focusing on kicking from the upper thigh/hip as opposed to the knee. Bigger muscle, less cramping. Strength of kick beats speed. \n\nI will never be able to swim breast stroke :( Learned as a toddler before I had any effects. I learned way before I started having symptoms, but all I could do was swim like a dog and very bad crawl. Then I joined a disabled swimming team and learned the specifics. It was not very bad, leg exercises are a torture and butterfly is practically impossible for me, but everything else I can swim. I have competed for some years as well. Take your time and do not despair. Frustration can take us back.\n\nWhat is your struggle? Anything specific? If you get comfortable enough you can probably swim with just your arms.  It is not the most efficient, but it is doable. Yeah I love water because it puts me on even footing. I remember my first swimming lesson. The instructor was a young guy, shouting and laughing at me \"you need to kick harder! Hahaha! Your legs are so weak!\"\nGot out of the pool and left.\n\nThen a few years later I found an old lady. She taught me how to swim gently, without needing any strength, as she was not using any either, and she was able to swim for hours on end like that.\nHer old lady friends used to come over and compliment me on how I was the only guy in the swimming pool who was not thrashing around destroying their hairdo. :)\n\nIf you can, find someone similar, to show you, even just a few lessons.\nAlso, as far as I understand, almost everybody who is learning around here uses buoys (stuck between the legs), foam boards, flippers etc to help and learn the correct techniques. So I would say it is normal, and it helps and it is fun :) (most people will be jealous, thinking, woaah, cool, I want flippers, too!) 1A here, I learned to swim at a very young age so it is always been natural. I actually swam competitively up through high school and was decent at it. That being said, kicking was always a weak point, my legs just did not want to do their share of the work. Keep at it and I am sure you will get there, learning to swim later in life takes time and having CMT definitely will not make it easier. You will want to spend a solid summer in a pool with lessons thrown in, it is all technique and comfort and that just takes time. Stick with it and I bet you will get to where you need to be in terms of swimming ability.", "Question For Anyone With AFO Experience I am looking for advice on when to look into an AFO brace.  I had a surgery on my left ankle in 2015 (21yr) to stabilize it; which worked great. I also had Achilles lengthening on both ankles in 2003. I have become increasingly more active since the surgery in 2015 and my quality of life has improved significantly (after years of suicidal depression).  That said my right ankle is starting to feel more weak; I do not want to/ can not afford another surgery.  My right ankle I think has another good decade in it hopefully.  \n\nDoes anyone have advice/ experiences with AFOs that could help me decide if decide if I should speak to a doctor about getting a custom brace?  I am doing fine on my right ankle, but the feeling I describe as a \"flat tire\" is becoming increasingly more persistent. I went the opposite way you did, did not get any surgeries but have been wearing braces since I was 21(30 now). What kind of information could I give you? I knew of a orthotics &amp; prosthetics buisness near to me and just got a script from my PCP and went to get fitted. Peoples needs can be very different. It is important to find a really good orthotist in your area and hey will help you find the best brace for you. Custom is almost always better than off the shelf unless you only have simple foot drop and no other problems - like foot turning in or out. What I can tell you is my AFOs changed my life.  I got a prescription from my specialist and had them made last year.  My pain is significantly reduced and my quality of life greatly improved.  I do not wear them all the time, but I do wear them when I know will be walking for a bit, like when I walk to work or have a looot of errands to do Thank you to everyone who has responded!  I am thinking about setting up an appointment to talk about it with my orthopedic surgeon/ specialist.  I just have to figure out the insurance costs, but really think its worth the money.  \n\nIf anyone has more experiences to share about how AFOs help them that can help assure me theyre worth the money I would love to hear from you My right ankle is beginning to feel like what I would describe as a \"flat tire\" if I walk on it more than 2-3 hours at a time.  It is nowhere near as bad as my left ankle was before it was surgically corrected.  But now that my left ankle is stronger, I am hoping an AFO could stop that \"flat tire\" feeling for my right ankle.  It does not roll, it just feels fatigued very quickly.  I guess I am saying all this to ask if you feel in your experience using an AFO brace prevents your ankle from feeling as much muscle fatigue/ slows that down so you can walk longer? Hey! I have been wearing AFO's for the past 6 months now. If you have any questions about braces, you can send me a dm. I would love to help :)", "A little bit of muscle building with CMT Hey guys, I was just wondering if anyone here knows how you can tell if you can build some muscle with CMT? I have been told a couple times on a couple different subs that I cannot, that I should take some kind of pill that I am not going to take, because if I do not take it it is all in vain.\n\nJust to clue you in on where I am at. My calves are as skinny as pipes, and I am missing the muscle between my pointer and my thumb. I feel that if I start doing push-ups there is no reason why I should not gain some kind of strength in my biceps and my chest, and maybe even my forearms. Am I correct? I have lost a lot of weight and I do not want to lose the muscle I already have. If anyone has any pointers I would appreciate it. I do not want to go to the gym and make an ass of myself, so I am fine doing exercises at home, like push-ups sit-ups planks, etc. \n\nSo, I am not talking about turning into hulk hogan, I just want to build a little bit of muscle and fill in the little bit of loose skin that I have, and maybe get rid of the love handles. When I was diagnosed at 20 my neurologist told me that I could not build muscle. This was very much untrue and probably the worst advice I ever got. \n\nProbably the only way you can be completely sure is to try, but it has certainly been my experience that I can build muscle through exercise with no pills. In my thirties I saw a physical therapist who specializes in helping people with neurological disorders. I learned a lot from her about how hard to push myself for optimal results without injuring myself. If you can see a PT who specializes in neurological issues, I highly recommend it. Learning to pace myself according to my own abilities and not default assumptions based on what \"normal\" people can do allowed me to make much faster progress. \n\nI work out at home these days with a combination of walking (or using an elliptical machine in bad weather) and various resistance bands as well as bodyweight exercises (such as push-ups and glute bridges). So from my personal experience of having mild CMT 1A muscle building is very hard. You can get some basic gains but that is it. Also it does not seem to slow down the nerve death which then leads to atrophy. I would say muscles that were affected by neuropathy are definitely lost, unless some kind of cure becomes available. Now how much of your muscles were obliterated is different for everyone, my calves for example are above-average in size and hardly affected.\n\nFor the other muscles I would say you can definitely put muscles on. There is no debate. You might not become a bodybuilder because you are still bottlenecked by weak or weaker grip and ankle strength. But you can do something. I build muscle/ strength everywhere on my body except maybe my ankles (they are still basically just skin and bone).  I think you should definitely be able to as well, but things vary between people.\n\nI would suggest starting out with incline pushups and some light yoga, there are tons of videos on YouTube. I do not mean to be that guy suggesting yoga, but I found it to be great for myself.\n\nDo not be afraid to go to a gym though, most people will not even be bothered to look at you they are to busy looking at themselves, we are all there to improve.  Those that do are just insecure and need someone to tear down instead of building themselves up.  Or honestly sometimes they are just clueless and trying to be nice. Had a guy comment on my calves being skinny once and the look on his face when I said I have a disability was hilarious, he went white haha.  But he was trying to be nice and suggest exercise, just clueless. But have you built any muscle from areas of neuropathy caused loss? Calves, or hands? This is a very difficult question to try to address. However, I would say that my ankles, while weak compared to an average person's ankles, are slightly stronger than they were 10 years ago. So to the best of my ability to answer this question: yes. I was always told I get to work twice as hard for half the result.  Does not stop me from trying though No one has ever told me I flat-out could not build musicle with CMT. Certainly in areas directly affected by the CMT (calves, hands) muscle building does not happen, but I have built and maintan muscles in my biceps, thighs/glutes, and abs.\n\nI go to the gym regularly - like 3-4 times a week - and no one has ever acted like I am out of my league. Most people are there doing their own things anyway. The variety of weight machines is worth it and you can pace yourself and see what feels best. Most gyms will also give you a primer on the machines if you are not sure how one works/what machine to use. I have been able to get some decent growth, but I really hit the gym hard in my 20s. Life got in the way but if you spend 10hrs a week working out you will grow. I was not a monster but I was very in shape and had a ton of mass. I did not know any better and was looking for a wife lol. This Similar experience. I have like beginner/intermediate gains. Easy to see my gym partners lift way more.  I have been lifting for 3 years semi regularly (3 times a week). I have defiantly built muscle and look decently aesthetic. I am trying to build a good base for my body to rely on for decades. I am without a doubt sure I would build more muscle without CMT, but i have put on decent lean muscle. Barely 5\u201910 about 165lbs for reference. I am roughly high teens in body fat. \n\n\nIt is getting to the point where my gym partner is getting quite a bit stronger in the same amount of time. We both have similar body type and body size. He and I both know it is the CMT that puts me at a disadvantage. Us CMT peeps have to work hard for results that is for sure. Do not let that stop any of you though. \n\nLifting weights has really made my life better. More confident, feel better, sleep better, look better. Taught me discipline too.  \n\nAs far as info on how to build muscle. YouTube. That is it. Heck fitness Tiktok is good too . Split up your muscles groups and lift close to your max output for repetitions. 45-90 minutes seems optimal for lifting sessions.  \n\nI have never squatted a ton. Generally the only exercise I avoid haha. Feels weird and off balance for me as I am sure it does for almost all here. Definitely do not skip legs though, just mimic the squats power with other exercises more suited to our strengths. Pace yourself when you start. Do not jump right in. Maybe give atomic habits a read!! Has a great section on slowly but surely ramping up the activity frequency till it becomes a habit", "Does anyone here have Cmt type 2 spontaneous mutation  I have 2A I have 2D as a spontaneous mutation Doc said type 2. Nobody in my immediate family has it. My grandfather (likely) and his brother (confirmed) are the only others in a very large family. So then what are your symptoms u deal with? A spontaneous mutation? Severe weakness in my hands and legs. I wear leg braces and have to work out all the time to have enough strength to walk correctly. I get nerve pain. Stuff like that", " Starting IVF! Me and my partner have our first face-to-face appointment with a geneticist today.  I am feeling pretty good about it but not really sure what is going to happen. \n\nIs there anyone else in the UK who is gone through this process? Is there anything I should really be asking or be aware of? I have not yet but I informed my former doctor that I would like to and she was super excited for me and my partner! Just the thought of a healthy offspring warms my mind and I cannot wait.\n\nWe are in the UK too! I do not have any advice other than have patience and I am crossing my fingers for ya! I know exactly what you mean. The thought of it being gone from future generations... so glad it is possible.\n\nThe referral was pretty fast. I am only a little ahead of you so I do not know if I can pass on much I have learnt. \n\nI did provide a family tree listing who had CMT and other medical conditions, which they said was useful. \n\nOne thing that might hold us up is that I do not have any paperwork with my diagnosis on and they are struggling to find it. It is not massive; I have had another blood test today but it can take up to two months to come back. If you can find anything, I would recommend keeping it handy. \n\nGood luck!

The most important answer: We have a 3yr old and a 7mth old. \nSecond most important: it was 10000% worth it Good luck to you! It is so worth it Congrats! \nWe are due for a healthy PIGD boy in October - we got our referral in 2017 so patience is key.

That is amazing, congratulations! How did you both find it?\n\n When I saw the geneticist a couple of weeks ago, we were offered Guy's or a private clinic in Nottingham. We opted to Nottingham because it is much closer and they seem super keen for us to start (they said it could be as little as 12 weeks when they get everything they need).  I honestly have no idea how long it is going to take us now.", " Podiatrists Keep Mentioning CMT? CW: Undiagnosed and asymptomatic. \n\nHey all,\n\nI hope this is okay to post. I (28M) have seen two podiatrists now and they both have mentioned the possibility of CMT nearly right away. I have high arches (not incredibly high, just high) and hammer toes, but otherwise no signs of any muscular weakness. I get blood in my toes from running and being on blood thinners, and ankle sprains/normal injuries from exercise, but again that all seems normal to me. I was told by the second podiatrist that it is just procedural for them whenever they see someone with high arches, but nevertheless it is quite disconcerting. \n\nI had a work up done initially when the first podiatrist mentioned it and the neurologist was like \u201cI have no clue why you are here but I will humor her and do the tests.\u201d He did a nerve conduction study, along with reflex and balance tests, and the findings were normal. I have some latency in my left and right tibial h-reflexes, but he was not concerned at all. I am a kickboxer and have spent years deadening my shins intentionally so they would be less sensitive, so that may play a role as well. \n\nI had an mri of the brain done that came back \u201cunremarkable\u201d, and have probably had every blood test known to man done over the last two years. I think part of the second podiatrist\u2019s concern was that I am quite stoic when it comes to pain and she initially thought I did not feel it? I feel pain just fine (had two toenails removed, do not recommend), I just do not make it obvious. Occasionally, like any other person my toes can get cold or go numb if I am doing something like jumping rope for a long period of time, but that is about it. Another thing to note is that my dad (67M) has high arches and hammer toes, too, but neither of my parents have CMT. \n\nAnyway, I hope this is not insensitive to post. I just do not know who to turn to. I have severely high health anxiety and it alarms me that both podiatrists jumped to the same conclusion. I presume it is out of an abundance of caution and that the correlation is not direct, but naturally it is disconcerting. Exercise is the only thing that has kept me going throughout the toughest years of my life and I dont know what I would do without it. \n\nSo, with all of that, is it possible to have CMT and not know it? Especially after having all the tests come back negative? Or Is this just something I should expect to be brought up with any new podiatrist I see, just because it ticks their initial boxes off? \n\nHere is a link to the neurologist\u2019s test if that helps any:  *whom* to turn to Someone with more information might be able to chime in, but you may be able to do a genetic test if it is bothering you and you want more confirmation. \n\nAs far as exercise goes, the progression of CMT really varies person by person, and there are lots of exercise solutions even for people living with it. So I would not stress the result too much\u2014and just focus on staying active.  \n\n\nI am going to drop a link below with more information.  \n( With normal nerve conduction, reflexes, and balance tests you are almost certainly fine. You could have a genetic test done if it really bothers you but even if you did have a genetic predisposition for CMT the fact that it is undetectable in neurological testing at your age would mean that you do not really have anything to worry about. \n\nA genetic test would be helpful only for your mental health, if this keeps bothering you, or for family planning if you think you could be a carrier and wish to rule it out before having children. Otherwise, I would just tell future podiatrists who bring it up that you have been tested and it is not an issue. My CMT remained undiagnosed until I had a genetoc test done and they found a mutation in my sord gene. So like u/NixyeNox said, if you are really worried about it, a genetic test may be the way to go. Helped me at least Were you presenting symptoms? This was really helpful, thank you! Yes since I was about 13 or so. And I got diagnosed when I was 21 I am not sure that is a certainty. I did not have symptoms until I was in my 30s. But f you can walk on your toes and walk on your heels and really have no weakness? It seems like there is nothing to worry about right now. You could future trip about it but why? There are few certainties in life but I think there is a big difference between not having symptoms versus having normal nerve conduction and other neurological tests. It may not be CMT. I would ask the neurologist and podiatrist to look into what I have. HNPP could be more likely. HNPP unlike CMT comes and goes. As people say get the blood work genetic testing done. If you come back with a pmp 22 duplication cmt if its a depletion its hnpp. The only remaining test is a genetic test, but if you can run and have this balance, along with no family history and normal nerve velocity and no issues at 28 then I really think you are fine and they just want to milk your insurance. I do not think I have any reason to suggest HNPP. I am not presenting any symptoms at all.", "If anyone is interested the show Elementary season 5 episode 19 had an episode about CMT.

Can someone help me?", "EMG How often are you guys getting EMG's? I feel like within the 4 years I was diagnosed and to now I have progressed a decent amount. I read somewhere (I forget) that we should be getting them done yearly to every two years. I go for a new patient appointment with a new neuro because I am unsatisfied with my previous neuro. Just seeing if I should bring up EMG testing? I had not heard of that 1-2 year timeframe before. I have only had two over the last 34 years since I was diagnosed. And one was when I started going to the MDA Clinic here 3 years ago. I have had two annual appointments since and it is never been brought up. I am not even sure of what value it would be? Well, I was diagnosed in 2016 at 21. Since then, my ankles have gotten so much weaker and now my knees are horrible. The neuro that I am currently trying to get away from just said \"yeah from your muscles not working right...try to rest and avoid stairs\". Well no crap. That is why I am seeing second opinion to see if maybe AFO's would help or not. I am the first of the family with CMT so I do not really have any idea on how this stuff goes and my neuro sucks. I have only ever had one. The only thing that it would be useful for, after getting a diagnosis, would maybe be to monitor your progression, and there are many other ways you can do that. I do not think it is at all necessary to do every few years in most circumstances (I am sure there are exceptions). Thank you! I hope I am satisfied with this new doctor. Only ever had 3 in my life, over a span of 18ish years. Last time was for my pregnancy, which was not worth doing, in my opinion. Yeah, it might show progression, but so can symptoms. You can ask your neuro, but I do not think it necessarily required. I only had them done when I was younger and we were not sure what kind of peripheral neuropathy it was. Did not enjoy them. It was a unique sort of pain. I definitely would not want to have it done on a regular basis, but I believe it is just a diagnostic tool. Thank you! They are pointless if you are already diagnosed with CMT. There is no treatment or cure right now, so going through that pain to see how you have progressed incrementally seems like unneeded stress and a waste of a day.\nI have heard of neuros wanting EMGs because they want to track the patient's CMT out of curiosity/personal case study. That will be a no from me dawg If you are questioning whether you need braces than the answer is yes if the question is already in your mind. Other than the triple arthrodesis surgeries I had on both legs when I was a teen it is the most powerful \"treatment\" I have ever had.\n\nI first got AFO's when I was 11 and they made a huge difference in my life. Without them, I cannot walk a block. With them it is as far as my body can endure. The central question is whether you should get AFO's though. You probably have enough strength to get something like Blue Rockers:  (\n\nI tried them 6 years ago for a few years and unfortunately, my muscles are just too far gone for them and AFO's are what I went back too. But, go with the Blue Rockers first because it is better for your muscles in your leg in that you lose less over time than you do with AFO's (due to non usage.) Thank you so much! How do I go about getting my Dr to say \"hey let us do braces or something for stability\". I am not sure if it was only my original neuro that was avoiding it or what. So I am kind of nervous bringing it back up. I just feel so helpless because like you said, I can walk a block and that is about it. I was pregnant in 2018 and since then, I feel like my symptoms have just been horrible. Have you experienced this? Thank you! Very. Numbness spread around my pelvis, cannot feel to much of anything. Episodes have gotten worse and more frequent. Bladder control/ the feeling of needing to go is worse, sad to admit. Tingling, pain, numbness, throughout. Overall, definitely progressed. My daughter kepts me on my toes though; strong enough to pick her up, bend down, I even ran because she almost flung herself from her highchair, but that is aside from CMT. The OBGYN I had said progression from pregnancy was inevitable, but can vary in severity. Would definitely visit your obgyn more, if possible; since having her, I can no longer feel pain or discomfort as I mentioned, which led to an array of problems. Yes! I have a problem with my pelvic floor. Well that is what I was told. I have horrible pain all in that area. I have not lost all of my baby weight so I am wondering if the extra weight is causing my symptoms to be so much worse. Not OP but I can tell you that it is generally known to be a thing that one can get worse with pregnancy, either temporarily or permanently. It is both mentioned in medical literature (as I recall but it is been years so I cannot call up a citation right now) and also a thing I have seen with members of my own family. I have only ever had one as part of the diagnostic process over 20 years ago. I do not see a neurologist regularly either. I am fortunate enough to have a family doctor who is familiar with CMT and my symptoms have been relatively mild. Thank you! What is the length of symptoms to be considered temporary vs. permanently? It is been 2 years now since becoming pregnant. I do not really know what the maximum time frame is temporary symptoms. All I know is that I feel like I was hit by a train all day long, then night is the worst. My impression is that \"temporary\" in this context means that they would resolve once the pregnancy hormones got back to normal. I do not see any reason to get an EMG if you already have a diagnosis. Last time my doc ordered one I said, \u201cHow would the results of this change my course of treatment,\u201d The answer was that they would not. So why should I pay hundreds and hundreds of dollars for the test, take the time to do it, and suffer the annoyance of it? Weight can be a factor, but not entirely. I had my daughter in late 2018, and my weight has fluctuated alot, but that never seemed to affect my cmt all to much, nothing noticeable in pain at least. Most dr\u2019s are happy to help if you bring it up. Ive even had family dr\u2019s write rx\u2019s. Though, sometimes depending on the dr they will refer you to a neurologist or orthopedic dr. It is nothing to be nervous about. They are generally happy to help you in this kind of thing because it is a \u201csolution \u201c of sorts.\n\nIf you are unsure about how to go about this with Dr\u2019s and insurance contact an ortho place like Hanger and ask them what you need to do to get braces. Those places are eager to help you because they want your business.\n\nThe RX is the easiest part of the process. Insurance on the other hand... Neuro's are not necessarily the ones who deal with AFO's. I had a referral loop of neuro, \"rehabilitationist\", physio, OT, orthotist. And the last one does the AFOs. Neuro only went as far as noting mobility issues and referring to someone who deals with those symptoms.   \n\n\nThere is another recent thread discussing how frequently people see a neuro, and a common trend was noting that they diagnose, but do not really treat. It could be different in the states where they want to collect insurance money, but here in Canada you only get one for diagnosis purposes. It is possible that after years pass or if your symptoms were much worse, you would need another but there is really no purpose. It is definitely not something you *have* to do. \n\nI personally have not done an EMG for a few years because I do not like needles. But I like to do nerve conduction tests to keep track of a baseline. I do this because I have witnessed doctors look at my mom and be like \"Welp your issue is CMT\" when it is clearly not CMT and does not line up with her symptoms (she was actually asymptomatic at the time). \n\nI keep my baseline so if one day I suddenly cannot feel my foot completely I know what a \"healthy\" nerve study looks on me, and I know how quickly/slowly I progress. To me it is just more information, and more information is more power. \n\nJust thought I would give my own perspective. But also, with that, I am only 23 and my symptoms are pretty mild. Drop foot, leg cramps, a little bit of tingling, but that is mostly it. No leg braces and definitely do not visibly have an issue. I am expecting it to get worse so I want to stay on top of it. EMG's are not a treatment, it is a painful test doctors use to test your nerve conductivity. I have not had one in nearly 10 years. If you are already diagnosed, then there is no reason to go through that pain unless your life is in danger or your insurance company is trying to stop your income saying \"you have had time to recover therefore we have determined you are all better now.\" I have had to have repeated EMG's in the past because of the latter, but since I tested positive for CMT2a on a DNA test I have not needed to.", "Help me narrow down my type?

I am looking for help figuring out what type of CMT I have as I cannot afford to get tested (no insurance) and I have a hard time understanding all of the medical jargon involved in the different diagnoses and subtypes.

My uncle passed it down to three of his six kids, and my father passed it to me but not my sister. It is an even 50/50 split in my family. \n\nWe have all shown signs in very early childhood, most notably walking on tip toes instead of flat feet, but my case has always been most severe and I could not walk at all until after my second birthday. I have got hammer toes, a high arch, decreased sensation, pain, lack of balance, lack of functions like running and jumping, and I twist my ankle often. I also have very weak grip in my hands.\n\nI know this is an odd request and CMT is a very broad disorder but I am trying to learn as much as I can about myself. If anyone has any ideas what subtype I might fall under please let me know!  Based on the fact that it passes equally from men and women, it is not X-linked (not CMT-X).\n\nBased on the fact that it seems to pass to about half of the children in a decent sized sample it is probably a dominant gene. \n\nUnfortunately, that still leaves a lot of possibilities. Odds are decent that it is CMT1A since that is the most common type and is a single dominant gene so it matches what you have said above, but there is a definite chance it could be one of the others.  \n\nDistinguishing between types based on symptoms is impractical--there is a reason why all these subtypes only became known as being different with the advent of genetic testing. There is more variation in symptoms within a type than between different types. \n\nIf anyone in your family who has CMT gets the genetic test done the odds are very high that you all have the same type, so you would not necessarily need to get it done yourself. \n\nNarrowing down the subtype does not necessarily make the testing less expensive: I knew I had CMT1A but medical records were lost and I had to get the test redone to get a piece of paper saying it and they told me it was easier and cheaper to run the test for all the common varieties than to do CMT1A specifically because they are already set up to run together. This could vary based on testing company.  Thank you so much for your help! I guess I will probably just never know, but thank you for helping me. I was confused because in my research a lot of the types said that symptoms develop and are diagnosed in adolescence, but in my family they have always been apparent around the age of two or so. Is that not as important of a factor as I originally thought? There are a lot of generalizations made when people try to sum up how this disease manifests into the sort of stuff that makes for easy to read articles. If you want to start a thread asking people what age they got diagnosed and with what type, it might be interesting and show some of that diversity. A lot of factors can effect the age of diagnosis, though. Some people go for many years with symptoms impacting their lives but they do not have a doctor who thinks to check for CMT, so age at which symptoms became apparent would also be good to ask. \n\nMy own family is a study in the variability of how CMT1A can show up. My grandmother had it: did not so much as use a cane until she was in her mid 80s. My mother: had it and was in a wheelchair by 60. My sibling has it, was in a wheelchair by 30. I have it, am still walking fine in my 40s. Despite the fact I have a mild case my parents knew about it when I was quite young because they knew to look for it. \n\nAll that said, it probably **does** mean something that so many of you had an early onset and relatively severe symptoms. However, it is very hard to say **what** it means. Does it indicate a specific subtype or is there a different genetic factor that you all have in common that makes it worse? My background is in biology but I am not a doctor and that is as far as I can speculate. \n\nOne thing I can tell you: CMT manifests predictably over the course of a given person's life. As good or bad as your symptoms may be, they will unfold in a slow, consistent way. You may not be able to name your subtype, but you know that you have your family's type and that gives you a certain roadmap for how your disease will progress, for good or for ill. \n\nCMT sucks in a lot of ways but sudden progression is not one of those ways. If you find yourself thinking \"wow, my CMT suddenly started progressing faster\" you should get checked to see if there is something else (like diabetes) going on. \n\n  \n\n&amp;#x200B; My brother and I both have CMT. We were diagnosed with Type 2 however that is just from observation. They have been unable to match us with any known gene markers. So just FYI, even if you were to get genetically tested, there is no guarantee you will have a known one. \n\nWith our type two we walked on the sides of our feet, not the toes. My brother had it happen younger than me. Around 3-4. For me it started to affect me around 6-7. Not sure if that helps narrow it.  Interesting, thank you. I actually walk on the sides of my feet now that I have gotten older, but as far as I can tell no one else in my family does. I have had a few surgeries (tendon transfer, triple arthrodesis, hammer toe straightening) and thought those might have been the cause of it, so it is interesting to me to know that it might just be related to the CMT itself.  I think I am definitely going to try and get my family together to sit down and discuss our symptoms and see if we can get a general idea of what our CMT does and means for us, and hopefully that can be helpful for us and for our future generations who may end up being affected. Thank you so much for all of your help!", "Career Ideas for people with CMT I have been in customer service for over 5 years. I really dislike it. I decided to make a career change and get a CDL. Remarkably and surprisingly I passed the DOT Physical (but to be fair, it was mainly bloodwork, eye sight, hearing, etc., minimal physical evaluation). I just got my permit and have passed all the classroom testing. Monday I start the actual driving. I am not so worried about driving as I am standing (it is a class of 9 and we are going to be outside starting Monday). I already told the teacher what my issue is and that I will probably bring a chair. \n\nLong story short, I am probably making a rash decision but I need to get out of customer service (anxiety). The CDL physical is only good for 2 years so I have told myself I am going to do this for at least this long and then reevaluate. \n\nI want to make money and feel like I am being productive but with CMT I feel like my options are limited. I do not know what career to pursue. On top of the physical ails of CMT I also get pretty bad social anxiety and do not like working in an office setting. I feel like I am in a corner. I am married with a mortgage so the added pressure to provide is stressful (my wife works too). \n\nI am curious what career options people with CMT have pursued. Looking for a lifeline.  No suggestions but best of luck on your new path. Thank you kindly A job that does not require strenous and/or repetetive physical labour and that is not an office job sounds like a dream job to me. I do not have any suggestions, but I can say what the people in my family that have had CMT have worked with. I work in an office doing computer stuff, my mother worked in a bank in the 70s and then as a letter sorter for the postal service for the rest of her work life. My grandmother worked in a linen factory I believe, but stopped working when she had kids. My great grandfather  on my mothers side worked in a molybdenum mine before WW2, and also as a lumberjack I believe. I guess he must have had a very mild precentation.. I am trying to pursue something in CADD or graphic design. I am an office body but anxiety is a problem when working in groups. There are work from home jobs my mom sends to me alot, but I want more. Neiman Marcus, CVS, Walmart, and others all have work from home jobs. Trying to do jobs on base (manual labor but they accommodate) are fun, mainly the main exchange or trying for civilan DoD jobs are not all strenuous. There are rehabilitation centers that help people with mobility or movement issues get work or help us take classes to excel and go into other job professions that are career oriented. My dad (also has cmt) did this for accounting and has been at his job for over 15+ years. I would suggest you address this strategically. Your health (physical and mental), work history, skill sets, experience, age, education, and many more variables play significant factors in your paths forward. \n\nYou do not have to do this alone. And you should not try to! There are professionals that you can consult either through various government programs or social programs. You can also utilize the career counseling services of your local community colleges.\n\nBased on a few things you said, I am going to make a few assumptions. 1. I am going to guess you are under or about 30 years old. 2. You do not want to hear, Go back to school.\n\nI apologize if either of these 2 assumptions are incorrect.\n\nAs far as #2, for those of us with CMT, life is just that much more difficult. Even more so for those of us who are also challenged career wise as they get older and their work options narrow due to physical limitations. Give yourself and your family every possible advantage and give yourself the advantage of training in a career path via a community college, a tech school or a traditional 4 year school. Whatever you do, we are in the age of continuous learning and education. The age of getting a degree and moving on is dead. We are in the age of constantly reinventing oneself or being left behind.\n\nI know you can do it! Good Luck! Very interesting. The only people in my family that I know have it are myself, my brother and my cousin. I have the \u201cworst\u201d case but even at that is it not as severe as some so I am thankful. It is still very limiting, of course. The last person who we believe had it was my great great grandpa. It skipped a few generations. Great advice, thank you. Thank you, great insight. I am not averse to going to school, I just do not know for what exactly. I need to think outside the box and get creative. CDL is just a quick fix and even then there is no guarantee I will be able to continue doing it for long. The joys of CMT lol Well done on the career change, I would say you made a great decision and you have not let CMT limit you but sensibly chose a sitting down job.  In two years you will have another physical and it will be the same as this one - no great shakes.\n\nKeep on truckin' good buddy! Do you know what type you have? Although there are many genetic types of CMT, no type can actually skip generations. The only types that can *appear* to skip a generation are the recessive types, but genetically they have still been passed on even in the generation with no symptoms if the CMT did reemerge in subsequent generations. If it appeared to skip a generation and it is a recessive genotype then both parents would have had the same recessive type and they then would have had a 25% chance of passing along the gene. Another even more rare way something like this could happen is if the CMT was not passed on but then two generations down the line the person developed the same or a similar looking type through a *de novo* mutation. The most likely scenario would simply be that the symptoms were so mild that it went unnoticed. It is not uncommon that the disease severity varies between members in a family, with some of the milder forms going unnoticed in some individuals. My great grandfather is a good example, I could definitely not do some of the stuff he did. According to my grandfather he never showed any symptoms besides having thinner legs than most though, yet he was diagnosed with fairly high accuracy in the late 60s so we are fairly certain he must have had it. Thank you :) I do not know/recall which type I have (I was diagnosed about 20 years ago). Saying \u201cskipped\u201d was a poor word choice on my part. From what I recall the Doctor used precisely the word you did, \u201crecessive\u201d and \u201ccarrier\u201d. Both my mom and grandma were carriers and did not have symptoms. My mom was the first to have boys in a few generations. Apparently the form I have is recessive in women (they are carriers). That is not to say women cannot have had symptoms. They said if I father a boy, he will not have symptoms. But if I father a girl, she will be a carrier and if she has a boy *he will* be symptomatic. I do not know if that is unique to my type of CMT but only boys in my family have it. And even with that, it is a luck of the draw. I have 4 other cousins, same bloodline, none have symptoms. Since diagnosis (in San Francisco) I have was re-examined at Stanford 5 years ago and then at Cedars-Sinai in L.A. last year. From your description, it seems like you have one of the X-linked recessive types of CMTX, either CMTX2, 3, 4 or 5! I took a job with the state. Good benefits and healthcare coverage.", "I have always wanted a tattoo, just never knew what to get. I have had an idea recently related to the day I was diagnosed, the first time I heard of CMT. My Dr was a friend of my band mate, he was a real casual, funny guy. So I go through the whole process, and on the day he tells me what I have, he says \u201cYou have got CMT, also called Country Music Television.\u201d I lost it laughing. So I think I want to get a Country Music Television logo tattoo. I was thinking ( Texts, colors and all. Love it. That is a fun one! I used to preemptively tell people I did not meant county music television to lighten things up. I think it is a really good idea Looks really good, you should definitely get it Yes. Amazing idea! :) Ok now you have got me thinking\u2026 I have wanted a tattoo for a long time and have some piecemeal ideas of what I would want in it. Maybe I could work in some kind of representation of pmp22, anybody versed in genetics know of a graphical representation of a gene that could be used in some form? I was also considering something myelin related.", "I Need to Ask Some 'Delicate' Questions Male, 66, Live Alone, 2 Story Townhouse, Full Baths and Bedrooms Upstairs, tiny 'powder room' downstairs.\n\nMisdiagnosed for at least 7 years. Johns Hopkins Neurologist totally blew it in 2007. Told me to lose weight and get help with depression. An EMG was conducted by a local Neuro, results, 'this is an abnormal study' could be this, or this or this,... needs more follow up. The J. Hopkins Neuro just sent me home to lose weight and get un-depressed. \n\nNow here is where I am.  I was scheduled to see the Neuro, Dr. Sherrer at Penn Med in Philly the end of May. Received a call telling me I had been 'CoVidded', my term, meaning, rescheduled until December 2020. Well more than a year, about 16 months, since CMT 2D was confirmed via genetic testing.\n\nI have been more than SEVEN years without any kind of Neuro involvement due to the J.Hopkins screw up. I have NO ONE to ask these questions of and I am TERRIFIED!\n\nMy concern right now is my arms and hands. Particularly, my right arm and hand. My dominant arm and hand. It is more and more feeling tingling, numb, heavy, thick, dead.\n\nRecent EMG of the arms said, ... Moderate to Severe ... Spoke of demylinating ...\n\nFor those who know, or have similar, or if you could get me an 'in' with a Neuro that knows something about this, \n\nWhat am I looking at? How quickly does this deteriorate? How bad does it get? Will I be able to do normal daily things but at a much reduced capacity? Will I be able to feed myself, wash myself, do those personal daily bathroom things myself? ....\n\nAll those questions and more. I am sorry if this is indelicate, I really have NO ONE to talk with about this. No on I can ask, No neurologist of any skill, local or specialist and I have nothing by overwhelming fear and terror on a daily and nightly basis.\n\nI do have an appointment with a different neuro September 4th, but honestly, I really do not know if my legs, which are almost gone, let alone my arms and hands which are scaring me to death, will last that long. \n\nHonestly, there is no one in any medical capacity, not even my pain med dr, who is awesome, can help me with this.\n\nCan you please help me if you can? Or know someone that can? Or know someone that knows someone?\n\nMuch appreciated. Scared as hell, IdiopathicHell is my user name because if fits. \n\nThank you!\n\nEDIT: I forgot to ask, is it typical, 'normal' for the dominant hand and arm to go first? Are there things I should be doing, no doing, to preserve the right arm and hand longer?... It really depends on the type of CMT you have even that can change slightly person to person... that is assuming you have it. I think most people here would be hesitant to diagnose someone else. I know that is not helpful and I hope someone here can help you find someone to diagnose you correctly. My suggestion would be to go through all the side bar resources. Have immediate family had the same problems to your knowledge?  \n\n\n\\*my comment of \"That is assuming you have it.\" is meant as... It could be something completely different... not trying to be dismissive There is another recent thread on here talking about people seeing neuros. One point mentioned is that they do not do much beyond the diagnosis. Deterioration is incredibly individualistic, so they cannot really graph is out and predict. Instead of focusing so hard on seeing the neuro, look into something like physio or OT&gt; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; What am I looking at? How quickly does this deteriorate? How bad does it get? Will I be able to do normal daily things but at a much reduced capacity? Will I be able to feed myself, wash myself, do those personal daily bathroom things myself?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA neuro will not answer this. If you are at 66 and still doing most things normally, you are probably on a good track. OT can help with things that maintain independence. Modify the house if stairs are an issue, grab rails in the bathroom, small daily changes like buying prechopped veges if your hands are struggling with the big knife. OT's can be handy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPhysio can help with preservation. I would not feel comfortable giving any suggestions as there is mixed research out atm about over doing it causing more problems (but more sciency sounding).   \n\n\nYou seem to be new to reddit (or new alt) and, forgive the delicacy, freaking out with a lot of new information. If you want to chat it out less formally, there is a chat room if you want to try that. I am sorry to hear that the healthcare system really seems to be failing you, that is just awful. Unfortunately, deterioration in CMT is impossible to predict. Some folk are troubled by it early on but never really get worse, some go most of there lives with almost no symptoms but experience a sharp decline suddenly, and others just experience a slow decline. It sounds like you have been doing pretty well for your age but it is getting a bit worse.\nI am glad to hear you might eventually get some guidance but the main thing you can do yourself is physio. Even something as simple as one of those grip-strengthening gadgets can help keep you from dropping things (like I do), light weights and calisthenics can help maintain muscle and stretching is always important. If you can get in to see a physiotherapist they can be a big help!\nAs for what you will be able to do, we do not know about your personal conditions but the good news is there is a million things out there designed to make life with physical impairment easier. If you want, an occupational therapist can offer very helpful tips and tricks to make little things easier. I have a gadget for just about everything from opening jars to doing up buttons and tying shoe laces. With CMT I have come to learn that you can adapt and overcome anything with a little help.\nThe most important thing is do not despair. CMT is a challenge but it is by no means limiting. You should be able to do everything you have always done albeit with more difficulty or slower. It might mean taking more breaks when exercising or finding new ways of doing things but you will still be in control. \nI really hope you are making some progress with your mental wellness! Hopefully this relieves a bit of the pressure and fear of the unknown that you must be facing. Please reach out if you have any questions or just need to talk. We are here to look out for each other! I will be positive with you and give you the comment several neurologists have told me, \"If you are going to get a *Neuromuscular*  disease, this is the one you would want...\"\n\nOf course, that comment is really of no comfort to us, but, let me tell you, it does beat having Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (I had several friends decades ago who died of it) Or ALS.\n\nYour life will probably be disrupted at least on a minor level. Since you did not find this until you are older your progression has been extremely slow.\n\nMaybe it will put you in a wheelchair eventually. But, even if that were to happen, you would still have your mind and still be able to function fairly normally other than with your legs and maybe weaker hands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProbably sounds scary. But, it could be a lot worse. Thank you for the info and passing on the neuro's info. My legs, I believe, are dying as a result of yet another genetic abnormality,: Dominant Distal Hereditary Motor NeuropathyType 7. But, I have no idea if CMT is in the legs as well. Could be, I guess? OR does CMT 2D most often manifest in the arms and hands?\n\nWithin the last 2-3 weeks, the last 3-4 days, the pain, numbness, tingling, heaviness in my right arm, hand has increased in duration, pain, frequency. I am trying to get a handle on where I am, progression wise. What do, have does, your specialist do if anything to measure, track, record, ... your or anyones, rate of decline or whatever?\n\nForgot to mention, the genetic variant mentioned above for the legs, the genetic counselor also said it can, has been known to. cause vocal paralysis. \n\nJust trying to get a handle on this.\n\nDo you see someone locally AND a cmt specialist? ANY. ANY! suggestions as to how I can get them to see me or talk to me or my pain dr before sept. 4?\n\nThanks again for the response. I am assuming you are the poster previously known as awwman\\_ which I mention because I went back and saw that awwman\\_ had replied to a comment with more detailed genetic information. If this is not you, disregard this comment :P\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have tried to look up information on each of your three problem genes. I do not know if you should play the lottery or just really avoid lightening storms but each of your three mutations has an estimated probability of around 1 in a million. The chances of having all three together are really, really small. This is relevant because there will probably not be any record of anyone else having these three genes occur together unless there is someone else in your family with similar problems. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first of the genes, HSAN VI, is marked as a recessive gene in the literature I have found. Hopefully your one good copy of this gene suffices to make the impact of this one unimportant. This gene is associated with skin problems (blisters, skin ulcers) as well as neuromuscular issues. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second one is the CMT type 2D which we are more familiar with here, although it is itself one of the more rare types of CMT. Like other forms of CMT it tends to impact feet before hands as it shows up first in the most distal parts of your body aka the further from your brain a body part is the sooner/more it is affected. It is not a hard and fast rule though; there are CMT folks who see affects in their hands first. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe third gene, HSAN type 7 is a bit of the opposite of CMT2D in that it is a neuropathy which typically affects the hands first before the feet. I believe this is also called Harper-Young Myopathy and I had somewhat better luck finding information under that name. The symptoms of this are said to be similar to CMT type 2C.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe digging I have done has yielded very little practical information. I agree with what others have said about finding a good physical therapist and occupational therapist, hopefully ones specializing in neuromuscular disorders. PTs and OTs are, in my experience, practical folks who can have you try various interventions and objectively assess what works for you and what does not. Despite the complexity of your problems from a medical standpoint the practical interventions are likely to be similar to other CMT folks or other neuromuscular disorder folks. This is a good thing because they can apply their general knowledge of similar problems to help you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other thing I would suggest is that you look into a way to move to a home that does not have stairs. You might get by OK for some time where you are now but plan for an uncertain future. You may find the stairs impossible to navigate later, whether next year or a decade from now and it will be a lot harder to move at that point than it would be to move now. If your progression is anything like what I am familiar with stairs will be a problem long before being able to feed yourself. Washing yourself might be easy except that you have to climb the stairs to reach the shower. Stairs are the bane of my existence and if you can get them out of your life I suggest you do so. Thanks for the response and words of encouragement. Even typing this is uncomfortable, not quite painful but definitely feel discomfort.  I am scared of not being able to handle my private personal care. And scared of being locked in a body with arms, feet, legs, hands, and potentially, unable to speak. I have no specialist that will talk to me or even my pain mngt specialist.\n\nDo you, or anyone have ANY ideas, suggestions, as to how I can drive my issues to higher awareness in reddit and hopefully the attention of those who can make calls, contacts, .... on my behalf?\nI have waited my turn for these visits, a very. very, very long wait. I am not asking for anything special. Just that I have declined so rapidly and because of medical mistakes that were made by specialist my conditions were not diagnosed for more than 7 years.\n\nI was scheduled to see a cmt specialist an a center of excellence in Philadelphia on may 27th but because of covid that appointment was pushed until december. I honestly feel, without any hype, I wont make it that long.\n\nI waited my turn and then covid came to the world. The media is talking about nothing but covid. I know there are many more like me that have been thrown away and forgotten thanks to covid and the medias insatiable appetite for FREEEEE dramatization to drive up their ratings.  \n\nAny suggestions as to how I can use reddit to drive this problem to a greater awareness to hopefully gain attention of media or specialist or anyone that might be able to do something?\n\nThanks again! Thank you for your response and info. Much appreciated. Yes, the progression was slow. Always there, always blamed on my extremely flat feet. Yes, I know, cmt usually states high arches. While the progression **WAS** slow it has picked up great speed the last 24 months. The last 2-3 months even faster, the last 2-3 weeks, EXTREMELY FAST DECLINE. My right hand and arm are constantly painful. Constantly tingling. Constantly moving from a kind of numbness, kind of heaviness, kind of dead weight. Folding my hands, my fingers, an loosely closed hand in uncomfortable, not quite painful. A more tightly closed hand is harder to tolerate and the fingers and hand no longer fold or unfold fluidly.\n\nWhat was a slow progression has gained rapid speed very quickly. A reply above notes the addition of yet another genetic variant that is killing the distal leg and feet muscles. The dorsal reflex of the left foot is totally gone, the dorsal reflex of the right foot is almost gone. Wont be long before I will not be able to drive. Maybe not be able to walk. The left foot is more like a piece of flappy rubber attached to a kind of flappy leg.\n\nI do not know if I have cmt in my legs as well or if it just this other horrible neuro wasting type 7 disease.\n\nJust trying to understand if my hands are going to be as useless as my feet. Can I wash myself? Do my own bathroom biz? Do I even want to let it get that far? I have no clue. I do know, I do not want to let it get a point where I cannot take measures because my hands, fingers, arms no longer work.\n\nYou mentioned a chat room? Where, is that? \n\nThanks again Thanks for the response and insights. The genetic test shows 3 genetic variants. the 2nd variant, as stated on the genetic test summary report by the genetic counselor states:\n\n\"Dominate CMT type 2D\"\n\nThanks again. I completely skipped over that line, sorry. Yes, NixyeNox, I am awwman_. The awwman_ account was set up years ago and the name was taken from one of the animal groups, aww. I am a big animal lover and an old male, hence, awwman_.\nI opened this account recently because my decline has accelerated drastically in a very short period of time. And it has consumed my every waking, and attempted sleeping moment. I wanted to separate the accounts where I enjoy animals, art, the good things of life that make me smile, happy,  and not have this part of my life contaminated with this hell I am now struggling to understand and to decide what to do with.\n\nYou really are a blessing and I am grateful for all you have done. You have provided more help, insights, information, .... than any of the doctors that have seen me in the last 12-14 years. Other than my most excellent pain management doctor, who is the only one that even came close to a diagnosis, and drove this entire nightmare to the genetic testing that has put some context to what it happening. And now you have moved the ball forward even more. I will be sending your findings to my pain management dr and hopefully, between her and I, maybe we can come up with a way to get in to see a specialized neuro or talk with them via phone before my first appointment on September 4.\n\nAs far as the lottery goes, I can say with great certainty, the only thing this genetic cluster does is drive away the good things and attract the bad. Lightning storms are the least of my worries. What I have learned in almost 66 years is that if there is a rouge, deep-space asteroid destined to find a target, those once in a generation, once in 100, 1,000, 100,000, 1,000,000,000, ... years, it will find me! Life experiences are what they are.\n\nThe 3rd variant, I think, is the one that is scaring me the most right now. I forget exactly what I wrote under the other post, and my hands are aching right now, but here is an excerpt.\n\n\"We discussed our particular concern regarding SLC5A7 variant. We explained that this particular variant results in a stop codon, which in many instances would constitute a mutation.Distal hereditary motor neuropathy type 7 (HMN7) typically manifest with primarily distal neuropathy and muscle wasting. Vocal paresis has been reported in this condition. We stressed that this VUS (I don;t know what that means) does not constitute a diagnosis of HMN7. However continued contact with a genetic specialist regarding the classification of this variant would be beneficial.\"\n\nThe counselor stressed the importance of longterm followup with a neuromuscular specialist.\n\n\nI am scared this is much more than CMT. I am scared my arms and hands will become what my left foot currently is what my right foot almost is, nothing more than a flappy piece of rubber attached to a limp dead or dying leg. AND I am terrified I will be unable to speak.\nI did that. The specialist she recommended. The neuro specialist, at best speaks broken conversational english. She is from Spain. She can not answer my questions. She would only do lab test for heavy metals. She was recommended by the genetic counselor. Another member of the same hospital. The largest hospital in this state. The 'best' hospital in the state. When I ask if she is doing more diagnostic workup she ask me, 'what else would you have me do?\"\n\nThe Spasticityin my calves has been killer hell bad. No drugs or cocktails have worked. I asked about Botox. She finally agreed. Had no idea what she was doing. could not answer any of my basic questions. \n\nNo other neuros either locally or at the largest hospital will even talk to me or my pain mngt dr let alone see me. Every appointment for botox, emg of the arms, physical physiatry (braces, walking, movement, ...) has been covided rescheduled repeatedly.\n\nI am left totally in the dark with no one to to turn to.\n\nOther than my pain management doctor, you have done more for me than any of the doctors I have seen in the last several years.\n\nThank you. I am having great difficulty focusing right now. I am not sure I have grasped all of what you have said. I will have to come back to later.\n\nThanks again. I also have flat feet as well. It must be rare for cmt I go to the MDA clinic here and see a neurologist who tests me every year. I would just try to see someone asap. You need to see a neurologist about it though they can do nerve conduction tests to see where your nerves are at and to keep an eye on your condition year by year.\n\nI would also question whether two conditions are affecting you or just one. With CMT  vocal paralysis can happen but it is very rare. VUS is a Variant of Unknown Significance. Basically, they have not seen this exact variation in this gene before so it is hard to know what it might do. \n\nI am slightly confused by this sentence: \"We explained that this particular variant results in a stop codon, which in many instances would constitute a mutation.\" because of course if there is an erroneous stop codon that would be a mutation. \n\nNot going to lie, your neuro sounds extremely unhelpful. Granted, I do not know what other tests you have had so perhaps you already had extensive testing before you got to her. Does not sound like she was able to help with much though.\n\nI am sorry that you find yourself in this situation. It would be exhausting to try to chase down good information and advice on such a rare condition at any time, much less now. I am afraid I am not really an expert as I live in Canada which is very different. I suppose if you want to try legal action you could try r/legaladvice. Other than that you could reach out to your local news network because, as you say, they love anything related to covid Thank you. I have tried local media. Unfortunately, their interest in anything not covid directly related is anything that will only increase their local viewership. Which in my case, local news is primarily related to agriculture, economy, all of which and more, they tie to ... CoVid! LOL I think I found my new user name, VUSHell. Thanks for the edification. \n\nI do not understand that sentence either. Your continued thought was exactly mine, well after the meeting. During the meeting my head was swimming. Everything related to this was mindblowing. Based upon my reading here and elsewhere, I was pretty much expecting a yes or no answer. Binary answer. Not an even deeper black hole from which there was no light. No help. No information. and nothing but incompetent doctors from whom I got nothing but a loss of very valuable time.\n\nRegarding the neuro, Worse than unhelpful, she is a total waste of my time. Time I did not then or now have. And, even worse than that, her tortuous incompetence has put me through mentally and emotionally hell. What I mentioned here was only the tip of a very big iceberg. I am honestly wondering if her incompetence rises to the level of action.\n\nNot going to lie, for the last few months, everything has become much much harder. Much more painful. The NEW experience with my right arm and hand is terrifying. Add the NEW numbness, tingling, heaviness I am experiencing in my cheek, tongue, I am beyond terrified. \n\nI did not wait until the last minute to act. It has been a series of incompetent doctors in several specialties, along with being discarded like trash from  Penn Med CMT, J. Hopkins neuro fucking up in 2013 when he should have seen the signs he distinctly spelled out in his visit summary report, through the next 6 or so years, and then being discarded like trash by the only hospital in this tiny state that had any available genetic testing and neuromuscular specialist, and then being 'CoVided' so many times I lost count of the scheduled, cancelled, scheduled, cancelled cycle.\n\nI can not help but wonder if that rises to the legal definition of patient abandonment?\n\nBut, thank you, NixyeNox! YOU have been amazing and I am eternally grateful for you help! Thank you, Alpiney. Multiple conditions are occurring simultaneously.\nI have had EMG's At least 6 I can remember since 2013. Unfortunately, the last 3 within the last 2 years were the only ones that were able to slowly get to where I am now. All good. No worries :) ***FlatFooters Unite!!!!*** We are special! Welcome to the club! Classic NixyeNox, What I forgot to ask about was your research regarding,\n\n&gt;\"We discussed our particular concern regarding SLC5A7 variant.\nAnd what, if any info you came across regarding vocal paresis? \n\nAlso, would it be a neuro that would diagnosis HMN7? Any idea what is involved in diagnosis? I do not understand why the neuro did not investigate that more when I asked her about additional testing. Then again, as I have said before, her conversational English is deplorable, at least when trying to answer my questions or understand/comprehend my questions. Any time I mentioned 'pain' she went to auto pilot and said \"I do not do pain.\" Even when I tried to explain the purpose of the botox treatments was to treat the killer spasticity, which is extremely painful. \"I do not do pain\" Yeah, my partner managed to score neurodegenerative issues in the mid 20s. Seeing how rapidly others go down hill is hard to watch. One of the better frustrations has been seeing CMT research struggle due to progression being so gradual that they cannot really track if an intervention is slowing it down. I do not think legaladvice is the way forwards. Typically, you need to show harm. Would an earlier dx have actually done much? There is no real treatment that they provide other than stretch and stay healthy. I mentioned this in another comment here, a neuro does not really treat us. The diagnose, and then symptom management gets put on to OT, physio, orthotists... \n\nI mean this in the nicest way, focus on what can be changed going forwards. It is my understanding that a neuro would generally make the diagnosis for something like HMN7 and that she would do so with a combination of your genetic results and results of other tests. Basically, looking for both the cause (genetics) and also evidence of symptoms. Other tests for CMT include things ranging from the classic reflex hammer test to a nerve conduction velocity test; not sure what other things might come into play for HMN7. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClearly she was looking for heavy metals so she could rule that out as a cause for your symptoms. I would expect her to want to look for symptoms for both CMT and HMN7 and perhaps to try to find a way to distinguish them to be sure which one is your main problem. It is frustrating to hear that she seems so unmotivated to find answers or to help at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I have at least a vague understanding of how the medical system is supposed to function I have no idea about the legal aspects. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe vocal paresis I know is a major concern for you. I do not know that I can really shed any light on it though. Mutations in this specific gene, SLC5A7, are rare. The particular mutation that you have to the gene is, as far as I can tell, not reported anywhere. There is a family which has a mutation in this gene which results in vocal paresis but I do not know if that means that your mutation will have the same affect. That family has a number of people with this gene and the vocal paresis seems to kick in when they are in their teens. Since you have made it this far your variant seems to not have exactly the same impact but whether it is altogether more mild or just delayed I cannot tell you. Possibly a good genetic counselor would be able to speculate better on this, I am not sure. Again, NixyeNox, I can not thank you enough. Your absolutely magnanimous selfless assistance has been more benefitful than ANY dr since this long nightmare began when I finally accepted I could not work any more and sought disability in 2009. It has been a hellaciously long, winding road with false leads, dead ends, horribly incompentent drs. and periods of LONG LONG waiting for appointments only to have them cancelled, rescheduled, over and over and over.\n\n2 things:\n\n1. If we operate from the assumption that YES, I have this VUS, is it possible via internet or other source, we can locate information that can at least help me explore if there are things I can do, medications, vitamins, treatments, therapies, procedures, a list of do-dos and do not don'ts that could help, assist, minimize, prolong, mitigate progression?\n\n2. While I have been on reddit for a few years under the other name and have joined many rooms, I am not overly adept at the mechanics, master-user, getting-things-done, driving up the awareness of an issue to mega awareness. I am seriously considering posting something on AskReddit, explaining my situation, telling the reddit world, and hopefully media pickup, how impossible it has been to get any assistance from the neuros locally, in the state, or at the CMT centers of excellence.\n\nIn 2013 a local neuro did an emg on my legs, result, this is an abnormal study. could be this or this or this .... needs more investigation (paraphrased) that got me an appointment with a neuro specialist at John Hopkins, where I donated a kidney in 2001. That specialist was the most obnoxious, arrogant, dismissive, (fill in the body part) cut to the chase, he said I was depressed and fat. (which was true. My entire world had been turned upside down and then stomped on because of series of downsizings, hirings, dosnsizings, hirings all related to the econ crashes and trade wars) and that I should go home, loose weight, get undepressed, and returned me to local care and chose not to schedule anything more with me.\n\nHe cancelled the EMG he had scheduled. If CMT is the most COMMON of the rare neuro disorders, he should have caught it, especially now when reading his visit summary report, the front summary, now that I know about CMT pretty much ***SCREAMS CMT***\n\nI am seriously considering posting something to 1 or several reddit rooms to get the attention of someone that knows someone that knows someone.\n\nI have the neuro appointment with a neuro with Penn Med Sept 4, not a cmt specialist but my pain dr scoped him out and made the appointment. I DO NOT WANT TO LOOSE THAT APPOINTMENT OR THE MAY 27TH PENN CMT CENTER OF EXCELLENCE THAT WAS COVIDED UNTIL DECEMBER 2.\n\nHonestly, I do not think I can make it that long. This mental torture is torture. For about the last 4 maybe 6 weeks I have been feeling something odd, sensations in my face, tongue, area. a kind of numbness, an odd tingling, ... TERRIFIED, are these symptoms of vocal chord loss or the ac running all the time because of the ac or seasonal allergies. Almost no use of my legs or feet. Both arms and hands have recently begun hurting more, numbness, heavy, thick, tingling, ... Yes I am scared, terrified, of living like this. I am scared of dying like this. No use of arms, hands, feet, legs and locked in a body with no voice no fingers or hands to communicate and being kept 'alive' because, we the enlightened America, can not tolerate the concept of a peaceful, painless, in comfort from this plain.\n\nI got off track, my apologies.\n\nOther than AskReddit, do you know of any other rooms I could post to in order to hopefully get the attention of someone that might at least have answers or contacts who might?\n\nAnd, how can I compose a post off line. my fingers and hands hurt, I frequently hit the wrong keys, i have lost long, thought-out post in the past thanks to my fingers.\n\nNixeyNox, if I had an award or money or anything I could give you for your help, I would. You certainly deserve it far far more than any of the people or hospitals that just have taken my money, my time, my peace of mind and thrown me away like trash.\n\nNixeyNox, with all my heart, ***THANK YOU!!!!!*** Do you know what CMT type you have? I have read that foot deformities in CMT depends on the  type of CMT as well as the age of the patient. For instance, flat feet occurs more often in patients with CMT2 than in patients with CMT1, and young children with CMT 1 as well as 2 will often have flat feet that transition into pes cavus as they grow older. I am not sure, I used to know when my uncle got blood tested. I want to say type 1. I will say I have it mildly compared to others that I have seen too There is a lot here and much of it is outside my ability to help with. I am no internet communications wizard. I am just a 40-something person who took enough biology classes to figure out exactly what was happening with my own nerves, and can therefore read a lot of the terminology and understand similar situations. I think that our US health system is a mess and sadly many folks with chronic illnesses have stupidly long journeys to get even a proper diagnosis. I think more awareness of these stories might help but I have no idea how anyone really manages to get that attention. Also, while I will take your thanks I do not need any awards or such. I am painfully aware of my own limitations. \n\nI do have a suggestion for typing long posts; I often compose longer posts elsewhere and copy-and-paste them over. I use a Windows PC so I just open up a new text document (right click on desktop -&gt;new-&gt;text document) and type it there. That allows me to save periodically and just move it over when I am done. \n\nI have seen members of my family go through the painful transition of losing the ability to walk or even use their legs and I am rather ruthlessly practical about adapting one's life to one's disability by now. Spending time in denial wastes time when you can still walk and can be setting up your home and life for when you cannot--although this applies to my family whose CMT1A has slow but steady progression. I am not 100% sure how much applies to you since it is hard to know what your progression will look like without a more firm diagnosis and medical evaluation. \n\nYour advancing symptoms are alarming and I hope that your next appointment happens without delay. I hope your pain doctor is able to help you with what sounds like nerve pain. \n\nI would love to have practical advice for things you could do or take to slow your progression but at this time no great answers have really leapt out at me. For CMT'ers in general there is standard advice to maintain a healthy weight and do what exercise you can. Frankly the advice is a bit maddening since it is what everyone knows they should do anyway but I grudgingly (I really like cookies, ok?) admit there is something to be said for lower weight being easier to manage with failing muscles. As for exercise, I do strongly feel that a good PT with a specialization in neurological problems could help you strengthen and maintain your muscles as much as they can be strengthened and maintained. PTs may have less lengthy, expensive training and fewer flashy instruments than neurologists but they can be very good at useful interventions. If I manage to make any more headway in understanding what is happening to you or anything you can do to fight it I will certainly let you know. Thank you, NixyeNox. For the most part, I was referring to the loss of vocal cords, asking if we assume that is going to happen, then, would it be possible to identify any potential do's and don'ts to help stave off the loss of my voice.\n\nSeptember 11, 2019, I was not doing well as far as my cmt and the 3 variants but I was walking without aids, maybe more ambling than walking, but compared to now, I was far far better.\n\nSeptember 12th, I discover my younger brother dead in his house. Of his 2 sons, the youngest had just been deployed to the middle east the week before and the oldest has pretty heave duty ptsd. I did not want my nephew having to go through his fathers things by himself so I spent the next 5,6,7 days assisting clearing out, cleaning out the house, up and down stairs, bending, stooping, lifting, carrying, packing, moving, ... I was in pain, more pain than I had been in a very long time. the following 12 -15 or so days I was a 6'2\" towering inferno. Totally inflamed internally. Pain dr prescribed a 7 day regiment of prednisone to reduce the inflammation. \n\nWhatever I did that week of cleaning out my brothers house, to help my nephew, threw me over the cliff and it has been a very very rapid decline ever since. In less than a year I am barely walking, total loss of dorsal movement on the left foot and almost there with the right. Every step is agonizing but I am afraid to stop because I honestly believe, Use it or lose it, is very very real for me.\n\nThat is why I was asking about do's and don'ts for my voice. I did not know I should not being doing what I was doing to help my nephew who has really really bad ptsd. I just did not want him to hurt anymore than he already did. And for that, I lost the rest of my body.\n\nSo, I was asking about, do not drink ice drinks or hot drinks or keep voice level or minimize talking or gargle with gold or anything. The idea of being locked in a body where my arms, hands, fingers, legs, feet, and voice do not work is just madding terrifying.\n\nUnfortunately, my FIRST appointment with any kind of neuro that might know anything, anything, about any of this is not until September 4th, 2020. \n\nAt 66, I am fine with dying. We all do. But not fine with ~~living~~ being alive like that.\n\nThanks again for all your assistance!\n\nI wish you and yours all the best and will keep you and yours in my thoughts when I meditate, sending positive vibes always. I just read this post of yours after seeing you comment so much on mine. \n\nIf you have not already, please try to do the following: call any neurologist you can find nearby (preferably if they are on your insurance) and tell them how quickly you are progressing and that you need help NOW! Some clinics indeed are being impacted by COVID, however, others are still willing to make quick appointments for people in urgent situations. Be belligerent if necessary with the people on the phone and make it clear how abnormal your situation is. I recently had a strange event and called a neurologist and they had me come in the same day! It can be done, though perhaps requires a bit of pushiness. \n\nIf you cannot get a single neuro clinic in your area to see you in a timely manner, try going to the emergency room. I know it is not ideal, and the odds of them actually being helpful may be low. But if you explain what is happening and how quickly they might actually check you into a ward to get you sorted out. The chances are low but not impossible provided your sudden changes. Thank you for your reply and suggestions, lord_archaon\n\nI have called, begged, gone around, sought people who knew people who people all in hopes of making a contact, a call an idea. All have led to dead ends, refusals to talk to me, they wont even talk to my pain management dr when I asked her to call on my behalf. I did speak with the owner of a neuro shop here in town, He has about several dr.'s at this location and another southern location. some are neuros, some are Physiatrist. The neuro owner said he could not help me but would speak to one of his Physiatrist about taking me on to do botox shots.\n\nthat was about 4 weeks ago. When I got the emg on my arms being moderate to severe I sought out a neuromuscualr dr that also works at this owners shop. The woman that answers the phone told me I can not see the neuromuscular specialist since I am seeing another dr in the practice. I explained to her they do not do the same thing. She argued with me, they all do the same thing. I talked her into allowing me to leave a message with the assistant of the neuromuscualr's assistant. Never received a call back. 5 days later I receive a call from the owners assistant telling me the owner did me a favor with the botox dr. l explained how drastically things have changed. she was going to speak to the neuromuscular dr on my behalf. she nor he nor anyone has or will call me back.\n\nThanksgiving, 2019. pain mngt dr starts me on a new cocktail of drugs for the muscle wasting and nerve pain. 1st week no problem. Titrating up, take 2 meds at before bedtime. 2nd week, increase dose as specified. Had a horrible, life threatening reaction to the new meds. Into the ER I go. ER doc says I am just anxious and there is nothing wrong. I took my list of meds and doses with me in the ambulance, drs names, contact info, dosages,... you are just anxious. I explained it was a reaction to the meds. He discharges me.\n\nThanksgiving morning, now 7 am, earlier was about 1 am. 7 am thanksgiving morning back in the ER, Now there is a nurse practitioner. had the same list, explained the same things. she said I was an alcoholic. stop drinking. I told her i did not drink with these meds. she said dont lie to me. Discharged.\n\nThanks for your advice. I know you mean well.\n\nAllow me to give you, and anyone else that might read this some advice.\n\nNEVER EVER COME TO OR VISIT DOVER DELLAWARE!\n\nE-V-E-R!\n\nThe state Joe Biden says he is SOOOOO proud of. DO NOT COME HERE! I am sorry you are having such a god awful time. I wish I had something more helpful to say. Hell seems to be putting the situation lightly. I will relay my personal experience of weeping like a child just the other day feeling like no one was helping with my strange and frightening symptoms. I know that does not make your situation better, but sometimes commiseration can be cathartic. \n\nThe only other ideas I have are: \n\n1. perhaps try to seek help outside the state. Delaware is small. I know traveling long distances is not ideal but anything seems better than nothing if possible. \n\n2. Half-truths. I would normally not recommend omitting facts to your healthcare providers. But if telling a receptionist you are being seen elsewhere prevents treatment, leave it out. If you feel you need an updated EMG because of the rapid progression of symptoms, find a new doctor and do not tell them about the old EMG. Maybe even pretend your knowledge of what is happening is smaller than it is so they feel compelled to urgently help. These are not good tactics, or ones I would normally recommend. But as people say, desperate times call for desperate measures. And I can see the desperation in your posts. \n\nMay whatever powers there be grant you some blessings of relief. Thanks. I hear you. I understand you. Yes. It would have made a ***HUGE!!!!*** difference. Please read response to /u/NixyeNox below beginning with\n\n &gt; \"September 11, 2019, I was not doing well as far as my cmt and the 3 variants but I was walking without aids, maybe more ambling than walking, but compared to now, I was far far better.\"\n\nHad I been under a dr.s care or had earlier, more, formal/informal knowledge, education, I would not have unknowingly dove head first into an empty cement swimming pool head first.\n\nNot trying to be an ass, but yes, it would have been a significant difference in the outcome.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add, had the dr done his job correctly back in 2013 I would have had foreknowledge as to what might likely come to pass and therefore, I would not be living where I currently am with all the bedrooms and full bathrooms upstairs, and the living areas downstairs. I would have had time to prepare my living situation, my life accommodation needs, transportation needs, been available for any potential trials, been enrolled and participating in the correct PT and OT.\n\nYes, I do believe a legal avenue might be something that I may be forced to pursue. Not one I would prefer to pursue. Thank you for your words or support and encouragement, lord_archaon, they truly are helpful. As you say, at times like these, when we feel so alone on a planet of 7.5 BILLION humans, there are times it is comforting to know that I am not the only mature male that, at times, crumbles under the never ending  pulverizing pestle in the crucible of life. I had hope to be more stoic when this time came. Every step is now extremely painful and yet I know if I give into the pain, and rest, I lose all chance. And yet, if I am destined to lose the use of my legs, feet, arms, hands, maybe voice, then I must take matters into my own hands, literally, while I literally, still can and choose my time, place, method while I can. I am not there yet, but I am afraid to wait too long before I am imprisoned in a nightmarish body that is incapable of responding and thus being self-imprissoned because I did not take action when I was capable of doing so. Flat footed here too. We are a rarity it seems and  my neurologist said that it can be as taxing on the body as high arches especially on the knees. I was diagnosed as a toddler and my parents spent my childhood terrified of this condition taking over my life. I understand the depression and how frustrating it is having medical experts dismiss actual symptoms with you being depressed when actually you are depressed because of those physical symptoms! It is a vicious cycle. However, most things you find on the internet will be the \u2018worst\u2019 case scenarios. Personally early diagnosis has not impacted my life greatly. My Dad is almost 70, struggles to walk far (uses a mobility scooter) but can still drive (at this point, albeit short distances). He can still cook for himself but is prone to tripping. CMT can be a horrible condition with varying types but worry cannot change it. As you say, education can help but just keep an open mind that those with the positive stories do not always feel compelled to write. \n\nIf you have CMT, as far as I am aware every type effects the whole body - not just certain limbs (but lower limbs esp including the hands). It makes sense your primal hand will go first (same as leg) as that is the one that we use the most. ***ONE*** of the ***THREE*** genetic mutations is Dominant CMT type 2D, according to the genetic test. I have had flat feet from birth. There has never ever been a point in time where the last thing I felt before falling asleep and the first thing I felt upon awaking was pain in the bottoms and inside my feet, ankles and shins. My entire early life was nothing but constant pain in my legs and feet. And now, the bottoms of my feet insides feel like extremely hot pokers the bones feel like sharp shards of bone digging into every soft tissue or whatever is left. And my ankles feel as though they are being crushed. One wrong step, move, fall, and I might break my ankle into tiny pieces. And it never stops. Not just the knees! As time goes on, more and more of the skeletal structure becomes out of wack, all the way up to and including the neck. The pelvis and spine are impacted as is the neck if one is more outdoorsy, as I was. December 2019 had decompression surgery for stenosis. I still have stenosis in the back as well as neck as well as arthritis in from the the feet to the skull. As the old saying goes, 'If your feet hurt, you hurt everywhere.\" And, yes, I do. Thank you for your response and insights with your personal journey and that of your fathers. Your father is about 4 years my senior, as I am, or will be, 66 the first week of September. Until last September, when I discovered my younger brother dead in his house, I walked, hobbled, without any kind of aid. Since then, after helping his oldest son clean out his fathers house, I detoriated rapidly. Apparently, I overexerted myself, became a towering inferno that lasted well over a week until finally extinguished via a week pack of steroids. But by then, it was too late. I had no idea what I was doing to 'help' was literally destroying what little nerve protection I had left. Consequently, in less than a year, I went from being not so great to barely able to walk, now very close to full time wheel chair, and now my hands, arms, tongue, face, throat are tingling and feeling numb. According to the genetic results, the 3rd variant of my deformities has the potential to lead to vocal paralysis. \n\nSo, yes, I am terrified of the potential impact of not being able to feed myself, cook, clean, do laundry, or my personal daily hygiene, and being locked in a body wracked with pain in a wheel chair or bed or whatever and not even be able to speak or even type. \n\nOddly, it was my left leg that went first, and it feels like my right arm is dying faster than the left. I still have slight bit of dorsal movement with my right foot, not for long I am afraid, whereas my left dorsal movements in my foot have been lost for about a year.\n\nI do hope that well before you are my age or your fathers there are advances so you and others will not suffer the anguish of this disease or condition? Some say disease. some say condition. I really do not know. I think most of us - if not all - wonder how quickly our bodies will deteriorate. And that is what sucks about CMT: everyone deteriorates at a different speed and in different ways.\n\nMy (22) mobility is nowhere near as bad as my brother's (23) was a year ago. Heck, he is worse off than my dad (56) or even my uncle (72). I will not be surprised if he ends up in a wheelchair in the next few years.\n\nI will not be able to recommend you a neurologist, as I am not from the States. But I can pass some advise our neurologist gave to us onto you. Not going to lie, it is not groundbreaking advice...\n\nHe told us to keep moving as much as possible, but warned us not to overdo it. He explained (I am not sure if this is 100% accurate) that when you work out too much, your muscles will deteriorate just a bit. For any other person that means that they will recover and actually get stronger along the way. Ours simply will not recover (as much) and if you keep doing it too much, you will start to break you muscles down even more.\n\nSadly there is not much else you can do. And even so, it will not stop the deterioration. I am sorry that you have been through that, it is a lot. I do not myself know the first thing about vocal cords but it occurs to me that perhaps your priority should be to find a speech pathologist. I believe a speech pathologist is basically a PT but for vocal cords and voice issues and such an expert might be able to address your most important questions. Once again, NixyeNox, and as always, thank you for the kind words, words of encouragement, and thoughtful response. I am seeking an ENT (ears, nose, throat) specialist, hopefully one with experience in neuro disorders. Again, as in most things relating to the 21st century, so far, not to be found in this backwater capitol of a state, joke of 'City.' Dover, Delaware. \n\nFor anyone reading this, now or in the future, who ask, ***'why see a neuro regularly, they cannot do anything?\"*** The answer, the same as networking with other people. **Because, when you NEED them, it is too late.** The BEST time to network, get to know other people, get them to know you, is when you do not need anything from them. When you ***NEED*** something, it is too late. You are already at a disadvantage. I read in another post of yours that you have arthritis. Does steroids alleviate any of the pain in your feet and legs? From what I know so far about CMT 2D, pain like you describe above have not been reported. It is hard to rule it out though because little data does not necessarily mean it does not exist. Similarly your other mutations could also be the reason, but I do not know enough about them to speculate on it. If it was neuropathic pain, then it would be unusual for it to be present early in life with a significant intensity as the damage to the the nerves that eventually cause the neuropathic pain develops gradually over time. However if the pain is neuropathic, you should known that there are special pain medication that works specifically for neuropathic pain. I urge you to bring up your pain with your general practitioner and/or any specialists you are seeing/are intending to see in order to find out the cause of the pain and hopefully an intervention that will bring you some relief. I know that in some cases chronic pain can be difficult to treat, but with the help from the right people there are usually things that can be done to alleviate it at least to some extent.\nI think a good place to start could be to visit the ( nearest you, as I have heard nothing but good things about them and I know that many of them employ very highly skilled professionals with CMT expertise. Thank you for your response, pmp22, and the information you so generously shared with me and others. Starting from the back, I do have an appointment with a neuro specialist September 4, with Penn Medicine. He is not with the CMT center of excellence, but he is a highly specialized neuro with a background in several neuromuscular disorders. I do have a Center of Excellence appointment with Penn med that was rescheduled from May 27 to December 2nd due to CoVid. \n\nThe steroids did not help to elevate any pain. Their purpose was to *\u2018break\u2019* the total body inflammation I unknowingly brought upon myself when I overexerted myself for approximately 6 days, resulting in sending my slow but progressive decline in leg muscles to not far from total collapse of my legs in approximately 8 months. Thank you for the response, beatlerunningwater, and my apologies for the tardiness of my response, I have been a bit overwhelmed the last few days with a myriad of life challenges.\n\nI do hope you and your partner are doing well and the deterioration of your partners condition is well managed and cared for.\n\nYes, I must admit, being relatively new to all this, all the variations, the deplorable lack of information and the apparently glacial speed of knowledge regarding treatment, medicine, preventive or even palliative care is extremely frighting as well as disheartening. Thankfully, I found this sub and am grateful for the fellowship, knowledge, anecdotal sharing and commiseration. Check with the CMT Association,  ( or the Muscular Dystrophy Association,  ( (CMT is not muscular dystrophy, but the symptoms are similar and the MDA provides services for CMT patients. In some places, they operate the primary CMT clinic.\n\nCOVID is a problem with in-person visits (I have had a problem getting an appointment for dental work) but my local CMT clinic doe do telemedicine video appointments when face-to-face is not required.\n\nOccupational therapy and physical therapy are very helpful, but COVID is a problem now. But they may be able to help by video conference. Exercise on a stationary bicycle has helped me enormously. But you should consult with someone about exercise.\n\nI am 74 and fortunate I retired before I became really disabled. For a while, I was extremely disabled, but now I can do almost everything myself. I am mostly in a wheelchair. but I do some of my cooking (the biggest problem is that I do not know how, but that does not stop me \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude1c.) Thanks for responding, and my apologies for my tardy response. I have had some serious flair-ups this past week that have been seriously hellacious. \n\nAre you suggesting I check with cmtausa.com regarding some of those questions I posted? I had not considered that, nor did I realize mda provided info and or resources pertaing to such things especially regarding CMT.\n\nCoVid is killing me and I do not even have CoVid! I was formally, officially, diagnoised near the end of 2019. Unfortunitely, every CMT center of excellence, or anyone that knew anyhing about CMT had a minimum of a 6-7 month wait time for a 1 hour appointment. By the time my appointment came up, May 27, 2020, CoVid had been in full swing since March. A week prior to my appointment I received a call from Penn Med CMT Center of Excellence, telling me, in essence, I have been \u2018CoVided!\u201d as in, sucks to be you, now you can wait another 6 -7 months. I was so close to finally getting some info, so help, and it was pulled away. It also almost killed me as in September of 2019, I ended up doing something I had no clue was the worst possible thing I could do, I over exerted myself drastically to the point my entire body was inflamed and stayed that way for about 2.5 weeks before a Dr realized what was happening and put me on a very high dosage of prednisone to get the inflammation down and under control. Unfortunately, it was way to late. From that date in September 2019 until now, I went from walking unaided, no cane, no walker, no rolling walker, minor foot drop in the left foot and little loss of dorsal in the right and no pain in my arms. Now, both legs are pretty much gone. I must use a walker for even small distances, I cannot even take out my trash to the street. I cannot cook, other than microwaving, showering is always a scary endeavour, and worse, now my right arm from the shoulder to the fingertips are painful, constantly numb, and the fingertips never stop tingling.\n\nHOW did you get from \u201c...extremely disabled, but now I can do almost everything myself. \u201c Please, I would love to know. Cause at this point, I am actively planning my final exit. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 &gt;HOW did you get from \u201c...extremely disabled, but now I can do almost everything myself. \u201c\n\nPhysical therepy and exercise helped me. I was in physical therepy for about a year, until the insurance stopped paying. I also excercise daily, both the excercises learned in pt and riding a stationary recombent bycicle. I do not know for sure that it was just the PT and excersize, time may have also helped. Sometimes it just seems to get better.", "Please tell me I am not the only Transgender person with CMT! I feel like I am losing my mind here, all I want to know is if I can go on Hormone Replacement Therapy without destroying my body.   \n\nPeople describe HRT as second puberty, and I was always told that CMT accelerates during puberty. Also as far as I know pregnancy hormones (IE increased estrogen) leave a lot of women with CMT severely worse off, as I would be taking estrogen I am worried about that too. You should consult a doctor. Neurologist, endocrinologist, whatever you need. This subreddit is a great place, but a complex issue like your requires proffessional assessment. Everyone is body is different. There is no way that you are the only transgender person with CMT! But, based on your username I guess you are vegan. You just might be the only vegan transgender person with CMT. ... just kidding. I am also vegan btw. \n\nIf it were me, I would talk to multiple specialists about this and try to merge all of their input into one answer. And I would not do anything until I was confident in my doctor and felt safe and aware of all risks. \n\nAre you located in an area where you have access to good medical care? Hi, I am, I thought I was the only one, I am pre hrt but I have also been thinking about the same question a lot, if you ever find out please let me know I will let you know as soon as I see my CMT consultant! I am just not going to bother until I move house on the 20th Fair enough, I am 6 months from even starting anything anyway, thankyou That makes sense, medical care Is a slight pain right now. My area is really decent but I only just moved here, so none of my doctors know of very well I am very early too, so that is almost nice in a way that we are both in the same place. Absolutely. I just do not have the time to do that until the 20th, but not knowing is killing me :/ Yea definitely, I thought that I would never see another trans person with CMT so it is super nice I got to be honest, I am still not 100% sure I am transgender, but that is probably just me thinking I am an imposter. Hey, is it OK if I send you a PM and we stay in touch? Id say it is likely, cis people do not normally Think about being trans and hormones haha, I remember feeling the same though and my pm is always open :) I am not trans, just wanted to send some virtual hugs your way as a fellow spoonie sister. xoxo  That is super sweet, and I kind of needed it today, what is a spoonie though? Hey how have things gone? Did you find out anything ? Unfortunately not yet, I am still waiting until I have seen the GP before I phone up my specialist practice. I will be registered with a GP by the last Friday of March, and as soon as that happens I will immediately make an appointment with them to tell them that I am trans, that I want to be put on the waiting list for a Gender Clinic, and I want some basic support and information.  \n\nAs soon as that is done with I will ring up my specialist practice and make an appointment with either one of the neurology nurses or the doctor I saw last time. \n\nIf want me to keep you updated I will write your username down and send you some information as soon as I have it, I do not know your situation in regards to gender identity or disability. But I know that I am going crazy with questions and if you are in anyway near the same situation as me, you could use a friend with answers.  Feel free to PM me if you want to talk more.\n\n- April Ok, thanks. Yea I started questioning a few months ago (mtf) but idk. But I read your post and it really had not occured to me that if I ever were to take hormones it could affect my cmt (I guess the fact that it bothers me should tell me something haha), especially since I feel like it is gotten worse over the last couple of years.  So, I do not know if you saw the other post I made (same title and context, different subreddit)    \n\nBut I got different responses there, the top rated comment seems quite helpful but I could not really decipher it, maybe you will have better luck.  \n\nSo far I am under the impression that so long as you are prescribed the correct kind of hormone cocktail, it should not effect you too badly. Apart from that... CMT is obviously a muscle wastage disease, and HRT also wastes muscles. so it is probably really important to bare in mind that we will have to work harder to keep an acceptable amount of muscle density before finishing the 5 years of massive changes HRT entails (before it levels out at the end)  \n\nBut hey! I am not a Doctor, so please take what I say with a grain of salt until I see my Doctor.  If I might ask, what type of CMT do you have? Yea I did not understand all of that, especially not the paper they linked to - but I guess it seemed hopeful. Regarding their comment on \"Vincristine\" - is that a hormone related drug? Becuase there is a pretty long list of drugs that are potentially harmful to us (i had to research that myself becuae my doctors did not tell ne anything - visit CMTA's webbaite for the list - apparently laughing gas is bad!) \n\nI have type 1A\n\nSorry for any typos ", "Has someone experience with vitamin D and CMT? Hi,\nI wonder if someone had experience with CMT and high doses of vitamin D? I am looking into vitamin D deficit and if this could be something that can help to lessen the problems caused by CMT. So I thought I ask you if someone has knowledge and experience with this and if high doses of vitamin D can help. I am thinking of taking a well very high doses like 10000 IE to fill up the vitamin D reserves in the body and after that to drop down to a dose of 3000IE to keep the levels. Target weird be 50ng/ml.\n\nAny feedback would be great. What is your level currently?  I still have to get a test done. But my estimates using a detailed quiz is about 15 ng/ml. So, way to low. I barely get out. Working indoors all the time. And in retrospect I did not get much sun last summer.  Can you share that quiz? I was tested a couple of years ago, but it is out of pocket not covered by insurance. I would be curious to take that quiz and then get tested again.  There was a letter in the journal *Nutrients* a couple of years ago about ( According to the data, a daily dose of 8895 IU of vitamin D would be needed to reach \"optimal\" serum levels. However one should be cautious about interpreting this data to mean that you should try to achieve that by taking ~8K IU/ day because there really is not enough data on the long term effects of taking these kinds of doses yet. There is a Greek researcher who have done just that though in (\n\nAnother thing to consider is that there are five different types of Vitamin D. If you think you have a Vitamin D deficiency it is important to get it diagnosed properly so the exact cause can be determined. \n\nJust to give an example of the pitfalls of relying on self diagnosis and treatment: \n\nLet us say you experience symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency and you decide to buy some Vitamin D pills to take as a supplement. You start to take the pills, but they do not seem to have an effect so you conclude that it must be something else and you move on to try other things. \nNow suppose you have an undiagnosed kidney disease that interfere with vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) metabolism, leading to a deficiency. In that case, taking Vitamin D pills would not help because most of the vitamin D pills you buy are Cholecalciferol. If you had the deficiency diagnosed, the doctor would prescribe you with a different kind of vitamin D that the kidneys would metabolize just fine and you would see a normalization of the serum levels of calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D.\n\nIf you suspect something is wrong, I highly advice getting a blood test done. I understand that not everybody can afford it, but if you can it is always a better option than to try and take matters into your own hands. With CMT it is a good idea to check vitamin levels regularly, especially D3 and B12. I had a Vitamin D shortage and took 10,000 IE to get back up to the recommended level,m and then took 10,000 IE every other day for a few months. It did not really make much of a difference. \nThe only supplement I have found that helps are SARMs (legal in Europe, not in the US), and I am looking into CBD oil to see if this helps motor functions.", "How do I know which CMT I have? I have known that I have CMT since I was about 12, (21 now).. It has affected my legs mostly, but very little in my hands(My right thumb and pointer finger)..

", "My Right Hand - With Pics!  I am afraid to ask this question because I am afraid of the answer. There are no neuro's or really anyone locally that have any real knowledge of CMT. Other than my pain management dr., who also is not local but at least knows enough that she made the preliminary diagnosis.\n\nThrough EMG's and Nerve Conduction Studies, it is confirmed, my arms are 'moderate'. However, the M.D.'s differ as to whether I have both demyelinating and axonal or just axonal.\n\nMy legs are considered severe and axonal.\n\nFinger tips on the right hand have and odd numbness, tingling.\n\nKnuckles of both hands are tight, and the fingers do not fold or unfold smoothly. The right hand worse than the left.\n\nThe knuckle of the ring finger appears 'inflamed'. The palm side, the knuckle, the 1st digit beyond the knuckle, and just below the knuckle into the palm, are tender, and sore. There appears to be a swollen pockets on the palm side, side by side of the knuckle.\n\nSo far, no MD has been able to answer, is this the beginning of my saying good bye to my right hand/arm?\n\nI am seeing a local neuro on Friday, 10/23. Not holding out much hope as I have seen him twice before and he has not been very useful. But, when he is all ya got, that is what ya got.\n\nI did go to Uni Penn, CMT Center of Excellence, WOW! after waiting almost 1 year, what a let down! What a disappointment!\n\nSo, I thought I would come to the experts. Those that have and are living with disease day in, day out. \n\nDo these pictures of my right hand look anything like the beginning of CMT moving in?\n\nThanks for any insights! Not like mine, which may be good news but everyone is different. My muscles around my thumbs are almost gone kind of skeleton looking. Hard to pick up and hold things. No swelling except for my feet and ankles. Sorry to hear about the disappointing Dr. appointment. I have heard that with CMT we are more prone to carpal tunnel syndrome which gives the same symptoms. My Dr. wants me to get more tests done to see if that is part of my issues too but I am tired of seeing doctors that have no answers as well. They do want me to try wrist braces to see if that helps. I just have not tried them yet. Take care. Sounds like tendinitis and carpal tunnel to me. My hands do that when I overwork them or strain them. On another post I mentioned recent weakness in my hands. It has been slowly improving over the past week but still not back to where it was before. I believe it was caused by inflammation and wrist strain from track driving a few days prior.\n\nWhat has helped me is wearing wrist braces at night and part of the day if the inflammation gets bad. Also taking anti inflammatory drugs and vitamin D supplement. Also, taking venlafaxin for anxiety has had a noticeable effect on certain cmt symptoms as well. Anxiety causes inflammation and extra brain and neuro activity, so combatting it can actually provide real benefits for cmt. \n\nAll that said, your hands look way healthier and than mine. As another poster said, my hands look almost skeletal and grip strength is weakened. I cannot fully extend my fingers and on either hand, and have a lot of sensory loss. I think if you are able to manage anxiety and inflammation, you should be able to look forward to long future use of your hands. Thank you, /u/randmcc ! Really appreciate your response, and the effort it must take to respond. Especially with such an in-depth and informative response. I was unaware CMT'ers were &gt;more prone to carpal tunnel syndrome. Thanks again!\n\nI can totally relate to being tired of seeing MD's! Tired, physically, mentally, emotionally, of the phone calls, the follow-ups, the lab work, the medicines, the refills, the controlled substances that, absolutely MUST be picked up in person, can not be sent directly to the pharmacy from the MD;s office.\n\nIt is all so draining!!! It all takes what little energy and time I have on a daily basis. And every 'specialist' they want me to see is at minimum 60 -90 minutes away. and they cannot telemed, MUST be seen in person. Regardless of the fact I can not drive that far, and must hire someone, usually a minimum of $125 + gas + tolls + parking + ++ !!!\n\nBut, now I am just blowing off steam. Energy I do NOT have to spare!\n\nI do hope you find the energy to try the wrist braces. I understand the frustration. I understand it often sounds like snake oil after all the crap we have been told. BUT, after all, if, in any way, you can save what you have, it might be worth, one - more- try!\n\nThanks again, and good luck to you too! WOW! Thank you, /u/lord_archaon ! Really appreciate the response and the time and effort it took to respond, and with so much info!\n\nI am definitely anxious all the time! Unfortunately, my pain is unmanaged, even with seeing an excellent pain management MD.\n\nBased on what you said, I am wondering if it could possibly be the cane I use to augment the Rollater as there often are times the legs are too week and need assist from the arm's via the cane. I will definitely follow-up and hope you are correct!\n\nI am unfamiliar with venlafaxin. May I ask, specifically, which cmt  symptoms it seems to help?\n\nThanks again for sharing all your insights and information. You have given an old man some peace. Perhaps, tonight, I might actually sleep!\n\nI wish you well and the best. You and  /u/randmcc will definitely be in my thoughts, and sending lots of positive vibes for your peace, care, welfare. Hi! (Cannot give medical advice, not a doctor, blah blah blah, etc). \n\nThis is exactly what my hands do with overuse (they are currently only labeled \u201cslight\u201d to \u201cmoderate\u201d depending on the day and EMG apparently). They have been doing this to me for about 6 years now. I would been managing them with splints at night and then added in some bracing during the day. \n\nUltimately led to having a carpal tunnel release in the right hand. Did not necessarily totally fix it but my recovery time is much shorter (example: had to do yard work, my left hand took ~a week of not using it to calm back down, my right took about a day). \n\nI saw you mentioned cane use? That could very well be putting pressure on your carpal tunnel (a big no no for CMT). I had to use crutches post tarsal releases and it got to the point I totally lost use of my hands for a few weeks because of the continued compression. \n\nIt ultimately took me seeing a hand surgeon to actually get properly diagnosed and treated. I see a podiatrist specifically for my feet. I had been seeing general orthos prior to that and none of them were adequately getting me anywhere (though, again, local doctors suck and it took me driving 3 hours to Mayo Clinic to get anywhere)\n\nNot sure if any of this helps. Hoping it does. WOW! /u/KatyKeene05  ! Just WOW! Thank you so much for all that HELPFUL info! I agree with you regarding the EMG's and NCS. Seems each MD has their own 'special' way of reading, interpreting, even conducting these test. I have had so many of both and the results are always a spinning wheel and a dart. \n\nYou are the third person that has mentioned CP and or Tendonitis. I am unsure which medical specialty to consult. I do not have the time nor the energy to play SPIN THE MD SPECIALTY WHEEL before, if lucky, landing on the right spot of the MD game.\n\nFor the first time in years, today,  Thursday, 10/22, I am seeing a new podiatrist.  In addition to atypical CMT feet, (I have REALLY, REALLY, flat feet) the soles of my feet are in a constant state of INFERNO. The burning never stops. The pain is maddening. hopefully, the POD will discover a reason for the INFERNO, muscle/tendon/bone/nerve agitation or entrapped nerves or tissue or a problem with the ankles, ANYTHING TO EXTINGUISH THIS INFERNAL BURNING!\n\nYour nightly splints and daily bracing, were they your idea? Did you request them? From what kind of MD? Do you think they are at all helpful in delaying or perhaps impeding may be a better word, the ravages of atrophy and loss of use of the hands?\n\nIt is refreshing to hear someone else say the same about their local  medical community. As a former physical therapist told me, there is reason they practice here and not in the big cities or institutions. \n\nThanks again! Really appreciate your response!\n\nOh, forgot, other than resting the hand, not using it for strenuous activity, is/are there any home treatments you have used or know of that I could try before seeing, ONE-MORE-DOCTOR! I have been diagnosed with  de Quervain's tenosynovitis, which was described to me as \"like carpal tunnel but for the thumb tendon\". I was diagnosed by a nurse practitioner, possible a hand specialist? I do not recall as it has been some years and I think my workplace sent me to the right place. In fact when she realized what my problem was the first thing she asked was \"So you work in one of these bio labs around here? Do a lot of pipetting, do you?\" which yes and yes. Apparently it is a common pipetting injury but the words \"pipetting injury\" still sound so absurd to me that I laugh when I say it. \n\nI got a custom wrist brace and spent two weeks taking an NSAID (Advil) and never moving my thumb (an exercise in frustration) but it calmed down and the pain went away. I have occasional flare ups but I stop and rest if they start and I have not needed to pull out the brace in years. I was told ice packs could help the inflammation as well but I hate ice packs so I did not really use them.\n\nOn a somewhat unrelated note the bottoms of my feet have been burning slightly for the last couple of days and I fear that all my summer/autumn walking has taken a toll and I am going to need to slow down on that a bit. So frustrating when trying to take care of your health in one way harms you in another. I bought the nighttime braces on my own out of desperation and I think they have helped (been using them 3 years now). My hand doctor told me I would probably be worse off if I had not started and I am (by happenstance) using the ones he suggests using. \n\n( \n\nHe gave me the daytime braces but I think they are basically these if you google: Med Spec GelFlex Wrist Support Brace, Black\n\nHe did warn me not to use them all the time so my muscles still get something of a work out but when typing (I have a desk job) it is a good idea. \n\nI ice / use heat pads and that moderately helps the worst pain settle a tiny bit. \n\nOther than surgery I have not had success with really finding relief. I am starting yet another medication to see if it will do anything (I have tried 7? Already with no relief). \n\nNeurologists told me they are just there to diagnose and consult or suggest medication and that I need to focus my efforts with orthopedic doctors which led me to getting a hand surgeon specifically to take me on. He is been the most helpful doctor I have seen after a decade of trying to get answers (besides my podiatrist who I found because my feet are compressed to the point that I cannot feel them)\n\nHis basic plan is to hopefully slow this thing down and offer relief. So we are going to do an ulnar (elbow) release on the right and then ulnar and carpal in my left. Continue splinting and physical therapy. And probably have more surgery in about 10 years. That is the plan. Not the greatest but all they currently have to offer considering I am 26 and medication has not helped at all (still fingers crossed maybe amitriptyline will do something and stave off tons of surgery). I also have skeletal hands and do not look like op either. The cane definitely sounds like a possible culprit to me. Especially if you have to put a lot of weight on the wrist while your hand is bent all the way back. \n\nFor me the venlafaxin has helped with the severity of muscle spasms and even seemed to help my muscles fatigue a little more slowly. I have not been on it very long but I think it is going to be a big improvement in my life. Especially for anxiety. \n\nI am glad I could share something helpful. I hope you were able to get some sleep after all. Thanks, AGAIN! Once I read your initial response, and your personal experience with the problem, the only thing I could think of was the cane. My pain management doc, as good as she is, has been unable to determine the reason, other than cmt, or source of the constant burning pain going down both lower legs like fire, into the ankles, the feet and the soles of the feet. Consequently, walking, any amount of standing on my all ready very flat, big, fat feet, is painful and exacerbates the fire in the legs, ankles and feet.\n\nAs a result, not only have my calves atrophied, but my thighs, and glutes have as well.  The cane is necessary to achieve forward momentum when the legs just do not have the strength nor stamina to do so on their own.\n\nI am going to mention venlafaxin to my pain mngt md, see if there is an opportunity there.\n\nBTW, yes! I was able to catch a few winks last night! Felt so good! I am so sorry, /u/Old_WorldBlues . It must be awful for you to hear (see) me whine and pics of my hands, and my fears, when you are living it daily. My sincerest apologies if in any way my whining and posting has troubled, upset, rattled you. You will be in my thoughts. I wish you all the best and much peace. I just do not know what to say. Although I have been struggling with this for about a year, maybe a bit more, at the age of 66, honestly, I am overwhelmed. Never in the 64.5 years or so leading up to the suspission of CMT from my pain mngt doc did I ever hear from anyone, any family or medical, anything to do with a genetic neurological disease. To learn at 66 or there abouts, that, hey, guess what the universe has in store for you for your parting gift, ...CMT!! I am so overwhelmed, I have done nothing in my life, my living conditions,mentally, emotionally, ... nothing, to even prepare for anything remotely akin to this.\n\nI am so sorry if I in any way have upset you or anyone else with my selfish whining and fears. Oh it is no worries at all, I just wanted to share my experience. My hands have always been like that though so it is not like they have wasted away. My family has cmt quite bad and most of my affected relatives end up in wheel chairs by your age, so it is granted that that my case will look different. It is a very variable disease, even between family members. Thank you for sharing your experiences. I sincerely do appreciate the insights you provide and your contributions to this sub. And, thanks for your gracious generosity of my faux pas. I do hope, that well before you are my age, there are therapies, methodologies, medicines, and if we dare to dream, cures. All the best you and yours! Hey, /u/NixyeNox ! Great to see you again! \n\nde Quervain's tenosynovitis? WOW! Who comes up with these names!? Again, never heard of it. Thumb tendon, eh? I would have never guessed there was such a thing as thumb tendon pain. Never thought about it, but it makes sense!\n\nI wonder if the military awards medals for \"pipetting injury\" ?If they do, I wonder what it looks like?!\n\nI hear ya about the double edged sword of self health care. One of the best exercises is walking. I hiked the Grand Canyon a few times, always paid for it in mega amounts of pain but DAMN was it worth it! This was long before I ever had any idea I had any kind of neurological disease. To me, it was what it always was, just really big, fat, flat feet.  Now, I can not walk. It is more like a hunched over amble with one hand on a rollanator and the other on a cane.\n\nYou might be interested in something I just discovered a few minutes ago via this site. I was going to hold off and make a separate post but your foot inflammation is something I can definitely relate to!\n\nThe CMT-NET, German site, lower right on this page. I was just checking it out. Much is in English. Some you can kind of guess what they are saying. I used Google Translate. \n\n( Hey /u/lord_archaon ! Speaking of inflammation, take a look at the response I just posted to  /u/NixyeNox . Use Google translate. The Germans are researching a NSAID for pain relief.

Why cannot they find something that will help us!?\n\nMy fingers and hands are getting sore so I will have to end soon.\n\nTake a look at the responses i posted and the link I posted to  /u/NixyeNox in my response. German site. Use google translate. I am definitely going to ask my dr for a script! &gt; de Quervain's tenosynovitis? WOW! Who comes up with these names!?\n\nI assume Dr de Quervain, haha (just guessing though)\n\nMy feet are feeling better today after more rest. The German site is interesting. Always good to see someone working on stuff like that, any of us may really need it anytime.", "Ski or snowboard? I have been wondering about this. I have been skiing for many years, but last time was about 6 years ago. \n\nDo you think CMT affects skiing? And would it be better to ride snowboard as feet are a bit more \u201cfixed\u201d?\n\nWhat is your experiences? Snowboarding was always WAY easier for me. When you fall on the ground and need to get back up, flip over to your stomach, dig your toe side edge in and stand up that way. It was almost impossible for my to stand back up on my heel side edge. As far as riding goes I had no issues. Trust your edges. Jumps are tricky with CMT and so are rails but if you just stick to riding and carving, you will be fine and have a lot of fun! I skied as a kid, snowboarded as a teen, and am mostly skiing as an adult. I think snowboarding boots are way more comfortable for my CMT feet (there are days that my feet are numb, then in EXCRUCIATING pain after ski boots) but I enjoying skiing a lot more so I deal with it. I am a pretty chill skier though, nothing too intense. Everyone is different, but I know that CMT affects my ability to ski.\n\nI used to always have to go cross-country skiing in the winter as a child. While I could do it, I always disliked it because I had balance issues and got tired quicker than the rest. I always used to struggle with balance when going down slope and if the tracks got bad my lack of ankle strength made it more difficult to keep the skis positioned correctly. Going up slope was a pain because the grip wax that was available did not create enough friction for me, and the herringbone technique relies on good ankle strength which I did not have so I tired very easily. I stopped doing it as an adult for those reasons until a couple of years ago when I gave it another go.\n\nAs an adult I struggled with the same things, balance issues and lack of ankle strength, but overall it was doable and more enjoyable than I remembered it. I used skis with a built in climbing skin (great invention!) and that was really helpful when going up slopes.\n\nThe annoying thing for me about skiing though is that I know what to do but the body does not respond like it should, and that is a really frustrating feeling. Falling over in the tracks in the middle of a slope when someone else is coming behind you is not very popular either so that add some extra pressure to the whole ordeal as well.\n\nI have never tried to snowboard and unless a treatment comes along that helps my balance issues I do not think I ever will either. As a side note I went snowshoeing last winter (it is a thing) and that was also a great way to experience the mountains during the winter. I love to ski and still try. The foot pain from the ski boots is intense. There is a sudden rush of intense pain when I take them off and it takes hours for that pain to go away ( actually it never goes away, just decreases enough to be manageable). I do not want to give up skiing, so I am working with a pain doctor to see if we can find a solution for the foot pain. Not a lot of luck so far. I am new to trying edibles with equal parts THC and CBD. Hoping I find the right combination to help with the pain. You perfectly described the pain when taking ski boots off. Like a momentary delay then holy shit the worst pain I have ever felt. Sorry you experience that too.", "Surgery after puberty? Hi there, I was diagnosed with CMT 1A last November and have had a rough go of things. Its been a wild ride that I would like to eventually get off of. Anyway, I went to the Johns Hopkins CMT clinic on Monday and we talked about a lot of things, one of which was surgery. They said that surgery after puberty is usually a bad thing to do that results in only more pain than before the surgery. Can anyone whos had surgery for CMT on their feet after or before puberty respond and tell me your experiences? I really do want surgery as while I know it will not repair my nerves, at least my feet will look normal and will remove the need for these massive insoles I have. I am just really self-conscious about them and walking barefoot in my house can lead to me falling while I am walking on flat ground. 17 years old when diagnosed so after puberty I got my surgeries at 27 (R foot) and 32 (L foot), with good results. Improved function, no change in pain. \n\nI have never heard the idea that surgery after puberty is a bad idea - have you poked around on (  Do some research, read some papers, and get a second opinion from a different surgeon. Surgery is a big commitment, but for me it was worth it. Wow, I have never heard that before.  \n\nSoft tissue surgeries such as tendon transfers are usually less traumatic but they can only be done if there is no FIXED boney deformities. If there are then boney surgery is the next step (osteotomies and fusions). These are more traumatic though but still pretty useful as a treatment option at any stage of CMT. \n\nThere could be any number of reasons that surgery in any particular case is not recommended, but age is NOT one of them. Just to clarify, surgery will not make your feet look 'normal' depending on the extent of your high arches etc. I have had surgery on mine and while it helped for a few years before they slowly went back to how they were, at no point were they normal. Surgery is a mixed bag and does not always help. It is a long recovery period. Definitely do the research. Without knowing how bad your feet are misshapen is hard to give you advice. Can you describe how they \"went back\" because my doctors said that that would not happen. So lets say that my feet already have the high arches and cmt \"shape,\" is that considered a fixed boney deformity and is fusion really the only option? What kind of surgeries were they? It would depend on exactly what surgery you are looking at. Some pin the joints in place permanently, whilst others just put it back to normal and the muscle pulling can cause it to screw up again. The pes cavus (high arch) is not necessarily a fixed deformity, no. It becomes fixed when there is no flexibility in your foot to be able to partly manipulate your foot into a better shape by hand. That is something the surgeon can determine.\n\nI must stress that I am not a medical professional myself, I am simply a very knowledgeable and experienced person with CMT. \n\nI think that you need to see another surgeon for a second opinion. You are entitled to do this. Either all your current surgeon to transfer you, or your GP. u/DrBozzyBee and u/beatlerunningwater are correct.  Surgery is not about correcting the appearance of your feet. This can be a bonus side effect to the surgery but is not the primary aim. \n\nSurgery aims to improve function and/or reduce pain.\n\nAdditionally, they are partly correct regarding your feet \"going back\" too. CMT is a degeneritive condition. This means that it gets gradually worse over the years. Whilst surgery can certainly improve things for the better, nothing can halt the progression of your condition. This means that your feet will continue to change shape regardless. Fusions are certainly permanent, yes, but the changes in your condition will continue to affect your foot shape, function and pain. Have you seen an orthotist? Bracing is often the first step and can be highly effective. I got my toes broken and straightened in 2016 and each foot had me out for 3 months each time. Lost a lot of muscle in my legs since I could not put pressure on them for at least 6-8 weeks. Overall, my toes do not bleed from toenail problems, but no movement at all in my toes(even though I could not really move them initially, but it was a little better) and the feeling is gone, unless it is painful enough. Got leg braces after the surgeries and they have helped a lot. Toes are starting to curl a little but not as bad as I imagined. I basically exchanged one discomfort for a lesser one. Keep getting different outlooks like this though. Best of luck! My surgeries involved these procedures\n\n(\n\nIn this study, the average patient age was 28, and the surgeries resulted in improved function and reduced pain for most of the patients. I know the terminology is technical, but I highly recommend using google and youtube to get a basic understanding of the anatomy and surgical options. Knowledge is power. My feet only look a little different after surgery and to be completely honest, (although I am my own worst critic) just uglier because now there is scars added to the mix... I had surgery in the midst of puberty and have no regrets. It really helped. I am 24 now and whenever I see the doctor, he says my tendon transfers are still doing their job nicely. I am no doctor, but I have never heard of puberty being a factor. First set of reconstructions \u201883-\u201884. (19 yrs)\n\nSecond set of reconstructions \u201809-\u201810 (45 yrs)\n\nCurrently recovering from left foot metatarsal head resection and Achilles lengthening (my 2nd). (55 yrs)\n\nSurgeries have added stability on flat &amp; even surfaces. Pain is pretty constant to various degrees, but I do not remember life before that. \n\nHopefully this current surgery will let me wear AFO\u2019s (I would experience extreme pain after 90 minutes -L and 180 minutes-R). In PT they really helped my gait &amp; stability. \n\nI hate that the \u201cgood\u201d outcome is just to be able to wear braces, but balance &amp; stability are becoming increasingly important as I age. This surgery was one week ago tomorrow!", "Questions for hereditary So my dad had cmt, he actually did not having neuropathy and seizures until he was in his 40\u2019s. \nIt was very slow progressing until it was not. Doctors did not know what was wrong with him(despite the highest arched foot I have ever seen and hammer toes) they just kept testing him for diabetes over and over and over.\nI actually came across it by accident and had him diagnosed. \nMy father recently passed away and I was wondering if it was the stress of the hurricane or if it could be the disease,(idk just trying to make sense of it) but anyways I seen all the types and the symptoms and now I am wondering if I inherited it? \nI easily lose feeling sitting cross legged, my hands and especially my feet get super cold all the time (despite taking iron), (slow)progressive hearing loss, losing my balance, leg and feet cramps that were so bad I caught a couple in my sleep and thought someone was actually killing me, IBS. I do not have arched feet or hammer toes though. \nDo yall think I am being a hypochondriac?\n(I am on mobile excuse any mess ups please) I do not think you are wrong to be concerned but not all of the symptoms you mention are associated with CMT (at least not any type of CMT I can think of off the top of my head). CMT does not give people seizures. Nor does it give people IBS. CMT does not usually mean someone will die earlier than without it, either.\n\nFor most types of CMT the chances that you will have it if one parent has it are 50-50. With the issues you describe, I do think it is worth consulting a doctor about. I had seen a couple studies that some patients develop seizures. My dad never had seizures until he got pretty bad. He died Saturday at 63. But all these symptoms I had seen in support groups, organization pages, even medical pages too But it is crazy that he just developed it out of the blue like he did. Yeah he was born with the high arches and hammer toes but everything happened WAY later in life and his parents did not have it nor do any of his siblings &gt;I had seen a couple studies that some patients develop seizures.\n\nAre you thinking of MS? CMT does not affect the brain, this is the first time I have ever heard anyone say anything about seizures. And I have been reading CMT literature since the 80s.\n\nAs for  whether you have it it is impossible for any of us here to know. Your symptoms are not uncommon in the average population. You do not have to have high arches or hammer toes to have CMT. Some people live all their lives and do not find out they have it until they are older. One of my uncles is in his 80s and he just got diagnosed with CMT. This after running marathons and living a normal life. There is a very wide spectrum of symptoms and progression. It is not uniform for everyone.\n\nYou would need to get tested there is not much that anyone here could really tell you either way other than point you to a Dr. :-) No I am not. Scientists are still trying to figure out if it is related to CMT1A (it is still rare amongst patients but it happens) or if people just so happen to have two separate disorders at once. \n\nThank you &lt;3 I appreciate you telling me that. Just a bit scared, I watched my dad go from this 6ft something 300lbs weight lifter to a man who was wheelchair bound and maybe weighed 140? Part of both his feet ended up getting amputated cause he developed ulcers on the bottom of his feet and caught MRSA. His left foot took it the hardest, it was very contracted, no movement what so ever. Right foot had some range of motion but not much Do you know what type of CMT? What did \"had him diagnosed\" actually entail? The most common ones have no mechanism of causing seizures, and it is rare for them to cause bowel issues beyond those that come from general poor health/lack of movement. (  \n\n\nReferences 2 other instances of CMT + seizures. But all were present in early life. It seems just as likely that the person has CMT  and a separate seizure disorder. The case report indicates developmental delay different to the standard sucking at walking and playing. This kind of sudden onset and rapid deterioration is \\*very\\* uncharacteristic of CMT. \n\nI cannot speak to the details of what happened to your father, as I do not know his medical history in full and I am not a doctor. I do suspect that there was something more than CMT going on there, though. \n\nYou only mentioned CMT in general before but then referenced CMT1A; do you know what type he had? Did he have a genetic test? I agree that the rapid deterioration is very uncharacteristic of CMT. That is the sort of thing you see with ALS-- it can be slow and then sudden rapid deterioration. My dad and I have CMT (CMT1X), so when my mom got ALS, we were very familiar with the way it affected her arms and legs. I describe ALS as CMT on speed. But it also affects more which kills you (which is unlikely with CMT). \n\nOP, If your dad had CMT, it could be worth getting genetic testing. It will help if you know which type he has (you mentioned CMT1A) so you can understand inheritance patterns. Was your dad ever tested for CMT? If he tested positive, insurance should cover testing for you. Idk if he was ever formally tested. We had seen online that is some types do not show up on tests and that could of messed with insurance and disability stuff. Doctor recommended not getting tested and he would keep it diagnosed as idiopathic neuropathy or cmt unknown type.\nI was not told which one was it kept as Idk if he was ever formally tested. The doctors recommended against it because it could of messed with his insurance and disability. He is had mild symptoms since birth but never thought anything of it. It was only when he settled down (stopped working out, stopped walking so much, and gained weight) did it start to cause the main issues. \nThe navy actually wanted to kick him out back in the day because of his feet, but he told them it did not cause him any pain so they kept him. (70\u2019s) This stuff is so exhausting. My dads dad was adopted so we do not have a clue about possible genetic issues. My brother did the 23 and me test and it only showed high disposition for diabetes and hypertension. \nBesides the shit show on my moms side, we have to deal with this now.\nThanks for responding \ud83d\udc9a It sounds like your father's doctors did they best they could to manage his illness but navigating around insurance requirements did throw a bit of a wrench into the works. \n\nIt is entirely possible that your father did not have CMT at all. Or that he had CMT and also something else. \n\nFor your own peace of mind, consulting a neurologist to determine if you inherited CMT (or something else!) might be a good idea. I also think you may have more going on than CMT.\n\nMy Dad and I got our own \"whole genome sequencing\" done.  It is getting to be really cheap, $99 now from (   It explained a lot of issues for us (kidneys).  It did not explain our neuropathy, except that we do not have a \"known\" type of CMT.   I was well worth it for us, but it is hard to understand if you do not have some medical knowledge.  A neurologist can also run a genetic test panel, but it only looks at a handful of known gene variations that are known to affect nerves.\n\nAs far as the circulation in your legs, have you tried compression stockings ?  They can be very helpful.\n\nI am sorry about your Dad, 63 is too young.  For your sake, you should find out as much as as you can about what killed him, it should help you avoid the same fate.\n\nMy Mom had seizures that were caused by the bladder control medicine that a doctor gave her.  Check if any of your Dad's medicines were ( \\-- those could be the source of his seizures.   I give my Mom choline supplements and she has never had another seizure.   Doctors can be really stupid about these things sometimes. Sorry I am late replying but thank you, I really appreciate this info", "Recommended protein intake for severe CMT Hello, i am 26 years old and i have severe CMT (none of the known types). I was searching for protein intake recommendations and i could not find anything. Does anyone have any suggestions or any research to share? Also i should add that i exercise quiet regularly.  Thank you in advance. I have been drinking Ensure (meal supplement) for years. 16 g of protein, 160 calories and it tastes way better than anything else I have tried. I used to drink one daily during the day. It is particularly helpful when I am too tired to eat. If you are going for a more potent workout shake then I am not the one to ask. I do not know of any recommendation for protein intake specific to CMT. \n\nPersonally, I work out regularly and try to follow general muscle-building exercise guidelines for protein intake. I am not very strict about it but it seems to work for me. Protein intake depends on how hard you are hitting the weights, how active you are etc.  But as mentioned the usual body building formula works out ok, the old .5 to 1g per pound.  If you want to track more then just protein then we need to ask questions about you and a few other things.  \n\nAs an example I am hitting around 200g a day and weight about 100kg, or 220 pounds. thanks for the reply. I am a competitive swimmer so i swim almost everyday. Also i hove really low bodyfat (i am 55kg). So taking all these into account, i guess i should be around 2g per kg or 1g per pound. Do you want to bulk up or maintain?  A lot of body builders would suggest a 1g protein for 1lb if bodyweight if trying to bulk.  I am 172lbs so that would put me at 172 g of protein a day.\n\nIn reality I never hit that, I probably average around 100g of protein a day and that is with trying to eat a lot of it. Getting to 1g per lb is difficult for me even with protein shakes. That said I am lifting 4-5 times a week and still put on muscle.  I have no idea about changes to make due to CMT though.\n\nAlso my college nutrition professor used to quip that excessive protein is bad for the liver and not to do 1g to lb, do not really know too much about that but it works for me since I find eating 170+ grams of protein a day to be impossible. i would say that i want to increase lean muscle mass. i feel that i am not eating enough protein but on tthe other hand i dont know if my muscles are going to utilize the protein (because of cmt). \"Lean muscle mass\" is mostly just being lean.  If you want to be lean I would focus more on tracking your body fat percentage and getting it below 15%, ideally below 10% if you really want to be lean.  \n\nI have focused on \"bulking\" before and never could get my wrists or other joints to lift heavy enough for the muscles to show the way I wanted through my body fat.  I am now more focused on getting below 10% body fat and accepting I will be a bit low on muscle mass compared to \"the average person\".\n\nI would say to focus on getting around .6-.8 grams protein per pound, but also to keep track of your sugar and saturated fat intake.  Cutting back on sugar is one of the easiest ways for most Americans to lose weight/ become more lean.  Try not to get more than 35g of sugar a day and that should help a lot with getting your body to burn the fat and look more lean\n\nEdit:  Also I have no idea if CMT affects how our bodies utilize protein to build muscle My sons hand and arm strength are very weak and his occupational therapist recommended protein shakes just before his exercises, so I am sure they can only help! There is no recommend dose, however there is a limit. Any more than 200g of protein a day will increase your risk of bowel cancer so basically stay under that amount and you will be fine. I would speak to a registered dietician about this. They know dietary sciences and help make meal plans for all kinds of conditions and situations. Also I would check in with a physical therapist and occupational therapist for exercises and help with keeping yourself safe. They also help with pain issues. I stick to a keto diet. Startch makes me hurt more. I cannot take anti inflammatories and starch increases inflamation.

A previous phase 2 trial has shown preliminary evidence of efficacy for PXT3003 in treating CMT1A. This phase 3, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study further investigated the efficacy and safety of high- or low-dose PXT3003 (baclofen/naltrexone/D-sorbitol \\: 6/0.70/210 or 3/0.35/105) in treating subjects with mild to moderate CMT1A.  \nMethods  \nIn this study, 323 subjects with mild-to-moderate CMT1A were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 5 mL of high- or low-dose PXT3003, or placebo, orally twice daily for up to 15 months. Efficacy was assessed using the change in Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale total score from baseline to months 12 and 15 (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints included the 10-m walk test and other assessments. The high-dose group was discontinued early due to unexpected crystal formation in the high-dose formulation, which resulted in an unanticipated high discontinuation rate, overall and especially in the high-dose group. The statistical analysis plan was adapted to account for the large amount of missing data before database lock, and a modified full analysis set was used in the main analyses. Two sensitivity analyses were performed to check the interpretation based on the use of the modified full analysis set.  \nResults  \nHigh-dose PXT3003 demonstrated significant improvement in the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale total score vs placebo (mean difference:\u2009\u2212\u20090.37 points; 97.5% CI \\; p\u2009=\u20090.008), and consistent treatment effects were shown in the sensitivity analyses. Both PXT3003 doses were safe and well-tolerated.  \nConclusion  \nThe high-dose group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint and a good safety profile. Overall, high-dose PXT3003 is a promising treatment option for patients with Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease type 1A.\n\nLink found on October 19, 2021 via *manual review* of ( (which will be \"unpaused\" and back up-and-running before December 1, 2021).", "How many know that CMT runs in their family? My husband (47M) was diagnosed as a child but it was a long discovery process since no known family members had CMT. He had high arches and walked on his tiptoes and a young kid. No living relatives of his showed any sign of this disease. He became estranged from his father in his teens and is not close with that side of the family, so it is possible there are family members he is unaware of to have a history of CMT.\n\nWe have two children and neither of them have CMT.\n\nI have always been curious how prevalent it is in families, and if the chances of passing it on decrease with new generations. I would love to hear your experiences. The chances of passing CMT along depend on what kind it is. You do not say if your husband knows what type he has. \n\nFor the most common type, type 1A, there is a 50/50 chance of passing it along. The odds of having two children who are both unaffected by one parent having this type of CMT is 25% by the way. \n\nThere are other types which are less likely to be passed along. There are some recessive types which can only be passed along if both parents are at least a carrier of the gene. And X-linked types which can be a little more complicated in that sex can play a role in how severe one's case is. \n\nI come from a large family and type 1A runs in my family. There are a number of cases in my family, most of them mild. For a long time they were all undiagnosed. I think one particularly severe case got diagnosed properly when I was very young and everyone else got diagnosed within a few years following that as they sorted out that this was why so many of them were known to be rather clumsy. Unknown type (not 1A). My grandmother had it, my mom was the only one of 4 kids that has it (that we know of so far anyway), my sister and I have it out of 3 kids. I have not had children yet but reading your post made me more optimistic about trying naturally. I am really on the fence at the moment with what to do. I have been considering IVF as I have been told chance is 50/50 and if it skips the baby may be a carrier for their children instead. I am not against having children with it at all, and will love them regardless but obviously I would prefer they can avoid early physio splints etc I had to have as a child. I am not sure what type you have, but assuming type 1A or another dominant inheritance type, the odds of passing it on are indeed 50/50 but I want to say a word about carriers. \n\nBasically, the only way you can have a \"carrier\" of a dominant sort of CMT (like 1A) is to have the gene but be asymptomatic. Which is uncommon, but the point I want to make here is that a carrier would be part of the 50% \"with\" CMT. \n\nSo the odds that a child would not have CMT at all and none of their children would be at risk of inheriting it, are still 50%. The possibility that someone could be a silent carrier is already part of the 50% who inherited the gene.

Also, how helpful would custom insoles be for calluses? \n\nThanks in advance! Custom insoles definitely help with calluses. Honestly, I think most people on this subreddit have orthotics since CMT leads to funky feet. Better foot support is not a bad idea for anyone. Custom insoles made it worse for me. Self treatment is fairly risky if you have poor sensation, but a good pumice stone every day in the shower can do the job. I have had luck with the Dr. Scholls callus removers. Give the inserts a try and lotion often! Try to pumice and then follow up with lotion every night before bed or something. In a week or so, you may notice an improvement. Get a callus grater first.  I also have a separate dollar shave club razor head specifically for my calluses.  The razor works like a charm, but go easy.  Third, get extra thick foam insoles.  Believe it or not, I used to use a d-cup bra insert...my calluses are on my 5th metatarsal.

Stick with the really cheap extra thick ones. Pumice, sandstone, emery or other abrasives are your best bet.  Make sure to soak first, and keep a VERY close eye as you work away at callus.  It is very easy to go to far and not realize if you are doing something else (watching tv, podcast, etc).  Personal recommendation is Eucerin.  Shit breaks down callus like cola on rust, but you *HAVE* to pay attention to the work.  With any feeling issues or numbness it is an eyes-on job. I use lotion every day and file them down occasionally if they get to be too much. Definitely get a good callus scraper. I have trouble with pressure sores, so I have to keep them sanded down. \n\nAgree on all the posts in the lotions. Try some creams that are good for diabetes. I have had good luck with O'Keefe for cream. \n\nAlso, if you have to debride the callus, do not use s knife. Amazon sells scalpels.

Having gone through a lot of the official CMT websites, they seem to range from average to flat-out useless with regards to explaining CMT and giving advice to people with CMT. \n\nHave other people here found this to be true as well? What would you want from a website dedicated to helping improve the lives of people with CMT? Shoe recommendations. My god is it hard to find shoes my feet can fit in, that are comfortable, supportive, do not wear out in 2 months and actually look good.\n\nI know it seems trivial but it is so hard to find good looking shoes for people with CMT. I find that the CMT Facebook groups are good for exchanging information with other people with CMT. I have never seen much use for CMT websites other than the toxicity lists. That is the whole issues I would like to fix; having all the information silo'ed in different health forums, Facebook groups etc makes it hard to find one place that has a good amount of information for people with CMT. \n\nIn the UK, I have been told the toxicity list on the US CMT website is mainly \ud83d\udca9, and if that is all a website can provide, there is definitely room for improvement! Side note: DCs are amazing. I wear AFOs on both legs and use to have to wear New Balance (hated them, but they work to if that is more your style), but for 5+ years, I buy a pair of DCs that lasts up to 2 years. Saves money (20$ to 55$ a pair), looks great, and I have worn them to interviews and work. Only thing is, if you have a hard time with heels, breaking them in is hard. I usually wear a pair that are worn in and break in the others on my downtime. But, definitely an option to consider.\n\nEdit: grammer I like wearing Nike Air force 1, got like 4 pairs of them Who told you that? It is not just a USA list after all. I wear air Jordans exclusively. I buy 3 sizes up from my actual size. They do not wear at all really. Obviously they cost alot but when you factor in buying the same pair of cheap shoes again and again it evens out. A specialist neurologist working on the leading department for CMT in the UK. In short, theres one proven problematic drug: Vincristine. The rest fall under minor/uncertain, negligible/doubtful risk aka not proven to be an issue. I used to wear DCs but the tops of my toes rubbed pretty bad in them as my hammer toes got worse. I appreciate the info though. Thank you. Thanks for the feedback. How is the height of the toe box in these? One of my biggest issues is my toes not fitting or rubbing because they are hammer toes. Thanks for the feedback. How is the height of the toe box in these? One of my biggest issues is my toes not fitting or rubbing because they are hammer toes. Wearing a half size to a size bigger helps tons. I wear 8.5w in men, but I am a 6 reg without my afos. If the DCs are good, New Balance also has shoes that give more room, have removable cushions inside, and some have zippers (loved these). Zappos are a higher end shoe, but they are also geared towards people with afos and prosthetics. Is not that list based on a drug simply having a potential neurotoxic side effect? So the risk is not higher in CMT, it is just that the impact of a bad neuro event would be worse. Mine are the exact same. Buying the 3 sizes up means that my toe does not go to the end and is in the higher part of the shoe. It will take done getting used to but it is much more comfortable eventually :) Link to the cure Specialists/ doctors in your state/ region that could diagnose... that is one of the bmost asked questions I see here. I wear New Balance running shoes at a wide width... works for me for and a lot cheaper. They last me quite a while and the quality for the price is pretty good in my opinion. In my case, they fit just right. One thing I have never really seen said is that alcohol is REALLY bad if you have CMT. I was struggling to walk at all (I did have an alcohol problem so was drinking at least a bottle of wine a day) After giving up alcohol my neurologist wrote a letter to my GP stating how the peripherals neuropathy had improved. This was like a gift from the gods for me as I thought it was CNT causin the neuropathy and had imagined a miserable life ahead. New balance are great but the totally elasticated panels do not suit me as much as lace ups they seem to aggravate the nerves or make he shoe lass flexible. Does that make sense? I feel like it does not make sense to your average person who has no idea about CMT ? CMT does and will cause neuropathy. If someone diagnosed you with CMT without the proper tests while you were suffering from alcoholism, someone did not do their job properly. The nerves in my feet are pretty shot from my type of cmt... I have little to no feeling outside of the ticklish sensation No I was diagnosed with CMT from a blood test and it runs in my family so it came as no surprise. The neuropathy was made worse by the alcohol misuse so everyone did their jobs effectively. Apparently the list, and this is summaring an expert, is extremely exaggerated and in all likelihood will not be useful for someone with CMT as there is no proven case where those medicines have negative impacted someone with CMT. Most sites do not even list or talk about my type (2F) so maybe some more info on the rarer types would be nice. Also all the differences between the different types; usually the sites I see just have one general list of symptoms but all the different types have different symptoms associated with them.\n\nAnd also a list of CMT experts or places where you can get tested; my mom fought for years and years to get tested because she had figured out it ran in our family, finally went through all the tests and got diagnosed, and then I had to fight for over a year to get tested even with my symptoms and 50% chance of having it. I got tested by an expert in another state (I am in the US) for free because of some program she was doing to test kids of parents who are diagnosed. So information on those types of things would be good. That is a very US specific list which I doubt would be easy to gather, if possible at all. Your neuropathy will not have changed; if you could not walk it is likely because you were drunk which impacts balance and sensation, even in people without CMT. Your nerves would not have become better when you stopped drinking - nerve regrowth currently is not possible - but would simply no longer be impacted by extreme alcohol impairment. Nope I walked that way for months after stopping drinking. I will dig out the letter from consultant neurologist which states improvement in neuropathy AND cause. I would be super interested to know how they came to that conclusion - did they do any nerve testing? If alcohol is that damaging for people with CMT, its something that unquestionably should be highlighted to the community. You may be waiting a while for that... Alcohol in and of itself can cause peripheral neuropathy. I work in drug and alcohol and many people get nerve damage and shuffle around (especially after years of drinking. Sometimes the damage is irreversible but luckily I stopped in time) I do still have neuropathy but it is so much more improved. As I said alcohol should definitely be highlighted on CMT websites.  Reading about  alcoholic neuropathy, i am not sure it is really relevant. as it is caused by  long term excessive drinking of alcohol, it does not seem to be related to CMT. Not being an alcoholic is generally good advice for anyone, just as you would say not being overweight is good advice, with the impact of both being amplified if you have CMT. When people talk about alcohol, they will think about drinking moderate amounts; saying \"warning; CMT and alcohol do not mix\" is sending the wrong message, while saying \"do not be an alcoholic\" is just common sense. &gt; Also all the differences between the different types\n\nThere are about \\~60 different types, while only four (CMT 1A, B, CMTX1 and a form of CMT 2 that I cannot remember) make up the majority of CMT patients (over 90%). Unfortunately trying to find information for all types would be phenomenally time consuming and serve a very small percent of the CMT population. I see your point but many people do not realise how much alcohol is \"excessive\".  I see people on a daily basis who have drank \"excessively\". It is easy to do a couple of glasses of wine after work every night. That is considered too much\nso I think it is worth a mention. \nIt is always good to be aware and I do not think it would harm to mention it in a CMT website. I certainly would have liked to have seen it. I think your forgetting that people who become alcohol dependant are some of the smartest people in society. I have worked with teachers, police, a counsellor and many many others who have become alcohol dependant. Common sense is not a factor I am becoming addicted to substances. Humans are far more complex than that and it is very naive to think otherwise. I am not sure on the US, but in Europe the recommend alcohol unit intake is printed on every single bottle. For wine, it is basically no more than one glass a night, and they are looking at making the recommendation even more strict. Yes alcohol is dangerous on so many levels and I see the damage too often. People can be beguiled by it is legal status and do not realise the many negative side effects. If alcohol was discovered today it woul be a Class A drug. Just simply discussing the differences between 1s and 2s would probably make a difference. Do not need to see that 1a is most common and it does xyz. Simple information about demylenating vs axonal cmt's would be good. Also, nearly every website suggests not drinking. Not because it will cause nerve damage, but because coordination is not great when sober, let alone when tipsy. A chat room/forum system would be great. There used to be a really good one ran by someone on here in the old vbul days, and so have more organised discussions about the location specific things without spam or cluttering a list info section. Page I made that automatically tracks CMT treatment-related news, research, clinical trials, and updates:\n\n**CMT Treatment Report**\n\n( So here is an interesting nugget of info about the types of CMT that I thought I would share in advance of the site going live - basically, the category and subtype of CMT are almost entirely pointless for all but learning how it is passed on to children. You can have CMT-1A, yet have symptoms of a subtype of CMT-2, and that applies across the entire CMT spectrum! There is one way that it is not \u201cpointless\u201d and that is that it is sometimes required that you have a genetic diagnosis in order to participate in research studies. Not everyone is going to want to do that, but if it is something you are interested in it is probably worth getting tested. Hold up, I never said genetic testing is pointless. In fact, it is the only way you can get a certain diagnosis!  The labelling applied to CMT types though is relatively pointless as it does not help dictate the symptoms someone may have or go on to develop \u2639\ufe0f Sorry if I misunderstood - I agree it does not make a great deal of difference, although it might actually have some implications for severity and long-term prognosis. Little is known about differences between the different CMT subtypes, but there may indeed be some some differences. We just do not know. I suspect science will continue to advance in this area and it may have implications for any future drug therapies, etc.\n\nMy dad is a doctor and he is said that neurology in general is a field that has a lot of advanced diagnostic tools but not many effective interventions outside of a few areas.", "Pharnext Announces FDA Fast Track Designation for PLEODRUG(TM) PXT3003 for the Treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A  According to ( source, the median approval time for drugs under fast track was a little under 250 days in 2017.\n\nThe time between FDA approval and getting the medicine into the hands of patients often takes several months though, and approval of packaging and manufacturing is one of several post-FDA approval challenges. But there are aspects of this treatment that I would imagine are Pharnexts favor, such as the fact that all of the individual compounds are well known and have individual FDA approvals for other indications. I also do not envision any major manufacturing challenges.\n\nI have been slightly skeptical about their claims since the start, but I want to believe. And right now, they certainly seem to be the closest to the finish line.\n\nWill it become available before the year is over? I am cautiously optimistic. This is good news, even if it might invalidate the last five years of my life as a graduate student Just a reminder to everyone, you can do pxt3003 now.  Just need a script for baclofen and naltrexone! Now I am curious, why is that?  I study the mechanisms that regulate transcription of the *Pmp22* gene in the hope that we can identify novel pathways that are important for achieving the healthy middle-ground level between HNPP and CMT1A  Are you working towards a dissertation? I would love to know more. If I remember correctly, the phase 2 study on PXT3003 demonstrated a dose-dependent improvement of about 10% in the highest dose group, but with some considerable variation in efficacy. Although it seems like they will be the first with a treatment, there is plenty room for improvement. That is if it actually works, one small phase 2 study is hardly enough to be sure. Yeah, I am working on a PhD at the University of Wisconsin. We just put out ( on my main project last year - the short version is that back in 2010 or so there were a couple of papers that showed that some patients with mild neuropathy were found to have smaller duplications of DNA regions near the *Pmp22* gene but not including the gene itself. Within the DNA sequence shared by these smaller duplications, we found evidence of a DNA domain called a super-enhancer, and found that when we deleted that super-enhancer using a system called CRISPR-Cas9, it had a pretty potent effect on reducing expression of *Pmp22* in our cell culture model, potentially explaining why patients who have a duplication including this super-enhancer might appear to have a mild form of CMT1A. We are working on a mouse model of this super-enhancer deletion right now and have gotten some pretty exciting early results - one long-term hope for this might be that we could identify biological mechanisms that require this super-enhancer to influence levels of *Pmp22* expression and that those mechanisms might be things that we can target with drugs. Wow! I remember reading the paper when it was published. I pretty much read anything where John Svaren are among the authors! :) I think modifier genes are really interesting in relation to CMT, not just for their potential as targets but also for their potential to explain the sometimes striking variation in presentation within affected members of the same families. One of the most enduring questions I have had ever since I got diagnosed has been why I am so much harder affected than my antecedents, and enhancer(s) is one of a couple explanation I know of that could help explain that. Some day I really hope I will find out. My mother (who had CMT1A) passed away a decade ago, but she left behind frozen tissue samples. I am still on the fence about whether or not to have them destroyed or keep them for future whole genome sequencing to try and answer that question.\n\nAs for the paper, one thing that stood out to me was that Pmp22-SE was particularly correlated with the P1 promoter. One of the concerns I have about future treatments aimed towards PMP22 is the possibility of unintentionally affecting PMP22 expression in the Oligodendrocytes. Unless I am mistaken, your approach seems ideal in that regard. How feasible do you think it is to create and effectively deliver transcription factors that only bind to Pmp22-SE enhancers? You may have seen it, but just in the last couple weeks there was a ( on a potential disease-modifying gene for CMT1A called SIPA1L2 - I am not sure how that might translate to the clinic, but I know from hearing John talk about it that the search for things that might explain differences in severity from patient to patient is something that the field seems really interested in.\n\nIt is true that PMP22 messenger RNA is produced in oligodendrocytes, but the ( and is not important for central nervous system myelination. It is still really interesting to us that this super-enhancer is biased toward the Schwann cell-specific P1 promoter, though! Early results suggest that this is true not only in cultured Schwann cells (as in the paper) but also *in vivo* in peripheral nerve.\n\nWhile it is possible to create \"artificial\" transcription factors by splicing together different DNA sequences, I have not heard of any cases of transcription factors being used therapeutically - I would think they would be very hard to deliver to the nuclei of patients' cells and hard to control if they got there. It does not seem likely that targeting Pmp22-SE itself is viable, but we did quite a few experiments trying to figure out if we could identify any transcription factors that **only** regulate the gene through the super-enhancer - the last figure in the paper was one of these, and unfortunately, as in that figure, we have not been able to find anything yet.\n\n I have not seen that one, I am way behind on 2019 papers. :) They trickle in so frequently these days it is hard to keep up, and I am still playing catch up with the backlog. :) I am not at all surprised though, I have been expecting more ever since people started talking about modifier genes and I have a hunch that this is just the beginning. It is fascinating how the complexity of CMT1A just keeps increasing the more we learn about it, and I wonder how many more years of research it will take before the majority of the processes that are at play will have been described. I really want to understand how something as \"simple\" as an extra copy of a gene can give rise to so dramatic changes in our phenotype, and I really hope there will come a day when I feel like I have a complete (high level) understanding of the mechanism of this disease. It is really fun to read old papers and see how our understanding of CMT 1A have evolved over time, and it is amazing to see how actively CMT is being researched these days. For instance, I read some time ago a paper that claimed to show that PMP22 levels were highly variable among patients with CMT1A, and another one that indicated that elevated PMP22 protein levels might also cause developmental disabilities in Schwann cells. I think findings like these are really interesting, and I wonder if there are more to the demyelination-remyelination and/or dysmyelination theory for 1A than what we currently know. \n\nI did not know that PMP22 protein was not expressed in oligodendrocytes, that is just great!\n\nIt seems to me that a lack of precise delivery systems are a challenge for a lot of promising treatment approaches. My hope have always been and still is that we will get some kind of treatment soon that at least halts the progression without too many bad symptoms. That way we have time to wait for more precise treatments that might make use of future developments from other fields. It is mind boggling how much applicable research is being published these days. \n\nDo you think you could send me a copy of your paper? The figures are a bit mangled in the copy I have. \n\nAlso, what is next coming from you guys? And what are your thoughts on allosteric modulators (ADX71441 from Addex therapeutics) and the antisense oligonucleotides that Ionis Pharmaceuticals are pushing? Also, what is your take on drug synergy in relation to Pharnext? I have always tried to keep up with the literature on possible molecular functions of Pmp22 protein, and there is been some really interesting work on that, but a lot of what I have seen on that has been done in HNPP models and looking at what happens when there is a Pmp22 deficit, rather than in animal models of CMT1A. I would really like to see somebody figure it out someday, even if it comes long after there is an effective treatment for the disease!\n\nI would be happy to send you the paper - if you want to e-mail me at  I will send you a copy that is hopefully clearer.\n\nTo be honest, I am often in sort of a basic science bubble and do not really follow the clinical research that closely (I have not heard about ADX71441), but I do kind of hope that the antisense oligonucleotide therapy pans out - since those ASOs are specifically designed to target Pmp22 mRNA, I would hope there would be very low risk of side effects compared to typical small molecule drugs. I am sure the people working on it are keeping these things in mind, but something like that seems like it would be a huge potential issue with a cocktail like PXT3003. Regarding the drug synergy, I forget whose lab they were from but I did see a presentation at a scientific meeting last June that showed data seeming to demonstrate that the cocktail had a synergistic benefit compared to the individual drugs, but I am not really sure where that is at now (if I am understanding your question correctly).\n\nAnother major focus for our lab recently is understanding mechanisms for how Schwann cells respond to nerve injury - there is an interesting phenomenon that occurs after nerve injury where Schwann cells undergo a process called transdifferentiation and become what we call repair cells (unlike oligodendrocytes, which generally die after nerve injury). This transdifferentiation process involves an epigenetic switch that leads Schwann cells to express certain sets of genes that they otherwise never express, even in earlier development, and our next paper will probably be about trying to identify the proteins that are important for flipping that switch. I am not entirely sure how much this side of our lab pertains to CMT, but John has talked in the past about how one way to look at something like CMT1A is as a chronic nerve injury condition.

", "Do not Starve: Shipwrecked Day 6-12 ", "Variant of Uncertain Significance (CMT2N) Hello Everyone,\n\nI have been on quite a journey over the three years with many debilitating symptoms. Most of the doctors/specialists have been just as confused as I am. I recently invested in Invitae genetic testing for conditions that most closely matched my symptoms and the following VUS was found:\n\nA Variant of Uncertain Significance, c.155T&gt;C (p.Ile52Thr), was identified in AARS. The AARS gene is associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2N (CMT2N) (MedGen UID: 413754) \n\nI thought I would check in here to see if anyone else has this variant or knows anything interesting about it. I assume it does not support the diagnostic process as a VUS? I have a lot to learn and a lot of reading to do. \n\nI am mentally and physically exhausted from my symptoms and this process, so any helpful words are appreciated. I will see a genetic counsellor soon, but I do not have access to a geneticist. \n\nTIA! Hi, I just want to start by saying I do not have CMT myself, but I am a geneticist that researches CMT. VUS are really hard to interpret without someone doing a bit of work in a lab. If you would like to research out to someone with an interest in AARS, I would suggest Professor Anthony Antonellis as he is very interested in this class of genes and might be able to help.\n Hi there, I just got my invitae back and I am in the same exact boat as you, I hope someone has more info! I and my mother have a different mutation on AARS, but ours is a known pathogenic variant. There does not seem to be much info available on this type of CMT. Our disease severity is probably what I would call mild to moderate. I wear AFOs as my legs are much more severely affected (I have almost no measurable problems with my hands or arms). It is mostly only my lower legs that are weak; I also have very poor balance. My legs above the knee are unaffected so far.\n\nProbably impossible to tell how yours might be different just from the finding of a VUS, but I am curious if you find out anything of significance since it is the same gene. Thanks so much for this! I looked up your colleague and sent an email to his office, it would be so great to connect with him!  Thanks for the link, I have been sifting through and suggesting as much research as possible and id like to leave no stone unturned. I would be thrilled to be part of any kind of research of the opportunity ever presents as well. Cheers! Hello, when you say \"same boat\" so you mean same VUS identified or same gene? I would like to share any of my findings with you. From an objective point of view this is fascinating stuff, but I really just wish I could find more info on the gene mutation found! Thanks for your message, sounds like you have maintained mobility which is awesome, but still so hard with the weakness etc. I am sure! I will keep you posted, I have found some research on the Aars1 gene, if I find anything interesting I will let you know! Hi there, yes, VUS, heterozygous for this gene and my neurologist either does not know much or just does not know much because by his words \u201cit must be not a bug deal since the lab did not want to do familial testing\u201d and now will not answer any more questions till my appointment in December this all sounds idiotic to me so I am hoping some more information just falls out of nowhere and here we are, so please, if you find out something else, let me know I would really appreciate it. I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and of of course I have most of these symptoms so I am pretty scared at this point. I understand you frustration all too well! Have received some interesting info from others interested in the gene. These are NOT medical professionals, but I was able to verify through research database etc. I will post some of the snippets here;\n\n\"It is been reported in CMTers who have a clinical axonal CMT, which could be either 2N or AARS1-dHMN. Prediction algorithms do not agree on the potential affects the variant has either. One says it would be harmful, another says it would be harmless, and another is inconclusive.\"\n\nMy understanding is that it is ultimately a nerve conduction study that will lead a doctor to decide whether this variant is likely causing problems for me. It was also suggested to me that one reason this mutation presents as uncertain is because the mutation could cause problems (or not) based on how it interacts with other genes that the other people with the mutation may or may not have. So they might not have symptoms because they do not have other genes that I do that interact with it and cause the problems I have, OR those with the variant without symptoms might have the symptoms eventually but did not at the time of testing, or this particular mutation is benign and the people with the mutation that have symptoms is merely a coincidence. \n\nMaybe if we find enough of us with this variant with symptoms the classification could change (I have no idea if that is how it works, but it would still be cool). \n\nI did not include my symptons in my original post because, too many words, but maybe you and I could compare? \n\nIn addition to CMT2N, the AARS1 gene has been associated with AARS1-Distal Hereditary Motor Neuropathy which appears more common than 2N and also describes my symptoms, I was told it falls under the CMT umbrella despite the name difference...\n\nMy symptom onset was in my early 30's (aside from a lifetime of ankle sprains and clumsiness). My pain and weakness started in my right arm with my ulnar nerve (pinky and ring finger and wrist) and spread where it has mostly affected, in my neck, scapula, arms and hands, but I do get tingling and prickles in my feet and have had them give out on a few occasions. I also have some trouble swallowing. There is not but that is what cannot to mind as most relevant. Truthfully, I am not sure if I have progressively gotten worse since onset, because at symptom onset all of the muscles in my neck and scapula went so tight and I could barely move. My muscles are less tight now, but the extent of my weakness, numbness, twitching, tingling etc is ever present but does have periods when it is significantly worse than others, often triggered by increased activity but not always.\n\nLong post I know!

Getting a diagnosis can be an emotional experience, but I think it is a really important part of taking control over and coming to terms with our disease. Information is power, and getting a diagnosis is the first step in informing your self about your situation. From your description it does not appear that you have had a gene test. With a family history, a neurological examination and possibly an NCV-test that might not be needed, but I would bring it up with the neurologist if he/she does not. I think there is great personal value in knowing exactly what genotype you have, it helps remove any and all uncertainty and gives you a target to focus on. I would also talk about disease progression and management options, and if possible consider schedueling a follow up consultation. The disease progression depends partially on the genotype, but even within families there can be significant variation. So comparing your self with other diagnosed members in your family to try and predict your own future progression can result in very inaccurate predictions. Should you feel like it I highly recommend talking about CMT with your family or someone you are close with, it is not good to botyle up these thoughts and feelings inside. People without CMT even when trying their best often cannot fully relate so it can be a great relief to talk to others you know have the disease.  My intent when calling my dr was to ask about a genealogist. But I did what everyone does when talking to their dr and just agreed and said \u201cyes, okay, thanks\u201d over and over.  I will bring it up tomorrow. Cause it does seem to very across my family. Some are crippled and some are not just loads of pain and dexterity issues.  I find it useful to write down questions beforehand and bring them with me on a piece of paper. Your neurologist is probably going to ask about your family history, so it could be useful to ask your family members who have been diagnosed some questions beforehand. Things like when they were diagnosed, what tests they took, and if they were told they had a specific type (1A, 1B, 2, etc). You might have to do a nerve conduction study, but it is fairly quick and nothing to worry about. They will probably look at your feet so it is a good idea to make sure your nails are trimmed. I forgot once and I had really ugly long toe nails, I was a bit embarassed. :) Hey! I just browsed past this thread again. Did it go okay? Thanks for checking in. My first meeting with the neurologist went a bit more revealing than I thought. I always thought the major problem was my hands but she grabbed my toes and had me close my eyes tell her what direction she was moving them up or down. I failed miserably even though I thought I was spot on. There were also some tests with cold metal and a vibration that I also did poorly with below the knee. After some talking of family history and the tests that day she felt confident in diagnosing CMT. So I went and had the pmp22 test before heading home (that was a lot of blood) I never got an email telling me what came of that but I have a nerve test coming up on the 16th of May. Hopefully after that I will know the type and what the future looks like.   Right now I am on a low dose of Gabapentin and flexeril. But since starting the medication I actually find myself feeling different, worse even than before. I have failed those toe tests too, I actually found it kind of scary that I could not feel as much as I thought I could in my big toes. I am more careful about my big toes now that I know I cannot really rely on feeling pain in them if something were to happen. So I am a bit careful about not wearing shoes too tight, not letting my feet get wet and cold, and generally checking my toes to see that they are fine more than I probably would have done if I had normal sensation in them.\n\nI hope the gene test and the nerve test will be conclusive, because it is always easier for both you and the neurologists to address the symptoms when you know exactly what is going on.\nYou should definitely mention how the medication makes you feel on your next visit, and keep in mind that there are a lot of other medications for both pain and cramps that are effective and could be tried out. And perhaps if it is possible it could be a good idea to try out just one medication at a time? That way it will be easier to know what medication cause what symptoms and decide if it is worth it to keep using it. Also keep in mind that Flexeril should not be administered for longer than a couple of weeks! Yeah admittedly I had a few stressful panic attacks through the rest of the day about the tests.  \n\nI stopped taking the flexeril this morning. I have been thinking it is the biggest part of why I feel worse. Brought it to work with me just in case but I do not think I am going to need it.", "Cmt is such jerk I am 33..i have cmt\nMy daughter has it and also a few cousins and my mom.\n\nI find out soon what type as we just did gen test..\n\nHaving cmt has been such a battle to me.\n\nI walk on the sides of my feet (outter)\nPeople kind of look at me funny and let us not start on my ugly werid feet.\nDoes cmt give you brain fog?does it make your entire body hurt?have zero energy..\nI am getting weaker.\nI have zero upper body \nHowever my legs are strong as hell\nI can easily bunch 250 and that is alot for me \nI am 222 and almost 5 7\nI dunno yall this shit has been a battle and I am tired of it.\nDoes it get worse?I.feels like it. I am having very thin legs and hands and foot drop too it is very hard to run and walk. The brain fog is because your mind has to work harder to manage your body. Your mind is figuring out how to use alternate muscles to do what the weak ones are supposed to do. Your mind is working to use your eyes to help maintain your balance because your feet are not sending any valid information about how your weight is distributed from moment to moment. Your mind is working to make sure you do not knock your coffee cup over because it cannot tell where your hands are exactly. Your mind is dealing with ongoing grief about things you could do yesterday that you cannot do today. Your mind is dealing with fatigue because trying to keep all that going when your muscles are exhausted is a huge challenge. Man I completely feel all of this! I am 30 and I have only been diagnosed in the last year. My weakness is my legs. My upper body is really strong but cannot even do a standing calf raise. This comment prob does not help much but at least you know I am right there with ya!\nbrain fog \u2705\nWhole body hurts \u2705 \nZero energy \u2705 I definitely hate the fatigue that comes with it. I can take the cramps and pain easier than my super low energy level. Everything wears me out and I have to plan my days around it. I am 41. Is this scientifically accurate? Curious to see studies that relay this information. Good question. I do not know of studies. This is (paraphrased) what I heard when I went to the CMT clinic. I did not use the term \u201cbrain fog\u201d but I was asking them why I was having so much trouble trying to work. They explained that I was devoting a lot more brain power to managing my CMT - altered body. I thought my struggle with malaise was something wrong with my character, and that I had somehow turned into a stupid and lazy person. \nThey reassured me, and explained how my brain was having to do a bigger job. \nWith the information they gave me, I have been able to adjust by limiting how and when I try to do work that requires cognition. For example, I do not try to dial a phone number when I am standing, because I know my brain is busy concentrating on balancing my body. Once I sit, the phone is not as confusing. I am \u201csmarter\u201d in the mornings, when my body is not as tired, because my brain is not so busy managing things like proprioception. \nI have also learned to avoid judging myself, self-pity, and complaining, because those take up too much brainpower and energy, too. Im sorry but I am in tears knowing I am not alone!most doctors make me feel so crazy when I speak on my pain and my no having energy.i work and I stand all day and the day after I am off I cannot move I look 100 trying to walk in the morning my legs are not skinny..in tired of being tired I am 33 and cannot barely keep up with my kids.im on perk 10 mg and 1200 three times a day gabapinton and I will be honest it does not help much.i am so happy to find more people with cmt. Please take extra good care of your feet. My husband, daughter and MIL (along with several others on my husband\u2019s side) have CMT. My MIL is 86 years old and is recovering from a stage IV pressure ulcer she developed on the outside of her foot. The wound was open to the bone. It has taken several months of care to get it healed up. Early intervention is key to preventing bigger problems. My mother had this same thing happened! I hope she is better. She is great she had to have a bone removed this was 20 years ago! There is a CMT clinic? Yes.  Google \u201cCMT Clinics\u201d.  I went to the one at University of Iowa, to see Dr. Michael Shy. Is it a one time thing to get a treatment plan setup or is it something you need to go to regularly so you need to live near one? I do not think there are any by me. In I am CT. One time. I may go back in a few years. It was a huge help for me to understand what was going on in my body and mind. I spent 1 day there. Lots of tests, lots of question &amp; answer. They were kind, too. They even had an orthotist evaluate and make recommendations about my braces. They did genetic testing and a hearing test and an EMG. It was great to go to a doctor that actually knew more about CMT than I do! They were able to do all that testing in one day?! It has taken me an entire year just to get an MRI and EMG done! Another 6 months to even schedule getting the blood test which is still awaiting insurance approval so another 2 months before I actually have any results. I wonder if they would accept all my results via fax and then do a tele health visit to just explain and educate me on everything. Who knows?  It is worth a try. I was there years ago, but maybe with the pandemic, one of the clinics is doing tele-health. I wish you good luck with all the medical complications.", "Cmt and diets \ndo you have a special diet? \nI am thinking about becoming a vegeterian but some people have told me in meat there is some good things for my health so i do not know haha\n\nI got so confused because i saw this and i was just wondering if its true-\n\nExercise can be difficult to sustain with CMT, as the muscles and joints are weakened and take longer to recover following exercise. Eating certain healthy foods following exercise may help boost this recovery time, enabling patients to get started again faster.\n\nThese have not been tested in clinical trials for CMT patients, but include:\n\nSpinach, which increases protein synthesis to enhance the muscle repair process.\nPineapple, which contains two enzymes, bromelain and papain, which reduce inflammation. Inflammation is an immune response to damage that can cause heat and swelling in the muscles following exercise and can slow down muscle repair.\nEggs, which are high in protein.\nGreen tea, which contains antioxidants and may help protect the muscles against damage during exercise and boost metabolism.\n\nso what is your opinion on this? is there any food that really helps?", "Advice Hi everyone\n\nWhat advice would you give to a younger self if you could? Keep up the weight loss. I was heavy, then lost a bunch of weight (granted, via an ED). I gained back more weight than I had began with. If I had lost weight in a healthy way, and kept it up. My CMT was not nearly as bad when I weighed less. I would advise my younger self to find a really good physical therapist earlier. Just a few sessions with a physical therapist who understood how to work with neurological disorders taught me how to exercise to strengthen my muscles without overdoing it and injuring myself. Regular exercise is great and I could have done more sooner if I knew how to pace myself properly. Get one of them sitting down jobs. THIS. And not only this, but some good stretches other than touching your toes and the push against a wall calf stretch. Dr always said \"make sure you stretch and exercise\" but until recently no one actually taught me HOW to stretch and exercise. As someone else said, visit a physical therapist ASAP to learn how to exercise and stretch properly. Also, find someone to get you the right kind of inserts and shoes. Makes a HUGE difference. I recently was referred to a pedorthist and he was a great help. Any articles or videos you could recommend? I do not have any that I have found or used. What helped me was at my last annual MDA clinic visit, my Dr. offered to write me a perscription for some physical therapy. And the therapist was who showed me. I would start with asking your Dr. for a script and maybe ask if they have recommendations for places to go for PT in your area. Getting enough sleep. Perhaps not everybody needs 8 hours but I know now from experience that I do. And doing a brief stretching routine in the morning. Hurry up and make your dreams a reality, in the future it might be to late. Be bold, be adventurous, take risks. If you want something you have to go get it, otherwise it will not happen. Travel, get out in the world, and test your physical and mental limits. Adapt this advice to your situation of course. Make your plans for the future based on the worst day you have ever had with CMT. It is progressive. If, on your worst day, you dropped things, fell, or needed extra help, then make arrangements now for that to be your \u2018normal\u2019 level of disability.", "Squats Hi everyone! Glad to have found this sub! \n\nJust wondering if anyone has had any luck being able to perform a \u2018deep\u2019 squat without heels lifting? I can sorta do one if I perform a sumo squat, but was just wondering if anyone else has any tricks and tips that might help me achieve this? \n\nThanks! \ud83d\ude0a I have not had much success with keeping my heels on the ground, but something I have done to make it more comfortable, is get a piece of normal 2x4 wood (or something similar at the gym, maybe a thick mat) and put it underneath your heels with your toes on the floor. Helps with balance and makes the squat a little more comfortable! Will give this a go - thank you! \ud83d\ude0a I recommend getting squat shoes (and you can buy high arch insoles to use instead of what they come with.) Do a lot of leg warm ups (elastic bands, kettle bell swings) and some leg stretches before doing squats. Also make sure you do one or two warm up squats (empty bar)\n\nThen try quoting. But, at the end of the day, do not really push yourself to go past 90. You do not get much out of it and realistically they are challenging for us to do.\n\nAlso make a v with your feet. That has definitely helped me. You can also try squating with a band around the knees (can help with balance I found)\n\nI have also found squating with a safety bar (not all gyms have them) help a lot with balance due to the counter weight. I will definitely have a look at the gym to see if they have a front safety bar. \n\nI will also have a look for some squat shoes! Thanks!! \ud83d\ude0a Nope, cannot squat safely and that is with mild CMT so I doubt anyone can.\n\nMy advice would be to stay away from using a squat rack and user a seated leg press, plate loaded leg press, and leg raise machines. Anything else and your going to risk bad form which will lead to injury and zero progression. You could also use two 45 lb plates, or other plates. I just feel a little more secure using something behind my heels that I can lean into! I have been using a bench behind me to sit on which has definitely been helpful, but I just want to change it up a bit. Will give the plates a go! I just elevated my heels (at home) slightly and I enjoyed the slight increase in my range of movement so I am super keen to try it at the gym. Thanks so much! Sometimes other CMT folks amaze me with their abilities! \n\nThat said, I cannot do squats myself. I do Glute Bridges as a more stable alternative to work those muscles. Other folks of similar ability who do not have access to a full gym but want to strengthen those thigh/glute muscles might want to consider that as well. \n\nI very much agree with minimizing the risk of injury. When I was younger I had a terrible habit of pushing too hard, injuring myself, and not being able to make any progress. It took a good physical therapist to adjust my attitude to work out less intensively and be able to gain strength effectively. No problem, Good luck :) I did this as well. I found though that if you can afford squat shoes, they are much better for this because the heel has a much more solid foundation and have a natural high heel to them.\n\nDoing this with regular shoes worked for me too but the squishy heel in most shoes caused me to cave my knees. They just were not firm enough. Awesome! Let me know how it goes! \ud83d\ude0a Oddly enough, I have had success with a Bosu ball. Flat side up. Practice near something you can hold on to though. I will use kettle bells or Smith machine. It is one of the only ways my glutes actually engage Oh wow, will give it a shot! Thank you!! I tried, and failed, but I do have exceptionally tight calf muscles. Also, you may want to be careful as people with CMT suffer more with hip issues such as impingements, which squatting will make much worse much quicker.", "Tell me about your AFOs Just found out from the podiatrist that I am going to need them.\n\nWhat kind? What do they look? What kind of shoes can you wear with them? Any recommendations for a kind that is easier to hide? Or any alternatives to full AFOs? I think it all depends on what the issue is.\n\nI used some when I played soccer. They went up to about half my shin length. They were a little bit bulky, so I had to get a cleets that were 2ish sizes bigger than my normal shoe size. \n\nMine were mainly used to provide stability. I played keeper and any time I punted the ball, my ankle that was grounded would roll. The braces kept them from rolling. They also had a little tension to help lift my foot for me (I have foot drop, but not super severe). \n\nI wore baggy pants and you could not really see them underneath. Sadly there at my house and I am away at college, so I cannot really give you a picture of them.\n\nI have relatives that use AFOs daily.  I have seen ones that are super thin and easy to hide. Some that do not go up all the way, others that actually attach to the outside of the shoe, etc.  Did you have any say in what kind they would be when you first got them? Yes. We went over alot of options and what would best fit my needs and wants. If you are not being given a choice or are not listening to you definitely need to find someone else. I can put in a very positive word for Ottobock carbon fiber orthotics.  I had full AFOs in my teens and found skater shoes to work really well with them. I was not really a skater but the shoes were typically wider and allowed for the AFOs to fit easier.  I have phatbrace brand. They are lightweight and customized but they use velcro straps which do not last very long.  \nDepending on your situation you may be able to use a standard AFO which is smaller and lighter and often works with most shoes.  My custom AFOs are very bulky so double depth shoes are needed.  There are very few manufacturers of double depth shoes so finding shoes is tough,  especially for women,  imo", "Cmt and new people How do you tell people about cmt? And how do they take it? \n\nBecause lately i feel anxious when i tell people about cmt and what is it. People start to read about it and then they start to see me more as a disease and less as a person with feelings. They start to act differently around me, they are getting nervous etc \nHow do you deal with things like that? My dad has always been super ashamed of his CMT and hides it from people, which he can get away with because he looks relatively normal. I was born with scoliosis as well and my CMT is a little worse than his so people always knew I was different. As a kid, I would introduce myself by telling people about my CMT, but as an adult it would be a little weird. I usually just wait till it comes up naturally. \n\nJust remember that you cannot control your genes and you cannot control people's opinions. And if they really see you differently after you tell them, they are not worth getting to know in the first place.\n\nSelf love is hard af, especially with a disability like CMT that can physically hurt you sometimes, but it is worth it! \n\nI am wishing you nothing but the best! And fuck anyone that looks at you as lesser because of something you cannot control! My good friends and my family and my partner know the details of my CMT, but I really see no reason to tell people I do not know intimately. Casual friends usually do not know, they just know I cannot walk very well and we leave it at that. Even at work, my bosses are aware I need some accommodations, but I do not talk about it with coworkers.\n\nI am a private person by nature and I always consider \"does someone need to know this information in order to interact with me?\" Usually not. It certainly does not affect my ability to do my job/checkout at a grocery store/go to lunch with a friend so why should I bring it up?\n\nIt is obvious that I walk differently, and I cannot walk very far, and sometimes I wear AFOs, but it is not my responsibility to explain every detail of CMT and how I cope with it to satiate some else's offhand curiosity. They can wonder if they want, I am not going to go around explaining it until we really build a firm level of friendship, trust, and intimacy. The CMT is certainly not the most interesting thing about me - or about you!\n\nIn short, do not feel like you have to explain yourself or tell anyone anything at all! They can wonder, that is fine. And if anyone really bugs you for details, they are not really worth knowing. I \u201ccame out\u201d about my CMT a few years ago, and it has made life so much easier. Most of my friends and family knew I was ill but it just was not discussed. I began by posting fact-memes on my social media with info blurbs about CMT in easy to understand format so it was not too overwhelming. \n\nThe only people I still struggle with is dating. I am in my late 30s and single, physically I present \u201cnormal\u201d except I cannot wear heels anymore and my hand strength and dexterity is shot, so I have trouble like\u2026 opening my own soda, using chopsticks, picking a penny up off a flat counter top, etc. I never know when is the \u201cright\u201d time to tell someone I am interested in dating. I do not want to be disingenuous, but I also do not want to open with, \u201cI am disabled with an incurable disease,\u201d and have them paint a wholly inaccurate mental picture before they even meet me. It is a dilemma! That is true. it is really hard to find someone who will accept it and will not judge you. i think we just have to keep trying and do our best. we never know what is going to happen next! I wish you the best of luck I own that shit! My CMT is only a part of me, not some disease. Most people do not ask about it, and if they do I give them the basic rundown. If they feel empathetic or saddened, I lighten the mood. I do not want people to feel bad for me, I want them to like me. My closest friends tend to forget I am disabled in the first place (despite the wheelchair and crutches).\nJust be you and people will not see a diseased person, they will see you. Totally with you on that!\n\nI always say to people that if I did not have CMT, it would not be fair for anyone else because I would be unstoppable. That always gets a laugh. Are you me? Haha. I am 35 and I have tried every approach. I do not know what is the right one!", "CMT, ALS4 or a dangerous mnd, in a limbo First of all, thank you for your attention. I am 19 yo male. My initial symptom was foot drop for no apparent reason. Then my emg showed mnd onset like results. My second emg confirmed denervation. But unlike ALS, denervation and wasting is bilateral and only in my legs, for now anyway. After i was diagnosed with t1 diabetes mellitus my doctor was quite sure that i have ALS4 (it seems like endocrine disorders and bilateral nature of my condition strongly resemble it), a non-aggressive and non-lethal mnd. So i will be tested for SETX and PMP22 genes. I knew about SETX but when i checked for PMP22 i found this disease called CMT. I have flat foot arch, severe scoliosis (15 degrees), twitching all over my body symmetrically, symmetrical weakness in my legs and foot drop. My uncles also have flat foot arc and hammertoes (which i do not have hammertoes but ive read that it is one of the indicators) so i am leaning towards CMT. I do not want to think about other morbid possibilities, what do you think? What this might be? My mother had type 1 diabetes and cmt and had very severe foot drop early on and scoliosis. My brother and I only have cmt, but he to has a very flat foot. My arch conversely is very high.  This does not necessarily help you with a diagnosis but does tell you how I have seen cmt present in my immediate family.", " On My Nerves - Small Irritations Weekly thread for the little CMT things bugging you this week I had the dropsies for a day or two. Shooting nerve pain would cause my hand to fail for a millisecond. Just long enough to drop...or spill.", "Solo Trip / Voyage Hey everyone! \n\nCurious to know if anyone here has traveled on their own to visit somewhere new.\n\nI would like to take a solo trip somewhere but I am nervous of running into issues during sight seeing where I may need help and will not have it available. I know I can do research beforehand for the places I plan to visit and I definitely will but would like to hear the experience of someone who is done this already. What are your specific symptoms? Weak leg muscles and poor balance. I am pretty independent but in cases where good balance is needed, I will struggle or cannot do it and hills/climbing is to difficult. I have similar symptoms. I solo travel often (Ireland, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan in the last year). Most modern cities have good public transportation so you can get around easy. Otherwise you just need to find activities that fit into your lifestyle. There is no \"right\" way to travel, so find the way that works for you. When I do encounter problems specifically related to my CMT I have never had trouble asking for help. If you are really nervous you can learn the words for \"elevator\", \"escalator\", and other helpful phrases beforehand so you can ask for directions if necessary. Got it! I thought about getting some trekking sticks. Do you use anything when you are traveling?\n\nAlso, from the cities you have traveled to, which did you find most accommodating/easy to get around? I do not bring ( specifically related to my CMT. If I am expecting inclement weather I bring a pair of \"approach\" hiking shoes which have a strong grip.\n\nThe most accessible city that I have traveled to is Tokyo. Japan in general is extremely easy to travel around. I have done a lot of international business travel on my own. \nExpect to need extra time to manage your fatigue. I used to plan for one day a week in my hotel room, resting. I used audiobooks to amuse myself, and picked up snacks I could eat so I would not have to go out to get food if I was too tired.\nBe sure you have easy access to drinking water. It can be hard for CMT folks to open and carry bottled water.  A day\u2019s worth of water is heavy!\nPlan ways to keep your feet &amp; lower legs warm on long flights.  I carry leg warmers and heavy socks. \nUse a wheelchair at every airport. Yes, I can still walk that far, but if I do, I will not have the energy to manage fun or business at my destination.\nGet a cane that folds up to be stored easily. I can walk without a cane, but I use one to keep from getting too tired. If I do not have to make as much effort to balance, I get to enjoy my surroundings more. A brightly colored cane can be helpful for walking in a crowd, because it helps to keep people (especially kids) from crowding or hurrying you. \nI try to sit down to do tasks that require me to concentrate or use my hands. It is too easy to make mistakes if I have to devote attention to balancing.\nAvoid Greece. It is a magnificent, gorgeous place, but it is built on a great big jagged rock.  Even nice hotels and restaurants usually have a big step up from the street to the front door. You can ask for a place with an elevator, but there can still be lots of unexpected climbing indoors and out.\nMunich and London are both pretty manageable, but London taxicabs are hard to get in and out of.\nBeware going anywhere that might have an unexpected ice storm. It is hard to manage balance on a slippery surface.\nI know I cannot walk in sand or snow, so I avoid those destinations.\nMy wheeled luggage has a handle that extends. I can balance myself using my suitcase like a cane. Be sure you can stack your luggage so you will not have to carry any bags. \nI hope you are able to use some of my travel tricks and that your trips are fun and easy for you!\n~ Follygolly I have been to Japan twice, going to Tokyo this year. Aside from falling on my ass once in the pouring rain CMT was never an issue for my endurance I would actually go on big mad treks but that is just me. I have traveled solo every year for about a decade now, all over the world. I much prefer it to traveling with someone, because you get to explore on your own and you can plan the trip around the things that interest you as opposed to having to compromise. If you speak English and have decent mobility, I think it is physically possible for most people to travel solo, but I do not have any experience with wheelchairs so take my advice with that in mind. You can compensate for some of the issues caused by CMT with the way you plan the trip and/or you can compensate by spending a little more to make the problems less of a problem. For instance you can pay for hotels/accommodations closer to what you want to see, paying for a taxi/solo transport instead of taking a train/public transportation, buying more expensive tickets to skip long queues, stuff like that. If you have more serious health issues, there are ways to arrange for someone to assist you with transportation or come help you if you need it and stuff like that, it is all a question about cost really.\n\nMy first solo trip was to Barcelona and it was a bit scary to be honest but it went okay and I learned a lot. Subsequent trips got much easier, and every trip I did since was better than the last and now I feel pretty seasoned. I have CMT 1A and back problems (partly fused spine from scoliosis/kyphosis), but all in all they only cause me minor issues. \n\nMy main issues when traveling is carrying/lifting a heavy suit case up stairs or into a train or etc, running to catch a train/plane/what ever or crossing busy roads (I am looking at you Naples), pain in my feet from being on my feet/walking all day long for weeks at a time, and hard mattresses in hotels. But I have solved these problems by packing light and smart (packing light really is an art form), reading up in advance so I know what to expect, wearing good custom insoles and shoes, and asking for an extra pillow or two if I need it. On some occasions I have lined up four pillows in a row and slept on them when the mattress was particularly concrete-like.. It works pretty well.\n\nMy experience is that people will usually help you if you ask, and my attitude is that when I am traveling somewhere nobody knows who I am and nobody will remember who I am, so there is no shame in asking for help no matter what it is for.\n\nIf I were to give any advice for solo travel it would be to travel to a civilized, modern country with decent infrastructure first, because that will be the easiest, then you can get more and more adventurous once you learn what your main challenges are when traveling alone. Also add in whole resting days, you will probably need them and they are a godsend. If you have reduced or lost sensation in parts of the feet make sure you check them often for galls and make sure your socks and shoes are not so tight that it reduces circulation. In a pinch you can use a suitcase as a chair to rest on if you are not too heavy. Suitcases with wheels that rotate 360 degrees are the best invention since sliced bread.\n\nIf you have any questions about solo travel and or about any particular places feel free to ask, maybe me or someone else here have been there!\n\nEdit: The CMTA can send you a wallet sized card with the list of Neurotoxic Medications for people with CMT. I always carry one in case something happens and I get hospitalized. I also have a printed copy which I keep between two pages in my passport. There is also a TSA card that explains that you have CMT. It is a shame that something like that have to exist but it is not needed anywhere else in the world in my experience. If you are a European citizen traveling in Europe, get the \"European Health Insurance Card\" which documents that you are entitled to coverage of medically necessary healthcare in another EEA country. If you are traveling to some Asian countries such as Malaysia for instance, or to Australia or New Zealand, cabin crew members will spray the inside of the cabin with an insecticide before take off. Personally I do not like it, and whether or not it is potentially neurotoxic is pure speculation, but I make sure I get window seats when I know it is going to happen because they usually spray the cans while walking down the hallway and I think (hope) it reduces my exposure slightly sitting farther away from the discharge.", "Dating I am 27 years old and have recently gotten back into the dating game. From your experience, how many dates in do you inform your date of CMT? My progression is still mild, but I have been using AFOs for three years now. \n\nFor me the most awkward/uncomfortable part is going to her house after a few dates (whether I told her by then or not) and having her watch me take off my braces and shoes.\n\nThanks for any input you all. Just be as open and straight forward about as possible/comfortable. Its no use to hide stuff as she will find out sooner or later anyway. That Is worked best for me. \n\nTo quote Tyrion Lannister: Wear your AFO\u2018s as armor and they can never be used to hurt you. I am kind of happy someone finally posted a question about this topic! While I do not wear braces, my shitty balance gives off my CMT so I need to disclose this before actually meeting the person or they will probably think I am a drunk. \n\nAs the comment above mentioned, best to be straight up and transparent. The way they react will also let you know if they are worth your time. Best of luck! Feel free to DM me with any questions. I always mentioned my legs like it was no big deal. Just part of me. The women I went out with, I assume, dated me because I was attractive and/or funny, not because I could run hurdles (I could not). A woman that would have issue with your thin legs or braces is not worth your time anyway. So stand tall, smile, exude confidence in who you are and say \"How you doin?\" to the next nice woman you see.  Quite honestly, I have worn braces since the age 5 and in my 20's I was a bit of a slut. Of course it helped that I worked in a casino where the fishing was good. It also helps to have a self deprecating sense of humor. I am very self deprecating and humorous. However I am not confident enough to wear my AFOs in public without pants covering them. \n\nI do a majority of my dating through online apps. Through your experience, how do you bring it up like it is no big deal? I like this quote a lot. \n\nI am aware she will find out. I am just unsure how to mention it without it sounding like a major issue. Yeah my balance without the braces is awful. How do you mention it to them? I never wear shorts unless I was going swimming. It is NO big deal. The fact that I wear braces does not define me anymore than someone that happens to wear glasses defines them. You might even consider not bringing it up but instead wait until she asks about it. Then just say \"Oh yeah, I wear lower leg braces because I have weakness in my legs.\" and leave it at that. More than likely she will say \"Oh, I was just curious\". It is only a big deal if you make it a big deal. Everyone has something that they deal with whether it is braces, low self esteem, an extra toe, whatever. Try this exercise. Every morning before you leave the house look in the mirror and tell yourself something positive like \"I am smart, I am funny, nothing bad happens if a woman says No\". This may sound dumb but it works. I never got intimidated by attractive woman. Just walk up and say \"Hello, my name is Blank\". The worst thing they can say is \"not interested\". Also, do not bring it up while exchanging messages, wait until you meet face-to-face and she asks. Stay positive friend. Here is a screenshot of a text I sent to a guy that I spoke to for a week and a half about before we met in person. I have more like this. I save them bec some of the reactions are so heart warming. Reminds me there are good people in the world. I am down to upload more and share them if you would like. \n\n Thank you. That was very helpful to hear. Take care. Haha brooo. This is great, thanks for sharing! No problem :) Thank you for posting this topic. I Image most off us have had an issue with this at a certain point. From my experience, I can say honesty always works best. When me and my husband were dating, I was very straight forward, from day one. My hands and afos are a given (at least to me) but I always said, \"We start being serious, you better know what kind of life you are in for..\" I told him and he did not care. Maybe worried, but nothing short of, \"okay, how can I help?\" And he knows now, I will not EVER accept any help, unless I am unconscious. Being forward with everyone I dated, or just general people, made me feel secure in knowing they are there despite my senseless spills. If you are comfortable telling them, give yourself time, but do not wait last minute. I had a divorce 5 years ago and it was quite the whirlwind going back into the dating world - things had changed a **lot** in 15 years!\n\nGenerally I would wait and see if it was worth even telling them that information before deciding to do so. So, with the woman who I ended up marrying I told her on my second date.    \n\nI would not wait too long though. That could work against you and they will wonder why you were hiding it from them. I have CMT that is pretty severe especially as a 22 year old (it was known before I was born just not the severity) \n\nI have been with my boyfriend for 3 years in May. I disclosed it before we went on our first date and basically described everything from symptoms, genetics, how does it affect me etc. I have had to be pretty transparent about it with everyone I meet really but my Boyfriend was so understandable and made me feel completely at ease etc. \n\nI used to be self conscious about my feet and my balance, would try and force myself through the pain of walking etc. When I was younger but when I met my boyfriend I felt completely at ease (Plus he researched it on the internet as soon as I told him, just so he could understand it better:) ) \n\nI think everyone ive told has been more understanding than I thought :) Would love to see more! I will make a post later with links of the rest of the screenshots I have from other People :) Thanks for doing that :) Thanks for the topic. I have recently gotten some new afos and have worn shorts. It is hard not to notice people stare. At 35 years old even with afos my balance is horrible. I think about it constantly as I go through my day and wounder if people think I am weird or if it is the reason I have not really been making it past the first date when it has come to finding a relationship. Any advice would be helpful as I am having a hard time at the moment. Thank you for listening to me vent. I had the benefit of dating at 18 and staying with the guy, so before it was too obvious. I just brought it up slowly. Stumble a little bit whilst walking from the movie  - \"sorry, I have a balance disorder\". Stupidly burn myself whilst cooking, \"heh, I cannot feel that properly, nerves are a bit fucked\". Then later came the full \"well, protein production in the nerve is fucked\" conversation. think of it like this: its usually not an issue  for other people unless you turn it into one. \n\nIt kind of depends on how comfortable you are in them. Or in other words: if you are nervous about them it will make other people nervous as well. Does this make sense? My wife has mildly progressing CMT also. It was not even a full month into our relationship when we would discussed our longterm medical situations, and she would told me about her CMT I am 21 and I have talked to multiple girls and slept with multiple girls.\n\nPeople who are ready to handle relationships generally are not that judgmental. My current girlfriend talked about how she wishes I was more comfortable with my socks off and stuff because im insecure of my feet deformities. My girlfriend before that did not care and we took multiple baths together and what not. I have had casual Flings and I had a girlfriend for about 5 years and she loved me and did more for me than anyone ever probably will.\n\nSomething so small honestly and it is never really affected my dating life because I feel like most people are actually really considerate. I honestly would not stress it. I am considering I am young where people tend to be the most shallow I am pretty sure you will probably be okay. People are not as bad as people think. Do not get me wrong there is bad people out there. And I am sure someone would not think twice about looking at you with your disorder and not wanting to date you. But I am a firm believer that if someone gives you the chance they will gladly love you they will not love you any different than they would love someone else", "Any people with Severe, Early Onset CMT? (26 m) I am looking for people with severe forms of CMT in order to exchange information, chat etc.\n\nI have CMT since 2 years old and i am using a wheelchair for the past couple of years. I do not have contact with any people that have a similar condition and i would like to change that :D. I know there must be some in the sub! \n\nWhat type of cmt do you have? it is unknown sadly. i got tested for all the known cmt types and i had none of them. but my clinical condition matches mostly with cmt3 I have had symptoms basically since birth. I was a \"floppy baby\" that was slow to develop walking/crawling/sitting up abilities. Although docs did not really know what it was at the time other than a generic peripheral neuropathy. Got testing when I was a teenager that showed it was CMT 1B. Early 30s now. Nobody else in my extended family has it. My son who is 6 has type 2E. We found out when he was 4. It is getting very difficult for him to walk currently. He has bad arches already. He will be getting surgery done in January to help flatten his feet. We are trying to do all we can to keep him walking as long as we can. I was diagnosed at 3 and do not know my type Same thing for me. None of my far relatives had something similar. Swimming helped me a lot with walking when I was youmger Yes! He loves swimming. Where are you in the world? In the UK there is a dedicated website to CMT and as part of that they used to do small yearly (I believe) gatherings. I am sure there are associations out there that do similar where you are. If not perhaps you could think about contacting some of them to start a pen pal or group meet section as I am sure there is lots that would seek the comfort of being around those that understand that little bit more. Hey man you sound basically just like me. I am 26 and have severe CMT from birth and have been using a chair for a decade now. Hit me up if you want to chat hello, thanks for answering. i live in greece and i know only one person with cmt. i would like to know more about that website My son (2yom) just started to exhibit signs of CMT and has periodic neuropathy (pressure palsy) where he loses sensation and function in his leg if he sits in the same position for 15 minutes. We are awaiting an EMG nerve study and then genetic screening.  No one in the family has a history of CMT. I have been looking for others with early onset CMT because it is difficult knowing what to expect next!

I write low effort posts and emails because it is the best I can do. Just this much typing is almost beyond what I can do. Keep positive. I am a creative person too and if or when I lose my ability to use my hands I will try to paint with my mouth .try and find tools that will help you to cook or craft or paint. And if none of that works then try to find a new hobby you love that is within your abilities. \u2764\ufe0f Adapt, improvise, overcome.

Some shots are blurry, but I get a lot of great images. Find ways to approach what you love differently. That way you can focus on what you love and not that your hands will not do what you want them to do. Much love, sending good vibes your way! I review and edit documents on a computer for a living. Now I am filing for disability retirement. Cannot do it anymore. Having a hard time sitting all day\u2014even that tires me out. My hands, elbows and shoulders hurt all the time.  I think feeling sad is the appropriate response. Knowing you are not alone and developing other interests may help, but feeling sad is ok. Let yourself feel it. \nIn Solidarity and Peace. Yeah, I was a cellist. We get on and get by though. We find new interests. Perseverance is paramount. Thank you everyone. I do not want to insult your kindness but I have been adapting, keeping positive, adjusting, etc for more than 50 years now. It is exhausting and some days I just cannot rise to the occasion. So I feel sad. And you are right allysgift, feeling sad is ok. But thanks for the kind words. Of everything that CMT has taken from me I miss my hands the most. Having been recently diagnosed, and still having a fair amount of mobility I do not feel qualified to comment with any authority but I have tried to look forward and I envisage using vocal abiltity as a way around whatever difficulties that will come. Speaking and singing etc. You of course have to work out what is best for you but I send you the best of vibes in the meantime \u270c\ud83c\udffb Exactly.

I have foot drop and cannot stand on my toes. I do not have energy return as a result when I walk or go up stairs.\n\nSo my AFOs delaminated (Allard ToeOff Flow 2.5) and my replacements came in today. The orthodist casually mentioned WalkAide, he said they would cost around $7000 total and uncovered by insurance. I flipped though the brochure and I was intrigued but now that I am googling I am less than intrigued because it says it is unlikely going to work for peripheral neuropathy.\n\nI asked if it required a prescription and he said no.

Any others resources with realistic / short exercises everyday? ", "What do you guys do for depression? I am 62 and have CMT 1A. I have had some level of depression since I was 10 and it is hard to separate it from my CMT. I functioned fairly well until about 10 years ago when my hands stopped working well enough for me to keep up in my career (communications with a LOT of computer work). I was also trained as an artist but cannot even hold a pen to write more than a few words at a time\u2014filling out forms is hell. I have had several coping mechanisms since I stopped working full time, including volunteering, lunches with friends a few times a week, etc. COVID has interrupted all of that, but the depression had been getting worse for several months before that. The usual recommendations of walking in nature, do something with your hands, make art, etc. are useless. I have been looking for a therapist for MONTHS...literally. If they even call me back, their practices are closed. I am looking down the barrel of at least twenty more years of this (I am generally healthy otherwise) and I honestly do not know how I am going to make it. Trying to get back on some antidepressants, and find a way to deal with pain, but holy hell, this depression is soul crushing. I also lost my home in a fire three years ago. I would put my heart and soul into it and lost a LOT of original artwork, photos, basically everything. We had about 15 minutes to get out. I have a replacement home but I have put the bare minimum effort into it. It is nice, but all the joy I got out of making my previous house a home is just gone. \n\nIf you have experienced this, you know how painful it is. What have you found that helps? I am honestly thinking about choosing my exit at some point (not imminent but sometime in the next 8-10 years if I make it that far.) I really I wish I would just get cancer so I could avoid the whole final exit thing. What an awful thing to say, but it is true. Also, I am an atheist, so religious faith is not an option. Just want to let you know I read your post and can relate to the feelings.  I wish you the best in your life and hope you can find joy in a hobby again. Im currently struggling with loss of dexterity affecting my hobbies as well and it is very frustrating. \n\nMeditation helps me some but i know it is not for everyone; sometimes it is nice to sit and just let go though. Yes try meditation, and for sure try to get help from professional. Where are you located? I am sorry to hear you are struggling, and COVID certainly does not help. As far as counseling goes, have you ever checked out Doctors on Demand for online therapy? Not sure what your insurance situation is, but mine covered 50% so my visits were $20 copays. However, full price for a 50  minute session is still only $40, which is not bad in comparison to other practices I have encountered. \n\nI know virtual therapy might sound a bit odd, but I worked with one of their counselors for about 2 or 3 months to work through some unresolved feelings about my CMT that I never worked through at diagnosis and she was absolutely fantastic! It really helped me and was super convenient too. Also, as a fellow atheist, I appreciated that there was no \"it is all part of God's plan\" thrown my way (and my therapist visually scoffed when I mentioned another therapist in the past tried that line).\n\nAlso, forgive me if this is already familiar information, but something else that helps me in the harder moments is looking at the research page:  There has been WILD progress since my diagnosis nearly 7 years ago, and there is already a drug proven effective to at least stop (and in many cases, slightly reverse) progression for your subtype in Phase 3 clinical trials! The spinal muscular atrophy community recently got to celebrate the victory of effective gene therapy treatments, so neurologists I have spoken to have said that there will likely be a significant cascade effect into other diagnoses like ours within the next few years. That does not necessarily make today better, I know, but when you think in that long span of 10 to 20 years, I truly believe it is more likely than not that there will be something that can medically help within the next 5 years.\n\nI am only 26, so I know I cannot realistically imagine how you feel currently, but I am wishing you the best and hope there are brighter days ahead. Hey, check out Camp Footprint. I volunteered for the first time last summer. I think it would be worth your time. Half of the camp is just for adults and the other half is for the kids. My bunkmate was 65 last year and he has CMT 1A like you and me. It changed my perspective on a few things and created a really great support system and group of friends. I signed up on a whim and said \"Why not?\" \nGlad I did.\n\nIf I could offer you some advice? Change up something drastic. Watch Yes Man with Jim Carrey. Thank you for the Doctors on Demand thought. I will take therapy any way I can get it. I am not sure what my insurance will cover. But $40/session is not bad. I cannot imagine a therapist talking to me about God\u2019s plan. And yes, I have been a member of CMTUSA.org for many years. There is are great and exciting things happening in research, just not sure I will have much left by the time anything is actually available. I am staying tuned with cautious optimism. I think at this point, it is the mental game more than anything that I am struggling with. Thank you. I do meditate, listen to lots of meditation podcasts, etc. and it does help at least ground me in the moment. And I read, pet my dog, talk to friends, quit drinking, ride my bike, etc. But, not to be a relentless downer, I still wake up with no enthusiasm for the day. I am tired and just want to put down my boxing gloves. I guess griping to people who at least get the CMT angle helps a little. So that is something right? I am in California, in a hotbed of mediators and gurus ;-). I got another recommendation for online therapy based in the state that I will be checking out. Huh, I have heard of Camp Footprint but thought it was just a kids thing. Thanks for an interesting idea! I do fantasize about a drastic change like moving across country or getting one of those camper vans and striking out. Who knows? Reading your story saddened me, and I can relate. I am only 30 and still able to be relatively active but for the first time in my life the CMT is progressing noticeably and taking my ability to do certain things. \n\nI have also always dealt with depression at some level, and I know what you mean that it is hard to separate it from the CMT. When I am feeling most down about the future, I try to remind myself that there were times when I was very happy, and there will be those times again. Cliche, yeah, but it helps me. Also regular intense cardio exercise seems to help a lot. \n\nEspecially now, the future feels really bleak, for a lot of reasons. Hoping the best for you. Ok have som more time to write. I can imagine that it has to be a terrible pain. And I totally understand your depression. I have CMT1A working as a SW programmer and doing lot of computer work. 8 years ago I become pain in my hands such that I had to stop working for months. After resting my hands literally for months the pain went away and I could start to work again. I do not know if it helps but here some tipps for you: I ditched mouse and started to use this  ( I mapped the klick key on the keyboard windows button using  ( This way one of my hand was using the trackball and other did the klicking it revealed the pain. There are also other possibilities like head and eye tracking control  ( .   \nDuring the period when my hand hurt I did a lot of swimming. I on't know if it is an option for you but it helped me a lot. I know CMT1A can be different for every person, but I can give you hope it will get better by the time. My mother with CMT1A is 76 and still live a full life. Of course psychic is a very strong thing and if you are in a depression it can create a feedback loop. I have learned the worse my psychic is the more my legs or hands hurts.   \nTry perhaps remote psychoteraphie, check in UK,  I had a friend who had very good experience with remote skype psychoteraphie. If you need a contact direct message me and I will send it to you. COVID will pass, and better time will come. I am sure you will find joy again in this life.   I wish you all the best and will be thinking about you with my family. I have had to be really careful around meditation. So many of the beginner ones focus on very physical sensations, which could be more of a hindrance. I remember one talking about paying attention to the sensations in your feet and hands... I am thirty-eight, but reading your post, I felt as if I could have written it. I have suffered a profound loss of sensation and fine motor skills in my hands over the last decade, which led to me being unable to enjoy most of the hobbies I used to love. \n\nLast month for the first time in my life I finally sought help and began seeing a therapist regularly. My family, friends, even my doctors have urged me to do so for years now. The irony is that my background is in both internal medicine, and psychology. I suppose we make the worst patients. \n\nI am slowly learning to stop focusing on the things I have lost, and the many things I can no longer do. I suspect this will be a lifetime project. Instead I am trying to place more value in things I currently enjoy: being an active participant in local politics, listening to books on Audible, playing with my Frenchie, learning new recipes and feeding family, long afternoon naps, exercising my hands playing video games, sampling exotic tea varieties, snail mail (even if my penmanship is not what it used to be) with wax seals and small gifts exchanged with friends that moved away, online window shopping, growing fresh herbs, making and sharing music playlists on Spotify with friends, book club, etc.\n\nThere ARE things left to enjoy. Sometimes it is very hard to imagine that. A few months ago I got an email from a dating app I would forgotten I had signed up for. Update your hobbies for a better connection! it said. And for the life of me I could not think of a single hobby I enjoyed. It felt like I slept a lot, and wandered around if a painful fog when awake, and that was about it. But as you can see, there are actually quite a few things I enjoy. It is hard to remember when you are alone at the bottom of a spent wishing well. You are not alone. There might be a wish or two left.\n\nMake a list of things that bring you joy. Even small joys. Refer to it frequently. I am at your disposal if you need to talk, any of you.  xo I wish I had an answer for you. I do not. I will be 66 in 3 weeks and I can not see a path forward that is worth is taking. While I used to love summer and all it brought, and hated the dark, cold gray of winter, I find myself looking to the 66th thinking, this is the time. This is enough. I am tired. In every sense of the word. I am worn down. Lost, lonely, scared, and just plain sick and tired of this shit. I have deteriorated gradually over a period of approximately 13 years. Little by little, one by one, things I used to do, used to love, have disappeared. Now, I am but a shell of the man I used to be. Every, single, step is an an agony. Every time I hold something, try to do something, it is a chance to watch one more time my clumsy lack of ability and coordination. To the point, that tonight, I could not even place a bowl of water beside my cats dinner without spilling it all over the floor. And then naturally, there is the inevitable clean up.  \n\nI am tired of the loneliness, the long, long days and the even longer nights. I am terrified of the upcoming winter. The days upon days of being stuck in this fucking house on the first floor. I keep going because of my cat. She is the only reason. But, I have made arrangements for her and I have made my peace with my end. The plans are in place. It will be peaceful, quick, even pleasant.Far more than this current state. \n\nLike you, I chose to look into the void with the peace of knowing there is nothing out there. I know there is no such thing as some magical deity that pics the winners and the losers. \n\nLike you, I just can not see doing this much longer. The pain and loneliness the loss is far more than anyone should have to bear. Yeah, I think I came across a similar meditation. The best ones for me are not guided but are just long recording of sounds, usually rain (dry old CA makes me long for rain.) one thing that occurred to me in the course of this conversation we are having is that looking forward too far, in the context of CMT anyway, might not be very helpful. That is where mediation, or at any rate mindfulness, can be of best use. It is so tricky because on the one hand we all have to keep an eye on the road ahead and try to prepare ourselves for the future (physically, financially, socially, etc.) and yet it can also be a source of pain to imagine future, diminished us. I like your solutions for using the trackball and click-key. Take care of those hands!! A friend of mine has fairly successfully adjusted to using voice control. I use it some, but not enough to be comfortable with it. And as you say, head and eye control is an option as well. We do live in a fortunate time for adaptable technologies. Sometimes I consider what my life would have been like even a century ago and it would have been far harder. Swimming is wonderful as long as I can get to the water without falling down 8-O! Thank you for your kind thoughts. I am so glad you have been able to find a therapist. I have gotten the same feedback from friends and my spouse. A lifetime project is has been, and will continue to be. That which does not kill us makes us stronger, right? Some days that is true. Some days it is not. I guess if we can make it to the day after the ones that suck, that counts for something. It also sounds like you have been good at finding the things that get you through, and props for finding many that can happen in a pandemic. I am a reader as well and lately that is been the best source of distraction for me. And adding to my bird feeder collection, making a fountain bird bath, watching those flighty visitors is good too. Hey awwman_I read your other post here several days ago. I am so sorry you have been having trouble getting a neuro evaluation rescheduled. And I totally get your concerns about two-story living. One of the biggest attractions of our previous house was that the master BR was on the first floor. I was just 40 when we moved in and was still relatively ok, but over time, it became a really big advantage. I eventually stopped going to the second floor altogether. I do hope you have been able to make some progress with your health care. I have had a terrible time getting call backs. I was also told by a two different health care professionals in the family (a doc and a PA) that, unfortunately, people in pain are often turned away because \u201cdoctors would rather deal with people that will be satisfied with their treatment.\u201d Also, insurance companies like swift resolutions. WTF?! Anyway, You are so fortunate that you have a good pain mgmt doc, IIRC. I so get the despair when a simple thing like feeding your cat becomes an ordeal. It is fucked, no two ways about it. Living alone makes it that much harder. I am really fortunate to have a supportive spouse but they are beginning to have some health issue so it is even more destabilizing to think of us both needing help. I do hope you stay with us a while, but I respect anyone\u2019s own sense of when they have had enough. I will probably be called out for that but so be it. Thanks for the original post and the above response, Sacred_thorn_apple. One reason I responded to your post is because of our similar ages. At our age, not only do we face all the uncertainties of old age, we face them with far less energy, vigor, naivety. We have a lifetime of experience as to how the human animal and 'society' really operate. And, based on my experience, I would not chose to be me with my disabilities at this age if there were any other option. We face an uncertainty similar and yet oh so different from our younger CMT brethren. Not that their path forward will be an easy one, I sincerely wish and hope it is, but as I said earlier, the naivety of life, humans, society is gone.\n\nWith each and every step being an excruciating agony, a chance to ride the Free Fall Express, I know, living alone, in a 2 story house, I am just as inclined to losing my balance, fall down the stairs, on into onto something, impale myself with a knife as I go about food prepping, or just stumble on my drop feet, or anything and end up lying there with a busted back, hip, whatever. \n\nI respect everyone is choice as to how they chose to live and chose to leave.

I too have experienced that stage and it is a horrible feeling when you just throw it out there as if it is nothing. Maybe you should try meet-up groups for cmt or muscular dystrophy or simply general ones for meeting new people in your area. Social isolation is the worst for depression and it is hard socialising with a disability having to think about everything before you even set off somewhere.

I do not really see the point? Is there anything helpful they can do? I saw a great neurologist when I got diagnosed, but did not really see a point of going again? I mean, I guess they can give you updates on where you are at, I just feel like CMT is going to do what it does whether someone is keeping track or not. I have a thing against neurologists.  So on your first point, once my daughter was diagnosed with CmT they pretty much have served their purpose.  She is better served by her ortho and physical therapists now that they know her diagnosis.  \n\n\nMy hate affair is personal.  I went to a neurologist for a sleep disorder.  Classified as a specialist visit, paid a $40 copay when I got there.  I spoke to him for maybe 10 mins, and he referred me to get a sleep study.  I got a bill for over $1000\u2014because his \u201coffice\u201d is in the hospital they charge it as an outpatient hospital visit.  Friggin crooks. I go to an MDA Clinic for my neurologist, so the point for me is to be considered for studies with experimental treatments. Also orthotics, drugs, etc. No point in going more than once a year if you do not need to. Nope. I was diagnosed young. Had to see a neuro recently just to get referred into better specialists like orthopaedic surgeon, orthotist, rehab team (also useless). There is nothing they really can do, and the only benefit is getting news updates if you see someone that keeps on top of the research here. &gt;Also orthotics, drugs, etc\n\nAre these things done by the neuro though? Orthotics are typically an orthotist. And I have had all drugs done by my GP. I go every 6 months for a work up with my neuro, physical and occupational therapist, and a verity of others. They just really track my regression This is probably more the insurance and/or hospital administration but I feel you. The system sucks. I am finding the replies very interesting. I have only seen a neurologist to get my diagnosis and have not seen another one in the 20+ years since. I have a mild case, though. I see other specialists as needed, I have just never had any need to see a neurologist again. I go to clinic and a neurologist is part of the team I see but it is the same thing every time. Honestly the clinic visit as a whole is pretty much a waste of time because the orthotics company they use never really helps me at all.\n\nBut at my last appointment the Dr did write me a script for some PT to learn some good exercises and stretches. And the folks at PT put me in touch with a pedorthist who 3d printed me some custom inserts and they are amazing. So not a total waste of time I suppose. I go to the MDA clinic once a year. As others said, they can track regression and helps with scripts for new braces or equipment. In fact, I am going through the process of getting a scooter with their help. Well, if I did not have regular appointments with the neuro, I would not be able to renew or change my meds. It is really about pain, tremor and muscle tightness/spasm management for me, I guess if your PCP is well versed in meds for your particular issues. My neuro has been helpful in using things I think my PCP would not really think of like Carbamazepine for muscle cramps. The MDA Clinic where I am a patient has several specialists, including orthotists and genealogists, who work directly with the neurologists. I see about six doctors per visit. Have not gone since diagnosis. No cure. I cannot afford to find out which brand I have. Nothing really anyone can do. I know what I got, know what is coming and can judge what is getting worse. But hey, you got insurance that covers it, DO IT TO IT; will not hurt anything. There is not a great deal of point beyond monitoring the progression of your disease and/or renewing any prescriptions you may need (in my state, you have to have a prescription before an orthotist can treat you, or insurance can be used for PT). My dad is a retired doctor and he always said that neurologists are basically diagnosticians who mostly cannot do anything to treat you. That is changed somewhat in recent years but it is still mostly true. Im sorry, but as someone whos worked on the other side of the of the counter i want you to know its your responsibility to find out what your insurance will cover. Doctors usually are not the ones billing your insurance, your anger seems misplaced. Lol what?  If their name is on the bill then they can take the blame.   \n\n\nAnyway it was basically a scam.  A neurologist is a specialist right?  Insurance covered specialist visits with a $40 copay.  Neurologist did not have a stand alone office somewhere, his office was in the hospital\u2014instead of being charged for an office visit\u2014they billed it as an outpatient hospital visit.  They gladly took my $40 copay when I came in and then mailed me a bill afterwards.  That is a scam if I have ever heard one. Seems to come down to who can do referrals/scripts. Would be interesting to see where people live. A lot of the things people are saying the neuro does, I get from my GP. When it comes to medication, I like being able to go back 2 weeks later to say it is not working, instead of waiting for a neuro list. I only see a neurologist if I am having nerve-related pain or when I need an orthotics prescription. Some people see them yearly to tract their nerve conduction and deterioration. It is easy to say you should find out what your insurance covers but they do not make that easy and this is a perfect example. You checked to see how much a specialist visit was and you reasonably thought you had the answer. The insurance company had more rules that they did not tell you about. \n\nThe doctor probably does not care and does not even know unless he goes out of his way to find out about the billing (he should, but he is already busy with learning all the medical things). The doctor just gets his hospital salary regardless of what the hospital bills and/or the insurance pays. \n\nI do not think it is a reasonable system that requires that you call (and probably spend an hour on hold) to ask \"is this particular specialist visit really covered by your published specialist visit rules?\" Completely agree with ya.   Insurance companies make all kinds of stupid rules that do not make sense.  Like having to get approval from the insurance company that an MRI is \u201creally medically necessary\u201d, but they do not even cover getting the MRI.  So I need your permission to spend my own money\u2014like what? \n\nSame with medication.  With all the coronavirus stuff most Drs are fine with giving 90 day scripts.  Dr writes me one (nonnarcotic or scheduled) and insurance says nah will only pay for 30 days sorry.  Luckily it is a cheap one anyway so I just paid for it out of pocket so I could get the 90 day script filled. I would recommend keep appointments in case of side effects. For example it was my CMT consultant who diagnosed me with a failing hip and this was done in a matter of days rather than months with a GP.\n\nAlso if you need orthotics then they will support you with that. I went to a neurologist for years, waited hours in the waiting rooms only to be seen for all of 10 mins (if that) &amp; essentially it was a okay things have not got dramatically worse yet so on your way. Their attitude in my experience is you have this, it is not going away, deal with the depression that comes with it until it may or may not get worse. I stopped going because it depressed me. However, sometimes regret it because it is better to have a support network even if at the time it feels like they are not. If you want I would suggest emailing or leaving a message for your neurologist and ask them what their directive is. My neurologist likes to check up on me every six months to check progression see if he needs to change my medication make life style suggestions and requests for things that are vital such as ot and pt. I feel like its a good time to also just talk to someone who knows what your disease is about and get clarity on issues you have. And I do believe that there is some good to having someone keep track of your situation for you the greatest thing that can combat CMT and these problems is preventative care. What you do sooner than later is key. My neurologist is the best. He works with me on medication and has referred me for physical therapy and orthotics. My quality of life is much better than it would be without his care. Honestly he is the best doctor I have ever been to.", "Build Your career as Chartered Market Technician. Best CMT Training Institute in India at Jaipur (Rajasthan) Feel free to make any query related these courses ", "I have a pretty funny question for you guys. I wear two leg braces. Sometimes I trip and fall for no obvious reason. My feet do not connect, my feet do not connect with another object, it is like my right foot goes back, and then goes forward, and instead of swinging all the way through like it should it hits the ground in like a very stiff kick, which brings me down. This just happen a little bit ago when I was walking my dog, and I fell hard. I did not mess myself up or anything, because it is getting to where after the last decade I know how to fall. To me, it is pretty humorous. When someone ask you if you are okay, it is a little embarrassing though.\n\nSo, does anyone trip and fall for no reason? All the time. :) Yes, I have had to learn to really watch my feet when I walk.  And that is with your braces on? With my afo's on I am still clumsy but I do not feel like a major fall risk. I have not fallen yet with them on. Without them, I have tripped on a slightly raised sidewalk on many occasions. My wife does this a lot, it used to worry me a lot before but now it is just funny. We will be walking and it looks like she suddenly decides to sit down where she is. I sit down next to her and we have a laugh. \n\nWhenever it does not look like that, I know it is a bad fall. I catch my toe a lot when I am walking. It is especially fun when I do it while going downstairs. I honestly fell more with my AFOs on. I am not laughing at you, I am laughing with you.  Unless you are not laughing \ud83d\ude01 I suffered from drop foot all the time (y\u2019know when your toe catches the ground). But when I got AFO\u2019s they helped with the matter by keeping my toes up. What kind of braces do you have? Maybe they need to be adjusted. Yes this is common with the condition. I remember a date shoving me playfully (you know in a cute pull you away kind of way) and I fell straight down! \ud83d\ude05 Yeah this is common with the condition and probably is one of the most embarrassing aspects to deal with. Braces are supposed to help with the foot drop but I sometimes I find they make things worse especially walking up curved roads. You may find soft ankle braces are easier (medical ones that have some support at the back) but it depends on how severe your condition is. They may help stabilise your ankles though (you can wear them with the splints/braces too but you may find they are then too heavy/uncomfortable to wear together). You could also look into getting specialised shoes made that might help. Though they can be quite heavy so there are downsides. \n\nI remember a date playfully pushed me (you know in a cute push you away kind of format) and I fell straight down! \ud83d\ude05", "Working out / body building etc? I am 21 and I do not feel any real day to day weakness normally. I have high heels and all the apparent symptoms but besides that I do not feel any other symptoms that limit me on a regular basis thankfully.\n\nI read a lot about how you should do very moderate exercise and not bulk up and that is more or less the consensus of the topic, But I see a lot of people here talking about working out and such like a normal person and it makes me very confused whether it is considered ok or not to exercise normally, reach my limit and drink a protein shake and call it a day OR I need to really worry about how much I am stressing my muscles?\n\n\nSo to sum it up, if I do not have any symptoms besides physical shape and maybe early fatigue - do I need to worry MORE than the normal person going to the gym?\n I do not think you need to worry more.\n\nYou NEED to stretch more than a normal person.\n\nI saw a CMT specialist when I was a teenager and he was all about me playing sports and working out. I credit a lot of my mobility at 30 to the working out I did 10-15 years ago. How is that so? Because for me I do want to work my ass off in the gym but I spoke with a few professionals and read also that it might damage your muscles if you work too hard.\nIs that is incorrect? \nAnd if it is, why is it noted in a lot of sources online?\nWhat I read is that putting too much pressure or body building is something that can worn out your muscles earlier which will cause symptoms of cmt to appear earlier then they would normally do.\n\n That seems pretty counter to what my doctors told me to do. They knew I was playing sports, hell they specifically scheduled my foot-drop surgery so I could recover in the off-season. To them my activity was one of the best preventative measures against atrophy in the future. They also worried about tendons shrinking over time. Activity stretches them out. When I was 10 my doctor said the best thing ever to my mom. \"You should get him a trampoline, it will stretch his Achilles.\"\n\nThere are a lot of unhealthy habits in body building. Maybe there is a line there somewhere and that is what they are referring to. What are your sources? I am not going to argue with you are doctor, but mine always saw activity as a good idea. Ok so this one is from a professor of Clinical Neurology : \n\n\nSynopsis: Unlike other neuromuscular disorders, physical exercise does not appear to worsen weakness in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.\n\ntl;dr \"None of the patients demonstrated any significant side-to-side difference in hand or foot muscle strength for any muscle tested, while dexterity, as expected, was significantly better on the patient\u2019s dominant side. In all muscles studied, strength significantly decreased with increasing disease severity and with age, with no significant difference seen between dominant or non-dominant hands, but with a mild but significant difference found in gastrocnemius/soleus strength in older patients, which was greater on the dominant side. Gender affected neither symmetry nor strength between sides. Overwork weakness does not appear to play a role in CMT 1A, **and patients may be encouraged to exercise to their heart\u2019s content**.\"\n\nWhile you have also numerous sources such as CMT UK stating here: \n\n\nAgain, they state:\n\nQuestion: I have heard that over exercising (overwork) can actually be harmful. Is this true?\n\nAnswer: Research into conditions such as CMT has shown that there is no increase in weakness with low\nto moderate intensity exercise, with the benefits far outweighing the risks. **You can reduce your\nrisks** by:\n* exercising at **low to moderate levels**, as advised by your gym instructor or physiotherapist\n* **not exercising to exhaustion**\n* recognising that if your muscles are sore for longer than 48 hours after the exercise that you have probably worked too hard.\n My dad was diagnosed at 35. The doctors told him not to exercise. He and my mom thought that was crap. Normally, they listen to their doctors, but this was the one time they did not. And thank goodness. My dad exercised and concentrated on building his leg muscles. For years he went to the gym daily-- at one point up to three hours per day and working with a trainer. I firmly believe this is why he can still walk at 76. I mean, he can barely walk, but he can still walk. His siblings did not exercise and their conditions are far worse. We have CMTX which is usually worse in men, but his sister has been in a wheelchair while my dad is on his feet. \n\nHe also exercises his hands daily. He started doing that more recently to try to get my mom to do the same (she has ALS), ands I noticed his fingers are less curled. \n\nI, too, feel a dramatic difference from when I am exercising consistently to when I am not. When I was running and dancing (ballet, tap), my balance was great and I could walk up/ down hills or uneven terrain without any issues. Since I stopped, I have seen a decline in my stability. \n\nI am not sure how they define \"moderate\" exercise.  I think bodybuilding would be more \"extreme\", perhaps scale back to \"rigorous\". \n\nAlso, there is a Facebook group called CMT Athletes which is great. Very inspiring.  It is commonly believed by doctors that you should exercise muscles that already have affected nerves with caution and moderation. No doctor that has studied CMT will tell you to not exercise at all.\n\nThat being said, you should only be worrying about this when you really start feeling the symptoms of weakness, loss of balance, etc. Until then it is actually beneficial to strengthen muscles, to help you fight the muscle atrophy that may present later in life.\n\nAlso, make sure you have someone check your posture and forms to make sure you are doing them correctly. Because of our feet and balance these can be off for beginners with CMT. \n\nEase into things and do not start with your max weight/going to exhaustion on your first days/weeks until you see how your body reacts, and more importantly how your muscles recover. Muscle recovery time can be quiet a bit longer for people with CMT. I have read the majority of studies that address the overwork hypothesis for CMT 1A and my impression is that the evidence seems to point towards it not being an issue with 1A.\n\nI have also read a lot of papers on resistance exercise in relation to management of 1A (do a search for \"resistance exercise Charcot Marie Tooth\" in pubmed if you want to start digging your self) and my impression is that \"moderate\" resistance exercise seem to both improve muscle function and the ability of performing daily tasks in 1A patients.\n\nI am not a medical professional so take my opinion with some salt. My current view on the matter though is that it is likely not a problem for people with 1A to exercise in the way that people without CMT do to gain muscle. But there are some things to consider. You may experience fatigue if you push your self, which can make it difficult to maintain the intensity over time. There are also issues with straining the wrists when using free weights and machines. Another issue are contractures and scoliosis/kyphosis, both are seen more frequently among 1A patients and are possibly caused by muscle imbalance due to CMT. Whether exercise could exacerbate these complications I do not know and I am not sure anybody do at this point in time. If you do have any of those symptoms I would make sure to discuss it with both a neurologist and a physio therapist before adopting an intense exercise regimen. And I would advice you to do so regardless, just to get some more opinions.\n\nThere is also the issue of actually \"building muscle\". I would expect \"getting good gains\" to be a potential issue, though how muscles respond to resistance exercise seems to vary among people with 1A. As a fun fact, I know at least one study have found that taking creatine while performing resistance exercise had no statistically significant effect compared to those only performing resistance exercise.\n\nSome people with 1A also experience muscle cramps, which could occur more frequently after exercise.\n\nTo finish it off with some anecdotal evidence, I know that for me (1A) moderate resistance exercise improves my strength initially but I tend to \"plateau\" after a while with me being unable to increase my strength despite my best efforts in both the regimen and diet. I also experience increased fatigue when increasing my activity level, which makes it difficult to maintain a high level of exercise. Personally I have replaced the gym with swimming and hiking, and that works better for me. Thanks everyone! I truly appreciate it  I have been going to the gym for over 8 years and it does help, especially in you quads and hamstrings. However your calves will need to be stretched and will always be a bit weak and cramp easily.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nthere is clearly an issue with muscle growth and CMT. Numerous people on this sub have mentioned it, I have this issue at the gym, and one study went as far as to ( So you will not ever get far unless you use PEDs.

Have not met any person with CMT who plays video games, at least not as much as I do, and I was hoping for some ways to keep my hands flexible and prevent cramping. I do not have any tips on the problem you have raised but would like to share my experience with gaming. \n\nI was a regular console gamer all my life, then in my early 20\u2019s I stopped playing for a couple of years. Now I can no longer use thumb sticks on console controllers. I can only assume the muscles in my hand deteriorated, perhaps due to lack of regular use. \n\nI guess my point Is to keep at it. Perhaps take regular short breaks and do hand stretch exercises. Ah yeah, I am still in my teens, and thumbsticks have gotten extremely hard to use, I switched to pc and it is a lot better but my fingers tend to cramp and I will miss a game winning shot because of it Hi I am 44 and play Overwatch on PC about 7 hours a week. I sometimes get cramps or arthritis feelings if I overdo it (on holidays I might do a 4 or 5 hour session). One thing that helps is to wear wrist/hand supports from the chemist when I am not gaming. I mean like special gloves that support my wrists and fingers. If my hands get cold I soak them in hot water. Get married.  Only get an hour or two a week,  if that, to play. Solved my finger cramping issues...\nOn a serious note, the cold is an issue for me. Im in construction in the north east and am outside year round.  Cannot pick up a pen if my hands get too cold.  Good gloves and hand warmers can work, but the trick is to not let it get that far.  \nThey start to get that cold tingle, take a minute, warm them up, pop the gloves back on. You need to stretch and move your hands and fingers regularly, start off doing like a stage hypnotist with the wavy fingers every so often. \n\nGoogle hand stretches and find a routine, be gentle but firm with your hands do not yank and pull them about. I gave up serious gaming a few years ago for unrelated reasons but I know what you are talking about for sure. I did PC gaming and it was mostly my right (mouse) hand that got super cold and could have issues. \n\nI tried thin fingerless gloves: did not work well and were annoying, they made my hand slide around on the mouse. My SO bought me some fingerless gloves that have tiny USB heating pads built into them: they work well and are not as prone to slipping around on the mouse; I am still not a fan of having something on my hands while gaming but you might be able to get used to them. Finally I just try to take a moment whenever my hands start feeling cold to wrap them around a hot cup of coffee/tea or I microwave one of those rice-filled heating pads you can use for sore muscles and take a quick break to wrap that around my hand. \n\nMaybe someday someone will make a heated mouse :P Why not use one of those heating lights (the red ones - I dont know what theyre called, but they are used for baby ducks, reptiles etc...) and make it shine right on your right hand with one of those little desk lamps! Nothing bothering you on your hand AND its kept toasty. I think this is a great idea and also kind of hilarious. I might try it if I have more problems keeping my hands warm. Would love to hear from anyone else who tries it how it goes! Maybe look up some exercises for carpal tunnel syndrome. Much more common than cmt so should be a lot of tips. I game everyday, and draw, but have not had much difficulty, just some occasional wrist pain What I do is between matches I will stretch my fingers back or crack my knuckles to ease up tense. When it comes to cold you can use thin cloth fingerless gloves or hand warmers. Just always stretch them when you can to get the blood circulating again. \n\nSource: CMT gamer with too much free time and a love of Halo Well goddamn never stopping playing games then!

I am mainly hand effected, and my hands are so sore after playing games or typing I sit is misery because doc said use ice for soreness and yeah, no. OMG! You just cracked the code! I would give you a medal if I could! I am glad my silly idea is helpful! To toasty hands!! Stretching is definitely helpful. I bought some theraputty off Amazon and looked up some simple stretching techniques. \n\nIf it gets so bad you feel like you physically cannot play anymore, I would look at Microsoft's adaptive controller. They have made some real cool stuff to let people with all kinds of physical disabilities play games. No experience with the cold (australia ftl), but getting a vertical mouse and twisting the keyboard so my fingers are not particularly clawed around wasd helped well enough. Not sure if mentioned already, but a really good mouse, (for PC players) can make actions easier on your hands.\n\nFor example, I use the Roccat Leadr.\n\nThe mouse has two sets of flippers, (instead of buttons) so my fingers do not start hurting from repeated pressings, (due to hardly any padding on my hands).\n\nThe other buttons are pretty easy to push down, so I really like this mouse.\n\nI usually try to do most my gaming functions through the mouse, while only using the WSDA keys for direction.\n\nUsing this method, your hands will not get tired out as quickly.\n\nLink to mouse: \nYou can also order them off of Amazon. I worked in software, and ended up with Carpal Tunnel in both hands, on top of the CMT. I found a surgeon who was willing to do the CMT surgery, even though we did not know how it would turn out. It helped a lot, especially with the cramping. I only game a bit, but my cramping got a lot better after I remapped most of the controls on my keyboard so that my hands are less bunched up.

Yeah I react poorly to anything less than 70 F... my feet and hands cramp, go numb, get pins and needles My feet get super cold but they do not hurt like my hands do, I have many dead spots in my legs where I feel nothing, and my feet have a delayed reaction to feeling in most areas, but my hands when they get cold especially when out blowing snow they hurt so bad, not looking forward to this winter at all. Yeah this winter has been rough.\n\nDo you have cmt x? I do have CMT I am sorry, I could have been more clear. Do you know what subtype of cmt you have? I have cmt subtype x.

The doctor writes that the possibility of hereditary spastic parapiegia has been considered but cannot be made on clinical features alone.  He continues that if the request for benefit coverage is denied, the patient would require more invasive studies such as an EMG (Electromyogram) and nerve conduction studies.  The request for benefit coverage of the genetic testing has been denied as experimental and investigation.\n\nBased on review of the medical records provided, the treatment consisting of (81479 Procedures Unlisted molecular pathology procedure) FOR DX (M216X9 Diagnosis Other acquired deformities of unspecified foot) is experimental and/Or investigational for this diagnosis and clinical findings.\n\nWhile multiple references can be found regarding the diagnosis of hereditary spastic paraplegia, none of those references offer any suggestion of benefit to patient management and health outcome from genetic testing.

Sorry new to posting and tried to make the photo NSFW since feet are gross but to no avail lol I found it. :) oh no! \n\nStairs are my nemesis, yours too I see.\n\nHope you are OK. Yeah. I had my shoes/braces off and missed a step being a dumb dumb. Both feet went straight into the iron rods holding the handrail up and immediately knew I might have broken something. Little toe might be broke since most of the swelling is all around it, with a little more swelling near the next few toes. Called into work today to give it more time since it is way to painful to get shoes on. Yeah pretty sure I have 2A, have the ankle/wrist drop and the clawing of hands/toes and beginning to affect my knees. 31 M. I have always toughed things out, but the older I get the harder it gets haha. My father in law cut his foot open on a dog bone and only noticed when he saw the trail of blood he left when ever he took a step Ouch! Yeah, it is crazy It is doing much better, thank you. I hope you have a fast recovery as well I seem to need a fall every year or two to remind me to be careful on stairs (and my evil slanted driveway). Thanks for the free reminder! Haha, same and you are very welcome. I had to take Thursday off and then wear a medical boot that put all my pressure on the heel Friday. Going To try the shoe today, still swollen and sore, but much better than it was. Thankfully it was not as bad as I originally thought, but the feeling in my feet is very weird. Glad to hear you are mending.\n\nI once came down on my left foot so hard I was shivering with chills (sign of shock). Was certain I had broken it, but nope. The arch felt weird for weeks but slowly normalized.\n\nAny sign of infection though, get it looked at. Poor circulation in CMT makes infections bigger risk. I find Urgent Care facilities best for this sort of injury. Can be seen same day and get XRay, antibiotics but not as expensive as an ER. Yeah, no doubt. I know that exact feeling of chills, it almost makes me nauseous the 2-3 times it is happened. We just have to be more careful lol, sometimes I forget. Being in a wheelchair, and having to use an elevator or stairlift does have its advantages. I have not fallen since I started using a wheelchair. But I still remember \"flying\" down a set of stairs. It is something that I will never forget. Neither will the people who saw me fall or heard the thud when I landed.\n\nGlad you are still alive and are mending. When I saw that the picture was NSFW I was hoping for a picture of a naked woman, but all I found was a picture of a gross looking foot! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude01 Haha! Yeah, I figured I would do that so people would not just get a gross foot on their feed, even though I assume us CMT'ers are used to it.", "My experience with IVF I thought I would make a post with my experience with in vitro fertilization (IVF) utilizing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).  I occasionally see people asking questions about here and elsewhere.  Hopefully this post will help someone either now or on some distance google search in the future. \n\n\nI suffer from a moderate case of CMT1A.  There is no family history.  I was diagnosed at the age of 11, had multiple surgeries on my feet as a teenager.  Have fairly severe kyphosis and scoliosis.  My feet are an absolute mess, to the point I want to amputate them.  I did not want to have kids if they would most likely have CMT.  The odds of passing CMT1A onto your child are 50% (if 1 parent has CMT).  According to our fertility doctor, the odds PGD failing and still passing on the disease were less than 3%.\n\n\nThe process starts with lots of doctors\u2019 appointments for the wife then hormone injections (done at home by the husband) for a few weeks.  Once the blood work checks out, they prepare to remove unfertilized eggs.  This is a minor surgery that takes about 20 minutes, requires you to be put under anesthesia.  My wife had some abdominal pain for a few days following this.  They then fertilize the eggs and monitor their growth for 5 days.  On the 6th day they measure their growth and discard any eggs that did not fertilize and grow properly.  For our case, they removed 27 eggs from my wife, and 9 of them grew enough to move on.\n\n\nThey then remove a few cells from the embryo and test it for CMT, along with a slew of diseases or chromosomal issues.   Of our 9 embryos, 5 of them had CMT1A, and 1 of them had another issue.  This left us with 3 viable embryos. \n\n\nAt this point, the wife begins another round of injections (done at home by the husband) and many doctors\u2019 appointments.  Once the body is ready, an embryo is inserted into the body.  Two weeks later they conduct a blood test to determine if there is a successful pregnancy.   The odds of a successful pregnancy are about 60%.\n\n\nWe implanted all three of our embryos.  The first two were successful, and the third was not.\n\n\nCost:  Our insurance covered about half the cost.  Initially, we were denied, but our fertility doctor was able to convince them that CMT was a viable disease for IVF PGD coverage.  Insurance covered about 50% of the bill.  We paid $12,000 to produce the embryos.  $1,500 to implant the first two embryo, and $2,500 for the third (our insurance changed).  There was also a $600 per year fee for storing the embryos. \n\n\nTLDR: Used IVF with PDG to produce two children without CMT.  Total cost was approx. $15,000.  Insurance covered approx. half of the cost. This is great info, thank you! I am so happy you and your wife were able to build a family. I hope the same for all of the various forms of families impacted by CMT. Me and my partner are in the very early stages of IVF  (I have CMT she does not). Glad it worked out for you first time.\n\nHow long did the whole process take? So good to hear about this first hand. Is there anything you found particularly problematic/difficult about the process? How long did it take you from deciding you wanted to go down the IVF route to actually confirming the pregnancies? We met with the fertility doctor the first time in May.  Due to some other obligations we knew that we did not want to start the process until October, so we were able to get everything scheduled, and all the paperwork taken care of in that time.  Along with some preliminary blood work, etc. \n\n\nMy wife started the process in October was pregnant by the end of January.  We had no hiccups along the way.  Everything worked the first time.  If it does not then you may need to wait a month for another menstrual cycle. I had discussed IVF with the genetic counsellor at the John Hopkins CMT clinic in 2012.  At that time,  the use of IVF with PDG was still very new, at least according to her.  We were not ready to start a family until 2015.  At that point it took about 3 months from starting the process to getting pregnant, but we had no issues along the way.\n\n\nThe scariest part is that it is not guaranteed.  A IVF cycle without PGD might only produce a handful of viable embryos then you need to cut that number in half because of CMT.  You can spend $25,000 and not have anything to show for it. This is great information, thank you for posting! Although it is a lengthy, challenging and costly process, IVF with PGD truely is a marvel of modern medicine. Thank you for sharing your experience! I have done IVF as well, and just wanted to add a few things that may be helpful to others thinking about:\n\n-- for most people, it does not work in just one try. Most people go through more than one egg retrieval. The lucky ones only have to do one! I did four. I know others who have done 10+ \n\n-- if you do not have insurance coverage, it can be very very costly. My husband and I have spent about $100k. And we did not do PGD testing in the end (which was an additional $10,000). There are clinics, such as CNY in New York, which have much lower prices so people will travel to them to save money. My meds for each round of egg retrieval cost at least $5,000 out of pocket. That said, it may be worth it for one partner to look for a job with insurance that covers IVF. Starbucks is one such employer. I believe Bank of America is another. \n\n-- the time to just get the probes made for PGD testing can be up to 3 months. And the cost can be $5-10,000. There is not just a general screening, they must make probes using your DNA and your partner's DNA to properly screen for the genetic mutation. \n\n-- the husband does not have to give the shots. I did my own shots for my egg retrievals except for the larger trigger shot (the shot you take right before you retrieve). They were super easy to do once i got over my initial anxiety. Single women or women with husbands who travel or deploy can still do IVF in their own.\n\n-- The odds of it working depend on a lot of factors with a big one being age. We ended up not doing PGD because I am in my 40s and thus was not getting a many viable embryos to grow to the blastocyst stage (where they biopsy and /or freeze).\n\n-- clinics have different protocols they use which can make a difference in how long a cycle is. My clinic had me on protocol which included \"priming\". This meant taking a low dose of hormones the month before they started to really stimulate the ovaries with the hormone injections.  So each of my egg retrievals was a 2 month process. But others might be much shorter. \n\n-- the whole IVF process is very emotionally and physically challenging. And financially challenging! There can be so much disappointment. But also so much hope. It is an emotional roller-coaster. But I am so glad we did it. Even if in the end we did not screen for CMT. (I am CMT1X and female, so I have a 50% chance of passing it on to my children.) This has been on my mind a lot recently, thanks for sharing your experience", "Need some advice - broken toe Hi all,\n\nI broke my pinky toe 5 days ago just trying to stretch my leg (banged it against the side of the object I was trying to prop it up on) and the doctor told me to tape it to the toe next to it and stay off of it. \n\nMy question is- I still have nasty bruising, they are saying not to worry about it but I am nervous about how the CMT will affect healing and paranoid that there is something more I could be doing to be sure it does not get worse. \n\nHas anyone been through a similar situation? Any advice?\n\nType 1A here.  My mom (with type 1A) breaks bones in her feet constantly. Everyone else is spot on, but I will add to make sure you rest and are not constantly walking. With neuropathy you might not always notice that it is hurting, so you will not rest due to pain.  Thanks! How long did your bruising last? That is what I am the most worried about.  Thank you! Necrosis would be what I am worried about. It is still black but I have heard bruising can last 2 weeks in normal people, cannot seem to get a response from my doctor by email.  How black is it? Is the skin peeling? Can you feel your toe when you touch it? It is like a really dark purple, my toe has similar sensation to the same toe on the other foot that was not hurt (both are pretty numb, though, just normal CMT numbness). \n\nIt actually looks a little better this afternoon than it did this morning so I feel a bit better about it. Thanks so much for responding.  Glad to hear it is a little better, fingers crossed for a speedy recovery!", " Weekday Wins: Small Celebrations Little things that do not need their own thread but which you would like to share. \n\nSmall victories, near escapes, anything that brightened your day.

I did not think I would be able to mix the flour and ingredients into dough with just my hands, as my fingers are quite weak. But with some patience and changing how I worked the flour, it turned out quite nicely! Very small victory, but was glad to find some unexpected independence That is a great holiday victory!

Happy New Year!", "Tick-like muscle spasms I have been having respiratory and upper body (head to waist) tick-like spasms since middle school. Colder weather seems to bring it up, but it can be random. I have have/had flailing arms and chest spasms (suppressed breathing and heart palpitations), head jerks, stuck words (I loop on a word a couple times saying it or I just give up), and shaking/flap my hands (I use to do this as a sensory thing, which is not related, but now it is just an urge or spasm). 2 of a few doctor's I have had over the years have said it was not related to my CMT (type 2A), or said I was intentionally doing it. I still get mad; who wants to hit themselves or people around them on purpose like that? It hurt. It hurts, especially repressing it. I was wondering if anyone else has had any experiences? I have had so many things and issues pushed aside by my doctor's because it did not \"fit\" the symptoms of CMT, and I am interested in someone else's take on this issue, or other issues like it. From all my experience these symptoms do not seem like CMT. CMT is understood to affect peripheral nerves and not your core. What most people on this sub might relate to though is doctors disregarding their problems and failing in their responsibility to their patients. The symptoms you describe sound very real and very serious. It may not be CMT but in my unqualified opinion it sounds like a neurological issue. All I can say keep fighting to find a doctor who will take you seriously. \nA few years ago my mother developed a problem that caused painful zaps to occur in her brain whenever she tried to fall asleep. The lack of sleep and resulting migraines prevented her from doing anything. It took months and months of her suffering through this as we went from specialist to specialist before we even got a diagnosis. At one point we even had a doctor say she was imagining it. She was not. Eventually she got treatment and she got her life back. Your ailments may not be as bad but what I am saying is do not let this go. Eventually you will find someone caring and competent to help you. \nLet me know if you have any questions or just want someone to talk to. I do not know where you live but there are many resources and organization around the world (other than Reddit!) that are always looking to lend a hand. Your tics and other symptoms that you describe sound like a central nervous system issue, distinct from the peripheral nervous system issues that are caused by CMT. My guess is that you have an undiagnosed issue such as a mild form of  Tourette's syndrome. \n\nI am sorry that doctors have been dismissive of your symptoms. That is always so frustrating. I do think it is worth it to pursue a diagnosis for these symptoms. It would at least give you peace of mind to have them explained and perhaps there are treatments that could help reduce them. I am glad your mom got a competent doctor and treatment. You all are in my prayers. I am looking around, and my new PCP is taking me seriously and helping me find neurologist that she can work with on my symptoms. Hopefully, a step in the right direction. That is great! Are the muscle spasms /twitches visible? For several years I had, what I called, Involuntary Muscle Spasms, in my legs. They were sometimes visible, other times deeper but I could feel them. I began using my phone to both time the duration of spasms as well as record the visible ones. There is a medical term for such twitching but I cannot seem to recall what it is.\n\nHave you had MRI's of your neck, back, chest, ...?\n\nHave you had genetic testing?\n\nIt was via genetic testing I discovered I not only have CMT2D but also 2 other neuromuscular genetic defects. Motor-sensory neuropathy type 6 and type 7. \n\nThe MRI;s revealed pretty extensive stenosis in both the neck and back. Also, that a nerve was pinched and decompression surgery was needed. That is it is own horror story I will not go in to now.\n\nRegarding the speech and recall issues. I would suggest you create v you create a word processing document listing every medication you take, dosage, frequency, prescriber. Then look up each drug on drugs.com or whichever site you prefer, and then on your word processing document, hyperlink each drug to the drugs.com and look carefully at ALL the side effects.\n\nBy doing this, I discovered many of the drugs I was on could have these kind of side effects, even if they are rare.\n\nIf you stop a drug, do not delete it from your list/ Rather, move it to a HISTORICAL document. keep all the same info. Add start/stop dates. Why stopped.\n\nLastly, be your own advocate! TELL your dr's you want something. MRI, labwork, a specific medication, change in dosage. TELL them you want testing, EMG's of arms, legs, or xrays, or whatever,\n\nLast, last thing. I have lost much confidence, trust, in the American medical system. Most especially the 'specialist'. You are not alone in your distrust, frustrations, anger, hurt, disgust with the system or the doctors.\n\nBE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE! I saw this while lurking around (undiagnosed but with known FIG4 mutations and symptoms).\n\nI have two friends who have Tourette\u2019s and this REALLY sounds like that. This is very similar to how they describe their condition, as well as what it looks like from the outside. (Neither of them swears a lot btw\u2014 that is just a stereotype. Well, one does but she does but mostly just does so to mess with people who stare at her tics. When it is just us, I am the sailor-mouthed one and I do not really have any excuse.)", "Inducing Muscle Hyperlasia for New Muscle Growth Has anyone either explored kr spoken to a doctor or neurologist about ways of inducing muscle hyperlasia in order to encourage new growth of muscles? While there are drugs that can do this other way such as blood flow restriction can be used - has anyone explored either of these options?", "Nortriptyline? I have been struggling with being prescribed any sort of pain medication that can help. I have never had an effective way to manage my chronic pain, which has affected me my whole life. I had accepted it as something I would just have to deal with until recently, where I realized I didnt have to be miserable. But my doctor seems completely clueless. OTC stuff does not work, and previously I was prescribed gabapentin, which also did not help. I have never been prescribed muscle relaxants or opioids, but from experience I know they work. My doctor's next prescription is an antidepressant called nortriptyline. I am doubtful it will do anything, but I have to test it (trial and error.) Does anyone have any experience with this? I recently tried it, specifically to try to deal with burning foot pain. I already take Lyrica and Palexia which do provide me with some relief, but the Nortriptyline did not help. No side effects, but no benefit either. Unfortunately pain management is just so much trial and error. If it is legal where you are, I have had good responses to arthritis pain and bone aches and pain using CBD oils and edibles. It is not for everyone though and I understand that. Just sharing what has worked for me.  \n\n\n\\*To answer your main question and to be completely unhelpful, no I have no experience with those meds. That probably will not do anything besides screw up your liver. Its use to suppress neuropathic pain is sketchy at best.\n\nIf you can, push for **Baclofen**. Just note it has some side effects so you will want to be carefully monitored and taper up (and down if need be) on it. Baclofen targets the specific receptors in the brain that are responsible for causing CMT and helps with CNS issues. which is better for the pain the CBD or edibles? they do different jobs right?", "Looking for shoes/ shoe brands that have arch and ankle support? I need to start wearing shoes with better ankle support like boots as I twist my ankles a lot or they give in on me. Are there any brands that anyone recommends that still are kind of cute?

What do I need to know? What modifications do I need to make to the form of the excercicses?  Well I do not know how you are going to deadlift or squat, but if you can I would like know how that goes for you. \n\nMy variations have been \n\nLeg press substituting for squats \nAnd stiff leg deadlifts/rack pulls for deadlifts \nAnd bench should not be a problem  I finally started today. I used a wide sumo stance for deadlifts and squats, but I am not sure if I went deep enough. I am probably going to buy a pair of weightlifting shoes that have heels in them to help me get deeper and keep my heels in the ground. Interesting, how was your balance on the squats?  I did not have any issues with balance and I think that the wide stance helped a lot, but I was using a relativey light weight (65lbs) and I did have issues breaking parallel That is awesome. Let me know it continues for you! How was benching an other less \"complicated\" lifts for ya? I actually just started today and I did ohp/dead/squat.  I have never actually barbell benched yet. The overhead press went fine, except that my shoulders are really weak (probably not related to CMT) and I failed one rep on the third set with just the bar. I will make sure to let you know how everything after a little bit! I am late to the party here but I am wondering how this was going for you. Do you have problems with long recovery times? Are you keeping weight low in general?\n\nI have a small frame and am 5'9\" and come from a family of lanky guys, my CMT is pretty mild but I cannot seem to handle squats (poor form with any substantial weight and long recovery times). I do fine on a leg press. I can bench just fine but cannot seem to move past plates.  I ended up switching to ( just becuase I liked it better. Everything is going pretty well, coming off my second cycle after a very short run at StrongLifts, I am up to:\n\nBench 105x4x4\n\nSquat 125x4x4\n\nDeadlift 185x4x4\n\nNeither my squat or deadlift have stalled since I started. My bench has a bunch, but I recently realized I was adding weight faster than he recommended so I am hoping correcting that fixes it.\n\nAs for recovery, I think a lot of people get confused about this. Being sore does not mean you are not recovered. For me at least, I did not have any serious DOMS after doing StrongLifts for like a week. You just have to work through it.\n\nObviously, having CMT I have really terrible mobility and difficulty squatting. What has helped me a ton has been a pair of squat shoes with an elevated heal. A heavier weight actually helps me break parallel with the force it puts on my feet. Make sure to brace properly when you squat! Tbh, barbell squats and deadlifts have done more for my mobility and balance in the past month than anything my doctor has ever had me do.", "Blocking the Thrombin Receptor Promotes Repair of Demyelinated Lesions in the Adult Brain  Interesting paper about promoting repair of myelin in the brain by giving a nudge in the right direction to the astrocytes. Not applicable to CMT as the peripheral nervous system does not have astrocytes, but schwann cells instead. Yeah this is worthless news AFAIK I was like wait what?! It messes our brain too?! XD It is easy to see a paper about myelination and get excited, but the mechanisms for myelination in the brain are totally different than the mechanisms for myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Biology is weird! But at least we do not have to worry about brain involvement. Yeah our brains are apart of our central nervous system right? CMT pretty much is localised to our peripheral nervous system.  You would totally right I guess the silver lining is that as far as neurological conditions go we got off kind of lucky in my opinion, sucky as the symptoms of it can be. Absolutely. \nGranted, it is my brain that agrees that it is good that the symptoms are exclusively in the peripheral nervous system and never the central nervous system (aka the brain) so it might be biased :) To make it a little more depressing, there is a *lot* of research at the moment around remylenation in the brain/spine. So odds are greater than 50/50 that any articles you see about mylenation are CNS focused.", "Protecting from joint pain? Hey all, CMT1A checking in.

After a year of looking and no prospects I signed up for disability and because of how much I was making at my last job I am receiving a nice amount.  I would have liked to keep working but I just was not able to find the right job for my condition. Is it a standing / walking job?  Braces might help.\nIs it a typing job?  Three finger typing will work.\n\nReally, what is the work you are hoping to do? I am 30 and recently went part time. I was feeling exhausted for so long and did not have the energy to just keep up with activities of daily life. I felt like I was never caught up. I investigated everything. Blood work, sleep study were normal, I am not depressed. I finally decided in November of last year that I needed to go part time. I have been doing much better, though I do hope to eventually go back to full time work for the extra cash, if I feel like I can. I am the same.

Discussion thread?\nI do not really know how Reddit works.\nI am 71 and live in New Hampshire.  I have CMT1A.  I wear Allard Bluerocker AFO.  My hands and feet work but are weak and getting more so. Last year I travelled to Boston to the CMT Center of Excellence.\nWhat else should I say? Hi! Welcome! You are in a subreddit which is basically a place to post your thoughts and have people reply. And here we are!\n\nGreat start! You can reply to me and then we have really got a conversation going.\n\nI am 43 and have CMT and we are about to have our first child... Hi and welcome! I have CMT 1A as well. I have heard very good things about the CMT Centers of Excellence, how was your experience visiting them?\n\nJust for your information, when someone replies to one of your posts, you will get a red letter in the top right hand corner. If you click it it will show you the new replies. I could also mention that this particular subreddit is a bit slower than many other subreddits, but about 30-40 unique visitors view it every day and there are usually a couple of news posts made every week. Welcome!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am just 30 and was very recently diagnosed. I am still working on coping and new to the community as well.   \n\n\nI have been diagnosed with CMT of an unknown type. Hey hey!\n\nSo at 71 what will not help you is that your Testosterone will also be dropping. This causes normal men to lose muscular mass, so this is even more problematic for men with CMT.\n\nI would recommend seeing a doctor and getting your testosterone tested and then inevitably taking something to boost it. That would be a quick fix to loss of strength for the moment. I am about to be 31 and was diagnosed at a very young age. What got you to go to the doctor to get diagnosed? Not severe symptoms? No Family history, so I had no clue what was going on. For a while before this diagnosis I think I was in a sort of denial that there was any problem. What was once a toe became a problem in my legs over the course of a few years. I have never understood the prognosis (I do not think the doctors ever tried to give me a real idea probably because they dont know). With my case I dont know of any family with it either. Had obvious issues very young but all I have ever had provided to me were the AFOs to help support me when walking. So with that being said i never saw any point in spending time and money on doctors since being an adult. My hands are weak and I have zero mobility in my feet but very sensitive. I wonder what the difference is between the types and if progression varies from person to person regardless of the type. This is part of the reason I got on reddit to read and see if theres anything to be learned. I dont know anyone with cmt either so it makes it seem sort of isolating. Even among people with CMT, people like us with no family history are quite rare.\n\nSo far, it seems this part varies from person to person. \n\nI am no doctor, and my research is limited to just my own. There seems to be an autoimmune aspect to cmt at its base level. Something like the body eating away at nerves, starting at peripherals. \n\nIf this is the case, then I think it would certainly vary from person to person depending upon nerve density in those area, any past trauma, and possibly diet or overall physical health. Probably a bunch of other variables, too. Sure, that is kind of what I have concluded too. I have not been the healthiest in the past though and I am not sure if that made it worse. I never over ate though because I knew if I gained too much weight itd be harder on me feet. I do wonder about the circulation to my hand and feet with the lack of muscle. I also smoked a good amount up until July last year. I have also read alcohol can be bad and noticed if I drink it does make me more susceptible to injuries. \n\nIts interesting to see how it does not affect some people until later in life though. It affected me to where I stood on my tip toes as a toddler then I fairly quickly lost use of my feet (I cannot remember that far back). \n\nAs far as family history I know it came from my moms side of the family but I do not have any type of connection with them or her so even if there was history I would not know. It really snuck up on me. My feet even look mostly normal (albeit a bit flat footed)\n\nAs far as circulation, got to stretch routinely. I use this video for my hands sometimes and use the stretches all the time  Thanks I will try that...I do not usually do any stretching or exercises ever so it might help.", "I went to a networking event and asked for help #BigStep Today I went to a networking event and it was pretty packed.

In the world of CMT research, the CMTA have made some very substantial advances these past few years. I am going to quote ( page, which lists the key points of CMT1A STAR research project progress for 2015:\n\n\n*CMT Type 1A is caused by the duplication of the Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) gene, which leads to the demyelination of the peripheral nerves. The research to date has focused on finding small molecules that interact with specific molecular targets to downregulate the production of PMP22 or to correct a downstream defect of PMP22 overproduction.*\n\n*Sanofi\u2019s U.S. screening center finished screening the 1.9 million compounds in its repository in early 2015, using a cell-based assay that reports the activation of the gene for PMP22 by emitting a light signal. Further work has distilled the screen results down to those small molecules that are specific for the regulation of PMP22 and that do not regulate other myelin proteins. A number of specific targets have been identified with molecules that target them.  This team effort involves a number of STAR investigator groups at the Universities of Wisconsin, Buffalo, Johns Hopkins and the NIH, working together with teams of investigators from Genzyme and Sanofi (U.S.).*\n\n*The National Institutes of Health has also used the cell-based reporter assay to complete its own 400,000 small molecule screen using the NIH Small Molecule Repository. They are currently conducting further screening on 10,000 of those compounds to confirm their activity. This work has been supported by a NIH grant to Dr. John Svaren at the University of Wisconsin, with additional support from the CMTA.*\n\n*Preclinical investigation to validate the role of several pharmacological approaches to ameliorate the effects of PMP22 overexpression has taken a big step forward in 2015. Alliance partners Addex and Affectis have provided drug candidates to the molecular targets GABAb and P2X7, respectively. We have also pursued in vivo follow-up studies to a previously identified class of proteasome inhibitor.  The GABAb and P2X7 targets were earlier reported to be causally linked to PMP22 function in Schwann cells, and clinical development candidates that specifically regulate their function are already available via our alliances.  Work has also been successful this year in progressing drug candidates for all three target classes towards an in vivo proof-of-principle that shows the pathology of CMT1A can be chronically regulated in genetic animal models of the disease.  PsychoGenics is our CRO (contract research organization) alliance partner performing the investigational studies in rat and mouse models of CMT1A.*\n\n*The lab of Dr. Gabsang Lee at Johns Hopkins University is advancing work on differentiating human stem cells from CMT1A patients into mature, myelinating Schwann cells. This is part of a STAR consortium effort with the NY Stem Cell Foundation to create induced pluripotent stem cell lines (iPSC) to rigorous standards from patient skin cells, and introduce them into CMTA investigational work. The Hopkins lab is also working to introduce new iPSC cell line methods into drug candidate testing being used in our alliances.*\n\n*The careful in vitro assessment of candidate drugs is an essential piece of each STAR alliance effort going forward. For this, reason the CMTA has commissioned Dr. Laura Feltri\u2019s lab at the University of Buffalo to regularly produce co-cultures of nerve and Schwann cells that actively form myelin. The evaluation of myelin marker response in this system to the treatment of candidate drugs is ongoing in support of our sponsored research and alliance activities.*\n\n*Going forward, robust biomarkers of CMT1A disease progression are needed to aid patient selection for clinical trials, and to evaluate drug responsiveness. For this reason, Dr. John Svaren\u2019s lab at the University of Wisconsin has been working to expand our knowledge of how Schwann cell\u2013specific molecules are regulated in CMT1A as a reporter of defective myelination.*\n\nIf you want to help CMT researchers and/or be a participant in clinical trials, consider joining the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network Contact Registry. If you do, you will be asked to answer CMT-related surveys once in a while, and you might be invited to participate in clinical trials. It is all optional of course. More information about that here:\n\n\n\nI am excited to see what 2016 has in store for CMT research. My hope is for a treatment for 1A before 2020. That would truly be something. ", "Braces and test results I got my genetic test results back it seems I have an abnormality in my MBZ gene. I was told this abnormality is common with two types of CMT. Type 1B or type 2i. I will be doing more test and what not to narrow down which one it is.\n\nAlso I got fitted for custom day braces to wear when i walk I should get them around Thanksgiving. I also got a pair of night time sleep braces I will be sharing pictures of them both when I get the other ones. \n\nIt seems that since ive gone for 15 years with out any proper support that my ankles rolled out so much so that they think it is necessary for the night braces. \n\nI am really excited about this! Yes. Appliances are a help and a relief. There are a decent number of extra depth shoe styles to fit AFOs nowadays, so it is no longer such a problem to find them. Oh nice if my boots dont fit them ill have to look for a pair that will work with them I couldnt remeber the acronym AFO when I was writing my post thank you Guys is night braces important? Idk I am kind of new to this personally That is ok bro thanks any way I have had mixed comments from various specialists. Some say they are a complete waste, others say they are amazing. Would depend on what your specific problem is. If addressing contracture, they could help. If it is more a weakness issue, they are useless I have them both I guess \ud83d\ude42\u270c\ufe0f My feet go numb if I do not wear the night braces. I think they are necessary to combat foot drop and contractures. I havent gotten used to mine yet. I can only wear them for short period of time my toes go all numb/tingly when i try to sleep with them and it wakes me up. Also its hard to find a comfortable position to lay with them on while trying to fall asleep", "Driving So I am 16 and want to start learning how to drive. How is the process different for adaptive driving? I am unable to drive the regular way so what kind of things will be different? I just want to know what to expect. It really depends what element of driving is not possible for you. There are different adaptive technologies for if you cannot use foot pedals or need assistance steering, etc. so it depends on how your condition is manifesting! What aspect of ordinary driving are you unable to do? That sorta dictates what to expect.   \n\n\nAlso country is important. I do not have enough strength to push the petals with my feet and I am in the us I had that issue when I started, and it was simply a matter of finding a smaller car and applying the force from the thigh rather than the ankle like the bitch instructor wanted.  Might be easier than dealing with modifications.", "Kneeling squat exercise I currently workout and have been doing so consistently for a year now. I have seen a decent amount of benefits and improvements thus far but always struggle with finding weight lifting exercises that do not require balance.\n\nI have tried doing regular squats using a smith machine but struggle way too much so gave up. I came across this other version of squat exercises where you are actually kneeling and this I confidently know I can do. \n\nHere is a link to a photo/guide of what they are: \n\nI am wondering if anyone has tried these or does this currently. Have you benefited from them and are there any tips you can share? That looks interesting!\n\nI do glute bridges (there is also a weighted form of this, which I aspire to someday)\n\nvideo guide to glute bridge form: ( Sweet, never thought about that as an option Now this looks promising thanks for sharing this. Best progression I have found for quads (and a great channel overall):\n\n\nAlso try a box squat (use something more stable to sit on though):\n\nThis channel is more advanced but he shows good form for everything.\n\nRelated to legs, I find the sumo deadlift easier than standard:\n\n\nI second the glute bridges that NixyeNox points out. Glute activation is vital for any lower body exercise (balance, protects the low back). Do those first.\n\nPlease be sure to watch videos on proper form before starting any exercise. Best solution here is machines.\n\nSeated leg curl, hamstring curl, &amp; leg press will get you everything you need without the issue of balance and reduce the chance of injury.\n\nThough the absolute best is the inclined plate loaded leg press. That will do everything depending on your stance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow the chance of injury to your leg muscles is high as form will be bad and muscle build is poor. Some muscles are overdeveloped i.e. calf muscles, but they will be too short. Hamstrings will be short and weak, and quads will be short. So you will want to stretch the hell out of everything, everyday, if you want to avoid injury.\n\nAlso be wary of hip pain. People with CMT have a higher risk of hip dysplasia and this will be aggravated if you exercise. This happened to me and I had to get a new hip by 26.", "Involuntary Shivering Hello everyone. I wanted to post this really quick just in case anyone else ends up with this experience. \n\nCMT type currently unknown (Athena is being a butthole about letting me do testing) and I just got my second Pfizer dose yesterday at 11:30am.\n\nIt is now 5:36am and I am awake because at 4 I began involuntarily shivering (not quite convulsions but also not regular shivers). It went on for about 45 minutes even though I was quite toasty in my blankets. I have not heard of any of my friends having this side effect so I am going with the assumption it is related to the neuropathy. \n\nAside from this both doses have been very tolerable with minor joint pain and some increase in thirst. I am just now very tired and unable to fall back asleep. \n\nOh in case it gets asked it went on so long because it took me a good while to become fully conscious and work up the energy to get out of bed. I can still sort of feel my body wanting to do it again as well. I experiences this with the j&amp;j but I also had a minor fever so I related it to that. One of my friends got the pfizer and he does not have CMT but got exactly what you described, no fever but like shivering shakes that lasted hours. So I think it is somewhat common of a side effect for the vaccines.", "R/JoeBob Whatever his current number is a disingenuos at best.

Several of my family members have CMT and all have drop foot.   One uncle who has it seems to be affected differently.   His feet have twisted inward to the point where he is literally walking on the outside of his ankle.  I wonder if anyone here has experienced CMT in this manner and what are the options..  if any...   to make any corrections at this point. Wearing AFOs did not help to prevent deformity? My right is rolling out so my AFOs are designed to put it in the proper position. But this is early stages. There are surgeons and either CLTA or HNF has done a webinar on that I am pretty sure. Unfortunately he did not wear his braces for many years and now the ones he is wearing just are not strong enough.  He keeps snapping them I am guessing because of the twisting position.  And he is now unable to walk at all without them.  I have been trying to encourage him to go see what his options are at this point but honestly I am afraid that it may be beyond repair. Haha yup this is me to a T XD see I had a tethered spine that caused my right leg to be worse of than my left. The tendons in the right side of my left foot are placid like a wet tissue while the tendons in the left side are weirdly strong sooooo you see where I am going with this? I know the ground better than I know myself XD Yep. For a few years I was walking on the outside of my foot. It took years to get to that point of course, as all through childhood I refused to wear my braces. I had to have surgery to correct it, but it is pretty much normal now and I do not need braces at all anymore. There is a cavus deformity of the foot from imbalance of muscle loss. The peroneal  brevus keeps your foot from turning in and peroneal longus pulls the foot inward . With CMT brevus is lost sooner than longus so there is a rotation and twisting of the foot . Overtime this becomes fixed and requires surgery to correct.  I have CMT and am a pediatrician . I have strength trained since age 14 ( diagnosed at 5 when my older brother and dad were diagnosed) . Strength training keeps the shooting pains minimized and helps with balance and stamina. I am now 50.5 and still active.  Good luck!", "Where do I start with CMT? Validate me please :) Hello Everyone,\n\nI have felt unwell for years and when I stumbled across CMT I started crying because I KNOW this is what is wrong with me.\n\nI am a 29 year old woman and I have suffered from leg/foot pain my entire life. At the age of 12 my legs hurt so bad I convinced my parents to take me to the doctor after months of them assuring me it was just growing pains. I complained about the pain in my feet, hips, and joints and was having difficulty walking by the time my appointment came around. The doctor said it was caused by iliotibial band syndrome (which is a knee injury) and told me to avoid running or other repetitive legs motions. According to him, it also explained the weird way I walk. As a child other kids referred to me as \"giraffe girl\" because of my unusual gait.  Now that I look it up as an adult I realized that I was misdiagnosed and I have blamed a lot of my leg pain on this BS explanation. I just considered the pain an annoying aspect of my life and moved on. In my mid-20's the leg pain came back and I was having trouble concentrating and I was exhausted all the time. I always blamed work or my poor diet or lack of exercise (it had always been difficult for me to exercise despite the fact that I am a relatively think and otherwise healthy person) and the pain was so severe I was sure I was dying and went to the emergency room. They did tests, x rays, ultrasounds, etc and found nothing wrong with my legs. The ER doc sent me on my way with a referral to an internist to diagnose my mystery pain. I saw the internist who was very direct and abrasive who told me it was probably multiple sclerosis. I started seeing a different doctor who was always trying to give me a prescription instead of finding the cause. Was it fibromyalgia? MS? Something else? I saw this doctor for months and when none of the other testing revealed an problem she finally ordered a brain scan for me which revealed I had some very mild inflammation but I would need an additional brain scan after six months to see if there was any change to confirm a diagnosis of MS. I was broken,  $13k deep in medical debt, and defeated that I could not find an explanation for my pain. I felt and still feel like no one believes me when I say I do not feel well. I have gone three years without seeing a doctor for my symptoms because I felt like it must be all in my head. I must just be dramatic and everyone feels this way but they do not complain. There is nothing anyone can do to help so why bother?\n\n I just take my flares on the chin and power through life the best I can. Some days I am so exhausted from normal every day tasks that I cannot even hold a conversation with my husband. I become so tired I cannot move and my body aches and hurts and my legs and feel always feel numb so I just lay on the couch like a corpse when I am having a bad \"flare\". It has been hard but  I am still paying off my debt from 3-4 years ago and was not interested in accruing more debt for doctors that were not able to find anything wrong or help me in any way. For over a year I had a debilitating pain in my face that I attributed to MS and WEDMD'd myself into thinking that it was trigeminal neuralgia because I thought I just has MS and that was a common ailment. I ended up breaking a tooth and when I went to the dentist x-rays revealed I actually had a raging infecting in my jaw bone which was causing my pain - NOT trigeminal neuralgia caused by MS. Discovering the source of my pain was due to some shoddy military dental work a decade ago has set my life in a different direction in so many ways - but let us just focus on my health issues for now lol\n\nI have been in a \"flare\" (please excuse my quotes that is just what I call them because there are days when I feel like a normal person and other days where I feel like my body is giving up on life and slowly dying. I started following the #spoontheory hashtag on Instagram and randomly saw the name Charcot Marie Tooth and thought WOW WHAT A WEIRD NAME. The name lingered with me for weeks and I felt the need to google it and OH MY GOD I AM CRYING NOW THIS IS IT I KNOW IT. I have not seen a doctor in years and my health insurance is shit and I do not know if it is even worth seeing a doctor? I told my husband that after four years I figured out what my invisible illness is and he blank faced me and seemed disinterested when I was having a life changing moment.  I just want to connect with people who understand what I am going through who can point me in the right direct. I live in Arizona if anyone recommends a doctor or a facility I can go to!\n\nNumbness/tingling in hands and feet. I had to give up driving stick shift after my feel and legs could not longer manage the clutch.

Any info?\n\nGiraffe Girl walk and difficulty walking\n\nSometimes it feels like I am moving through quicksand just walking or doing every day tasks.\n\nHemorrhaging after the birth of both my children - which has been linked to CMT. Does anyone have more info on this?\n\nInguinal/hiatal hernias. I had the hiatal hernia during pregnancy which mostly corrected itself. The inguinal hernia in my groin was surgically repaired but I am not sure if my weak abdominal muscles have anything to do with CMT or another genetic issue? My paternal grandfather who had hernia issues but I am pretty sure CMT could be genetic along my mothers side of the family. Does anyone have more info on this?\n\n High arches and maybe not quite hammertoes but my feet definitely are not pretty. \n\nFrequent headaches\n\nSoul-killing, incapacitating, life force stealing fatigue.\n\nBrain fog - I have such a hard time thinking sometimes. I am a relatively smart person and I know CMT affects peripheral nerves but the fatigue makes it so hard to think or speak sometimes. \n\nHard time regulating body temperature - I shiver if it gets below 75 degrees. I also live in AZ, but even in the air conditioning on the hottest day of summer I feel the need to go outside and warm myself up. I read that this can be cause by low blood pressure - does anyone else have more info on this? \n\nDifficulty running/infamously uncoordinated/slow reflexes\n\nI appreciate any feeback or help or comments or info!\n\nThanks! A lot of these symptoms are not likely related to CMT - headaches, hernia, hemorrhaging. But the other stuff could be. Look on the CMT website. You can find doctors here  (  \n\nIf you have CMT, getting leg braces can often be life-changing - no more feeling like you are walking through mud. Wow you are going through a lot! A lot of us have been there! Whether it is CMT or not- hard to say. There is so many possibilities as to what it could be. As sometimes symptoms overlap.  The best thing you can do is see a neurologist about it and have nerve conduction tests done and if possible a genetic test done.  The genetic tests can cost hundreds or in my case nothing- depending on income level. I am sorry you have been through so much. It is maddening to not even have a name for your medical problems. \n\nI do not know if you have CMT; the symptoms vary between subtypes and you have some, like hemorrhaging, that I have not personally run across being associated with CMT before. But! There is a genetic blood test for most types of CMT. I would suggest that you try to start there. It is a quick blood draw and it eliminates the need for guessing. You will need to get a doctor to order the test. \n\nThere is no real treatment (yet) for CMT, but there are ways to manage the symptoms, like leg braces. Even if you do not have CMT but a similar disorder, it sounds like braces might be something to consider, to help with your gait and fatigue issues. \n\nBest of luck navigating the medical system. For the fatigue, you will want a sleep study done. I suffered massively from debilitating daytime sleepiness (medically different from fatigue), and turns out I have mild non-REM parasomnia. Is this linked to CMT? Maybe, maybe not, but luckily meds can quite readily solve it. Hello, \n\nI just started putting \"Charcot Marie Tooth \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" with whichever ailment I have sought medical attention for before. However, I know that correlations do not always equal cause so I am just poking around Reddit seeing if anyone has more information. I know CMT cannot be the root of all of my problems but it presents in so many different ways I have gone down the  rabbit hole and cannot absorb the information fast enough. Thank you for the recommendation I am going to start the process of finding a doctor and that is the perfect resource. Do you use leg braces?\n\nThanks!\n\nHere are the sources that supported the potential correlation between CMT and issues I have had if you are interested! \n\n**Headaches:**\n\n**Some CMT patients have reported tension headaches from off-balance gait, scoliosis, and neck &amp; spine arthritis.**\n\n(\n\n(\n\n**Hemorrhage:**\n\n**Patients with CMT have more operative deliveries, malpresentations and postpartum bleeding than the general obstetric population. It is not clear whether the increased prevalence of malpresentation is related to fetal disease, although the disorder typically does not present until later in childhood. Postpartum bleeding from atony may be related to the disease effect on uterine adrenergic nerves.**\n\n( \n\nI did not find much infomation on hernias and CMT, but I was piggy backing off of the pregnancy posting and just was curious. It means a lot just to have other people who understand what it is like. How were you able to get a free genetic test for CMT, if you do not mind me asking? I have been trying to price it out and I am pretty sure my insurance will not cover it. \n\nThanks! I was seeing my neurologist a few years ago and he asked me if I wanted to see the genetic counselor there and I said yes. She offered me two options. One was a test that cost a couple hundred dollars after insurance. And the other was a test that had rules for people with lower income. Basically what you paid was based on income level. And mine was low enough I payed nothing and that is how I knew for sure that I had CMT2A2. OMG ! First off. HUGS.........You sound like me in my 20s. I was Diagnosed with this that and the other to \u201cPOO POO\u201d me and my concerns away.  Every diagnosis has lap over symptoms. And \u201cit is in your head\u201d  remained a constant in the forefront of what was going on with me.  \n\nMy complaints went to deaf ears to the point where I just stoped. \n\nI knew my pain !  I know my struggle!  I advocate for myself and I do not need Medical Doctors to validate my pain or condition.  The information can be beneficial but I do not need their proof or approval.  \n\nI changed the way I approached my health and wellness.  I took charge. I decided to eat very healthy.  I decided to Use MMJ to treat my Pain and mobility issues.   I decided to stop explaining my body, my pain, my issues.  They are what they are. I write in a journal and cast that crap away!  I do not carry it on my shoulders or with me every moment.  \nI take care of myself !  I was I guess waiting for a doctor to take care of me. I make the rules. I am the expert on my body!    \n\nI did not have my official CMT genetics diagnosis till I was 34 years old.  \nI have had terrible Symptoms since childhood.  After I gave up knowing for myself. My son was diagnosed as having CMT and I finally was able to get tested. My child needed to confirm his Diagnosis with a parents DNA \ud83e\uddec And I am the CMT carrier.   \n\nOf all the diagnosis the doctors gave me throughout my life and them guessing at what was truly in my head  CMT was never part of the discussion. My child\u2019s geneticist was the person who cracked the code for my family and I.  \n\nMy long drawn out message is .... do not dwell on the \u201cOfficial Diagnosis\u201d. It will come \ud83d\udc97  \n\nTake the best care of yourself Physically Emotionally and Spiritually that you are able to do.  You are a Priority!  \n\nYou are the expert on your own body. Listen to yourself! Well, the headache thing just says that some cmt patients have reported headaches. I am not convinced that this is causal. Lots of people have headaches whether or not they have CMT. As for the other, this was not a study comparing two large groups of patients. It was an observation of only 2 patients in Croatia. CMT is a disorder of the peripheral nerves. I think that you can have these other symptoms and still have CMT. These just are likely not things that would point that direction. Have you had an EMG? This is one of the tests that we usually get early on in our CMT diagnosis that helps us get diagnosed. My neurologist also looked at some of my symptoms - like the fact that I cannot walk on toes or heels - as an indicator. I agree about headaches, though it should be noted that approximately one-third of patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease have scoliosis and/or kyphosis which in turn is associated with headaches (tension headaches and/or increased CSF pressure in more extreme cases). In the absence of spinal deformities though I am not aware of any correlation between CMT and headache either.\n\nAs for postpartum bleeding I tried to look up the study cited above but unfortunately the full article is in Croatian. There are similar ones in the literature though, such as ( ( which also have a higher sample size (n=108). (Off topic, but I just realized that my mother is probably a part of this study!) \nIn this one the authors report that postpartum bleeding is more common in mothers with CMT compared to the rest of the population and they speculate that it could be caused by CMT causing a loss of tone in the uterine musculature (uterine atony). I do not see how CMT would explain a migraine headache but possibly a  tension headache caused by a misalignment of the body. In the past couple weeks I have been experiencing a lot of weakness and difficulty walking as well as a couple falls. I just so happened to stumble upon CMT and realized it was the answer I have been looking for. I have not seen a doctor for my issues in 3+ years because no one could give me answers. Now I am able to go to them and say \"this makes sense please test me\". I have started the long process to collect my old medical records from an office that is no longer open but I am hoping that when I see the new doctor my lack of knee reflex, ugly feet, and gait will get the referrals rolling. Thank you for letting me know what to ask about. This is exactly what I needed. Thank you so much! WAIT now there is ANOTHER digit added to the diagnoses??! I have known all my life that I have type 2 and only recently (in the past year) learned that I have type 2A. \n\nSide note, look into Dr. Shy with the University of Iowa hospital! My family and I went to him back in January for a CMT2A clinical study! Yep there is subtypes! Mine is a very rare one. Just in case you did not already know, there is a medication called \"( which is sometimes used when treating bacterial infections. There is reason to believe that it might be contraindicated in people with CMT2A2, see ( case study. It is in the \"uncertain or minor risk\" category in the CMTA list of neurotoxic medications, however the reaction in the case study above is pretty severe so it is probably a good idea to be aware about this when you have CMT2A2. As far as I can see, there is even more! CMT2A2 is further split into CMT2A2A and CMT2A2B. The genetics of CMT2 is pretty wild, with a lot of different genetic causes. No, I do not recall seeing that one listed before. Though it seems to be a medication for tuberculosis? It is scary the things you have to look out for -- and maybe some things we do not know about yet. It is used for treating tuberculosis as well as mycobacterial infections, most commonly \"Mycobacterium avium complex\" (MAC) infections. From what I gather infections with Mycobacterium species mainly happen in people with certain lung diseases and/or in people who undergo immunosuppression. Both Tuberculosis and mycobacterial infections are uncommon in developed countries so if you live in one of those it is unlikely that it will ever be a problem.\nI am sure other contraindications will discovered in the future, but chances are that the more common ones have already been described already. Sounds like you have had such a long road with your symptoms. I think a lot of us can relate to being misdiagnosed and invalidated for years, so know you are not alone. Best look up a doctor who is experienced with CMT and have an assessment and get the support you deserve. It can be overwhelming with all the information out there once you have disovered you have CMT so go slow, and see what advice your doctor has. All the best!", "Advice about my son, whose father has CMT My son is 14, and has high arches on his feet. Actually his feet look exactly like the pictures of the feet on the internet, if you search for Charcot Marie Tooth under Google images. He is had these high arches pretty much since he was small, though. Other than this, his calf muscles seem skinny, but he is always been skinny. His father was diagnosed with CMT when he was about this age, or maybe a little older, back in the 1980s. His father has had 7 or 8 operations on his feet. As far as I know, his father's hands were never affected, and he is now in his 50s. The father and I are divorced and do not see eye to eye on getting proactive treatment. Also, my son does not complain of any pain or numbness. He does have cold hands and feet though. What would people suggest I do? Wait and see if he does eventually have pain? I do not want to cause any fear mongering, so I have not spoken up about my concerns. Just thought I would consult some real people who have CMT, and find out how they were diagnosed, and at what age they noticed anything unusual, including the stereotypical high arches that some people experience. Thanks.", "Alternatives to AFO's ", "Foot drop therapy ", "Breathing problems with CMT Greets.\n\nI am 63, have CMT type 1 and central &amp; obstructive sleep apnea.  I am getting substantially weaker and my RR is sometimes 8 or 9. It is usually 10.  I have not gained any weight and am dieting to get down a little.\n\nI have heard that increasing muscle weakness often corresponds with increased difficulty breathing.  Does anyone have any experience with breathing problems attributable to CMT? CMT does not affect the torso so it cannot be the primary cause of your apnea.  This is true even though it often leads to obesity and/or sedentary issues with age due to reduced mobility.\nMuscle weakness associated with breathing issues is quite common in other similar disorders ; since you state you have type 1 one assumes a genetic diagnosis was made.\n\nWhat suggestions have physicians provided you? Sorry, I did not explain myself very well.\n\n1) I do have apnea independent of CMT.    Extra weight can make breathing harder because the chest muscles have to work harder to push &amp; pull the chest muscles., e.g., if you weigh 150 &amp; you put on 50 pounds, your muscles have more work to.\n\nConversely increased muscle weakness would make it harder to push &amp; pull those muscles, e.g, if your weight weight remained 150 you would lose the strength it took to move that stable 150.  Lorazepam weakens my muscles and my sleep improved when I stopped taking it. All the literature says apnea patients should not use benes for that reason.\n\nAs for what doctors say, \"That does not usually happen.\"  Because of that, they dismiss the possibility.   I use an Aircurve 10 for the apnea.  My last two doctors did not know that various settings could be changed in increments of 0.2 and that one setting would not go higher than 6.   I told them that does not inspire confidence but I am stuck with them on account of the cost.\n\nAs for the type, mine manifested itself when I first started to walk; I needed hand rails. By the time I was 6 I could not run worth a hoot.   I developed hammer toes &amp; drop foot very early  and needed my ankles fused about 40 years ago.  I cannot imagine it is not type 1.\n\nThanks There have been studies showing significantly higher incidence of sleep apnoea in people with CMT type 1, but I am not aware of any studies into specific treatments or why this is the case.\n\n \n\nI have sleep apnoea and treat it with cpap, my neuro notes it, but does not seem to rate any additional concern. Wow - very interesting!  My apologies to /u/Ephraimhas as I was unaware of those studies. Breathing problems are definitely a symptom of CMT. My dad has sleep apnea as well as CMT, and recently found out that only one of his lungs is working properly.\n\n( So here is something to think about and could hopefully help.\n\nFrom what I have found by asking many people with CMT, we all (regardless of age) seem incapable of building muscle. Then when you factor in natural muscle wastage as you get older, it would explain why many people with CMT get rapid muscle wastage come 60+ years old.\n\nI would recommend you raise this with your doctor and if possible, start some HRT (Testosterone) and combine that with cardio exercise and see if that helps. That should, in theory, help you to develop greater lung strength and give you the stamina to increase lung capacity. They have no idea to the full impact of CMT on the body. They know their is a link between sleeping disorders (OSA, RLS etc), and it seems that CMT also prevents the ability to develop muscle at a normal rate.\n\nMy advice would be to utterly ignore any doctor who says that CMT \"only affects your peripheral nerves\" and nothing else. These doctors have been screwing up people's lives who suffer from CMT due to arrogance/ignorance/denial/stupidity. Who are the \"they\" you mention?  \nOf course CMT (all versions) affects muscle growth; that is the basic problem.  Do you have any data to support your contention that CMT is not a peripheral nerve disorder? Being incapable of building muscle in certain areas is *exactly* what CMT is.  Steroids and hormones often help, but its just a band-aid over a volcano - ultimately useless.  Understanding what works for **you** is far better for long term success than anything else.  \n\nn.b. - If you are not one who smokes and are having issues with breathing, please revisit your diagnosis Actually that is not what CMT which is why it is also known as HMSN. \n\nThe issue is caused by a gene that stops any myelin sheath being grown around nerve axons which in turns causes an issue with motor control and causes sensory loss. The current, and clearly wrong theory, is that muscle wastage is caused by the muscles not being able to contract properly thus waste over time. However this argument is instantly disproven with CMT patients experiencing DOMS in the muscle sets in question after exercise.\n\nI have only found one paper where they used an AAS and my consultant and her team have never heard of them being used before. Do you have sources of more cases or know of doctors who have used it in the past?\n\nAnd I think a band aid is better than being left to bleed out. At the moment the current approach to anyone with CMT is \"suck it up, you are screwed\", even though there are many solutions which would make day-to-day living much easier. I have cmt2a with obstructive sleep apnea. I use a cpap every night. If you take medications for cmt, talk to your doctor and pharmacist to make sure those medications are not making the apnea worse. Get second opinions when possible and research every medication you are prescribed for side effects. Read all of the prescription literature. Look up studies done on meds.  I think it is more that cmt exacerbates many other conditions than causes them. My father has cmt and sleep apnea but he is also carrying a bit of belly weight. I cannot imagine that helps things very much. ", "CMT and alcohol-ee I am phasing it out, but if I felt social pressured to drink at all, Maker's Mark does the least damage. 80 percent corn, well made. \n\nIt works better than anything on sudden nerve pain, but no bueno long term. Beats having to go to the hospital though Alcohol is not recommended, though I enjoy an occasional drink when out with friends myself. \n\nI am curious why you think Makers Mark does the least damage though? If anything, I would think it would make sense to choose a drink with the lowest percentage alcohol, which is probably not bourbon. No carbs, small amount of wheat, no inflammation. Everything else makes me sick the next day.\n\nBut I am done. My mindset's totally different. Appreciate the reaffirmation that it is not a good idea   i love booze.  love it.  i am a happy drunk and a better person while i am drunk.  but ... i have gone through periods of heavy drinking where i know for a fact it is made my CMT worse and permanently so.\n\n  currently, i am also suffering from the dreaded and rare (i hear) burning-mouth syndrome.  it is the worst thing ever.  and the only thing that seems to calm it down is alcohol.  at the same time, i am told it is also probably causing it.  catch 22!\n\n  in any event, i stopped drinking, for the umpteen time, five days ago.  i usually take antabuse to keep me on the straight and narrow but for some reason, this time, i have not needed it.  we shall see.  onward! Yeah, I feel like I am in a Catch-22 situation in which alcohol relieves symptoms but I feel like it will be harmful in the end. I just had a period of drinking at home for the first time ever and observed what it did without social distractions. Cannot say how much drinking overall affected my CMT, but if I had been diagnosed early I would have probably avoided it as an adult. I recently spoke to a geneticist. Alcohol was only recently removed from the list of meds that someone with CMT should not take. \n\nShe said was mostly because alcohol amplifies your already impaired balance, etc. I will agree with that. It is way better to drink at home than going out where anything can happen to affect your balance. It does help to relax at home. The only issue I have with alcohol is my ability to walk &amp; balance on the rare occasion I get intoxicated, but I have never felt adverse effects from a drink with dinner or a cocktail with friends. What symptoms are associated with CMT &amp; alcohol?", "Today isnt a good day\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude02rant/advice So I am a waitress \nI walk on the sides of my feet\nToday I can barely love after my 7 hour shift.im working my feet look terrible they hurt so much\nIf I did not have cmt I feel like i would feel GREAT!today is an angry day.i hate it so much im tired of being In pain my gabapinton nor Lyrica helped my pain meds do not touch this pain\ud83e\udd2cwhat is your foot care look like if you are on your feet alot.\nI feel like should try for disability That sounds awful! On your feet jobs can be seriously rough for peeps with CMT. Aside from finding a new job, do you wear custom orthotics? They are a serious game changer when it comes to walking or standing a lot and can also help if you are prone to tripping. I am awaiting my braces \ud83d\ude2c I am super nervous about them but I hope they help I have no time line as to when I will get them tho \ud83e\udd7a Good! I hope they have not been delayed by covid! I wore braces (AFO\u2019s) for 6 years so feel to ask any questions! Yeah, been using braces since 1986. My life would be radically different without them. I can only walk a block  without them. With them, I can go for miles. The only caveat is that it creates new pains due to wearing the actual braces. Hate to say it, but you will probably want to start looking into other kinds of work for the future. Waitressing probably is not going to work for the long term... What does walking on the sides of your feet mean? CMT typically (but not always!) cause a foot deformity that makes walking on the outside of the feet a necessity. (\n) is one example to illustrate. Custom orthotics can help alleviate this in many cases, while in more advanced cases surgery might become a relevant consideration. I was a server by trade. Notice, was, and fuck I miss the industry. How far along are you? I have never gotten the \u201cwalking on the sides of my feet a\u201d thing, what does that mean? Is that something different if you do not have drop foot, which I do? Also, how are your hands? I ent from being able to carry three glasses in one hand when I started serving, to having to awkwardly grab each glass by angling my useless thumb around each one. And fuck thinking of carrying one of those really large shoulder trays like I used to, and the small ones were a risk to balance. Not trying to scare you, just wondering how our stories ma be different. \n\nHope your pain gets better. Waitressing with CMT? Ouch. I was a preschool teacher when I started having symptoms I loved it but I had to find a new career. It was way to painful to bare. I am 34!ive known for a awhile but just getting Diognosed and finding out what kind I have \nSo m walk on the outer foot so basically on the sides\nOf\nMy feet!my hands are not nearly as bad as my feet\nMy hands sometimes get stiff and I shake sometimes and my hand and eye coordination blows.my mama's hands are far worst than mine. Oh, no hand stiffness here, simply cannot spread my fingers. Keep it up till you cannot. I could probably get away with serving if they did not mind me leaning on stuff a lot and not using trays. Serving was an absolute blast. I work at a place called fried green tomatoes down in Macon Georgia.we are basically lunch ladys so I am lucky I do not have to carry a tray!and we are locally owned so I am lucky enough they realize I have a disability but still understand I need work.ive gotten the most shout outs (via reviews)in our company.where I lack some things I pick up for in my Harvard customer service skills.

Hello,\n\ndoes anyone here have a cat as their pet? \n\nI am wondering if it will be too much for our sensitive feet. I am also worried that I will hurt the cat if I fall or hurt myself.\n\nKindly share your experience as a cat owner. I have two cats. They are great company. \n\nThey do not really bother my feet. I am guessing you have had an experience with a cat in the past that attacked feet? I do not think it should be too hard to find one that will not do that. If you talk to people who have fostered a cat you are interested in they will often be able to tell you about that particular cat's quirks. Adopting an adult cat rather than a kitten gives you a better chance to know what the cat's personality will be like, if you want to make sure.\n\nI have never fallen on my cat. The idea of doing so does sound a bit alarming, to be sure, but the odds of falling on a cat in such a way as to hurt it seem fairly low. They tend to sleep in out-of-the-way places. They will get underfoot while walking, though you could try training them to not do that (or at least to give you space if you need it) with a verbal command and a spray bottle of water. I have not trained my current cats to do that though I did have a cat some years ago who I trained to run away a short distance if I yelled \"underfoot!\". And yes, training a cat is entirely possible though it can be a bit tricky--you need to provide consistent motivation, and a mist of water is perfect for that.  \n\nMy sibling, a power chair user, used to have a cat. That made me much more nervous than my own, more ambulatory situation. The cat avoided the chair and it was never really a problem though. Thank you for the detailed response. It is very helpful!\n\n&gt; If you talk to people who have fostered a cat you are interested in they will often be able to tell you about that particular cat's quirks\n\nThat makes sense, I see!\n\nSounds really assuring. For me, I have never had a cat since early childhood so I do not really remember too much about it or if maybe my feet got more sensitive once I got into puberty and CMT became more evident. I just think I would not like to be scratched on my feet by the cat not because of the pain but because I am really tiklish, especially when it comes to my feet :)\n\nBut on the other hand I wear socks pretty much the whole day, so I think that would help with that. My elderly mother, who is CMT is pretty advanced, moved in with my husband and I a year ago shortly after we got two kittens. I was also worried about them getting underfoot with her- she uses a cane. \nHowever, the cats seemed to pick up pretty quickly that she is not very agile, and really do not get underfoot with her. \nI also agree with the other poster- cats can be trained, and talking to foster families who know the particular cat you are interested in can be very helpful in making that decision. \nI hope you find a cat you love. They are wonderful companions \ud83d\ude0a I have mild CMT but I also have a blind cat. My partner does not have CMT but is very clumsy and often walks around with headphones in. \n\nMy cat, even being blind, has learned how to avoid us when we are walking around, it is not a problem at all. \n\nI would say go for it! I love my cat so much, she is one of the best parts of my life and I have not regretted having a cat for the whole 8 years I have had her. We have cats, dogs and chickens.  They will learn to move and you will learn when to stop, swear at them and then you move around them. Love my cats Thank you, I see what you mean!\n\n&gt; I hope you find a cat you love. They are wonderful companions \ud83d\ude0a\n\nYeah, I hope too :) &gt;  My partner does not have CMT but is very clumsy \n\nThat is funny :D\n\n&gt; I also have a blind cat\n\nOh, that is really interesting. Especially how the cat learned to avoid coming in between the feet when you are walking.\n\nSeems like they have a good sense for it. Maybe it is the hearing aswell.\n\nReally encouraging, thanks for sharing! Maybe I will try with more gentle words, but I get what you mean :)\n\nThank you! Cat's are wonderful FurPanions! The question is, are you a wonderful HuPanion?\n\nFull Disclosure - I am a BIG animal lover. I have had dogs and cats throughout my adult life. To me, FurPanions are part of my family. They bond with those that treat them well, tolerate those that tolerate them, avoid those who are indifferent, cold, cruel to them. \nTo me, domesticate animals are not appliances, are not intangible objects to be pulled out when we want them/need them, and then indifferent to them, their needs, when they are no longer needed, until next time.\n\nThat is a very truncated preamble. As I stated, cats are great. I am 66 years old. Until a little over a year ago, I never heard of CMT. I knew I had some kind of neuropathy problem but incompetent doctors throughout my life never picked up on anything, let alone CMT. \n\nMy cat, Sophie, showed up in my backyard about 5 - 6 years ago between Christmas and new years. it was a god awful cold year. She was emaciated, cold, starving and appeared to be looking for a place to just lie down and die. \n\nAt that time, while I was medically disabled, I was able to walk, no walking aid of any kind. I was just in a lot of pain. I was about 60 at the time. I was self-sufficient, could drive anywhere I need to go within an hour, hour and a half, did not need or depend on anyone or anyone's help.\n\nThat all changed December 19, 2019. By June I was unable to walk much at all. Totally dependent on a cane and rollator, unable to drive much at all. What little driving I could/can do, is limited to within a few miles of home. I can not really shop much anymore. Meal preparation is restricted due to my limited shopping ability and mobility as I am dependent on the the rollator even in the house.  \n\nThe reason I mention all is because I went from having no problem caring for my cat, Sophie, to now having to figure out how to not only purchase a 42 pound bag of cat litter, but get it in to the car, in to the house, some upstairs for a litterbox, some downstairs. \n\nDepending on the cat, they can be very finicky about the state of their bathrooms! You do not want an unhappy cat when it comes to their bathrooms! Like us, when you got to go, you got to go! And, boy does that smell stink when it finally hits you (our visitors) and now you have to find it, clean it up, figure outs going on with your cat, totally sanitize the boxes, new litter, hope it is acceptable, ...\n\nAnyway, when i could walk the first 5 -6 years, it was not an issue caring for her. She and I are totally bonded to the point that now, I am hoping I can hang on long enough that we can remain together. The idea of rehoming her just breaks me up. As the saying goes, you never want your animals to outlive you. As hard as it is, for me, when a FurPanion dies, the idea of leaving her behind to strangers brings me to tears. Yet, that is where i am.\n\nIt is getting harder and harder to scoop out the litter boxes every day, sometimes multiple times a day, go buy her litter, get it home, clean the boxes, refill each box. Harder and harder to put fresh water out (away from her food) to go purchase the wet food, dry food. Now that I have to use a rollator inn the house to get around my arms do not reach to the floor to down fresh food, water, pick up and clean dishes,...\n\nYes, cats are wonderful! Honestly, Sophie has much to do with why I am still here. Why I endure the pain. Why I keep going down this blind path not knowing how bad it is going to get, or when or if i will be able to care for her or myself.\n\nThis became much longer than I planned.\n\nThe point is, depending on you, your living situation (apartment, house, alone or others in the home, ...) your current condition, age, ... do you have someone that will take in your cat, if need be, ...\n\nI hope the pictures attached of Sophie come through. If not, I can try a separate post. still can not get the reddit picture thing figured out!!\n\n\n\nEDIT: EDITED link Thank you very much for explaining your side of view aswell, so that one can get a more realistic view!\n\nWhat a wonderful cat! And a great owner aswell :)\n\nWish you all the best! And happy holidays! She is so beautiful! Thanks, u/NixyeNox ! She is, *My Baby Girl*, and she is totally spoiled :)\n\nRight now, as I write this, she jumped into my lap, made a few 'Biscuits\" plopped down and is snoring away. \n\nHonestly, she gets me through the bad days and gives me a reason to keep on going as long as I can. Hope I was able to provide some insights into your decision making. I wish you and your potential FurPanion all the best. Be good to your cat, if you decide to get one, and chances are, your cat will be good to you. Just always remember, they have feelings. They experience love and loss and happiness and sadness.

Only sick for 2 days with 102 temp, head ache  and nausea.\nNow they say we need a booster?! Im 33 with same type. Its more my mum im worried about so im just trying to get a better understanding on peoples reaction. She does not take well to caffeine &amp; most medications Had 2 doses of AZ, no lasting effects.

After the second shot, my arm was a bit sore that evening and I got sleepy the next day. Took a nap and by the time I woke up, all symptoms were gone. \n\nI am in my 40s and have CMT1A. My healthy non-CMT spouse had very similar reactions to the Moderna shots. Oddly enough, from what I have seen the odds of having an adverse experience are practically random.

My husband and I got them together, and I had the after affects for a couple days longer. My arm was swollen after both shots. It went down within 3-4 days the first time, and 1-2 the second time. Had fever, chills, extreme fatigue, and nausea both time, but the fatigue lasted longer than anything (already have issues with fatigue).  I am leaving off symptoms I had before the vaccine (respiratory restrictions and heart palpitations), but those did ramp up during both vaccines. Phizer here.  No side effects besides a sore arm/neck and feeling lethargic after the second shot.  I have type1a. No adverse effects for Pfizer, 42M CMT1B and 14M CMT1B. Where have you heard this? All I can find for neurological impact is slight risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome. We would have no greater risk for this, and probably suffer less than the general population if told now our immune system does not like myelin either. Almost no side effects at all from Pfizer vaccine. I had some slight lightheadedness and a day or so of some mild fatigue.\n\nThere is almost no reason to be scared of the vaccines at all, and certainly much less reason than there is to be scared of COVID. The risk of adverse events is literally thousands of times higher for COVID than for the vaccines. I have 1a, first one was a day of feeling achey, second one was no bad stuff. I had AZ Had 2 doses of Pfizer. Only soreness in the shoulder. Could actually feel the soreness in the left shoulder mildly for a couple of days on the second shot. First one went away the following day  I have had one shot of Pfizer. Injection was completely painless (I am terrified so put it off for quite a while partly because of that and the condition worries). I have had a sore arm for, it seems, slightly longer than most have told me. However that is just now gone. It is hard to describe. I say sore but it is more like when you lean on it or sleep that side, it feels bruised. Or reach up, like a dull ache rather than pain. I am due my next jab soon. I was hesitating like you. I might post pone my second but only because I would prefer to have a longer gap between my symptoms. IMO it was safe to have and I most likely will get my second.

Done I was going to take this, but on page 2/3 I realized it is an orthotics question, and I do not need one yet. The survey did not give me the option to say so. Good luck in uni! I do not think I have ever clicked so many \"strongly disagree\" in a survey before. I am rather salty about both the device and the orthotist.   \n\n\nEchoing what others have said, might be beneficial to get data on where people are located so you can get what healthcare system they are in. My costs are fully picked up by the government, but it would be a different story elsewhere.", "Bombas socks are amazing!  Thickness in the right spots Did you get them from HNF?  I got it from Bombas.com. They are pricey but, I am willing to try them. Awesome ill have a look The Hereditary Neuropathy Foundation often gives these away as perks with a donation. That is ho I got my two pairs. I have a few pairs of these as well and they are awesome! I just buy hiking socks. They last years and have padding in all the right places.", "Should I work in a movie theatre Hey Im 19 and I just got a job for consessions at a movie theatre. Its only been 2 days and My feet are killing me and burning even when Im not putting any pressure on them. I also got chronic back pain from a year and a half ago that still hasnt gone away and has actually gotten worse because of my weight gain. Im trying to go to the gym but working makes me extremly exausted. So I dont know what to do? Should I Continue working or quit and focus on getting my physical health better and focus on school work. I have pictures of my feet for reference( I would say take time to find another job prospect where you are not on your feet. \nFrom what I know about cmt, you should not be on your feet during flare ups/ when the charcot is activated in your feet. Ive noticed pediatrists use the feeling of hotness in the foot as an indicator of when to stay off of them. \nYour health comes first, always. \nI dont know how feasible it is for you, but maybe try to get a desk or sitting job at an indoor pool gym so that you can use their facilities for water therapy. Go to a chiropodist / podiatrist about those calluses, they will sort those out and the burning will lessen considerably, do that first and then make a decision. New jobs will be tiring at first, they are for anybody just because it is new, if you like the job try it a while longer with the sorted feet. \"When the charcot is activated in your feet\"...  Do not add to the world of misinformation and misunderstanding about the condition mate. Yeah when I saw that phrase I wondered if the person was referring to Charcot foot, a completely different condition than CMT. Im just wondering how exactly could they fix the callus issue as I already have specially made insoles to better balance my feet? I also have the issue of tremendous back pain... dont think that is because of cmt but not sure. They will cut/file those suckers off baby!\n\nAnd then pamper those tootsies!\n\nSlather on lotion before bed then put on soft socks, like bamboo which breathe, are soft and antimicrobial, and sleep in them. I have/had super painful cuboid calluses and I had mine shaved down, now I take care of them myself at home. I thought I just had god awful thorny hobbit feet. You are young and I would really urge you to put the time (and money) into sorting all this out now, as you can do permanent good or harm for yourself. You say you have had back pain for over a year and you do not think it is because of CMT--was there an original injury? Most importantly, have you been screened for scoliosis recently? Even if there was an original injury, most minor things should have cleared up by now. CMT folks are prone to scoliosis.\n\nMy other recommendation is to find a physical therapist who specializes in neurological disorders. When I finally went to one in my 30s I wished I had seen her at 20, it would have changed a lot about how I was able to handle physical tasks. It needs to be someone who is trained in neurological disorders specifically, a sports type PT without that training is not very useful at all. \n\nA lot of us know the fatigue that can come with physical tasks when you have CMT. I will tell you it can get better, but whether the right thing is to power through or not in this case is a hard call. I would be inclined to say stick with it if you can, but you need to make sure that the pain is not due to you overexerting yourself to the point of harm, so please try to see a doctor or PT (you will probably need a referral from a doctor to the PT and you need to make sure it says on the referral for it to be a PT specializing in neurological disorders specifically) ASAP. I have been tested and I do have some scoliosis. I originally was sitting in a really bad kitchen chair for a long time because I didnt have a proper computer chair while I was doing stuff. I live in a small city and I cant seem to find any phisio therapists that I know of that specializes in neurolofical disorders. Been seeing a PT for awhile now but havent seen results mostly because most of the excercises cant be dont at my home I only see her 1 every month or two because I dont have much money and my mom doesnt want to pay Yes, with a little searching I found that Charcot Foot (for those who do not know, that is a condition unrelated to Charcot Marie Tooth, but also named after the same doctor) can be in \"active\" or \"inactive\" states, depending on inflammation level.\n\nEven medical professionals occasionally hear \"Charcot\" and think of the more common Charcot's Foot, as I discovered when I saw a nurse for a minor thing and she was puzzled that I said I had Charcot Marie Tooth, but I did not have diabetes. If your feet hurt it could be making you stand and walk 'funny' as you try to put less weight on the parts of your feet that hurt, which are the parts that take most weight hence the calluses, this could have a knock on effect your back.  You have to keep going back to the chiropodist every two months or so - it is not a fortune and is money well spent.  It will absolutely make you feel a lot better. When I was in my teens I ended up quitting my retail job because I was spending all the money I made on weed to numb the pain from working. Finally realized by the end of the week I was just in pain and $50 more in savings. I quit and started going to the gym to improve/ stretch. Wish I would had more spending money in college but at least I was not constantly fatigued and made improvements in my health. I wish I could say I have a great job now but I do not and have gone back to school to continue getting qualified for a more physically manageable career. Dont know if this helps but thought I would share. \n\nId also suggest you look into electric pedicure files for your calluses. I will wait until after showing when theyre softer and the electric pedicure thing I have makes it take less than 5 min and it is really easy on the hands as compared to a file. Make sure not to go hard though or it will take off too much.  You can get an electric one for like 20 bucks   It is a tough situation. \n\nI do suggest talking to your physical therapist about adapting exercises that you can do at home. After my bout of PT (weekly, but only for a couple of months) I got a couple of the resistance bands and a balance board so that I can at least do a few of the exercises at home. Your PT should be able to make suggestions about how to do some of them on your own, with minimal expense. \n\nWish I had something more helpful to say. I wish you the best.", "CMT questioner Hi I am doing some initial research for a project aimed at getting more people with CMT into the countryside and walking.

As u can probs tell I am a noob at posting", " Wednesday Wonderings: Quick CMT Questions Have any little questions, small things you wonder: is this CMT related? \n\nDoes anyone/everyone deal with this? \n\nHere is your place to ask! Hello! I see a lot of people are talking about pains associated with CMT. I have asked my neurologist about this but i dont really get a good answer from her. Just that it is very individual from person to person, and that the brain interprets \"radio silence\" from the nerves differently.\n\nSo my wonderings that do not merit its own thread are:\n\nPains:\n\n1. Anyone knows how common this is? I have no pain symptoms and have a mild/medium severity of CMT with slow/medium progression. I am 31 years old. When did you start experiencing pains? How did the pain progress from you first experienced it?\n2. Cramps. I experience a lot of cramps, especially in my calf, my hands and underarms. This isnt really a problem for me, because when it happens i just kind of grab my foot or my hand and stretch out the muscle, which stops the cramp instantly. Why are some of you unable to stop cramps by stretching out the muscle? Why are cramps problematic/why cant you stop them like me?\n3. Surgery. My orthopedist has recommended me a pretty drastic surgery with a 6-12 month recovery time to make my feet more normal and improve my balance and walking. He told me that with surgery i would be able to have a pretty normal life for another 10-20 years. Has anyone else done foot surgery? Unfortunately i dont remember exactly all the things the orthopedist wanted to do with my foot, but from my understanding the surgery consisted of 4 small sub-surgeries or whatever you would call it (operations?), and individually those 4 things was not a complicated procedure, but together at the same time it was a bit more drastic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll answers are appreciated. Thanks! 1. I have practically no pain myself and I am in my 40's with fairly mild progression. \n2. I get a lot of mild cramps that are easily stretched out but I also get, less often, very severe cramps in my legs/feet which do not respond at all to that. There is nothing I can do but wait those out and they really suck. As a teenager I used to wake up screaming when these would hit in the middle of the night. I have no idea why they are different. I do know that my bad ones seem to be triggered by cold so I try to keep my legs warm.  \n3. I have not had any surgeries myself; hopefully some of the other folks here can talk about their experiences. I am 24, and have always had some pain, more so after I had my ankles fused. First time to now had varied, but always picks up in extreme heat or cold (extreme being 85 or higher, and 50 or lower). \n\nFor cramps, I use to be able to stop them by doing the same (cramps being in my hands mainly). But now, it is gotten to the point I have to ride it out, which sucks when I am in the middle of typing. \n\nAnd surgery. I have had 3 or 4 over a 4 year period. They fused my ankles twice, and tried to prevent my foot drop. My surgery helped a little, but maybe 12 year difference, and everything went back to how it was before, maybe with a tiny difference. I cannot stand on my own, cannot bend my ankle or fall a certain way, and I have shooting pains from the incisions and where the pins held my foot a certain way. Thanks alot for your answer :) I do not have a lot of reference points as the cmt in my family is a lot weaker for the women, and stronger for men. I am the only male with cmt in my family. I am on year 5 of pretty awful hip, glute, lower pack pain (left side). Docs guess CMT related. Use got a scrip for LDN today and a few injections. We will see. I have leg cramps that make me scream sometimes but they are short. They seem to be getting better with Baclofen. I also have horrible bottom of feet pain if I stand or walk too much. This is why I sometimes use a wheelchair or scooter. Despite it all. I am a very active person. I work full time. I play in bands (when there is not Covid). I work out almost every day. I am not a candidate for surgery. My presentation is not typical. I have a high arch that would not really look that unusual to most people. And I do not have typical foot drop. I a, just really weak pushing off when I walk and cannot get on my tiptoes or walk on my heels. My balance sucks. Does anyone else get depressed in spring / summer? I know the usual seasonal sadness we all know about is winter, but I start getting really low around March and do not really feel better until the fall. Last year was the worst ever for me. This year we are in a drought and are having unseasonably warm temps. I notice I am beginning to feel that familiar dread when I wake up and it is all sunny. Some of it is probably hormonal (it seems to get a little worse every year) but I also feel like everyone around me is saying what a nice day it is and looking forward to gardening and bike rides (and granted, all the crap going on in the world is really not helping) and I am just dreading the heat and long days. Just curious if anyone here experiences this? I used to hate summer when I lived in the (American) south. The heat was brutal and I was constantly like \"why does anyone look forward to this?\" I have long suspected that a lot of the enthusiasm for summer weather comes from the cultural influences of the northeast, where summer weather is much nicer. Happy Weekend! I have been in the CMT Facebook group for a while now, never thought to check out Reddit. I just wanted to say hello :) i am so glad to find fellow CMT fighters here! Welcome! Thanks for your answer :) I always hated spring and summer, especially the long days. Several years ago we sacrificed a ton of money and got a pool on our back yard. We are in north FL so we use it about 7 months out of the year, and it is helped me. I also seem to have more pain and dry skin in the colder weather now so I think my opinion may be shifting a little. Hmm. That is interesting. What is it about swimming that you think has helped?", "How to deal with pressure sores I have tried callus pads, felt pads, cutting holes in my insoles but I keep getting it in this one spot on the ball of my foot. \n\nI would love to hear suggestions because I am ready to stop letting it slow be down on my efforts to lose weight. I have had some success with soaking my feet in hot/warm water. But mostly I fight through the pain. I cut mine with a straight razor blade after showers... and fight through the pain the other 20% of the time... if you are weary do not try. What? Calluses not pressure sores... sorry should have clarified. Did not realize I responded to your thread either. Cut the callus? I feel like that is too risky and more effort than its worth It works for me but yeah... probably not worth the  risks for most people. I am intrigued. How do you slice the calluses? I mostly get them on the bottoms of my feet. To put it kind of gross... I slice very thin layers till it is more or less flush with the rest of my foot. I often think of Frank Reynolds and his toe knife while doing this... no shame in my primping game LOL I cut my pressure sores out too. I use scalpels that I get off Amazon Hahaha! That is what I was thinking. At one point I tried filing them down with sandpaper, but I stopped doing that, and I do not know why... Is that recommended? It sounds like something doctors would not like I assume the presure sores are due to calluses that end up damaging the skin underneath, is that the case? Itseems like you are wearing custom insoles? Have you asked the ortophedic technitian that made your insoles about this? My mother got calluses and they lined her insoles with some kind of foam material. She also went to a place where they did pedicures and had them remove hard skin and calluses, I believe they used a blade of some sort. I only have mild calluses, but a warm soak and a pumice stone\u00a0works for keeping my calluses at bay. It is not. I have had mine debrided several times and I dont want to have to see the doctor constantly. I do not use custom insoles. I just modify them myself. When I get them out I use a callus scraper  (pedegg) and diabetic lotion. I am not diabetic but i have neuropathy. The gold bond diabetic is the best I have found. Maybe custom insoles can help? They are perfectly molded to the contours of your feet, so they help spread out the forces over a larger surface area. An orthopedic technician can probably also help in other ways, I know they can make parts of the insoles in a different material for instance and they have all kinds of stuff to alleviate pressure points, so maybe there are something that can be done! Diabetic lotion is good tip, I will try that out. I will have to look into that. I used custom inserts when I was younger. They hurt like hell and I had not been diagnosed yet. After I was diagnosed, I wore braces for a time. \n\nI stopped wearing them because if the pain (and stubbornness). After my last surgeries, I was not asked to use them. I would look into the scalpels on Amazon. I usually get a 10 pack for around $10.\n\nThey are sharper than a utility razor. So be prepared if you want to try it. I have cut myself deep with them. I will look into that, thanks. I add Epson salt, and will then rub lavender oil on my feet after they are done soaking.\n\nThen put some comfy socks on to keep the lavender from evaporating.\n\nThere are lots of powders out there people can add as well.\n\nI have also heard of adding Mother's Apple Cider Vinegar will increase relaxation. That sounds heavenly. How long do you soak your feet? And how often? I go as hot as a possibly handle, and then soak for about 30 minutes.\n\nHave all your stuff with you, so you can immediately dry your feet, add oils, and then put socks on. I will give that a try! Thanks! Get a prescription from your dr and get custom insoles. They are a God send. Relives most of the foot pain and I walk straighter. They do wear out but when I feel pain in the ball of my foot is when I get new ones. I am curious, does this have any benefits other than aesthetics? Would not the callus actually be beneficial? \n\nI got a solid laugh out of IASIP reference also. It reduces pain for me. I have to just sand mine down with a foot file. \n\nI also find that stretching my feet helps as I normally start to get the pain when my pressure distribution is worse than normal (I will be subconsciously curling my feet more due to cold weather or something). Glad you have found something that works for you. But in the interest of caring, I would say if you have lack of sensation and circulation issues be careful with doing this long term as my Dad used to do the same and got infections that he is still suffering the consequences of, so yeah just be careful! (I like your take on the username) :) I would recommend trying sketchers shoes with memory foam insoles. My feet would always blister and bleed after very little time but the memory foam and the extra lightness of the shoes works wonders. They can be pricey but you can usually find alternative stores offering discounted prices. Worth trying to avoid pressure sores. :) I am really careful, thanks for the heads up. I will check it out. Do they come in wide widths?", "I did a Zumba class today! I was not as fast as anyone, and I have to modify/make up most of my moves, but I did it! I definitely felt pretty self-conscious, but I am going to try not to let that stop me from continuing. That is incredible! Good for you! Hope you keep it up :) Hahah cool", "New to this thread I am new to this thread but I have seen a lot of people recommending Neurologists. If you have one and like them that is great, but if possible it is really better to see a PM&amp;R physician that specializes in neuro. They have a much better grasp of how to recommend changes and solutions in conjunction with medicine and mine has changed my life. I also have many families that are physicians (varying specialties) and this is a general consensus among them. This may not be possible for everyone since they tend to be much more specialized and really only exist in big cities, but if it is an option and you do not have the results you want, this is a great option to look into! I have seen this come up in the facebook support groups. Neuro is great for the dx, but they do not really treat. Would you be able to share some of the treatments they have offered? The biggest thing that is helped has been finding the correct doses of Gabapentin. I also get really bad.cold feet so she order me these leg and feet compressors that are heated and I use them about 30 minutes a day before bed and they have pretty much eradicated that issue. She also created a personalized work out plan. CMT is hard because not working out enough can be detrimental, but pushing yourself too hard can be just as bad. I am not too terribly advanced yet. But my father sees the same specialist and the biggest thing she did for him (he had severe mobility issues) was surgery on both of his ankles/feet. Basically, they took a tendon from the side of his foot (idk the name I wish I did) and moved it to the top so that he could pick his foot up again. Then they put pins (temporary) in his toes because they were extremely hammered and while it definitely sucked, he does not even wear braces anymore to walk. Definitely not 100% but he can go on hikes now as long as he has walking sticks, and that would have been impossible before. This guy over here handing out dreams like candy. Pfff. Just messing, all of this sounds awesome, though expensive. But I am glad for the new information. Actually our insurance has covered nearly everything. Gabapentin in like $6 with surgery and while the leg compressors I have are a but more expensive, you can get ones on Amazon that are extremely similar for anywhere from $40-$80! We definitely had to save up a good bit for the surgery, but insurance covered about 70% of it. Definitely look into your options if that is something you need. My dad says he feels like he aged backwards 20 years (he is 50) just from this surgery alone! That is awesome to hear about everyone. What does pm and r stand for? Pain management and rehabilitation, from the stuff they put you on. Jk about the last part lol, mostly Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. Some are a subject under the neuro branch and then some places they are their own branch but you have to go to one that specializes in neuro or nerve/physical exercise for feet/legs/hands. Idk the actual name. But like my mom does PM&amp;R but for brain injuries and burns so I go to someone else bc it is not her specialty. Neurologists really just diagnose but do not treat much (this is for anything) where as PM&amp;R can usually do both. All about researching and finding the right person. It is physical medicine and rehabilitation! Thank you!  That is very helpful! They are cover a broad range as the general purpose is \u201crestoring function for a person who has been disabled as a result of a disease, disorder, or injury.\u201d So it is important to go to someone that specializes in your particle group of concern Of course! Thanks for the clarification! It really does sound like a solid plan moving forward. Also for cold feet the \"thermoball mule\" slippers are great.\n\nFor surgery make sure to weigh the pros and cons, everyone is progression is different and you may permanently lose axons/groups of muscle fiber that cannot be recovered depending on where you are at. If proprioception/general area weakness is an issue skip to braces (flexible ones if you can to retain muscle). Yes! Everything is specific to you so a professional is really the only one that can give specific advice. In my dads case it was either surgery or a wheel chair as braces were no longer working so it was def the best option for him but it is not for everyone! And yes I used warm slippers that went in the microwave from Amazon before I got the heated leg compressors and they were great! Meant to ask, what are the special socks you have for cold feet?", " Drug Development for Rare Diseases Came across this article and found it to be very interesting and informative. It is a bit lengthy however if you have 15 minutes to spare, I highly recommend taking a stab at reading it. \n\n Interesting read. The comments to that article brought to light some additional complexity with regards to models like these. It would be interesting to evaluate the accuracy of this model using real world historical data, but I doubt that such data is available publicly. \n\nI put in the prevalence number for CMT 1A into the spreadsheet assuming that a hypothetical drug for CMT 1A is developed for the US market only. According to the spreadsheet, the annual drug price at approval would then have to be minimum USD 5,400 with an annual drug price increase of 5 % just to break even. For CMT 1B it came out at around USD 50,000 annually, just to break even. I do not know what the minimum profit needs to be for a company to commit but I suspect it is quite high and we are probably looking at several times the break even price.\n\nWe can speculate further though. There is currently a cutting edge drug called Nusinersen (marketed as Spinraza) on the market. It is a type of drug in the group of drugs called Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and its used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). It was developed by a company called  Ionis Pharmaceuticals in collaboration with another company called Biogen before Biogen bought the rights to the drug. The price of Spinraza is currently USD 750,000 in the first year and then USD 375,000 annually after that. The overall prevalence of SMA is about 1/10,000. The overall prevalence of CMT 1A is 1/2,500. Ionis Pharmaceuticals have recently developed and tried out an antisense oligonucleotide for CMT 1A as well (see PMID: 29202483).\n\nIf we assume that Ionis (or Biogen) were able to get it to market, and we assume that it was priced similarly to what Spinraza is priced at today, we would be looking at a price of USD 187,500 in the first year and then USD 93,750 annually after that. However, it might be possible that the cost of developing these kinds of drugs goes down significantly once the company gets more experience with making them. Because the mechanism behind how these group of drugs work is more or less the same regardless of the disease it treats, it may become significantly easier for them to tailor this approach to various diseases over time. On the other end of the spectrum you have PXT3003. All the compounds in that combination drug is already FDA approved and relatively cheap to buy separately. I still do not understand why anyone would buy PXT3003 when they can just make it them selves more or less for a fraction of the price. Why would Pharnext risk such big money on a drug that is just a combination of three already available drugs? If anyone have any ideas I would love to hear them. Fascinating read (and blog), thanks for sharing this", "Tongue Twitching Hi everyone. I am 30 years old, male, and have had a PMP22 point mutation my whole life, inherited from my father. For most of my life we thought it was typical CMT1A until recent genetic testing. Regardless, the phenotype is essentially indistinguishable. \n\nRecently looking in the mirror I noticed very fine twitching or fasciculations on my tongue. I have read that the tongue can be impacted by CMT so for all I know it is been there all along. But given the association of tongue fasciculations with much scarier neurodegenrative diseases, I was hoping to see if anyone else has noticed or experienced this. \n\nIn my case the twitching is very rapid and very fine. I can only really notice it if I hold a flash light over my tongue and look closely for several seconds. It is distinct from the normal occasional tongue movement of healthy people. \n\nIf anyone else with CMT1A or another pmp22 mutation has noticed tongue symptoms, or just has a brief second to look in their mirror with a flashlight with their tongue relaxed in the mouth; I would deeply appreciate the feedback. If other people show similar symptoms it would go a long way to helping me relax and not worry so much about my health. \n\nThanks so much for reading. I have HNPP, which falls under the CMT umbrella. \n\nI get tremors like this on occasion. My tongue and lips have both been known to keep me up at night. Thank you for sharing your experience. I really appreciate it. \n\nMy lips do occasionally tremble as well. I know HNPP is also a pmp22 mutation. My point defect seems to give me the best of both of hnpp and cmt. I have to wait for my arms to come alive again in the morning to look at my phone. :)\n\nHope you have a nice day. Do you experience sensations akin to an oddly light numbness at times whether concurrent or independent of the twitching?\n\nDoes this or the above occur more at specific times of day, such as the morning when you awake?\n\nDo the feelings or twitching diminish as the day progresses?\n\nI ask because while I do not think I have what you are talking about, I have been feeling the above mentioned sensations more frequently and I, too, am looking for answers. Is this still in relation to the tongue, or anywhere on the body? Occasionally  when waking up, I do experience numbness or tingling on my tongue, which typically resolves within a couple minutes of being awake. I do not usually experience this at other times of the day. The twitching seems to happen regardless of hour. \n\nIf in regards to the rest of the body, I of course experience frequent tingling and numbness across my arms and legs, and even on occasion, my face. This seems to get worse with anxiety and sleep deprivation, and I see mild improvements with exercise. It may seem silly to some that I did not do this originally, but I reached out to my father to see if he experiences similar symptoms. He has not always been open about discussing our condition so I was reticent to bring it up with him. Thankfully he obliged my request to check himself and even sent me a video. It appears he has very similar tongue fasciculations as I do. \n\nI am sharing brief clips of both my tongue and my father\u2019s below to hopefully help anyone else who may be frightened by this in the future. That said, I am still having an updated EMG performed in a couple weeks to be certain, but hopefully this can assuage some anxiety in the mean time. \n\n(\n\n(\n\nApologies that the videos are not more steady. I am sure everyone here knows that \u201ccameraman\u201d is probably not an occupation reserved for those of us on this subreddit. Also one other note, although I was not able to capture it on video, occasionally my fasciculations will spread momentarily all across my tongue for a brief second, then return to \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nThanks again everyone. My apologies for the confusion. Yes, in relation to the tongue, tingling and an odd numbness. The tingling and numbness of the tongue and my left cheek are relatively new to me and thus far unexplained by any medical professional I have seen. unlike you, the tingling and numbness no longer dissipate within a few minutes but are lasting longer and more prominent. I was wondering if perhaps in your past medical workups this might have been broached if only in passing by your doctor(s)?\n\nAnd, like you, I too experience the numbness, tingling throughout the body, and it does seem to be more frequent and longer during occurrences. Interesting, informative, and as you said, frightening. If I come across any information relative to my condition, or yours, I will gladly pass it to you. I wish you all the best. The good news, I guess, is that your father sounds like he has not been overly affected so, that sounds like good news for you? that is what I am choosing to take away from this, yes. Good luck with your journey. I know I have been in so much stress lately I have had to take serious medication just to calm down enough to eat (my tongue is not the only thing that is been bothering me with the condition). I know it is not easy. The tongue experience is new to me as well, which is actually what has me notice the tongue twitching to begin with. I am still in the process of seeing my neurologist about it all. I have two appointments in the next two weeks. Hopefully I will have more to share then. \n\nI have also been getting a lot of numbness in my cheek in the morning. I think it is because I grind and clench my jaw really bad at night, especially when I am stressed. Do you ever wake up with pain or sensitivity in your teeth or jaw? Or severe temple headaches? If so, you may also be clenching your jaw and compressing facial nerves. Of course, I am only guessing at this in my own case, but there certainly seems to be a correlation.  lord_archaon, while investigating a lead on my conditions, I came across something that made me think of your tongue twitch issue and the video you shared. As a forward, please keep in mind this made me THINK of you. I am in NO WAY saying this is your condition. I just needed to make that distinction because I do not want to share false knowledge of information.\n\nThe layman's phrase we would use 'Tongue twitching' also goes by, or can go by a medical term phrase, ***Fasciculations of the Tongue*** \n\nYou can enter that exact phrase into search engine and I THINK it describes similar conditions that you mentioned. Also, be sure to check out the images and the videos.\n\nThere does appear to be quite a bit of information surrounding several kinds of Fasciculations \n\nI wish you, and your father, all the best and hope this brings you some good news or at least a starting point.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nEDIT: corrected spelling and grammar", "What is it like having CMT, physically and mentally? I do not have CMT, but my girlfriend does, and she has it extremely badly, with it strongly limiting and decreasing everyday life skills most people can do. We are both Juniors in high school, and we have been dating for 2 years. Her CMT has been getting extremely worse since quarantine, and I am researching to understand more and perhaps find ways to help her get better or slow down the declining slope she is in. She cannot carry things up or down stairs, when she goes down stairs her foot has to drop down to the next step, and she can barely to up stairs without help or railings.\n\nWhat are things that \"trigger\" CMT, such as walking side-by-side with someone (that happens to her, does not know if that happens to everyone with CMT though)?\n\nWhat can I do to help reduce or \"calm\" CMT when it is hurting or acting up?\n\nWhat exercises or small daily habits help slow the worsening of CMT?\n\nAre there appliances or objects that can make it easier to do things with CMT, such as pulling a shower handle to turn the water on?\n\nIn what conditions does CMT act up the most, and what conditions help keep CMT from acting up?\n\nWhat modifications to a room or household can help support CMT?\n\nSpecifically, is there anything that helps with bringing laundry up and down stairs for people with bad CMT, and is there something that can help someone with CMT pull a stubborn shower handle, since those are two of my girlfriends weekly struggles when it comes to CMT?\n\nWhat jobs can someone with CMT not have? (My girlfriend is an artist that primarily does sketches of females from the shoulder up, and is also interested in becoming a glycologist or a tattoo artist)*\n\nWhat jobs are the most CMT friendly?\n\nAre people with severe CMT able to drive when they can barely tell how hard or lightly they are stepping down?\n\nWhat are good things that can improve your mentality about having CMT?\n\nAnd, lastly, a much more lighthearted question; what does what I have dubbed \"CMT tickles\" (when you feel tickled even after someone stops tickling you) feel like?\n\nSince I do not have CMT, I apologize if any of these questions offend anyone, I am just trying to learn more about how I can be as supportive and helpful as possible in her struggles with CMT.\n\n*If it would make you guys happy to see a CMT artist, I can post her art on here for you guys to see. You sound like a smart and sensible person who is doing research and going into this relationship with their eyes open, good for you. \n\nWe all have problems and we all have things that are a deal breaker in a relationship, even if they seem trivial to others. Apparently a physical disability like CMT would be such a deal breaker for Fjord. Which is their choice to make, but I would not suggest that it is a deal breaker for everyone. \n\nI have been happily married for many years. My sibling with CMT has also. As was my parent with CMT. And my grandparent with CMT. And various aunts, uncles, and cousins. I have a huge extended family. Lots of people in my life have found CMT not to be much of a barrier to a stable relationship at all. You do not say what kind of art she does so I am envisioning sketching. \n\nI get occasional twitches in my hands; I am not sure how common that particular symptom is but I just thought I would mention, in case she starts having such a problem, digital sketching can be great. Deleting a wonky line is just a ctrl-z away. \n\nWith that in mind, I think art can be a great career choice for someone with CMT. Thank you for the information! Her hands dont twitch, but they do get tired faster. An art career is what she is looking at mainly, so I have been encouraging her to expand her borders when it comes to art so that she can sell more art I agree. Her dad had CMT as well, and was married. And her grandma had CMT and scoliosis, and was married, twice. Physical bumps are always worth it if the personality is a bullseye  \n\n\\&gt;What are things that \"trigger\" CMT, such as walking side-by-side with someone (that happens to her, does not know if that happens to everyone with CMT though)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is very individual. For me, tired and heat. Based on this sub, I would say cold is the thing everyone else hates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;What exercises or small daily habits help slow the worsening of CMT?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately the same ones all people are supposed to do but do not want to. Be healthy, maintain health weight, stretch and have a decent amount of muscle, get some exercise. But also do not go too hard and burn yourself out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Are there appliances or objects that can make it easier to do things with CMT, such as pulling a shower handle to turn the water on?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook at things designed for old people or occupational therapy stores. For taps in particular, there is products like ( that give you more of a lever if you do not have it built in. There is actually a ridiculous number of products designed to help, but they just are not advertised for people in their teens. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;In what conditions does CMT act up the most, and what conditions help keep CMT from acting up?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is very individualistic. Talk to her :p    That said, temperature, mental state (being stressed, not paying attention) are common enough themes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat modifications to a room or household can help support CMT?\n\n\\&gt;Specifically, is there anything that helps with bringing laundry up and down stairs for people with bad CMT, and is there something that can help someone with CMT pull a stubborn shower handle, since those are two of my girlfriends weekly struggles when it comes to CMT?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI linked a product above for the shower. For the laundry, a simple one I swapped to was smaller loads and using a shopping basket so I could carry it crooked in one elbow as opposed to on the hip or both hands, freeing up the other hand and being able to see my feet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;What jobs can someone with CMT not have? (My girlfriend is an artist that primarily does sketches of females from the shoulder up, and is also interested in becoming a glycologist or a tattoo artist)\\*\n\nWhat jobs are the most CMT friendly?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheoretically any.  A guy I met recently with CMT is a disability support worker, yet others on here reply on those support workers. Obviously professional ballet is probably out, but it is not terribly limiting. \n\n\\&gt;Are people with severe CMT able to drive when they can barely tell how hard or lightly they are stepping down?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes. Do not mistake being a noob driver for being a disabled one. You know when you are pressing hard enough based on the speed of the car/response of the brake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;What are good things that can improve your mentality about having CMT?\n\nDecent support circles and social life??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;And, lastly, a much more lighthearted question; what does what I have dubbed \"CMT tickles\" (when you feel tickled even after someone stops tickling you) feel like?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo idea. Never heard of it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Since I do not have CMT, I apologize if any of these questions offend anyone, I am just trying to learn more about how I can be as supportive and helpful as possible in her struggles with CMT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEh, I have seen posts from 40-50 year old partners that seemed more condescending than this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*If it would make you guys happy to see a CMT artist, I can post her art on here for you guys to see. So, I married my highschool partner. 11 years later and still together. How is the disability supposed to be that much of a barrier? Did you just reject the idea of ever being dateable or something? Thank you for the information, I really appreciate the detailed question-by-question answers! I have built a good community around her, and I have done as many of those things as my young self can, so I am glad to say that I think I am doing pretty well! That is r/CMTHMSN", "CMT and children (forgotten which type I have) Hi all,\n\nSo I am 21F - born with CMT where I inherited it from my dad - I am unsure of the type as I cannot remember and was wondering if people would mind helping me find out haha from what I read it would be CMT X?\n\nI do not speak to my dad or his side of the family so this is purely from my perspective.\n\nMy mum knew I would have it - but did not know how severe - turns out quite severe! I have loss of balance, low circulation in both my legs along with no reflexes on my knees and weak reflexes on my elbows. I struggle to walk long distances or stand due to having high arches which then pull my muscles from my legs (have to wear insoles). My back hurts as they are curved at the top and have needed physio for a while now - no meds help. \n\nI also get tired very easily and need alot of sleep from it and pain can be muscles or nerve pain(in my back only).\n\nAs a child I would struggle but it seemed to have gotten worse during puberty. On bad days where I have maybe pushed myself too far - I would have to have hot water bottles under my legs as they would have a pinging sensation on the inside and I also have restless legs too sometimes. The morning after is usually the worst where I go to get out of bed and sometimes literally have to crawl along the floor or walk very slowly due to pain.\n\nAs you can see I have quite severe CMT - my genetics professor mentioned this was even rarer that females have it quite severe so just my luck! I have forgotten about what she mentioned about children and I was wondering how it would affect my children - does gender matter and how would they test? (Not currently trying just interested for future reference - we will be going to see her in the next few years as we do not need constant appointments and also do not want to go through a check up which takes months to just ask this question when we are not currently trying)\n\nMany thanks!\n\n Hey, I have the same. I have type 2\nHere is some info\n A male must pass on his Y chromosome in order to have a son. As the gene causing CMT is carried on the X chromosome, a hallmark feature of X-linked inheritance is that fathers do not pass the condition on to their sons. However, since the father needs to pass on his X chromosome in order to have a daughter, all daughters born to a father with an X-linked form of CMT will be affected with the condition. She then will have the 50 percent chance of passing on the condition to a child in each pregnancy, no matter the sex of the child, as explained above. Thank you so much for explaining - saves waiting for months for such a quick question! Definitely made sense :)", "im trippin on shrooms...i just cried over my cmt.i hate it so much..its made my whole life utter hell...from not being able to just work a normal job to actually enjoying my everyday life..cmt has made my depression so much worse..im hoping to find somw relief hence the mushy part \ud83d\ude2d  The \u201cmushy\u201d part. Get it? The *mushy* part? \n\n\nIt is a shrooms pun.\n\n\nYeah I probably would not want to get caught in a thought loop abut my CMT while on psych\u2019s. Feel your pain man about the loss of all the things I used to do that can no longer. Just know you are not alone. thank you\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude2di kind of had emotional experience today over my cmt..clearly posted this at peak \ud83d\ude06 I know life with CMT sucks but it is what we got. Honestly if I had to choose between being alive but having to deal with CMT for the rest of my life (we are lucky it is not a terminal disease) vs. being dead I would choose the CMT life. \n\nThis is your life man. The only think you can do is enjoy it. It is like Gandalf said, \u201cAll we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\u201d I am so sorry. Internet hug. Xxx I am sorry. Please know that you are not alone. It is okay, there are others out there too, like you. We all have smited the disease. Unfortunately, we have CMT and have to figure it out.\n\nI stretch hardcore and it feels much better, I like to stretch when high on THC. Better mind body connection. Hope you had a good trip man! Lol I did man!it was much needed \ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udec0\ud83d\udc93 I had the same experience! I spent ages looking at my toes and I was soo upset!", "Waiting for CMT results My sister is 29 and has lived in mild to moderate pain most of her 20s. She has had surgery for arthritis in her big toe (little to no cartilage was left). Has had three hip surgeries for hip dysplasia (PAO). Recently, she was experiencing excruciating thumb pain. Warm temps would relieve the pain but it was so severe she could not unplug a anything from the wall, type on a computer, etc. The pain has subsiding but now her thumb will not straighten and you can visibly see the muscle weakness that has occurred. \n\nShe was testing for RA 4+ years ago and it was negative. Her doctor is now testing her for CMT. She can walk fine and beyond her toe pain / toe surgery she has no issues with her feet and legs. Were any of these symptoms a sign of CMT for anyone? She has an appointment at The University of Virginia in June. CMT symptoms are complex as there are so many variants. CMT 1A is the most common and those symptoms above would not normally manifest unless very severe (difficulty walking etc)and would show at puberty. \n\nEither way get the genetic test and nerve velocity test as both combined will confirm or not if it is CMT not in any pain that id describe as excruciating,  but cold weather/environment  could exacerbates problems like aforementioned , lucky for me winters only 3 months. also ring fingers wont straighten I will be honest; it *could* be CMT because CMT can present itself in all sorts of weird ways, but my mom has RA and what you described sounds **exactly** the same. If the CMT test comes back negative maybe she should talk to her doctor about another RA test. It might be possible it was a false negative Sort of. I have hip dysplasia as well. My earlier symptoms were leg cramps and foot deformities. Five years after that I just started to feel like shit all the time. Everything ached; I had joint pain and muscle pain. They told me it was fibromyalgia, an auto immune disorder, this and that, ends up it is just cmt. Your sister\u2019s case would be very atypical though.", "Does anyone eale experience heavy or near-total loss of feeling on your skin?  20-year-old male here and I do not honestly remember what type of CMT I have. I got diagnosed at the end of middle school and it is been a hot minute since.\n\nAnywho, for the past 5-6 years I have basically been losing the sensation of touch on my legs but it is just my skin. I can feel everything else like the muscle and bone but weirdly not the skin. I am in college now and it is just a norm for me but it is recently hit me (and the mental break down with it) that I actually will not be able to tell when the person I will end up with touches my legs in any sort of manner. It is actually panic enduring thinking about it and it bothers me that I got handed a pretty bad hand genetically. Though thankfully my hands are pretty good and the only bad thing to happen to them are the occasion locking in place or cramping but I can thank the increased strength from playing piano for a while.\n\nI was mainly wondering how do you all experience numbness or loss of feeling because it is a wild ride for me right now I am really not intending to scare you but usually sensorial loss precedes motor loss so you might see such features in the future.. Generally speaking though having decreased sensation especially in the lower legs is common but no sensation whatsoever? I do not think I have heard that before, maybe only in severe cases which does not seem to describe you. Are you sure this is caused by CMT? Yeah, it is. My grandpa had it too and he could feel his left leg. I have talked to doctors, who actually know what CMT is, about this and they eventually told me it is chalked up to their being such a wide variety of levels of severity with people with this symptom. And yeah, I realize that is just the reality of this condition. It I have known that this might happen in the future but experiencing it now is kind of mind-fucking. Sorry if my post sounded a little confusing I am not questioning you have CMT, I am questioning whether these symptoms are CMT-related. I had a somewhat similar experience if you are interested. Had massive paresthesia in my right foot for days, and it eventually spread to my left hand (lol), also had lots of weird symptoms like really aggressive spasms everywhere in my body. Needless to say I was sure CMT has progressed and I am doomed but it actually was just anxiety related and everything is alright now.\n\nNow back to your issue, it is a bit strange what is happening to you, but if it were me I would be happy I have sensorial instead of motor issues. What you experience is definitely unusual though.\n\nGood luck with your college, if you need a fellow student CMT-er to chat with I would be glad to help. HNPP here.\n\nI am 30, and I have experienced this since childhood. I cannot feel my feet, most of my shins, and a large portion of the skin over my left shoulder blade.\n\nIt is weird and discomforting. I am sorry you have to deal with it CMT can manifest in different ways, but your experience is far enough from what I am familiar with that I suspect that you may have one of the less common subtypes. Next time you see your doctor, ask them if they can look at your file and tell you what subtype you have. It might be helpful to talk to those folks who have your subtype specifically, to see if they are familiar with this sort of thing. \n\nThe sense that we call touch is actually several different senses, biologically speaking. There are different types of specialized cells that detect temperature, vibration, proprioception (being aware of your position and movement), light (skin) touch, deep touch, and more. \n\nFor comparison, I do not think I have any impairment in my light touch detection but I have practically no ability to feel vibrations below my knees. Not exactly a problem in my everyday life; I had never noticed that until my neurologist did a test. And my proprioception is quite impaired in my legs as well--anyone who experiences tripping over things because their foot was not quite where they thought it was? That is impaired proprioception. \n\nThat is a bit of a lengthy way to say: if you are worried that you will start to lose the ability to feel deep touch (muscle/bone things) or any other part of your sense of touch, they are different senses that are not closely related to the light touch sense and there is no reason to think that they are likely to become impaired. Oh, that makes sense. But yeah, at first I thought it was because of my other conditions and I tried getting that under control. Though once I accomplished that it did not stop so I went to the doctors after and talked to my parents about if anyone else had this. \n\nBut yeah, im glad I can walk still and be mobile. As well as my hands working pretty normally. That is actually really comforting to know. Thank you I have gotten used to it for the most part. Just things like that have been getting to me. You know my future and all. But it is weird how well I have adapted to not feeling the skin on my legs I hear ya, really. I have 3 young kids, and it makes me nervous, definitely.\n\nSometimes I forget that other people have sensation. Example, I tell my boyfriend that he has bitch feet because I can walk comfortably on rocks As morbid as that is it is is a wonderfully hilarious way to look at it.  Sometimes you got to make the best out of the situation I cannot feel my feet, but my legs still have most of their feeling.  My feet however have basically no sensation to touch or heat.  I like to blow dry my body sometimes after the shower (it feels nice haha).  That said the blow dryer gets pretty hot and has to be moved around to not burn my skin, however I literally cannot feel it blowing on my feet/ any heat from it.  It is kind of strange moving it from my legs to my feet and the transition from feeling heat/ wind to not feeling anything.  \n\nAlso feel free to join me with the CMTtypeUnknown flair.  I was diagnosed through my mothers orthopedic surgeon as a child and have no idea what type I have either. Yeah, heat is also an issue with my legs and feet. I find random cuts all the time on myself That is funny because I have a lot of sensation lost on my legs and feet, but for some reason walking on rocks makes them feel like the bottom of my feet are on fire.  I do way worse walking barefoot on rocks than most others. I lost feeling in my lower legs and in my hands, then noticed dry skin, cramping, and burning. It seemed like side effects of CMT at first, but I actually had severe untreated type 1 diabetes. Better blood sugar control and alpha lipoic acid have slightly reduced the symptoms. Keep up with your yearly check-up if you have not, because diabetes can be detected early. There are several CMT variants called, Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy. HSAN. You might look into those.", "New to Reddit and CMT but Hey! Hey CMT'ers! I have been diagnosed with CMT Type 2 this year and thought to give reddit a crack. From Newcastle and hope to catch up with people as clumsy as me! Welcome to the \"I can trip over a painted line\" club! Welcome! sometimes do not even need the painted line haha Heyy I have cmt and also from Newcastle! Tho in Northumberland. Small world! Hello and welcome to the club! I am a 2A guy...welcome! Hey there and welcome!      Congratulations dude. It is all down hill from here. So grab a wheelchair and ride that bitch to the bottom at Mach 10. Ah man hope it does not come to that but on the plus side if it does it will be much harder to trip over if I am already sitting? Why are you spamming this?  My 2yo son likely has CMT.  If there is a SINGLE toy on the floor, he will trip on it.  If there is not a toy on the floor, he will also trip on that.  Initially I thought it was just typical toddlerhood (clumsy, not paying attention, etc), but now knowing his condition, when I watch him I can see his feet just not quite moving like he wants them to.\n\nEver since he started walking, we would tell him to \"brush his knees off!\" when he fell to kind of distract him from the pain (it really does work), so now, no matter how he falls, he pops up and brushes his knees off like a champ.  I am glad we instilled that \"get back on the horse\" mentality in him, particularly now that we know he might not grow out of the stumbling! When I was young I was exactly the same! I am only just diagnosed so I just thought I was clumsy and tripping over stuff was just something that I always did. So good you have instilled that in him to get back up and brush his knees off! Once I got to school and was tripping over air in front of my friends it made a big difference being able to pretty much bounce off the ground and keep going. A little embarrassing but you get that.", "Big calves I have 1a and my calves are quite large and have been my whole life. Does anyone else have this? Yep, from all the walking on those top toes! Really? I always thought my calves would look more atrophied but they are quite the opposite for my small frame. Sure, I used to walk on my toes as a child but my mother always promoted me not to and I pretty much do not do it anymore. I am 35 now. Yes, huge calves except for on the bottom. They kind of go away there. The medical literature calls the thick calves/thin ankles combo the \"inverted champagne bottle\" look. The higher muscles bulk up as they are doing extra work compensating for the lower muscles of the ankles and feet. \n\nI certainly have some well developed calves though I feel like in Victorian times my dainty ankles would have been quite fetching. Yes I only did it as a small child..but always had larger calves. My PT says the way I walk is constantly working out the calves, and I need to do more exercises for the opposite side (Achilles). I am nearing 30. Interesting.. thanks for your input \ud83d\ude0a Lol quite fetching indeed! I am surprised by this. I always thought my well developed calves were an exception to the CMT gang. My Dad who has CMT also has exceptionally thin legs and most images I have seen show clear muscle wasting. I have chunky calves that cause so much pain- muscle spasms, knots, cramps. Yea I feel you. Other pics I have seen have skinny ankles and more developed calves up top but my calves are completely developed (and quite large for my thin frame) and my ankles are normal looking. So I always thought that was odd. Is your pain and cramps symmetrical? What other cmt symptoms do you have? No not always it is often one side but I think that may be related to foot drop and thus one side being tighter. Lack of sensation, poor circulation. I do not have any obvious physical abnormalities. Do you get cramps too? Yes. I have not been diagnosed with CMT. I was born with high arches and the past year my calves have been very crampy. I floated it past my doc and she mentioned the possibility of CMT Think of it like rubber bands being bent the wrong ways some things are tight and some things are loose ;stretch the tight stuff and strengthen the loose stuff. Worth asking for a blood check. My dad has the very high arches, scoliosis of the spine and gets pins and needles a lot. And does he have cmt? Yes he does. This sounds so much like me. I have the larger calves and lots of pain and cramping. My brother has the thin legs and his feet are flat flat. Both with the same CMT. It can manifest a lot of ways. Yeah it seems to be the case. I find a lot of people question whether I have it on the basis of the little outwardly obvious signs. But I feel your pain- those cramps can be awful.", " Friday Feelings - Small Celebrations Little things that went right this week. \n\nTimes when CMT could not stand in your way.\n\nVictories that you want to share.

First off, this is my first post thingy and I have never met another person with CMT before. I have been refused DLA (In england) as I can sometimes walk more than 200m and I can put together a meal if there is no chopping or pan holding needed. What should I do? Does anyone have a similar story?", "He falls every morning Just watched my precious 4 year old son fall again on the way to preschool. It is a five minute walk. He falls every time. But he loves to run and walk and jump and dance. I cannot keep him cooped up. I do not want him to have to use a pushchair for a five minute walk. My heart is so damn broken this morning. Every so often I get hopeful that his CMT1A is not as progressed as I fear it is, then I watch him fall again and that hope sinks. He is so small. He gets so excited he does not want to hold my hand, he wants to chase his friends and play. I wish I could have it instead of him. He is so little and he does not understand. Kids fall alot even the run of the mill ones. The cordination isnt there yet. But if you are concerened see his ped to see about maybe some Occupational and Physical therapy. Pt can work on balance and Ot can work on cordination. Yeah I agree with the above. If it is really concerning PT. If he starts on exercising early in his life it will help his whole life. The more active he is the better. I played team sports my entire youth and nobody noticed I had cmt. CMT1A here. Parents had me in organized sports all through life. No good teams but still teams haha. I was a decent athlete at best but still played alright. I used to fall a lot when I was young but grew out of that and rolling my ankle. \n\nMy parents waited till I was 17 to tell me I had CMT. I only started to wonder around 15 . In hindsight I am glad I did not grow up in those super angsty years knowing I had motor sensory neuropathy. I am glad I found out once I had matured. Thank you so much for this. I know I sound a bit hysterical but I am pretty sure my daughter has it too and my plan was not to say anything until it starts to show and she is old enough to handle it. Now I know that is not the wrong way to handle it. She is amazing at swimming and is in a local football team so we are keeping her as fit as possible. My dad recently eluded to me that he let some of my coaches know that there was some activities I would be limited in. Not for sympathy but rather to better help them coach me. Swimming seems like a great sport for CMT\u2019rs!!! For me personally I notice I am just as strong a swimmer as my peers whereas sports like soccer,football and hockey I lag behind.\n\nI am super thankful my parents never coddled me over it. They expressed that life would be harder but worth hard work none the less!", "CMT surgery Does anyone have any experience or know someone who has been a part of this surgery program at Cedars Sinai in LA? (\n\nI would like to see some post surgery results maybe 6-12 months afterwards. I have met with Dr. Pfeffer. My son is going to have surgery on his feet in March at Cedars. Based on my research he seems to be one of the top surgeons that focuses on CMT in the world. He has patients come from all over the world to see him. He has also been doing if for a long time. He did a presentation with CMTA that I would encourage you watch. \n\n( This is great, watching it now I HIGHLY recommend two, if not three, consultations with different surgeons. Earnestly, what will Country Music Television do for you? It is barely country these days at all. Always get a second opinion, I have had two surgeries for my CMT and my life was completely changed Thank for the info! If he has people coming from all over the world to see him, just based on my own personal experiences, he must be booking out appointments far into the future? Just for evaluations, actual surgeries .... even farther out? Are you saying your life changed for the better after 2 surgeries? Just want to be sure I am understanding correctly. We saw him last fall and we had to book about a month out for the initial appointment. I know they were really busy at that time. I am not sure what it may be like now. I believe he will also do virtual appointments. If you would like I can get his secretary\u2019s contact information for you and you can enquire about his schedule. I am shocked he saw you so quickly! Happy for you and your son, though. I tried to get in to see the CMT specialist at University of Penn a CMT Center of Excellence facility, and that was a 6 month wait - BEFORE covid started! Same with Johns Hopkins, another Center of Dubious Excellence, another 6 month wait before covid.\n\nIf you can get his contact info that would be great! Thank you! \n\n\nThing is, I do not have the traditional CMT Foot. Rather, my feet are, or were, very flat. Now, they are even flatter as there is little to no muscle or tendon or ligament around the ankles. So, I do not know if he could help me. I DMed you his secretaries contact information. Best of luck! Yes, that is what I am saying, sorry for any confusion Thank you for the contact info. Much appreciated! Good luck to you and your son! From his bio and a brief background check, sure sounds like your son has the best working for him! Hope you post some post surgery follow-ups. I am in Delaware, but from your post, people from all around the world fly in to see him. It would be wonderful if I could walk again. Thanks again, and good luck!", "What is the best response to \u201cdid you hurt your foot\u201d? Hi there\n\nNo shame in my CMT, but I am constantly finding it hard to explain when new people ask me \u201cdid you hurt your foot/leg/ankle.\n\nWhat is your response to that question? Depending on the setting these are my two favorites.\n\n\u201cNaw, this is to meet nefarious women with questionable morals...\u201d bonus points if my fianc\u00e9 is there I will look at her and introduce myself. \n\n\u201cMeh, I have been hit harder by smaller shit.\u201d I just say my feet are messed up/it is how I walk. I do not like to go into detail or explain that often but sometimes I will explain a little more. I have had one person familiar with it because their in laws have it. I am the only one in my family that I know of so it was interesting talking to them about it. My mom thinks she has a milder version but is undiagnosed.  or if they think you are drunk, even if they do not come right out and ask.\n\nI often wonder if I have given the impression that I am inebriated during job interviews due to my very abnormal gait. I do not use a cane or walker (even though I probably should) so I am not sure it is readily apparent to people what is going on.\n\nYou have the normal anxiety nerves that come with interviewing, then on top of that the struggle of simply walking through the building and into the room. It is one reason I am all for this shift towards WFH and tele-interviews that seems to be a result of covid. For the shortest answer if I do not want to talk about it I will say something like \"I have a bad ankle\" which is not wrong. They can always ask for the story later if I get to know them better and it seems appropriate. I tell them I have a condition which affects the nerves in my feet so that I have difficulty walking. If I am in a rush I tell them my ankles and feet are almost paralysed. Usually I do not get too many follow up questions but I am happy when I do so I can explain it. Even though cmt is horrible, for me it is very nice to at least have a diagnosis. For someone who grew up without a diagnosis I blamed myself for a lot of the issues that comes with cmt thinking I was just useless or lazy with things that involved walking/running. \"Depends on what you mean by \"hurt\"\" usually works for figuring out a better response. Sometimes I have picked up a limp and not realised, sometimes it is a medical professional asking about injury or pain - two things that should be more correlated than they actually are. \"I borrowed money from myself and could not pay myself back, so I was forced to break my own feet.\"  My uncle suggested that one after my first foot surgery as a teenager.  Still useful today :) I tell them I got Country Music Television. My sincere condolences. Sometimes if it is a kid I will be funny and say it is a robotic leg, or I would make some funny story about it- but if it is an adult I just simply say, \u201cI have a disease in my legs now look it up if you simply must know.\u201d And I will tell them the name. (Because the adults who mostly ask me are rude most times) also I wear AFOs and the ones I have kind of do look prosthetic or robotic. (Sorry if my response was rude) Not rude at all man, but I have not had people be rude when asking. It is just to be kind and understanding. But sometimes it still messes with my mood. And now I have a couple of good answers to go around for the next time someone asks. I usually just say \u201cno, that is just how I walk. It does not hurt or anything, just looks a little funny\u201d Ey- well I hope the responses help and let people mind their business, the people I grew up with where always rude to me with questions so that is why I kind of became bitter but I am slowly getting better about it. Wish ya luck my friend! I say, \"nope, it is my CMT\" or \"nope, I have a neuromuscular condition\" depending on who I am talking to. Most if the people in my life know about CMT so that is helpful. I screech \"Nooooo! My legs are all withered!\" whilst clutching desperately at their arm.\n\nI do not, but sometimes I would really like to.", "I am not alone! Having just discovered this subreddit, I must say it has been refreshing reading the many stories by my fellow CMT folk.\n\nIts very heartwarming to know that there are people out who have had a taste of what I have been through. \n\nSending my love from Singapore!", "CMT and weed I enjoy to smoke weed every one in a while. Is this bad for CMT? Or maybe even good?  \nWhat are your experiences? I do not think there is any research that says weed is bad for CMT. In fact marijuana helps with inflammation and it could help with sore muscles and any pain you may feel. I guess I depends on your personal preference and whether or not you live in a legal state. I use a blend of CBD hemp and cannabis. I have found that most modern cannabis strains are too high in THC to suit my anxiety. I do not measure anything exactly, but if I roll a CBD joint, I will usually just put a pinch of cannabis along the top of it in my rolling machine. There was a thread last year: Cannabis for CMT, Pro /Cons which you might want to check out for more answers. Try delta 8 THC. Little to no anxiety, paranoia, fogginess, or memory loss with all the fun of THC. The community is growing like wildfire; I would try it, like it, and stock up before it gets too popular and becomes scheduled. I do not have any negative physical affects from smoking nearly everyday for going on 7 years.  In fact the opposite since i can view marijuana as a pain reliever it helps me feel more confident exercising. I will look into it. Do you know of any good companies that produce it? I live in a state with rec and medical. If you have aches and pains and are afraid of side effect of smoking/ vaping there are many other ways you can achieve the same goal. Oils are probably the least invasive, as in you achieve a real low mellow high (if it is cbd, which if you are using it for pain relief it should be). It will reduce pain with the least amount of side effects.\n\nSmoking, obviously the least healthy, is probably the next step of pain relief. Vaping would be next but that is like a 10 step jump from smoking. That is like going from church coffee to cold brew.\n\nThen there are edibles... the logically more \"healthy\" way of ingesting. Going from dabs/ vaping to edibles is going from cold brew coffee to cocaine (I imagine). You are going to be blasted into the sky and probably get vertigo the first time if you DO NOT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. The people who do not take edibles seriously are  the people who will tell you they had a bad time. So with edibles they take a while to kick in but once they do... it is a rocket straight to the moon. So beware that from half an hour to an hour it can take for your body to metabolize and digest that chunk of cookie. Do not ever eat the whole thing... just do not... I have warned seasoned pot heads (fellow friends) when I had made edibles...\n\n\"Nah I can handle that cookie.\"\n\n\"I am not saying you cannot handle it, there is a lot of budder in these and I am telling you so you do not flip out.\"\n\nNext day... 'I ate that whole cookie...\"\n\n\"And what did I tell you?\"  \n\n\n\\*currently at a 7/10 and yes in my experience strains higher in cbd are best for pain relief MyCBDHaven, snapdragon, greene rush hemp, star thistle ranch, bulkdisty.com Hey that is not fair man I have to have a just a gummy I would love to have a cookie or a piece of chocolate or something like that better than a gummy where you get that stuff If your local shops do not carry that then you can just make your own weed butter and use it to cook. I am not sure whether I can tell you how to cook it here... but I am sure you could find somewhere online that tells you how to make weed butter and recipes. Granted the potency will be a variable, hence not wanting to eat it  all at once.", "Im a powerlifter and i have CMT, fuck that shit aint going to stop me, i gain muscle like a beast and apparently dont lose it either, CMT can blow me.  nice man! I have been lifting for about 6 months now and it has been amazing so far. Not quite at the \"4 plate sumo deadlift\" level yet, but progress has been steady. Do you do squats? that is the only excersise I feel is too risky for me. Got any lifting tips for somebody with CTM? I love it! What type if I can ask. I will look to this post for inspiration at the gym today. Everything, fuck CMT, do squats stand on a plate or use squat shoes. Use the rage about the sickness and transfer it into the gym! I have never had issues with strenght!! GO HAM! Yeah squats i know\nIm so stiff but i stand on two 45 plates and i can easily squat ass to the grass, or use squat shoes! \n\nDont Think about CMT, just do it! Fuxk that sickness forget about it dont let it define you or stop you! \n\nYeah my eyelid might hang, but im strong as fuck and i gain like a monster no steroids, fuck CMT! \n\nI would rather have CMT than any other fucked up sickness, everyone has something dont let it define or stop you. To clarify I meant - what type of CMT? UNBELIEVABLE progress in just 2 months...\n\n  ( Thanks apparently CMT makes\n me gain muscle and retain it as if i were on steroids the doctors are so confused i might be a new type of CMT they say.. task failed succesfully i guess? Share your routine with me! I love this! Do you take protein shakes? How I often do you hot the gym? do you focus on weight lifting? Do you push your limits or are you taking the 'moderate exercise' approach?\n\nI need answersssss \u2764\ufe0f How do you lift without losing your balance?

Great job!! Looking amazing.. I used to over balance really badly with squats. A trainer at the local gym got me holding an empty bar in front (though a broom would work, these are very light bars) for balance, and then only going to roughly half depth but high reps. Getting the motion down to memory through the high reps helped, and then weights could be slowly added. The made up kind. I am sorry but going from \"sacred and nervous\" about lifting to 4 plate dead lift in less than 2 months simply is not possible, even with all the steroids in the world.\n\nI have cmt(1a) and I have made great progress in the gym. I can offer you advice but if you think this is achievable in 2 months you are going to be disappointed.\n\nI am sorry you have been lied to. no hammer toes, normal looking ankles and decent calf muscles?? strange. And in other comments you say you can squat to the ground easy. Man either you are getting CMT confused with something else or i need to get what you are on. For instance if i try to squat to the ground or power lift like this tendons in my feet will RIP OR SNAP. I do have hammer toes and a fucked ankle, my calf muscle are huge - but i had surgery for it here in Denmark ( thank god for free health care ) and i Can squat and deadlift no problem, i dont feel any pain or anything in my feet? \n\nThis Is my feet ( Since you apparently have no CMT symptoms, how were you diagnosed? My eyelid was hanging had hammertoes and walked on my toes - and ankle is fucked! I will give you the benefit of the doubt here and suggest you find a new doctor because you have been misdiagnosed. \n\nOne of these things is not even a symptom of CMT, and the others are vague indications at best. Trust me i have been to multiple doctors and specialists, even had my tissue and genes tested - they say i might have a shortage of SDH, and something called complex 2? Hey congrats on your progress, our view of the condition is very similar. Do you take protein shakes? How I often do you hit the gym and do you just lift weights or any other exercises? \n\nThis condition did not affect me too badly either but I am always happy to improve. Would be great to know how you do it Just hitting it 6x a week and my girlfriend is a Danish powerlifter and european master etc, so we just powerlift - honestly my advice dont Think about it just do it, forget you have it since it does not affect us. \n\nA tip work on forearms, that is kind of it. \n\nFuck CMT. I do not have balance issues Ah i see OP has a very rare, possibly unique form of CMT. \n\nApparently he has what might be a shortage of SDH, which would be a mitochondrial disorder. There are only half a dozen cases of similar disorders which I could find in skimming the scientific literature, and they have been variously classified as a variety of neuromuscular disorders, such as Friedreich's Ataxia (if iron metabolism is involved) or Leigh Syndrome (if very severe). It is reasonable that this could fall under the umbrella of CMT in a mild case. Each type or subtype of CMT has a different mutation which causes it, and differences as well as similarities in symptoms. \n\nEven with conventional CMT cases, even with the same mutations within a family, there is a high degree of variability.  \n\nExercising is a healthy thing for us all, within safe limits which vary from person to person. I think it would be interesting to discuss how various CMT'ers have been able to improve through exercise; that will be the topic for a new thread. Yeah that is me, but I do not know what it all means? Can I take pills for my shortage or? Doctor also mentioned some complex 2 something? Honestly I do not know what to expect I am having a follow up meet with my doctor this January?\n\nBecause I can exercise I have never had any issues or limitation whatsoever? I am unsure if the Complex 2 is because ADH is part of Complex 2 of the mitochondria or if it is because ADH is itself made up of 4 building blocks and perhaps they are saying that it is the second one which has a problem. \n\nIf that is unclear, just pretend it is all made of LEGOs: the ADH protein is a block of 4 LEGO bricks and that set of 4 bricks snaps together with 3 other blocks of bricks to make the big block cluster that is an important part of your mitochondria. \n\nYour few symptoms that you mentioned are instances where your nerve impulses were not getting through to your muscles properly. Most CMT folks have much more widespread impact on muscles: when someone can no longer walk, it is because no matter how emphatically one tries to tell one's leg to move the signal does not get through and the muscles do not move. Muscle weakness is more common than total muscle failure: only part of the signal gets through, so only part of the muscle responds and so one only gets part of the power one should from the muscle.\n\nThe more rare one's disorder is, the less research and experience are available to guide a treatment. Most CMT folks here are familiar with the ongoing struggle to get any research done, particularly for anyone who has a CMT variant other then type 1A, the most common type. There is going to be little precedent to guide your doctors in treating you (if you need treatment; you appear to be doing OK). Because of the lack of experience with previous cases like yours there is unlikely to be a simple pill ready for you to take.  \n\nI hope your doctors have good news for you in January. Thanks a lot so do I hope! Well I just hope my CMT has done its thing and will leave me alone if you understand, I do not hope it gets worse? I am 21 and I have not gotten worse honestly I mostly forget about it lol since I can do everything. Picture is old? I have had a huge break from the gym hence my scared and nervous. In the military with CMT, I never let it hold me back in life. It is just another barrier to overcome. Good job man, keep it up.", "About to have tendon transfer.

The CMT is on her dad's side (not sure which type) and of the 4 siblings her two younger sisters both got it.\n\nUnfortunately one of her sisters is also clinically anorexic (5'2\", &lt;80 lbs). We are trying to help her gain weight, particularly since she just got sick with pneumonia after getting rained on. We are going through the standard guidelines at youreatopia.com (really great website!), but are running into some difficulties due to the CMT.\n\nShe feels she cannot be normal and will always be small because of CMT. So whenever things get tough she mentally falls back into thinking she is genetically broken so she cannot succeed no matter what.\n\nGoogle does not reveal a correlation between CMT and BMI. Googling pictures, life stories, etc, of people with CMT reveal fairly normal bodies and activity levels. Everyone else in the family is at healthy BMI. So right now we think the primary issue is getting her to disassociate CMT with being small.\n\nAny kind of advice is appreciated. The sister is smart so she will be receptive to studies on CMT and body weight, although I could not find any. ", "CMT vs B12 deficiency Hi everyone\n\nIs there any was to differentiate between chronic vitamin B12 deficiency and CMT?\n\nI was told some 30 years ago \"oh you have some variant of CMT, genetic testing is too expensive, there, good luck with your life, try and do not get too fat, it helps.\"\n\nNow a few weeks ago I saw a documentary about people with chronic vitamin B12 deficiency and the symptoms are so similar.\n\nDoes anyone know, how would one go about finding out which one it is, without genetic testing? If you have a B12 deficiency, your doc can see it on a blood test. People used to have to get B12 injections, but now you can just take supplements. Just be sure the supplemented B12 is NOT natural. It has to be synthetic for people who cannot metabolize B12 properly. If you have insurance, genetic testing is very affordable now. \n\nI have had CMT for decades, but just found out the type (2A)....with the positive result they tested both my kids for cheap. Invitae did my testing. I had B12 deficiency on top of my CMT 1A a few years ago. Honestly, I was not aware there was anything extra going on but my doctor included a blood test with some lab work and I got to give myself shots for a while then switch over to supplements. There was not a dramatic difference when it went away; I had slightly less trouble with fatigue once my B12 levels got back to normal, that was about it. Anything else the B12 deficiency might have done was masked by my general condition, I suppose. Every time you get your annual physical they test for this. If you had it you would know. People get annual physicals? Have not had an annual physical in years. Might have been avoiding doctors after an \"overdose\" (of doctors' visits, not of any substance) Will organize that, thank you. And good recommendation about the supplements being synthetic! Not in the US here, last time I asked my GP, they said it would cost about $1000 out of my own pocket if I wanted anything tested like that. They seem to both share the same effects on nerves, yes. Bummer about having them both at the same time :( TBH, I have never heard this myself and I take supplements to avoid a repeat of the whole \"giving myself shots\" thing. I take a brand called Nature Made, for what that is worth. Of course the brand name does not mean much and maybe they are synthetic, the bottle does not seem to say. I just know they seem to work for keeping my levels up to normal. \n\nOr maybe my diet was worse then and taking the supplements has nothing to do with my improved levels, which is why N=1 is a lousy guide for anything. My insurance decided to cover testing when I said I was thinking about whether to have a child, because then they decided the information was medically relevant when just knowing apparently is not. I feel like insurance companies probably differ on that, but something to be aware of perhaps. They do not always, it depends on your doctor. MY NEUROLOGIST DIAGNOSED ME BYSIMPLY LOOKING AT MY HAMMER TOES AND AN EMG WHICH INSURANCE SHOULD COVER. I DO RECALL HIM ASKING FOR FURTHER TESTING WHICH INDEED IS VERY EXPENSIVE. I also have B12 deficensy If you have CMT then a B12 deficiency is a big deal that should not be left untreated or it could worsen your symptoms(!). If you have recently had a blood test that confirmed low B12 levels then you should get a B12 shot ASAP and do not forget to have your levels checked afterwards and also regularly in the future.", "Muscle Fatigue Hi! I have CMT type 2. I am continuing exercise everyday, Only just started exercising in June of this year. I just have a basic question. Is muscle fatigue in legs or thighs rather normal for everyone? or will it go away when you build endurance up? Also does Creatine or BCAA's help anyone that is working out?  \n\n\nThanks Yes fatigue in legs and thighs is completely normal, it may reduce slightly with training but will never completely go away in my experiences. Somedays it may take longer to notice but I still fatigue much faster than anyone else I know (been working out 4 years now).  \n\nI avoid ever maxing my legs or else the muscles tighten and I lose a lot of flexibility. For legs I focus on functional strength and flexibility. CMT will stop you from building much leg muscle, but it can be done as long as your consistent and CAREFUL not to injure yourself. \n\nAll of this is personal experience and may not pertain to everyone with CMT.  hope it helps\n\n:) Hi! Thanks for the reply. I am glad to know it is completely normal, Yes the fatigue is light but it is there. Hopefully with time it will disappear. I greatly appreciate the response and i will definitely make it consistent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks :)  I have type 1A and when I was working out, I never worked out for consecutive days. Rather, I would go M/W/F and rest all weekend. I did use \"Beast Creature\" Creatine after each workout and it helped me recover faster. I was not as tired or sore for as long. Just make sure to drink plenty of water. Of course, I would recommend asking a Dr. about the creatine first just to be sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck and keep up the good work. Always take creatine with a bit of sugar to get it pulled into muscles faster.  It is awesome stuff. I have 1A and drink BCAA's before and during my workout and notice a substantial increase in stamina and a small increase in recovery time. Thank you so much for you are reply. This gives me hope :)  Hi there, Okay excellent! That is really good news! Thank you so much for the reply! I will definitely add BCAA's to the mix. Do you have a certain BCAA product you use? Or anyone one of them will work?   \n\n\nThanks again! :) Thank you so much for the information. Yes i always have dedicated leg days that are not close together so it is time to recover and while they are recovering, I do weights.   \n\n\nThank you so much :) I just want to come back and say I mentioned the brand of creatine because it was delicious. I seriously wanted to drink it more than it says to. The pink lemonade flavor is incredible. I would highly recommend getting on nandrolone to help prevent muscle wasting. I initially had soreness running nSuns which is a program with very high leg volume. The soreness sucked at first but I stopped getting sore after probably two weeks of consistent squatting and deadlifting.  Muscle fatigue in the legs, especially around the hips, is extremely common due to the imbalance in muscles caused due to high arches, tight calves and shortened achilles tendons. I would work on some basic physio exercises to help strengthen the weakest muscles as they will be the ones to fail before the larger ones like your quads or hamstrings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for creatine and BCAA's....none of that will help. It looks like CMT hinders all muscle growth. What I found massively helps is Cardarine and Ostarine, the first for stamina, the second for muscle growth. If I was you, get into a good routine, get a good, calorie controlled diet going, and then look at SARMS: ( **Selective androgen receptor modulator**\n\nSelective androgen receptor modulators or SARMs are a novel class of androgen receptor ligands. (The name follows the terminology currently used for similar molecules targeting the estrogen receptor, \"selective estrogen receptor modulators,\" such as tamoxifen.) \n\nThey are intended to have the same kind of effects as androgenic drugs but be much more selective in their action, allowing them to be used for more uses than the relatively limited legitimate uses of anabolic steroids.\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ( ^| ( ^| ( ^| (   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 That is standard and probably unrelated to cmt Any will work, do not get sucked into the brand wars - it is like Creatine. If it is creatine monohydrate, its all the same, even if the price of one is literally 300% greater than the other.  I do not experience much muscle fatigue (type cmt1a) and when I do it is only for a short time like less than 5 minutes. For exercise I only really walk a lot and lift weight / kettlebells for like a little bit at a time maybe 5-10 minute bursts. I do not go for like 1hr. I also go every day though. Also I am female. I read recently in \u2018Strong Curves\u2019 that women recover faster.  Question for you:\n\nI am already on testosterone injections due to low-T.  In some quick searching it seems like this is basically the same concept with a different drug.  Can you tell me why you went on this one? First of all, nandrolone decanoate is safe for women.  Taking testosterone is safe for women too, but it has more androgenic properties and women would get less benefit from testosterone cypionate or enanthate.  Women's dosages of both these drugs are of course much smaller than a man's.\n\nFor men, you pretty much have to be on TRT if you take any nandrolone.  It will shut down your testosterone production pretty hard and fast for a number of reasons.  You can of course keep your T production up and maintain testicle size with HCG.\n\nTo answer your question on why?  Well why not?  Your muscles are atrophying with CMT and you really cannot just get them back with a regular workout routine.  Nandrolone is potent stuff and has shown significant benefits over regular testosterone.\n\nAnabolic steroids are miracle drugs for CMT.  Here is a case of a CMT1A\n\nNeuroregenerative Effect of Oxandrolone: A Case Report\n\n\nAfter the 3-month therapy, the patient gained 5.0 kg of lean body mass. Muscular strength increased significantly: maximum voluntary contraction at bench press increased from 10 to 25 kg, dumbbell fly capacity increased from 2 to 8 kg, and leg press capacity increased from 15 to 40 kg. The Walking Index (WISCI)  improved from level 6 to 14. The SNCV increased from 20.3 to 22 m/s in the medial nerve and 19.6 to 21.5 m/s in the tibial nerve, respectively. Similarly, the CMAP increased from 3.1 to 3.4mV and from 1.0 mV to 1.3 mV in medial and tibial nerves, respectively. The muscle biopsy showed an extensive type-grouping, consisting of cluster of types, suggesting a reinnervation process.\n\n\nThat is just fucking incredible.  \n I have tried 2 different brands and both were good.

She still sometimes just cant comprehend certain needs because my symptoms are not showing (I am guessing). For instance like how i have a daily budget of energy and when its gone its just that gone. Ill also forget things because all i can think about is the pain and how to fight my way through the day without losing my mind. I have to work a 10 hour shift to live and pay for my healthcare. That alone is making me slowly die inside. So when i come home the last thing i want is to fight and argue. I just feel like all our problems would go away if i could get her a better understanding of my daily battles. I guess what im asking is does anyone have a link or can send me some good material for her to read and me answer questions about the things i have to go through day to day? \n\nIt is the UK organisation but obviously it is still all relevant.  There is lots of info on there, the website's not brilliantly designed so make sure you scroll right to the bottom on each page and persevere a bit with it.\n\nTake it easy mate. I appreciate the response, but im looking for something more than just the basic info. like she understands what the disease is and what it does but im looking for something that explains how it affects day to day things and what is its like living with it.  You might not be able to find something CMT specific, but you could look for things that describe what it is like living with a \u201cchronic disease.\u201d \n\nI am married &amp; it is hard still hard describing how I feel to my husband. Like you, my illness is still invisible &amp; I do not think he fully understands even though he says he does. He will try to compare his physical pain to mine &amp; how he is still able to push through &amp; does not understand why I cannot. It is frustrating.  Have you heard of 'spoon theory'? It is basically a metaphor for the experience of living with a chronic disease or disability, and while it might not describe your exact experience of living with CMT, it is particularly relevant for the idea of daily energy limits. Might be an approachable way to give her some insight into your life.\n\nHere is a link to the ( describing spoon theory - there is a lot more to be found online about it though.\n\nHope that helps!", "Anyone having hip pain? Is anyone having trouble with their hip flexors? I woke up a few weeks ago feeling like something was a little out of place in my hip, tried to stretch it out, and thought it would resolve itself over time. It is gotten worse though, to the point that I am now avoiding even going to the store for a few groceries. It hurts when I stand up straight, like a deep pull high in my leg, next to my pelvic bone. Stretching seems to make it worse. Any thoughts?\nThanks!\n\n(Diagnosed with CMT Many years ago in my 20's. No genetic test to confirm)\n", "Question about pxt3003 ", "Joints worse in the summer? Does anyone else experience more issues during the summer? I live in Florida and for some reason as soon as it starts getting hot and humid (which is basically the entire year) it feels like my joints get \u201cstuffy\u201d and my muscles hurt more often. I also have problems with my carpal tunnel flaring. For reference I am 25f and have not gotten a definitive diagnosis on which cmt type I have, but it does run in my dad\u2019s half of the family. Heat definitely affects me adversely. Not really my joints or muscles, but I feel more.. numb, I guess? And more easily fatigued of course.\n\nFevers in particular can really mess me up when I catch a virus. At their worst, it feels like I am disconnecting with my body. Like graphical lag in a videogame, except in real life. Just an all around shitty feeling. Luckily I do not get sick very often. I am like this also. When it is hot I feel looser, my limbs do not respond how they are supposed to and I am much more likely to have falls. Carpel tunnel is also so much worse in the heat. (CMT1A) Yes, anytime it is humid or wet my joints get worse. It is the same reason people with arthritis have this issue too. The change in air pressure makes your joints and tendons expand and contract and since us CMT folks have lots of play in our joints, that is just more room for movement and pain. Heat, barometric pressure drops and raises, cold, all of it. My CMT also gives me autonomic neuropathy so the heat also lowers my blood pressure and causes me to nearly faint any time I get a little hot. July is usually wheelchair month while my body gets used to it. Oh gosh the fatigue is ridiculous during hot months. I also feel like nothing responds as fast as it should. Like I have physical lag. In winter my bones ache a little but I feel so quick and energized!\n\nI am glad you do not get sick often! That makes sense! I had felt like I was imagining things because everyone always thinks the heat should help me feel better but it does not.", "16F just diagnosed with CMT CMT is something in my family on my fathers side, and since I have the worst medical luck, of course I got it. It is really painful and I am scared. Could I please have some help learning how to live with it? No reason to be scared. I am 20M and the most important thing is to stay active. With that being said, i have a pretty mild case. It is only visible when I run and my feet have hammer toes and high arches. CMT does not affect your lifespan or anything like that. I have found that it is only a big deal when you let it be a big deal. I am sorry that you are having a hard time with it. CMT is highly variable and impacts people differently. Hopefully whatever pain you have can be managed. \n\nPeople can often help you better if you can be more specific. I know, it would be nice if there was a one-size-fits-all list of CMT tips, but there are few things that apply to everyone. Staying active is generally good, but what that looks like for one CMT-er can be very different from what it looks like for another. Hello! 31M here but I was diagnosed at 18 and it did a number on my mental health throughout my college years and looking back it really did not need to. How you deal with it will definitely depend on how the CMT manifests/progresses for you and also your personality. \n\nAnother commenter mentioned staying physically active. That has definitely been important for me. I recently have been spending a lot of effort on mental health, one on one talk therapy has been so valuable. I wish I would have started therapy right after my diagnosis. I did a write up on my meditation and breathing routine here \n\nThat is probably more information than you need right now but maybe it will be useful to you later on. So lucky to be diagnosed at your age! It took 60 years to finally figure out why I have hurt my whole life! My brother in law also has cmt. Do not know what kind, but he said he never had any pain. I hurt 24/7 since the day I was born. I have axonal 2b1/4c1 and demylanating type 3/ dejerine sottas. I am losing being able to tell what temperature something is. It can be a shock when I sit in the tub, so have to be extra careful. Hello! 34M here. I have a friend who is my age and is a female. She is has a few surgeries but has overall lived a healthy and active life. I know this disease affects everyone differently, so I hope your experience is similar to hers in the long run. I personally find staying active is difficult, with the pain of standing for too long, and extreme pain when you push yourself too much. I used to be a volunteer firefighter (16-30yoa) and it hurts mentally now that I know I just am not physically capable anymore. \n\nMy piece of advice would be to live live the best you can, while you can. Get out there and do all the things you would like to do, while you are still able to. Do not focus too much on the future.

I would not think it would be cmt but I am honestly at a lost and its not really getting better, it changes throughout the day but it always seems to be there. I would not exactly call it pain but again more irritating itching. It looks fine, dont think its fungus as it looks healthy.

It was not until I was 61 yo, had been walking with a cane, had a limp, and fell down a lot that I found out that I had CMT.\n\nWe need more awareness among medical professionals as well as others (school PE teachers and others who may see kids with the problem) I agree! Especially Pediatric doctors so we can catch it as soon as possible! ", "Type 2k and hot achey feet I have confirmed cmt type 2k. Considered mild. The symptom that bothers me the most is foot pain. Sometimes caused by heat (blood pooling) and sometimes they just ache and throb. I have not found the heat/blood common factor others in my research. So wondering if it is actually something else that is conflating the issue. Anyone have this sypmtom? 1a and pretty mild, think you hit the nail on the head. Blood pools without enough muscle to pump it back up (or compression stockings) walking is ok but standing is miserable. Aside from overuse pain the constant deep neuropathic ache can go from unnoticeable to unbearable. Many people are prescribed Gabapentin or another neuropathic pain medication. For me Cymbalta removed that kind of pain and also reduced the \"noise\" in the signal so it is kind of like I got some extra sensation back. Yes. Standing is awful! I am constantly looking for somewhere to sit. I can walk as long as I do not stop...and if there is not the deep ache pain already.\n\nStarting alpha lipoic acid tomorrow first. Dr recommended. Is the Charcot Marie type considered light? Or the course of the disease?\n\nI also have this type of illness.\r  \nAnd I would say that the burning sensation in the feet is my number 1 problem.

Mostly sensory, but also motor, causing unsteadiness, foot drop, and inward rolling of the right foot (for BOTH of us).\n\nWe are old, Dad is 83, had it 10-15 years.\nI am 58, started ~a year ago and quickly getting worse (and triggering arthritis in my right knee and ankle?).\n\nFor years, my Dad was told it was diabetic neuropathy, until he had and EMG and was told it was CMT.  We then went to the CMT Clinic at U of Iowa.   They did not come up with a clear diagnosis.   The genetic test was negative for CMT in the 72 genes evaluated.   As a default, they left the cause of his motor neuropathy to a known minor injury of his knee,  and his sensory neuropathy to diabetes (which is well controlled \u2014 A1C ~7.2).   I do not have diabetes. (A1C ~5.2)\n\nI now got an EMG and it showed slow conduction in both motor and sensory nerves.  I have an appointment to see a neurologist in a couple of weeks.\n\nIn the mean time, I am trying to think of other possible causes.  I googled up a diagnostic differential that suggested it could be either CMT *or* lead poisoning.  That seemed very possible \u2014 we have been working in an old building where a printing company used to made lead type from molten lead.\n\nThat was not it \u2014 my heavy metal blood test for Lead, Mercury, Arsenic came up undetected.\n\nI sympathize with all of you \u2014 neuropathy is painful and depressing and it does not help when people think you are making it up.\nSince you all have some experience with this \u2014\nAny other ideas ?\nMore toxins we should test for ?\nMore inherited conditions we should look at ?\n\nWe have other minor inherited issues, shared with other family and extended family, that include kidney cysts, ankle problems, Microtia \u2014 these problems always seem to affect our right side only ?\n\nThanks for reading this much !\nSuggestions will be much appreciated.\n\nAny other people here with \u201cunknown\u201d CMT-like issues ? It could be a number of things, including but not limited to: medication, heavy metals, industrial chemicals, mycotoxins, bacterial toxins (e.g. Lyme disease et al.), autoimmune reaction, viral infection (e.g. HIV et al.), plant or animal toxin, endocrine disease (e.g. hypothyroidism), organ disease and/or failure, dietary (e.g. vitamin) deficiencies, cancer, misc. acquired undiagnosed condition, a rare or even novel de novo mutaton, trauma, and more. \n\nFrom my own experience though it is not a good idea to try and find an answer based on a \"shotgun approach\" of trying to match possible causes with symptoms. It usually never works and it only creates worry because you end up reading about all these horrible things that you imagine you could have that you very likely do not. It can be really hard to diagnose these things, so a much better approach is to work along with a doctor who will be able to systematically narrow down the possibilities. For instance, if the NCV is uniformly slow along individual nerves and between different nerves, it is likely not an acquired demyelinating neuropathy (but do not quote me on this!). Your doctor/neurologist will know all of these things and will hopefully be able to find the cause.\n\nTo have the best possible chance of success it is good idea to prepare a list of information to bring with you when you have your consultation. Things like when your symptoms started, what your symptoms are, how often you experience them, the medications you take if you take ant and any medication you have taken since symptoms first appeared, etc. The same kind of information relating to your dad and also any other relevant family history is also important to bring along if you can. Thanks for that. Yes, I have been organizing a list for the neurologist, and I will ask him if the NCV looks uniformly slow. Thanks for that.  I have been organizing a list of issues for the neurologist, and I will ask him if the NCV looks uniformly slow. Some kinds of CMT do not yet show up on the genetic tests from what I understand.

I unfortunately was a victim of something horrible and even though I went to the hospital and got the morning after pill I am pregnant. My body is not physically strong enough to handle a baby right now but I am also worried there could be some complications with an abortion because of cmt. Again, sorry for the possibly controversial question but I would like some advice if anyone has any. I am only 18 and should not have gotten myself into this situation but I dont think im physically, mentally, or financially stable enough right now and I do not think the pregnancy would be safe for me especially since my doctor told me before that I would need to plan it first. I cannot talk to my family either because they are extremely against pregnancy before marriage and against abortions. Abortion is health care and anyone who comes here to debate abortion on moral grounds and not the medical question will have their post removed. I am sorry that you are in this situation. \n\nThere are a lot of details that I do not know about your health situation, perhaps the most relevant being how far along you are now. Also, I am not sure what your doctor thinks you would do to plan for a pregnancy that would make it safer, although unless this is some specific CMT advice that I am unaware of it is probably not important here. \n\nI do not have any experience with an abortion. I have had two early stage miscarriages. One of them required some medical assistance and while I was unhappy to lose the pregnancy it was probably not functionally much different from an abortion at that time. \"That time\" was only 7 weeks along though, so I do not have personal experience of what it would have been like later. I had no lasting physical effects from either of my brief pregnancies. While I have not had an abortion, I have friends who have. The process for one friend was uncomfortable, but from what she told me it seems far less likely to cause complications than a full surgery or childbirth itself would. i have cmt and ive had 3 abortions.all three were fine.best of luck. Thank you I am so sorry you had to go through that Thank you!", "Broken braces? I got leg braces when I was in 5th grade and since then to my sophomore year of high school I have broken at least 8 pairs of them. Usually that last for about 3-4 months before they snap. I have many different varieties with carbon fiber and full unhinged plastic. The plastic ones have lasted me the longest of about a year but I snapped the QUARTER INCH plastic at the ankle. Is this normal? Is there anything is can do to stop destroying them? My daughter\u2019s gone through three pairs of afos, mainly just from outgrowing them but never really had issues other than occasional cracks in some of the corners of the front.  \n\nI am assuming they are custom made (as hers all have been); do you get them all from the same place?  Or maybe not enough flexibility in the shoes you are wearing them with? I am near 40 and have been wearing plastic AFOs for 6 years or so.  I have snapped a pair at the ankle.  A year is about right for how long they should last, they are not intended or meant to last years and years, they wear out just like shoes.  I should think because you are young and growing this adds to the wear and tear.\n\nIf anything congratulate yourself for being so active you wear them out quick! The most recent ones have been custom and have been better than the off the shelf ones but still break often. I have been to 3 different places (currently I get them from a children\u2019s hospital) I have never grown out of a pair because they break. The people there say my shoes are fine so I do not think it is that.

The people there say my shoes are fine so I do not think it is that. I think I am being to rough with them I did not creep your history so was going to ask if you are still at an age where you will grow anymore.  If not maybe talking to the people that custom make them, maybe they can custom make something with like titanium inserts molded into the plastic to give it more strength.  I know they are expensive enough as they are but if it saves having to replace them so often it might be worth the extra cost. I have had my most recent for almost 9 years. I have broken the straps and the hinges before, but never the afo plastic. I have had 3 different pairs, out grown 2. Last I had them updated was when I was 14 or so, never had another pair since. I am 24 now, and they are okay, not up to date but intact. Maybe going to your neurologist or try Hanger; recommendations should help, and they will suggest the cheapest and best ones to work for you. If you keep snapping them, maybe try reinforcing where that happens or letting them know where, so they can help reinforce or make it more flexible to accommodate your activities. I have tired hanger and they gave me the worst pair I have ever had. The customs that I have now all of my doctors like but they too are breaking. I wish I could have them more flexible but I need the most support I can get for my knees. I am not really growing anymore so this seems like a really good idea. Thanks! No idea what is \u201cnormal\u201d, but I went through a period where I would break a carbon fiber AFO or two every 6-8 months. They told me that was not the norm but that I was probably more active than the average person who wears them.\n\nI have since switched from an off-the-shelf AFO (Blue Rocker) to a custom carbon AFO, that have been created with a particular emphasis on the failure mode I was typically experiencing. Specifically, they are super thick and heavily reinforced at the \u201cstrut\u201d where they connect to the foot plate, because that is where mine always develop cracks eventually. Even these will eventually fail (I am on my second set and will likely need a third pretty soon), but they are definitely quite a lot more durable, lasting me 2-3 years.\n\nI would highly recommend that you find an orthotist that is interested in working with you to find a solution. My experience is that the custom ones are actually far \u201ccheaper\u201d in the long run despite the higher sticker price since they last so much longer. Depending on what kind of insurance, etc, you have, it can be very big savings. True about the support. Where do they snap more? At the ankle the most I just got my carbon braces after living with cmt my senior year in hs this year I have already cracked part of it but am afraid if I break it I am screwed until I get a new one That happened to me last year. I ended up walking with crutches for a month while they made me new ones. It sucks.

One of my coleagues admitted to me once that he does jumping jacks every time he goes to the bathroom (we have large single user bathrooms) in order to squeeze in some physical movement every day. Computer jobs are great but lack of movement is not good when you have CMT. My dream job I think would be one that combines off site data aquisition and on-site prosessing. Maybe drone or lidar scanning in the field 1-2 days/ week and the rest at the office. Such jobs are out there, but they are not that common. I do not really view myself as the management type I am generally pretty reserved and like to keep to myself.  I am afraid people would think Im a pushover, which is far from the truth but I do not express myself well.  \n\nDo you do management? If so did you ever view yourself as a manager type beforehand?  If not what changed?\n\nSorry for the 3 part questioning haha   I honestly am biased against computer only work, my mother is a programmer and her job basically requires her to sit all day (she tried a standing desk but could not focus on her work because of knee pain).  I know that might be a problem she has that I may not at this point in my life, however I do not want to be stuck at a desk.  I also actually hate working on computers, I am decent at troubleshooting windows but am a novice/ know little about anything else.    \n\nI cannot stand not being able to ask the computer why it is being so difficult and not listening to my commands.  Really thank you though I do not want to seem unappreciative but I would compromise my identity to learn to want to work on a computer my whole life.         I do it because I am passionate about problem solving but another factor is also that a lot of more physical jobs would simply be too tiresome for me. If I had to be on my feet all day or walk/travel a lot, or lift heavy stuff, I would not last very long. I also dislike having to engage customers, so sales and support and all that jazz in the corporate world does not really appeal to me either. The way I see it though, the world is becoming more and more data driven and automation is coming for all jobs. So working with computers and expanding my skill set will hopefully help in keeping me relevant in the future. And despite the fact that treatments for CMT are on the horizon, I think it is a good idea to plan for the worst and assume that hard physical jobs will always be problematic for me. My mother worked a physical job all her life, and in the end she really struggled because of the disease progression.\n\nAs for Sonography, I found this:\n\n\"*During their careers, 84% of sonographers report experiencing some form of work-related musculoskeletal pain due to scanning in compromised positions, incorrect gripping of the transducer, spending too much time to manipulate the transducer on technically difficult exams such as obese or large pregnant patients and a lack of upper body fitness.*\"\n\n It may be worth taking any opportunities you get to put yourself in front of people as confidence is something that can be improved. I do indeed do management and manage 15 people on any given day which is something that is a far cry from my degree, I ultimately went down this path for two reasons: 1) it is tech management, and I like tech but mainly 2) which is that tech is in vogue and as long as I stay ahead on current trends, I am unlikely to find myself out of employment in the next 20 years, so all in all seems like a good route to go down and one which I have no intention of moving away from.  It pretty much depends on a lot of factors. How advanced your disease is a big part of it. After all, many people work very physical jobs and do not find out that they have CMT until their 50's and 60's. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI on the other hand was in bad shape in my teens so I have always done lower key jobs that were not too physical. I worked in radio broadcasting, call centers and did driving jobs. I am now in my 40's and it is a lot tougher than how it used to be. My biggest enemy is fatigue so, no matter the job I am pretty much bombed by the end of the shift. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, as of now I am on disability but I did have an excellent part time job with a nation wide car agency driving cars statewide. I absolutely loved it. A lot of people who are retired or disabled do those jobs.  Do not know if you are computer minded but I am a programmer and that has worked pretty well for me because I also have it worked out that I can work from home on bad pain days. Lots of people at my office have standing desks and I also get up regularly to walk around (though not because of cmt so much as my desperate attempt at staying awake as a narcoleptic). \n\nAnother thought might be medical coding (which is not programming but related to medical billing), it is a growing field and a lot of technical colleges have programs. That is what my mom does and what I did before programming. Most large offices or companies can get you a standing desk upon request especially in medical cases. And after a couple years a lot of offices let you work entirely from home. My mom goes into the office like once a month. With a Bachelors in Sociology, maybe something like Case worker or program coordinator or program specialist with Red Cross. ( ", "Anyone have flat feet? Heyo! I (25F) know that a lot of people with CMT have high arches, but I have very VERY flat feet. In fact they are pronated in. Just curious if anyone else has this as well? \n\nI am wondering if it is from all the medical intervention. Double hamstring and calf surgery at 11 (pre-diagnosis, I was actually diagnosed at 13), straight legged casts up to the hips for a month, then casts up to my knees, boots, and then of course, the wonderful AFOs. Just looking for some peeps who might also have duck feet! 29M 1A here and I have flat feet, my left foot is worse for sure. My dad has 1A and flat feet as well, neither of us have had surgery. I wear custom insoles for arch support though to be perfectly honest I do not know that they are helping. I do some barefoot running (wearing toe shoes) which I find helps my foot strength and I think is helping me maintain my arches. I am fortunate that the CMT has been very mild in it is presentation for me, I know it will be very difficult for a lot of CMTers to run. \n\nI like the term duck feet though, first I have heard it. Totally stealing that! Thank you for the reply! I am very thankful that I had the medical intervention because without it, they said I could have some serious issues walking and would need assistance (either walker or cane). As I went into high school I did Triathlons without any problems which was awesome and I am so grateful for.\n\nI recently purchased some Hokas that have good support, but they do not really have arch support. It is more supporting by keeping my ankles from rolling in even further. \n\nToe shoes! Interesting! I have always steered away from those because I figured they did not offer much support, but I did not think about the fact they might help strengthen my feet! How long have you been using them?\n\nAlso, so glad your presentations are mild, keep up the running and strength! I do and my uncle does as well. I have it mild but my uncle has it worse. But we both have flat feet. I have tried insoles and they have never helped give me arches, I do not know about my uncle. I used to be more active but after a labor intensive job my legs are worse. I like hard labor but my ankles and knees kill me and my left hip when it is cold. My left leg more So, I do not know if that is normal. Thanks for the encouragement! It is a daily struggle to find the motivation. \n\nThat is so awesome that you were running triathalons with CMT. I mean, seriously, amazing. \n\nI have been running in toe shoes for almost 10 years now. I do not do more than 5k ever. Most runs are 1-1.5 miles. Lately I have been running 3-4 times a week. I know it is totally anecdotal but I have had a great experience. All my doctors have scratched their heads when I tell them about it.. Yeah I tried insoles for a while too, but I was advised not to push an arch if I do not naturally have one. \n\nI am not sure if one side being worse is normal or not either! It would not surprise me though. CMT is silly like that lol. Yeah it affects everyone differently. Its crazy 65 M, here. EXTREMELY flat feet! Awaiting the results of a nerve biopsy to absolutely confirm CMT. All other test, examinations, MRI's, EMG's, ... all say I have CMT. Why I needed the painful nerve ectomy I have no idea if all the other test say I do have CMT?!\n\nAnyway, there has never been a time in my life when my feet and legs have not hurt. There has never been a night where the last thing I felt before fall asleep was my feet and legs throbbing and in extreme pain. And there has never been a morning in my entire life when the first thing I feel just before waking is my legs, feet, knees, throbbing and aching.\n\nFrom a very young boy, about 6, 7, I was always dragged to doctors for my flat feet and the pain and it was always the same thing. Take off your pants, and walk up and back the hallway so the dr's can watch how my legs and feet are moving. This was back in the time of dinosaurs, the late 50's, early 60. Also, these Dr's were all military, grew up in the Air Force.\n\nI have had inserts, required at age 7, 8, 9 to wear female Air Force dress shoes because they were the only shoes small enough that would provide a strong support for ankle and foot roles. I cannot begin to describe how humiliating that was, to have to wear not only Air Force shoes at that age to school and playing outside, but female Air Force shoes!\n\nI was required to spend 30 minutes, twice a day, picking up marbles with my toes 15 minutes per foot.\n\nMy flat feet have caused problems with the entire muscle/skeleton systems. My hips, pelvis, knees, ankles, feet, back, all hurt and are painful as a result of flat feet.\n\nTo be honest though, I have always been very physical and outdoorsie. I have hiked the Grand Canyon twice as an adult. Run the rapids down the Colorado River, and hiked and climbed many of the mountains and valleys of the west.\n\nYeah, I have flat feet. and they still hurt! Yes, I have 1a !  I have absolutely no arch which as you no is so uncommon (my mom's you can practically wedge a pingpong ball under). I do not think it is from intervention, I think CMT can either result in the more common high arches or the lesser common no arch. It is strange.", "R/cmthsn is a cancer I called them out on being biased and they immediately banned me.\n\nI have been member of r/cmt for years.  I have CMT and should be able to express my views in these communities.  They banned me immediately for arguing they are simply creating a contradictory sub to this one\n\nR/cmthsn is a bunch of BS Sorry r/cmthmsn 3 posts in 2 years. What exactly happened? Are you talking about their sub,,?  I can assure you I have posted more than 3 times in the last 2 years.\n\nIs this a smear campaign?  It has happened to me before for calling out mods I am not a fan of r/cmthmsn but our mods have no control over it. JoeBob wants to create a CMT community that will agree with (and buy via his affiliate links) the supplements he is pushing. As long as he keeps that to his own sub, there is nothing I can do. \n\nReddit rules allow a subreddit to be run as an authoritarian fiefdom if the top mod so chooses. All anyone else can do is not go there. This is so sad for our community. But I really appreciate you affirming for me that he is an ass. That sub has 9 total posts, it is not like it is the go to place for cmt related information and discussion The view numbers on his site posts that the subreddit points to have abysmally low numbers as well. Seeing that it is joebob, it is because I have him blocked. If nothing else, it highlights that the sub is inactive with the mod the only OP. Nixy, you are a perfect example of why a different community is needed as the lead moderator of this one. You seem unable to grasp that a website cannot be ran for free - affiliate links make little to no money, yet are the most customer relevant. For some reason you do not seem to be able to comprehend that a website needs some sort of revenue stream; I am guessing you and the mods are somewhere over the age of 50 a d have never worked on an actual website in your life. Instead, because you do not like the idea that you do not know best and you are scared your community may move elsewhere, you let toxic shit like this be posted. \n\nWhy would someone create three toxic posts aimed at me with no substance? The guy is batshit crazy and I have reported him for repeatedly beaking the Reddit code of conduct. \n\nLet me ask you and the others here: what have you done for the CMT community? Participated in a subreddit? Complain about socks? Wow, what trailblazers you are. I made the my site with the vision that CMT resources online could be, and needed to be, better, but as soon as you thought that jepodized your community, you freaked out and made it all about \"self-promotion\". Here is a hint: if I wanted to make money, I would not waste time on a CMT website. \n\nThis place is a toxic shit hole and you guys prove it. Go back to complaining about socks. You seem to be a little obsessed with this. What is actually going on? This is not a healthy or proportional reaction.  It is extremely disappointing that I am having to write this and such a thread (two in fact) has not been correctly moderated: (\n\nThe short story is that this user posted on ( deliberately in an inflammatory way, directly and unapologetically in breach of the subreddit rules. The user was then banned but proceeded to send me numerous insulting, profanity-laden messages, and was subsequently blocked.\n\nSeeing moderators engage with this post instead of correctly moderating it is a disgrace. Reddit has been informed and will take what actions are necessary to sort this out. Passion looks like obsession to those who have none. No, it is obsession. Numerous and randomly aggressive posts in a matter of hours? That is not healthy or normal", "CMT workout Hi friends,\n\nHave someone made a CMT workout?\n\nI guess we all can skip leg day? \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnyway, I have wanted to start working out for balance and core strength for some time - but also chest/arms/abs. Do you have any tips? \n\nThis is something I have been meaning to start. Unfortunately I cannot form muscle no matter how much I work out so I cannot help you there lol. Hi there! I have gone and made several resources for CMT specific workouts:\n\n(\n\n(\n\nThose pages cover what to focus on, with a few blog posts of what I would recommend as a good exercise routine for legs and forearms. Hope this helps! \n\nMy tip is to focus on your forearms. This is usually weaker in people with CMT, resulting in being a limiting factor for a lot of other exercises as your forearms will give out before your other muscles do. Spending some extra time on them can be a major benefit. For legs, I would also focus on strengthening the hips as these can become imbalanced due to CMT. I know you are joking, but NO, it is crucial that we not skip leg day, as CMTers. You may need to do different leg exercises. I have struggled with squats personally because of balance issues and heel tightness (deadlifts are a little more doable, possibly, if you use a trap bar with raised handles especially). So mostly, I stick to leg press, leg extension, and leg curl machines for legs; I have recently started trying to incorporate a calf raise machine but it is a serious struggle because my calves are so weak and atrophied. But, I think I am making some slow progress in rebuilding some tone and strength there.\n\nI agree strongly with the above advice about strengthening your forearms. I also find that difficult but it is really important for maintaining function, and it helps you to be able to do other good upper body exercises safely (e.g., bench press). I like doing reverse cable curls and cable curls if you have access to a cable machine (may be harder at the moment due to the pandemic).\n\nAlso I usually do recumbent bike for cardio. I find that is also good because it also does some good for your legs. And I always do cardio and lifting on the same days, because I find that lifting feels a lot better after getting the blood pumping first with 30 minutes or so on the bike. I have just done a work out sheet for my 7yr old Son, concentrating on core and leg strength. See below \n\n\n1, \tWARM UP \u2013 RUNNING ON THE SPOT.\nSTAR JUMPS.\n\n2, \tDYNAMIC LEG STRETCHES\n\n3, \tTHIGH STRETCHES\n\n4, \tHOPPING\n\n5,\tSQUATS\n\n6,\tPLANK\n\tPLANK/PRESSUP \u2013 OPPOSITE ARM, LEG OFF THE GROUND &amp; HOLD\n\n7,\tWALL OF DEATH/WALL SQUAT \u2013 STICK OUT ONE LEG\n\n8,\tBALANCE ON ONE FOOT \u2013 CLOSE YOUR EYES\n\n9,\tTWO FOOTED JUMPS\n\n10,\tTOUCH YOUR TOES\n\n11, \tAIRPLANE I had the same issue, then I tried SARMs and they changed everything - not growing muscle is a known result of CMT, but the neurologists are too ignorant to tell patients this. For me, rowing on a concept2 does the thing. Keeps the muscles in tone and with basic technique and a moderate pace I have not been able to hurt myself. \" I guess we all can skip leg day? \"\n\nNope - maxing out all the leg machines and now working towards hitting 300 kg on the plate loaded leg press. Got to get those quads popping in my shorts!\n\nThough on a serious note, have a look at JoeBob85 and his links. They are pretty good advice on what to do.", "Has anyone had abnormal evoked potentials before diagnosis?  You mean like a CMAP (compound motor action potential) as part of a nerve conduction study or are you asking about something else? It is a tibial somatosensory evoked potential. Not everyone may have had this in their diagnostic work up though. Did you have mostly abnormal nerve conduction and emg? Yeah, I had the characteristically low nerve conduction velocity but I do not think I had a  tibial somatosensory evoked potential test done.", "CMT and covid Hi everyone,\nAre CMT people at a higher risk for covid-19? As in not a higher risk of getting it, but a higher risk of long term complications if we get it.\nAs the virus is known to have attacked peripheral nerves. And:\n although it does not say what kind of neuropathy. No. I have CMT and EDS and I fully recovered from covid. I had a lot more spasms in my calves during the second week (I had a moderate case and difficulty breathing, but was not hospitalized) but nothing chronic. My aunt and cousin also had it (and have CMT) and they had no complications or long-term issues. \nThat is not to say that we are protected from covid in any way, or not at risk for long-term covid or death. It only means that CMT has no determination on how the immune system reacts to covid. Thank you. Please take care, both you and your family Same to you! I think it is worth noting here that your personal experience is not necessarily universal, given that some folks with cmt have breathing and lung issues down to cmt, which would make them at higher risk to covid. I have breathing issues as well as dysautonomia. My aunt has advanced COPD and diaphragm issues due to phrenic nerve issues from CMT. She is okay, as am I. As I said, the immune system is the variable. And there have been people with those disabilities and symptoms, even people with JUST COPD, who have died. Your experience is not universal and to say that no one with cmt will necessarily have a harder time with covid simply is not true. I said it is up to the immune system. What you did was use your personal experience, twice, to suggest that people with cmt need not worry any more than a non disabled person. Which is wrong. Not only because some people with cmt absolutely will have a harder time, directly because of their cmt, but because the intensity of Covid you had, could wildy differ from person to person. But keep down voting me idc \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f It is clear what I said. Go to the largest CMT support groups and you will see it repeated ad nauseum; some are asymptomatic, some have serious issues, and the most I have seen have shared my personal experience, including subtypes with more prevalence of phrenic nerve impairment. The variable is the immune response, which cannot be predicted at the moment. Covid kills people way healthier than us with no known previous illness or risk factors. There is no way to know how your body will react. And having CMT makes even the flu worse, but that does not mean we are at higher risk for long-term covid or a cytokine storm response. I wonder about the risks of the vaccination with CMT, it has caused facial palsy, so should we take a risk? My opinion is that the risk of facial palsy, a temporary condition, is very low and treatable. The risks of covid far outweigh the risks of the vaccine, on both a personal and collective scale. I had Covid. Was not hospitalized but had bronchitis and fever from the covid Infection. I recovered from Covid in the respiratory sense but it has had a lasting impact on my nerve function. It is been 6+ months since my infection, but my tongue fatigues after talking for a long period of time, I have way more muscle spasms all over my body than I used to have, my hands and wrists are noticeably weaker than they were before the infection. I have been through the wringer with my neurologist and a half dozen other doctors and there is nothing to be found but CMT and covid. There is a lot of studies showing Covid causes nervous system related problems in up to 80% of normal people. People with CMT may not be at higher risk of dying from Covid, but if you want to preserve your existing nerve function, you should strongly avoid getting infected. There is no indication that someone with CMT is at any greater risk than anyone else in the general population. There have not been any reported effects of the vaccine on the peripheral nervous system (facial palsy I believe would be due to issues in the cranial nerves, which are not structurally part of the peripheral nervous system).\n\nAlso, as u/wolfbear pointed out, the risks of complications from getting Covid are much more serious than the risks from the vaccine. My neurologist had always advised me not to get the influenza vaccine. I am not sure how he would feel about covid though. So, there is no correlation basically.", "Driving with AFO Recently fitted with noodle afo. I am afraid to drive with it as I cannot extend my foot downward. Does anyone have experience with this?  Took mine off to drive for a long long time until I gained confidence. Be safe. It is hard at first. I had to lean a new angle to set my foot on the pedal with mine on to compensate for this. After a week or so though I pretty much had the new technique down. My daughter had to have a medical assessment for driving and because of the combination of afos and lack of feeling she was recommended to use hand controls.  We have not crossed that bridge yet due to drivers Ed issues (covid and lack of offering lessons with hand controls) but the school recently got a new contract and the new ppl are going to accommodate her needs\u2014so that is promising. I have a different type of afo, the Allard Toe Off. The lady who fit me just recommended that I unstrap the afo while driving. Luckily my drive is only 10 minutes to work. Any longer trips I take a change of shoes. Have not tried driving with it, but I am on my second pair. How do you like them so far? We are yours custom fitted, and is your stirrup inside our outside your heel? They definitely help, but the push on the calf takes some getting used to. Stirrup inside.\nHow long do they typically last? Yeah, I have a strappy thing that I have been using. Not bad to drive with, but not as good of foot lift Oh, my upper plate\u2019s on my shin, which I really like, kind of gives you something to lean into. My first pair just under a year, but when I went back to the orthotist she said the first guy did not have mine made with enough reinforcement. So the first pair had the stirrup go on the outside on my heel and up the back of my calf with a 2 inch collar with a Velcro front. I found that having the stirrup on the outside really limited that styles of shoes I could wear. My new pair has inside stirrups which attach to a steel bar reinforced soccer style looking shin guard front plate. While these are much more visually apparent, I find they have provided me more balance, and added a bonus shin guard from leaning into things, and the inside stirrup has let me buy more styles of shoes, which means lower costs. These pair are coming up on two years. What shoes do you use? I looked at so many and most of them are so cushioned I cannot feel anything...which is not good for me. I have never ever driven with a non hinged afo. Reading the fine print in the booklet that came with mine (spry step, quite similar) I think it even said not to. Reebok Nylon Classic, they fit a pair of Nike skateboard shoes. I always look at the sole on the bottom for something real wide in the middle and flat. Your foot plate may be different than mine because they *can* be ground down by your orthotist. I just never had that done. They also fit in. A pair of Timberland Earthkeepers, and very tightly in Clarks Desert Boot. I daily drive and autocross in my AFOs. Only issue I have had has been with the angle of certain clutch pedals making it difficult to press the clutch all the way in, or my bulkier shoes making it hard to come down accurately and quickly on the break without overlapping another pedal during an autocross run, depending on the pedal setup of the car. I recently switched to automatic, and it is eliminated my problems. \n\nI find that the angle of pedals in Subarus are hard for me, but Mini/BMW, Ford, Honda have been fine. In the Subarus I have tried to drive, I would have needed (and almost made) a spacer or wedge of some kind to drive the car.", "What are the signs of CMT? Hi. I wanted to know how you guys found out you had CMT.  I took care of my mother for 20 years until she died last year. She was diagnosed back in 2001. I have not shown any signs yet at 43 but the last 2 weeks my leg muscles have felt a little weird. I probably should go to get checked out but truthfully it is a little frightening.  Get your leg checked out but having CMT not show up for 43 years is very unlikely Yeah,  my mom was not diagnosed till she was 65. She started complaining something was wrong in her late 50s. My grandmother probably had the same thing but was never diagnosed.  Does your patellar (knee) reflex work? Can you walk on your heels? Sometimes symptoms can be very mild, my great grandfather for instance had it (1A) but showed very few symptoms even late in his life. Yeah,  knees work,  no foot drop,  and have feeling on bottom of foot. I do have high arches. Both my calf muscles just feel tingly and weaker than usual.  My dad got diagnosed at 60 when he realised he could not stand on tip-toes anymore. My mom was first diagnosed in her 50s My father was diagnosed at 55. I have it too (genetic testing), but an currently fairly asymptomatic. There are late onset subtypes. I just found out thru genetic testing that I have CMT, and I am 60. I will find out what subtype I have on Monday, April 1. I started to have neuropathy in my legs a few years ago I think, but my neurologist thought it was because of a couple of back surgeries I had 27 years ago. In spring 2018 I began to have drop foot in my right foot, and then summer 2018 the drop foot started in my left foot. The drop foot symptoms in both feet went away after a few weeks. Ye Gods.

I am still in the process of getting diagnosed. Numerous family members have CMT, and I am experiencing nerve twitching and other signs of CMT. I also have large numb areas of my skin (might not be CMT related). \n\nI was wondering if anyone has ever experienced an extreme itch that cannot be scratched and shows no outward symptoms (bug bite, rash, etc.)\n\nI have been getting these every so often, and they keep me up at night. It is almost like my nerves under the skin are itching, but I have no feeling surface level. As a result, I cannot make the itching sensation go away. Look up neuropathy, maybe, and see if those symptoms match up with your type and what you are experiencing, and maybe mention it to your doctor as a possibility? Is the feeling only in your legs? It occurs in random spots unfortunately. I have had it primarily occur on my foot, side, and shoulder blade area. It usually last for a couple hours and then disappears. My legs have a constant bug crawling feeling, but not this weird intense itch. i have CMT and restless leg syndrome. You might see a doctor about the leg tingles. A simple prescription might help. Nope. Itching has never been a problem for me. Does it feel like an itch that is a few layers beneath your skin? So it feels impossible to get to?\n\nAlso..., opioids will make me feel itchy like there is a bug jumping around on my body. Yeah the surface layer is numb and the itch is under that layer. I am not on any medications. I am currently in the process of waiting to see a neuromuscular specialist. Yeah the surface layer is numb and the itch is under that layer. I am not on any medications. I am currently in the process of waiting to see a neuromuscular specialist. I get the same sensation. I am assuming it is CMT related.\n\nLet me know what you find out though! Yes, I have some of that itching, on one foot. My dermatologist told me it is the damaged nerves causing it. I put benadryl cream on the skin and it helps a bit. It could be a placebo effect, but I do not care as long as it works.\n~ Follygolly WOW flashback. sometime between the years when i was 12 to maybe 16 i would frequently lose sleep because of this. I knew it had to be cmt related but researched it and thought it was restless leg syndrome. It would only happen at night when i would lay down to sleep, i would constantly have to move my feet to make the feeling go away and would even check under the covers to make sure there wasnt actual bugs crawling on me i HATED it. so glad it went away, geez almost forgot about thanks for the ptsd xD I get tingling in my legs and feet, especially when I am trying to sleep at night. In really bad cases it actually hurts (sort of feels like a itch) and takes a lot of shaking to get rid of it, but even then it just comes back in like 5 seconds time. I am fairly certain I have got restless leg syndrome and maybe its the same for you. The only thing that really works for me is a hot bath with some muscle relaxation soap.", "CMT affecting my hands/legs. So I was diagnosed with CMT1A when I was 5 (my kindergarten teacher noticed I could not use scissors properly and told my parents to get it checked out). It runs in my mom's side (as far back as her grandfather had it). I am 24 now and my hands have started shaking uncontrollably and now I have noticed my legs do not \"work\" sometimes like they are supposed to. The first time I noticed was last week when I went to take my dog outside. I had to drag my left leg as it would not pick up to walk and today, it did the same thing.\n I know my uncle has a more progressive onset of 1A as had to start using a cane in his 40s and had to have corrective surgery when he was a kid. I will finally be seeing a neurologist after 6 years so we shall see what happens. I also just got married and am hoping to start a family sometime soon as well but scared my future kids could get it as well. I watched my brother grow up with this. Yes it is scary, but you have to keep your chin up about it and try to stay positive.\nGood luck and let me know if you want to talk Thank you! It is definitely not fun but I have do e all I can to live a normal life w/out it affecting every aspect of my life. I k ow ita hard watching a loved one with it (my husband has known about it back when we started dating and he is been my biggest supporter). AFOs can be life changing if you are not wearing them. Also, are you treating your tremors? Propranolol really helps me. In addition, your kids do not have to have CMT. There are treatments to get pregnant with an embryo without CMT. Cannot tell if you are trolling, but this is early standard CMT stuff. Shit sucks, does not get better, depending on the phenotype you may be likely to transfer it to them as well, maybe not though.\n\n\nNot trying to be an asshole here dude, but this is a *progressive* neurological disease. So prepare to notice your legs below your knees, as well as your hands both getting worse.\n\n\nLike I said, not trying to be an asshole, just realistic. I completely get what you are saying and you are def not being an asshole about it. It definitely does suck having it and what it does to your body over the years. Join the club!! My doctor told us 50/50% chance of passing it on. I am not willing to risk that. Family members are a window into your future, so keep an eye on their symtoms, try and go research into dead relatives and see how they moved. \n\nMaybe look into adoption? Or a sperm bank donation for your partner?\n\nThat is where we are right now, but then there is the fact that no doctor can tell me how bad I will get. I do not want to be in a wheelchair rasing a child. The Geneticist said lots of parents raise their children in wheelchairs or with some other assisted devices. I am sure many people would be okay with that scenario, but if I had a choice I would pick no kids with my current outlook.\n\nAnd that is killing my wife.\n\nFinally, ask your doctor for carbon fiber afo's, it might allow some mobility back into your life.", "First baby born from IVF technique which eliminates CMT ", "Triangles ", "Newly diagnosed - CMT X linked I am 12 weeks pregnant and just received our genetic testing back which revealed that I am a carrier of CMT X linked. We are going through CVS testing as soon as possible to understand if the fetus has been effected. From what I understand, there is a 50% chance a male will be severely effected, 50% chance he will not have it at all, 50% chance a female will be a carrier or mild symptoms and 50% chance she will not have it at all.  Has anyone else been through this? I had never heard of any family history of CMT so I am very surprised and trying to learn as much as possible. What are the models symptoms of a female carrier if she does have it? \n\nSince I found out I am a carrier, I have noticed that a few weeks ago I have developed a very slight tremor that is undetectable by sight, but I can feel it in my hands and feet especially at night. I have never had symptoms before, but I have been reading that symptoms can be exacerbated by pregnancy. Has anyone else been through a pregnancy who was an X Link carrier? Did you experience symptoms? Did the symptoms last or get worse after pregnancy?  First congrats on your pregnancy!\n\nI have CMTX. You are not a carrier-- you have CMTX. It is X-linked dominant-- you would only be a carrier if it were a recessive gene. \n\nI got it from my dad and it is rampant on his side of the family. It affects everyone differently. My dad had very few symptoms until his 30s. He is now 78 and needs a walker or wheelchair, but he did not need that until his 70s. My aunt, his sister, is also now in a wheelchair. She is in her 80s. One of my male cousins was more severely affected younger with foot drop, but nothing a good AFO cannot help. \n\nCVS is an invasive procedure which comes with risks to the fetus. It is a minor risk, but still a risk. I urge you to do more research before going down that route. The idea that all males will be severely affected is a little misleading. CMTX is not life-threatening. Would you terminate a pregnancy due to CMTX? I have a newborn and had to ask the same questions of myself during pregnancy although CMTX was not part of this consideration because looking at the big picture, it is not that bad. All of my affected family members (and there are many) live very happy productive lives. That said, one of my cousins is doing IVF to try to eliminate it. I did IVF as well but decided not to test for it.\n\nPlease feel free to PM me anytime if you want to chat.  Oh sorry! I forgot to answer your questions regarding pregnancy. I talked to a perinatologist about it during my first trimester. He said about a third of women will see their symtoms get worse, a third will see no change, and a third may actually see improvement. I saw no change. My balance is affected, my ankles roll constantly, and I have slight weakness in my hands now (which started right before i got pregnant-- at 42 years old).  I am a male with X.   Everything you have stated is a correct understanding.   Basically a 50% chance your child will have it (from the female).  \n\nFrom the male side of things, 100% of my daughters will have it, and none of my sons will.  \n\nYou either have the gene or you do not, Genetically speaking.  \n\nSo then speaking to how you are affected.   Males will generally express the CMTX symptoms.  Females MSU never express them, it could be more mild, or possibly the same.  I have been told \u201cmore mild\u201d symptoms is the most common.  \n\nIt is hard to say what you are going thru is just pregnancy or some CNT symptom.  Just really do not know.  \n\nI hope I helped.   Thank you very much! As a male with CMTX at what age did you start expressing symptoms and how severe are they?  Thank you very much for both of your posts. This was very helpful information. Was your perinatilogist a specialist in CMT? Do you also see a neurologist for your own symptoms?  This diagnosis just happened on Friday (no one in my known family has ever expressed any symptoms or knew they had it) so I am desperately seeking information all weekend and trying to figure out where I need to line up appointments next week.  I am 32 years old and now thinking back to try to identify if I have had these symptoms at a younger age and just not paid much attention since it was not severe.  Perinatologists are high risk pregnancy doctors, but are also well-versed in genetic disorders. At my hospital, they are part of genetics. My doctor was very familiar with CMT. I was actually surprised how much he knew! I do not see a neurologist since my symptoms are so mild and there is nothing they can do anyway. I might go just to get some baseline numbers so if/ when it starts to progress they will know where I was. \n\nIt might feel a little scary right now just having gotten the diagnosis, and it does kind of suck to have it, but overall, it is not too terrible. I hate that I cannot do some of the things I could when I was younger due to balance issues and my ankles being so unstable, but I am glad it is not something worse. And there are ways to accommodate. My husband knows I always need a hand walking down hills. That started maybe 5 years ago in my late 30s and has not gotten much worse in that time.  About age 10-12.  Though like never had that basic PE coordination like skipping, galloping, etc that you do in early PE Class.  \n\nNow I am 37.   Fairly severe now.  Both hands And feet.  I cannot walk without AFOs.   Many days my hands hurt.    Thank you very much! Your information has been so helpful.  Thank you very much for sharing  If you are on FB there are many groups.   There are also local support groups in the US.  ", "Upcoming CMT Conferences ", "What do you guys do for full body pain? I am 22 years old and have CMTx. My symptoms are not extreme yet or anything. I have footdrop, and I get fatigued easily, but I do not have to wear AFOs yet. \n\nWe are in the process of moving from Alabama to Florida, and I am dying. My whole body aches, my legs especially. It does not help that our stuff will not be there for a few days so we will be sleeping on an air matress. \n\nWhat do you guys do when literally everything hurts? I just need some kind of relief to get through this. Get AFOs. You will be much less fatigued. You will not hav to make so much effort to walk and your body and gait will be better aligned to reduce pain. If you have foot drop, why are you holding off? I agree with the above, get yourself some afos. Also, biofreeze is your best friend. I mean, sometimes you just have to endure it, I have Cmt as well.  My motor skills are shot, so I have to think of other ways of getting bottles open or jars. Sometimes I have to use my teeth for water bottles, is just the way it is Straightforward over the counter Ibuprofen 400 mg, should sort it out.  There is no need to go off the deep end with pain killers.\n\nPut a pillow under your lower legs and feet and lie on your bag to get to sleep or/ and just to relax and rest.  Rest is your friend.\n\nI did not have AFOs until mid 30's but walked very 'badly' for years, not quite sure why or how I did it now.  It is your call obviously, depends on how much you think you need them. Never told my fam, but I literally took a tooth out cause I could not open a bottle. 22 and lost a permanent tooth. Afos help, but there are \"over the counter\" afos for foot drop. I have had mine since I was 7ish, and before then I could not walk, was in constant pain, and just overall miserable. I would try those first, could help with fatigue and reduce pain. As for the body aches, pop a few alieve and nap. Helps with the achea, in my cause, or just resting a bit for a jump start. Icy hot helps, but the less the menthol, the better, could cause minor/major skin irritation. That sucks, I feel for you.  I usually use my back teeth I have footdrop, but it is not really bad enough for AFOs. I have discussed it with my neurologist once or twice, but we just are not quite there yet. I think in the next year or two we might be, but not quite yet.\n\nAlso AFOs take some time to get, so it will not really help my current moving situation. Yeah I definitely do not think I am bad enough for AFOs yet. To the naked eye I do not look like I have problems. I have had footdrop since I was little, but it only really affected me when I played soccer. \n\nOver the last year or two I have noticed I have started getting fatigued easier and my foot drop is more noticeable to me (but still not to others). I have spoken with my neurologist about it and we started using trileptal last year because I was getting these terrible leg cramps. The trileptal stopped the cramps and I felt normal again until the last few months. \n\nI discussed AFOs with my neurologist before. She said it was my call, but she felt that they were not necessary yet, and I agree. My legs and ankles are still pretty strong, they have just lost conditioning because I have not been doing much the last few months (Just graduated school and decided to quit my job and give myself a 3 month vacation before starting my masters program next month). \n\nMoving has just been a huge toll on my body. I have been taking ibuprofen and it definitely helps some. I should probably rest more and take more breaks though. You sound like you have got a good grip on it there.   Remember that some activities are just plain knackering, CMT or not. Very few people would be able to laugh off moving house and carry on regardless. Thanks for that. I think sometimes I get frustrated because I feel like it is just the CMT, but you are definitely right. A normal person would be pretty damn exhausted too. I do not have foot drop but just weakness and my AFOs are amazing. They have a strut that reacts to propel me forward. Honestly, neurologists do not know as much as the orthotists (the best ones) know. I just read this article today, which addresses all over muscle-skeletal pain.  I use CBS rub. Smoking high potent thc also helps me recover as I feel it rests the nerves for my muscles to relax. Not sure of this is for everyone with CMT as o have CMT 1A but it is worth a shot I would you have access to it. I also go to the gym every other day and try to wat as healthy as possible. Although I do cheat often not going to lie bahahahah. Pain with CMT has ultimately become my best friend you have to learn to almost enjoy it. Good luck and remember it is okay to reat when your body is screaming. Dont feel bad for it. Paracetamol works better for me than Ibuprofen, just thought I mention that. But of course the best is if you can avoid doing the things that cause pain in the first place, although I understand that it not always possible.", "Hate living with foot drop and AFOs, is there any way I can fix the problem? I have CMT and have a minor/moderate case of foot drop. I still have some control over my ankle and foot, but the muscles got weak to the point where I started walking odd to not trip. I use AFO braces to help me walk better, but I do not like using them. I hate having such a small selection of shoes and taking longer to put them on, and I do not like trying to put them over/under pants. Are there any exercises I could do to actually work my way out of drop foot? Is this even possible or is muscle atrophy too difficult to overcome? I use an ankle brace. Not the best but also not clunky. Exercise is a good way to maintain the muscle you still have, but you (probably) will lose muscle mass.  I am not a doctor though, just what I have been through. By ankle brace I mean the ones people use for sprained ankles that you can pick up at a drug store. I have not tried this but I see it often advertised in Quest magazine. \n\nCan you work with a physical therapist to try to strengthen those muscles?  Yeah I could. I think there is hope for me because it is not a full drop foot, but rather a weakness in the area where I walk better with the braces Ive used an ankel brace as well, pair that with a some high top shoes and it does a pretty good job. I have hated all my afo's they caused to much pain after a few hours, and the chaffing was unreal.  True, I used to wear work boots for that reason also. Lots of support in high tops and well any boot really. Now I usually wear really super light weight running shoes. Here is the fun/depressing part of CMT. We cannot stop the muscle loss, and once the muscle is gone it is gone. BUT we can strengthen the muscles we do have. \n\nCan you get a referral for physical therapy from your doctor? I saw a physical therapist years and years ago, and granted if i had kept up with the exercises I would be better off, but I did not. \n\nSome of the exercises they had me do were:\n\n* Write the alphabet with my big toe on each foot (in the air). Do this three times\n\n* Using resistance bands point and flex my foot, invert and evert my foot. This one is better to have a PT show you. \n\n* pick up up marbles with my toes. this one made me cry and I hated all the PTS for this one. I think this is one of those things that if it is not going to help it is absolutely not going to help. \n\n* Stretch my calves and achilles tendons. Also Hamstrings. It is super important that we all stretch every day. We get tighter muscles faster than average people. \n\nOther important things: \n\n* Try and build in as much walking as possible into your life. The more you use the easier it will get and it well help stabilize your muscles.\n\n* I have found that walking around in heavy boots all the times results in weaker ankles. I try and switch up the footwear so sometimes I have to use my ankles more. Basically variety of walking and shoes can give you different challenges. \n\n* I have not done this yet, but I think I need to. It may be time for trekking poles or a cane.   If muscle wastage is a big problem, have you talked to your doctor about anabolic steroids? For some arbitrary reason, they are used to treat a lot of muscle wasting diseases but do not seem to be used for CMT. I have the same problem.  I have not found any solution but I definitely feel the same way about wearing the AFOs. Traveling through airports is also a nightmare,  have to explain to security every single time", "Trying to understand what is going on... Hi my name is skyler and I was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy when I was a child, I went through a bunch of surgeries to try and combat it and when I was around 10 I was still able to walk, run, jump, swim, and all throughout high school I even played baseball. Around a year or 2 ago I started to notice numbness in my feet, at first I though it was from my type 1 diabetes so I did not pay it any mind. Time went by and the numbness spread, it started on the bottom of my feet ( big toe and balls of my feet) and it spread to my entire foot and up my legs, the numbness is also like a SUPER sensitive numb, if I step on anything small it hurts like nothing imaginable. My hands have also lost a lot of functionality, I have trouble getting dressed and can barley open bottles. My neurologist thinks it may be CMT. Is there anyone here that has a similar story to mines? &gt;Is there anyone here that has a similar story to mines?\n\nHonestly, we  probably all do because those are the typical symptoms of CMT. That does not mean you have CMT but it certainly is a hint that it could be (there is lots of other conditions that have the same symptoms)\n\nWhat are they doing now? Any kinds of tests? I have an EMG Monday but that is all as of right now. CMT and SMA both run in my family and my mom has CMT but it does not really affect her. If your mom has it then the odds are high that it is CMT. Hope it is not... :-) do you know if anyone in your family has cmt / experiences the same symptoms? None with the same as mine, every one else in my family with it experiences arthritis like symptoms do not till later on in age. My mom is 42 and she is just now starting to feel it.", "Bad days? So what do you do for those really bad pain days?  The ones worse than normal. I try to avoid my pain meds if I can because I have to take Tramadol. I would take my Tramadol. My doc and PTs have said it is not good to let the pain get that high Ya. I know. Lol. I was just hoping for some ideas bc Tramadol is a narcotic, so I do not want to take it to often. Before my AFOs, I was taking it daily and coming off it was hard Is that because of the blood pressure? I think there are a lot of reasons. Super high pain is harder to control than catching it before it gets that bad. The psychological effects of high pain for me are very hard to tolerate. If I feel like I wish I were dead, maybe it would have been better to just take a Tramadol when I needed it. Is what because of the blood pressure?

Is it abnormal to not be able to gain muscle in my forearms with CMT? How are your feet and calves?\n\nDo you have sensory loss in your forearms? Can you pass a sharp/dull test? My feet have very high arches and my calves are also very thin and desensitized. I am not sure what a sharp/dull test is though Depending on the severity of the neuropathy, it is difficult to \u201cadd\u201d muscle to impacted areas. When you begin noticing a decline, staying active and using those muscles can delay/slow that decline. I have CMT2A...have had no muscles in my calves for decades. Just beginning to demonstrate in my forearms/hands. Doctors have prescribed PT/OT to try and slow the process. Close your eyes and have someone else touch your arm with something sharp or dull and you see if you can tell the difference. I just turned 18 and my forearms have been getting smaller and smaller for about 3 years to the point that they are basically just skin around bone. Will do, what is the significance of the test? That is how my legs are. Feet have been reconstructed twice, almost no movement in toes, feet, or ankles. I can still walk, but I struggle with balance and stability. I am the same way, I have never had reconstruction though, I can only move my big toes and my ankles are getting worse. That is very common. The CMT neuropathy is length dependent, so the innervated muscles that are the furthest away (the extremities) are the first first to atrophy. So hands and feet first, then the forearms and lower legs, and so forth. When I am walking for instance, my tibialis anterior muscle (which is responsible for lifting the feet) is the first to get tired, and as a result I usually fall behind when hiking on flat terrain with non-CMT people. But in steep terrain where I get to use my hip and thigh muscles, I am usually able to keep up. As time goes by, my thigh muscles also weaken but because they are closer to the spinal cord they atrophy later in life. If it is any encouragement...my symptoms really started at puberty and I am 55 now. Lots of challenges and frustrations along the way, but there is still lots (of non-athletic) things I can do. \n\nRecently had both of my children go through genetic testing and they are \u201cin the clear!\u201d It is a sensory test to see how well your nerves are working. When I go the neurologist they always do this test. On my legs though. I do not have arm issues (yet). I have CMT and strength train. I have gained back muscle I thought was gone forever. Science told me no but I have seen it myself . I vary from heavy weights and low reps to lighter weights and high reps. Consistency wins the race ! I am 50 and only a small circle of family and friends knew about my disease until my middle son showed signs of terribly progressive disease and has had  massive corrective surgery of his feet. In telling his story mine came out . so yeah i just discorvered this subreddit and my hsmn typ 1 was already discovered when i was 3 years old, cause it took me very long to learn how to walk my mother took me to the doc. So back to your question i trained at home for one year and now im 4 years in gym right now, in those 5 years i made really some progress i mean not like you see  in some youtube videos, but i were all my life chubby and never had any problems in gaining weight, and i just started training and saw some results and till the day i love it.  i once had an appointment with doc, before i got in to the weight lifting game, who was a \u201especialist\u201c in hsmn, and he told me i should just loose weight and hope my hsmn wouldnt get worse, so less weight=muscle relieve. I really dont know if my training helps my hsmn, but it helps me to feel better, liking my body and changed my mindset even if it will not help stopping my hsmn i have the feeling im fighting against it.", "Found the pins they stuck in each toe for around 6-8 weeks when I had surgery to straighten out all my toes. What a year that was!  Do you miss the hammertoes? I have contemplated straightening mine out sometime in the future. Worth it? Goodness no. It has helped me out quite a bit, but I did lose basically all my calf muscles since I was laid up half of 2016. They did have to remove one of the permanent pins in one big toe because it was being pushed out of my toe(I could see the end of the screw through my skin), which was not pleasant and I do wear leg braces now because of losing muscle and just getting older. I would say it was worth it as long as you have someone to help and good enough insurance/job because each surgery put me out of work for about 10-12 weeks each time. Why the heck did you keep them?\nExtremely unpleasant having the pins removed; not at all pleased to recall that Haha. Memories man, memories. Honestly I was cleaning out my closet and found them. I had pins 10 years ago.....and again right now!  I am hoping they are removed tomorrow and that I can move into a boot. Excited &amp; dreading it at the same time. Yeah, I am afraid I will have to get it again around the 10 year mark as well. My doctor said they may curl up again and might have to get it done next decade or so. Only got permanent screws in my big toes(one removed in 2018, surgery was 2016). My Grandma had it done 3 times over her lifetime. Hope you have a speedy recovery! Honestly the stitches coming out was worse than them pulling out the pins, but them ripping out the pins is a sight to see haha. Did you do them one foot at a time? They do not really do pins any more. The last time I had hammer toes straightened they used an implant. I was off the couch in two weeks and back in sneakers soon after. \n\n Yes, otherwise I would not have been able to put any pressure at all on my feet and one at a time I could at least crutch around. Interesting, I did both of mine at the same time and was able to hobble around with crutches Yeah I think a lot of surgeries are different, but this was the best option for me and my doctor recommended it. It would have been a terrible 5-6 weeks if I would have got them both done at the same time, but it would be done. That is awesome you were able to put pressure on them after surgery, I could not for a month :(", "CMT and covid vaccine? Hi all, I just recently found out I have CMT type 2C, though I have very mild symptoms. \n\nI am looking forward to receiving a covid vaccine eventually, but was wondering if anyone has spoken to their doctors about any potential issues with the vaccine. Has anyone had this discussion with their docs?\n\nAs far as I understand so far, some medications can amplify CMT symptoms. Hopefully this is not the case with the covid vaccine. The CMTA has a pdf on the vaccines: ( though tbh I did not find it terribly informative. That is not their fault; it is just too new to have data yet that would verify a lack of problems with rare diseases.\n\nThat said, there is no reason to expect, theoretically, that the vaccine will cause any complications for people with CMT in general or any specific subtype. I plan to take it as soon as it is available to me.  \n\nThe vaccine works by showing a particular protein to your immune system and teaching it to fight that protein on sight. This allows your immune system to fight the virus with no hesitation when it is encountered in the wild, killing the virus off before it can get established and cause symptoms. It should not interact with the peripheral nervous system. Hello! You can refer to ( where this community discussed vaccines and CMT three months ago. Quick summary: there are no known complications with CMT and vaccines of any sort. There is a list of medications that are known (or even slightly suspected) to exacerbate CMT symptoms, which you can find ( but no vaccines are included. \n\nSo you can get vaccinated in peace! As a pharmacist, a fellow CMTer, and someone who has cleared it with my neurologist at a CMT center of excellence, this vaccine should be completely safe! I received my first dose over the weekend and have had zero issues. Good luck! The neurologist I see once a year and my primary care physician both signed off with an emphatic YES, the vaccine is safe and I should get it with no concerns over CMT complications. That thread is a bit of a roller coaster... Good read though, thanks! I am convinced there are no issues with the vaccine now! Direct experience! Love it. Hope you get your second one soon! Great resource! Thanks for the info. I am even more eagerly awaiting my turn in line then. Thanks! Glad to hear it!", "Ban Posts From JoeBob. Enough said. This has nothing to do with CMT like all of his posts on this sub Yeah he is an utter ass I sympathize but he has not actually posted over here in weeks, unless I have missed something. So I do not really have any reason to ban him at the moment. I am currently in an argument with him about the actual medical term for RLS.  Hint; it is not RLS and he is an idiot for saying it is\n\nThe disease is now called Willis-Ekbom Syndrome.  This is these easiest example to show he is full of shit The 3 simple rules made him unable to post anything. Charming. Let us see what you said to me:  \n\n\n\"you seem very fond of constant toxic positivity\"  \n\n\nYou never explained what toxic positivity is, but you and Rivers61 are demonstrating admirably why so many people are turned off from CMT communities due to constant negativity. If you want to just moan and feel sorry for yourself, do not be crabs in a bucket trying to bring everyone down with you. I mean I have been on NBC news as a disability rights specialist, you run a subreddit with 97 people. I wonder whose doing more for their community. You are still not addressing the elephant in the room:\nWhat is toxic positivity? \nAnd I am doing more than you will ever do - 5 minutes of fame hardly counts as a game changer, and you are certainly not doing any wonders for the image that CMT communities are places of despair and misery. Toxic positivity is the attitude of people like you. It is when people like you say that people who dare to spend time being sad about their situation are lost causes and should not be listened to, and that everyone should be super positive all the time, which inevitably causes more depression. I will be on my disability Instagram with 10 thousand followers posting about disability every day, doing everything I can for the disability community locally and worldwide while you make your guerilla protest cmt group which was set up literally to look down on people you claimed had a 'woe is me' attitude. No one ever said any of what you said above, but clearly the idea of trying to promote a community that helps people be positive or upbeat, especially for a condition that can cause depression, triggered you into an angry tailspin.\n\n10k followers. Phenomenal stuff. Sponsored yet? I imagine your Instagram account must be just terrific with your attitude. What was it you said? \"It is ridiculous and emotionally exhausting going home in physical pain everyday while having managers act like you do not do enough. If I could do more I sure as hell would not be taking these shit jobs.\" Inspiring. Are not you also 10 - 20 lbs overweight? Did not your doctor tell you that being overweight and CMT is a terrible mix? If you think your doing any good for the disabled community, think again because you are sending out a completely mixed and inappropriate message, which seems to be \"everything's awful, it is not my fault, blame the other guy\". Yes, CMT can be miserable to live with, but is not that more of a reason why we need communities to help lift each other up, not smash them down because you are having a bad day? I am disabled and I can say you in no way represent me or a lot of the disabled community; you are the opposite of the message that needs to be spread. My dude I do not know whose account you are talking about but none of those are things I have ever said? I literally have no idea what you are talking about, have never had a manager say that or seen a doc who has said that, and the only interaction we have had is you inviting me to your group and me saying no... My whole point is you started your subreddit while looking down on others. I dont post negatively with every single post, but I do post about the struggles people go through and relate to. Of course people on the cmt main sub are posting about stuff they struggle with. You must see the hypocrisy in saying 'we should lift each other up' when you literally put in a claim for your sub by looking down on the people who posted about their bad days. How could you possibly hope to build a sub with that attitude. Apologies, I confused you for Rivers61 (post now edited), the guy who decided a flamewar was a mature move. \n\n\"My whole point is you started your subreddit while looking down on others.\"\n\nThat is a blatant lie. What is wrong in trying to create an uplifting community after many people have complained about constant negativity from CMT communities? Re-read the rules - they do not say \"do not complain\", they say try to remain positive where you can. How have you mistaken that for some attempt at belittling others? It really is not - it is an attempt to encourage people to approach life with a glass half full attitude rather than the current \"the glass is smashed and life is shit\" mentality that so commonly occupies CMT communities. You claimed the sub by saying you did not like the 'woe is me' attitude. Anyway man, I promise you will not get far in the community shitting on people who post about their bad days in a moment of depression and telling people they need to be constantly positive. The only way to deal with disability is accept your limitations, allow yourself to be sad some days, and do what you can and be happy on days when you are not. I wish you the best, truly, but I do not have high hopes with your attitude, many like you have crashed and burned telling people not to dare to have a bad day. Good luck. A lot of people HATE the woe-is-me attitude of many CMT communities, both online and offline, something you seem to be ignoring. Again, re-read the rule - it is not saying to not complain and to put on a facade of positivity, but, when reasonable, try to steer to the \"glass half full\" way of thinking. Is that really such a bad thing to encourage? \n\nDo not worry, I am working with different CMT communities and charities so I am doing just fine. As for this place, I am certain it will never be more than just a subreddit that adds little to no value to people's lives, highlighted by the fact that the mods have not taken down deliberately trolling posts. \n\nThough as an olive branch, if you do feel you have something to contribute to the CMT community, drop me a line privately or at  I am always looking for people who can impart their experience of the disease to others and help people avoid pitfalls that so many of us experienced or things we were never told about our conditions. My only regret in deleting this thread is that it is going to eliminate your points on toxic positivity. It is extremely disappointing that I am having to write this and such a thread (two in fact) have not been correctly moderated: (\n\nThe short story is that this user posted on r/CMTHSMN deliberately in an inflammatory directly and unapologetically in breach of the subreddit rules. The user was then banned but proceeded to send me numerous insulting, profanity-laden messages, and was subsequently blocked. \n\nSeeing moderators engage with this post instead of correctly moderating it is a disgrace. Reddit have been informed and will take what actions are necessary to sort this out. Haha its all good. Apologies for arguing here. You are disappointing I want to put in that I agree with you on everything you have said.  \n\nNext ask him what RLS is called today so we can prove a point renaming diseases is bad for awareness.  He does not care about awareness though, he does not think it is great this sub finally has 1000 users, he wants to divide. Looking at your posts, I simply feel sorry for you. You are angry, alone and lashing out at strangers on the internet. If you need someone to talk to call the Samaritans branch in your area or 1 (800) 273-TALK. This is exactly the false positivity the other guy was talking about.  I actually have a perfectly fine social life and family thank you.  I do not take kindly to people like you who use double speak to appear correct.  You are not clever.\n\nI feel sorry for anyone who goes through others post histories; it is honestly sad you care that much about me rn haha\n\nEdit: I say exactly what I mean, you skirt around your meaning with false positivity You made not one or two, but three posts here about me and the subreddit I run. That is not normal, healthy behaviour, and your post history confirms you have an openly aggressive and condescending tone towards others. You need to address you antisocial behaviour or you will end up being banned from Reddit as a whole. You need to stop trying to act like a psychiatrist, it is disingenuous.  Anyway have a good one with looking through people's post histories.  I have things a need to do Honestly I am not going to take social advice from someone who clearly enjoys picking fights with strangers on the internet. And you think I should take yours?  Really If that is your only regret then you are utterly unfit to be a moderator and I have reported this as targeted harassment. I have not posted here in weeks and yet you clearly harbour an unprofessional resentment towards me as you are leaving these threads up. Well, you sure seem like you need help. Go phone the Samaritans, they will listen. No Sam, it is not good. This is targetted harassment and is a damn disgrace. You should all be appalled at your behaviour here. All I am advocating is a glass-half-full view within CMT communities and you have warped it horrendously.\n\n\"As an advocate, sometimes there is something the disability community is super angry about and I am not. I take a step back, I listen to those people, I do my research, and try and make an informed post explaining it.\"  \n\n\nPractice what you preach.

Complaining endlessly while being poorly educated on CMT and not willing to listen to research is damaging for everyone.", "Anybody Else Attending the Movement as Medicine Conference for CMT Patients?  This looks very interesting. I just might go. It would be interesting to read about how it was if anyone attends this. Looking beyond the fancy names for the various exercise types the program seems to focus on the traditional and workout recommendations for CMT, namely moderate resistance exercise and cardio on bike or in water. Yeah. Not sure I will learn anything new as I have been working out with trainers who specialize in muscle wasting disorders 3x per week. I have done water PT, gone to a CMTA seminar on stretching and have one Gyrokeneisis classes for a year. But to be in a room with other CMT patients and to get pumped about our health and working out sounds pretty cool to me. I am attending! I am so excited!", "CMT\u2019s effect on nerve regeneration I have some nerve damage that seems to have been caused by untreated high glucose from type 1 diabetes. This damage occurs to the axon endings as far as I know. CMT 1A affects the myelin sheath. I have seen that nerves can regenerate but very slowly if the damage source is removed, which can be done somewhat by reducing glucose levels. The question is would CMT somehow impede the regeneration rate of those nerves hit by the high glucose? Nerve regeneration is very hard to stimulate without powerful drugs. I have not come across a research paper as of yet that demonstrates it can occur naturally. Ordinarily, in healthy people, peripheral nerves can and do regrow. \n\nCMT complicates things because peripheral nerves do have a limited capacity for self-repair. In normal, healthy, non-CMT people this capacity begins to get exhausted by the time someone is in their late 60s IIRC. In people with CMT it tends to get exhausted earlier but there are a lot of unanswered questions on this topic.\n\nI will use myself as an example, not because it is a great example but because it is all the concrete data I have on this. Last year, I (in my mid-40s) had a questionable bump removed (it is fine) and in the process of surgical removal of this bump some nerves that innervate the skin above it were severed. This is normal, but I was left wondering if I would ever regain sensation in that spot. The surgeon assured me that I would but you know, he did not know anything about CMT so I figured he was just assuming. Six months or so later I did start to get some pins-and-needles sensations there when I touched the spot. Now, a year later, I definitely have sensation back though it is still sort of overly sensitive and odd. \n\nSo, n=1, anecdote not data, ect. But I can say it is not entirely impossible for someone with CMT to heal from a bit of peripheral nerve damage. Now surgically severed nerves are not the same as diabetic damage, but it is the best info I have. So I would be cautiously hopeful. My understanding is that the healing that I experienced was on the slow side of normal. \nHello! You have made the mistake of writing \"ect\" instead of \"etc.\"\n\n\"Ect\" is a common misspelling of \"etc,\" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase \"et cetera.\" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as \"et\" to \"and\" + \"cetera\" to \"the rest;\" a literal translation to \"and the rest\" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. \n\n(\n\n^(I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS to tell you to eat vegetables for a couple of weeks. Thanks, bot. This is not usually the kind of transposition error I am thinking about when I am writing about biology :) I agree that diet is critical for diabetes management. However, 99% of doctors give terrible advice to follow ADA guidelines and keep constantly elevated blood sugars with large swings. Even with 5.6 A1C, my nerves and blood flow react to the spikes. I am looking into Dr. Bernstein\u2019s high protein diet as a solution. At least for diabetic neuropathy, there are quite a few papers about improvement after ( Yeah it is expensive, but it is with personal guidance, he is an MD that cures many of his clients, most MD ask more and do not heal the sickness, they suppress symptoms, sometimes with lifelong use of meds.\nHe offers all info and video's for free for self-study. Here he speaks about diabetes  (did not watch it myself) Let me be clear here. \n\nYou cannot cure CMT with diet (or anything else, at this time). \n\nSimilarly, while diet is very important to the management of any type of diabetes, Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition with a strong genetic component which cannot be cured with diet (or anything else, at this time). One day maybe we know how to cure CMT with diet:  \n  \n  \n\nThe GAPS-diet base the claim on epigenetics and does claim that it may cure CMT. It is fair to say that most family doctors actually know surprisingly little about nutrition and I should have suggested a registered dietitian. I do not know anything about Dr. Bernstein's high protein diet, but I hope he (or she) does not charge you $3000 for it. It is almost certainly not true that we will ever be able to control CMT with diet (barring, perhaps, the discovery of a magic bean that happens to contain an as-yet-unknown wonder drug that we could eat). \n\nEpigenetics are interesting and could perhaps provide a pathway to modestly blunt the overexpression of PMP22 some day. However 1) that day is not today and 2) it is easy to understand this without any technical knowledge by following the money.\n\nIf someone could demonstrate that he could cure CMT (or diabetes, or any of these other diseases that presumably he alone has special knowledge of curing) he could gain a lot more money and prestige by following the proper channels to publish this information, revealing it to the scientific community and allowing the whole world to benefit from this knowledge. \n\nPublishing a scientific paper does not itself earn money but demonstrating actual evidence for even the smallest of his claims would earn him a great job somewhere, and his name would live forever in the medical literature. Ultimately, the benefits of going this route are many and the benefits of hoarding this knowledge and releasing it over the internet to individuals who are willing to hand over $3000 pale in comparison, no matter what your personal or professional goals are. Nah, his book is $25 and his website and YouTube are free. The diet is not that hard to understand. Reducing carbs to minimum reduces injections, prevents hypos, flattens blood sugar, and reduces/reverts damage. Anyone with peripheral neuropathy could see improvements from cutting carbs. Glucose variability is a known cause of nerve damage, especially exposed nerves. The issue is that is polyneuropathy which is not the same neuropathy found in CMT. CMT will result in fatty atrophy and that is full on nerve death. That has not been cured. I am posting a second reply in regards to your edit about the GAPS diet and CMT. \n\nA few minutes on google has failed to turn up this claim for \"curing\" CMT so I am not sure if this is supposed to be specific to any one type or just all of them because it is magic. \n\nAlso google suggested that rather than looking for \"gaps diet cmt\" perhaps I meant \"gaps diet scam\" which is usually not a good sign.\n\nI did not directly address your previous mentions of diet being a cure (rather than treating the symptoms) but even as a fundamental concept epigenetics modifiable by diet cannot cure CMT. \n\nThe only thing that could cure CMT type 1A, for instance, would be to modify a person's genome to remove or at least permanently silence the third copy of the PMP22 gene. \n\nIf changing your eating habits can alter the gene expression, that is not a cure, it is a treatment. Presumably the benefit would not continue if you abandoned the special diet. \n\nAlso, I reiterate, there is no evidence for this at all. And if anyone had evidence, they would share it because they would make more money that way and also the scientific community would respect them and many more people could benefit from what they had discovered. This makes a lot more sense than your first comment. However, OP has two different types of damage. The diabetic damage to nerves that CMT has not yet damaged too badly is potentially reversible. The CMT damage is not. &gt; I have not come across a research paper as of yet that demonstrates it can occur naturally.\n\nPeripheral nervous system regeneration does occur naturally, it is a well documented phenomenon and an active area of research. \nHere is one relevant paper: (\n\nIn CMT, the body constantly tries to repair Schwann cell and/or axonal damage and the result is a constant process of demyelination/remyelination and/or axonal repair with some dysmyelination happening in some cases. These innate compensatory responses to the CMT induced damage is likely one reason why most CMT progresses slowly. Animal studies on demyelinating forms of CMT have shown that when the deleterious effect of CMT is removed, these repair mechanisms are able to fully restore the myelin sheet to normal working order in a relatively short time, and following this restoration of the myelin sheath some limited axonal repair also happens in some cases. This is why many believe that simply normalizing PMP22 levels in CMT1A could be enough to rescue the 1A phenotype in individuals with demyelination and mild to moderate axonal damage.\n\nTeased fibers studies using human biopsies have provided compelling empirical evidence for demyelination/remyelination happening extensively in the PNS in CMT patients, and especially in the last two decades there have been a lot of very interesting studies that propose mechanisms for how this complex process actually unfolds as CMT progresses over time. &gt; The issue is that is polyneuropathy which is not the same neuropathy found in CMT. \n\nA polyneuropathy is a disorder that involves damage to multiple peripheral nerve fibers. Most forms of CMT are by definition polyneuropathies. The only thing those two articles have in common is the word \"Epigenetic\". There is nothing in the article by Yamaguchi et al. that supports a claim that a specific diet could cure CMT.\n\nThere is reason to believe that some compounds found in food could potentially be beneficial for some forms of CMT, but so far no such compound have been proposed and then been proven to work. The most famous example was the ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) trials for 1A which sadly did not work.", "Am i understating my condition? Hi\n\nIm a 25 year old guy with CMT. Most common variation.   \nI got diagnosed two years ago but found out fra my mother a couple of years before that. She is got it too.\n\nI have lived a completely normal life, i maybe just fell a bit more than my friends when i was drunk as hell on the way home with a pizza slice \ud83d\ude0aOther than that it has not affected me in my general life. I do not wear any equipment and probably have shitty shoes for CMT (Adidas Ultraboost or Nike Free) and I live the same life af my friends - just a more wobbly version, and one where I look a bit more down when walking og get used to falling every once in a while, especially if i hike and get tired.  \nYou can spot it easily. The best image for this is both times I visited Africa, kenyans og tanzanians who whom i did not know would ask me if i hurt my foot. I would just reply \"no i am ok\" but it is definately noticable. Some of my friends have never asked med about it, almost never even noticed. Some have. \n\nOkay, but back to the point. I kind of got shocked when I found this sub. Never been here before, and even though everbody here are so sweet and helpful, I cannot help but get scared.  Is this what is going to happen to me? Sometimes people sound like they have lost hope, and I do not want to lose hope.\n\nI feel like I have chosed not to let the CMT define me. And you can do pregnancy planning and stuff to prevent it \"spreading\". But seriously - am I understating my condition? Should I start doing specific this to help me in the long run?\n\nBest regards  \n\n\nAnd by the way, I am very sorry if your condition is worse than mine and you think i sound spoiled. This is not my intention, i am just trying to learn how to cope with it from my perspective. Do not let it put you in a box. No reason for you not to live a full happy fulfilling life Not to scare you but around 25 is when mine took off. Cannot play the cello anymore, quickly picked up some AFO\u2019s... basically it affects every aspect of my life now; everyone is different though. Wish you the best. Best bet is to try and stay on top of things - get to a gym and start making sure muscle atrophy does not start causing issues. While there is nothing that can be done about nerve sensitivity, you can definitely fight atrophy if your muscles are in an okay condition today. If you let them deteriorate, then it is much harder, and even impossible, to come back from that point. I am 40 now but felt the same way at 25. I have 1a. For me progression has been veerrryyy slow. I still do not wear AFOs but currently am having a helluva time finding shoes and am thinking it is time for custom orthotics at the very least. I have always been pretty active and health conscious. Never been overweight. CMT varies a lot from person to person but each individual's case is predictable. It is characteristic of this disease that it progresses slowly, though inevitably. \n\nFor instance, it is hard to predict how much having CMT impairs, say, a 45 year old man's life if we know nothing else besides age and \"having CMT\". However, it is entirely possible to make a solid guess at how much impairment a 45 year old has if we know how impaired he was at 25. Since you are still walking OK without any assistance I would venture a guess that you have a somewhat mild case and will still be walking at 45, assuming the usual lack of accidents and that you continue to stay active. Maybe you will need AFOs by then, maybe not. But you are unlikely to need a wheelchair. A doctor knowledgeable in CMT could examine you and give you better advice on what to expect and I will throw in my usual suggestion that you consider seeing a physical therapist who specializes in neurological disorders to learn some simple exercises to maintain your muscles.   \n\nAs a more concrete example of the differences in disease progression: my grandmother with CMT did not use so much as a walker until she was 90; my sibling was using a wheelchair at 30. Huge variation in my family. However, there were definite signs of differences from a young age about how different people were going to develop. \n\nAs for shoes, whatever is comfortable on your feet is great. Some of us have difficult feet to fit. My own are a fairly common shape for a CMT'er I think: high arches, wide forefoot though somewhat narrow heel. I do not wear AFOs so I do not have to shop for shoes compatible with them. I use an alternative lacing for people with high arches (you can google this) and I wear mostly Keens. \n\nDo not be afraid but do be smart about it. If you start struggling get professional advice on what you can do to stay as strong and healthy as possible. Try to do the usual things to stay active and fit. In my family, CMT progresses very slowly. My father is over 60 and still has no major problems. I am in the same boat as you, I am 22 with a rather mild case and hoping it will not get much worse.\n\nOn a sidenote, I used to use some basic sneakers back in school and always had trouble walking long distances (like 10km+). These problems basically disappeared ever since I started wearing Ultraboosts ;) CMT affects everyone differently. I was diagnosed at age five and given braces to wear. I never let it define me and you should not either. Stay active, exercise, get an education, stay positive and live your life.  My twenties were a blast. I failed myself by putting on weight in my thirties and becoming less active which put me in a scooter by the time I was 42. I am now full time in a power wheelchair because I failed to exercise and stay active. It varies dramatically in severity even within families. I cannot really comment on 1A (what I assume you mean you have) as my type is 2N. Mine is pretty mild and does not limit my life very much at this point (I am 38). So it is impossible to really say how bad yours will get without more specific information. You are probably not understating it for now. Mine has plateaued without major progression for many years now, so it just depends. Others said it, but staying as active and fit as possible while you can definitely can slow the loss of functionality even if it cannot stop the disease.\n\nI wear AFOs but I also do things like walk a lot when on vacation (on my trip to Seattle last year I walked over 40 miles in a week exploring the city). So it does not have to limit you very much. The only major thing I have mostly lost the ability to do is downhill skiing, which I am sad about, but it is what it is. More typical life activities are not as big a problem for me. And as for skiing I can still participate in adaptive skiing (and I am working on building up muscle through weight lifting to see if I can regain a bit more stamina and function for skiing, as the endurance is the largest problem I face with it). For some CMT puts you in a wheelchair at 15 and for others they have no clue that have it until their 70. It just varies from person to person. My Mom did not know until around 50. I knew when I was 11 and had two surgeries in my teens and have a tough time in my legs. It just depends on the person. Even with your type it may not matter as in the case with my family. for some it is severe, for others it is minor. Sure is great that you have had it so easy. I hope it stays that way. It is an incredibly unpredictable disease with wildly different symptoms even within the same family.\nA lot of people who have a hard time have the harder aspects of CMT. Autonomic Neuropathy is the worst part for me and makes me want to die. I do not care about the pain or dysfunction. Not being able to regulate my blood pressure, blood volume, breathing, temperature, hydration, pupil dilation, blood sugar, etc is debilitating, horrible, and crippling. Some people get off easy and have zero signs of this, including my dad, who I got my CMT from. But his mother had the same issues with her CMT and the phrenic nerve neuropathy caused her early death. I would highly recommend calling MDA and finding out information about visiting a clinic near you. I go annually and have almost my whole life. I am like you, it is barely affected me until about a year ago (I am 29 now) and the last two years have been the hardest for me to come to terms with what I am facing, I think mostly because of seeing how my dad is in his 60s. \n\nBUT, being able to speak with multiple resources, including Drs, that specialize working with folks who have CMT and MD in general can really help prepare you for what you can expect in the future and how to deal with things as they come. However, do not let them force you into something you are not ready for. I went to the Wichita KS clinic most of my childhood, then to the KC clinic when I moved here, and the KC Drs were very quick to suggest AFO braces although I know I do not need them.\n\nAlso keep using the communities available to you, like this one. Feel free to PM me any time with questions or whatever, I have a more mild version but was diagnosed when I was 5 so it is nothing new to me at this point.\n\nMost importantly, be grateful for the abilities you do have and do not let the future get you down. Live every day like it is your last. Hello, \n\nI am very much in the same boat as you, mid 20s. I live as normal as I can with friends and do normal stuff. Of course i am somewhat limited in sports activites and longer hikes which sucks sometimes but mostly I dont really mind.\n\nDaily life challenges is my walking is not perfect which can be frustrating in the dating scene and professional work life. However my friends are used to it. My balance sucks, and whenever going offroad i have to really look down to see where my steps are, also fell alot when i was a kid. I notice my endurance for alot of activities is also very poor, however I am not using the Gym which I should. \n\nCMT has given me scoliosis and pes cavus on my feet. Otherwise I notice my wrists and bottom of my legs are a bit on the thin side. \n\nHope this was useful, feel free to ask me any questions. I have 1a, as well, and like others-it varies. Now that I am almost 40, my symptoms are starting to be more pronounced. My hands are starting to be affected and I have a lot of issues with my feet I did not have before. I am still holding on my my chucks and sandals and do not have to use an AFO, but it is probably getting there soon enough. \n\nI will say that I watched my mom let it define her and feel her lack of doing anything is why she struggles so much now. Not to say she would not have issues-but you have to keep moving in some way, if you can. I work a physical job still and have lost weight and it does help. I am better off than my sister. But i can still feel it and it is scary sometimes. Mine started showing around puberty. \n\nHad to stop playing sports in high school. Lots of ankle rolling, high arches, hammer toes\n\nBroken ankle in college playing intramural sports led to my diagnosis and first set of reconstructions. \n\nMuscles knee &amp; below really showed atrophy college and after...I was still getting around, but limited in athletics, stamina, and by terrain. \n\nI am still able to walk, but have had 3 sets of reconstructions 1983, 2009, &amp; right now. \n\nMy lower legs are almost skeletal in appearance (I rarely wear shorts). Hoping to be able to wear AFO\u2019s without much pain when I finish this recovery. \n\nI have CMT2A, both my kids results came back negative (praise God). \n\nStarting to show in my forearms &amp; hands (weakening)...I am 55 years old. Sometimes it is hard, still doing my best to live life. \n\nCMT does not demonstrate the same with everyone and it works on its own timing. Get tested &amp; get familiar with what you are facing. Hope that is encouraging. You do not sound spoiled, but beware of ableist language. I do not think people lose hope, I think eventually you accept you have a disability and there is just stuff you cannot do or have to do differently. I also am not a fan of 'I do not let it define me'. Like it absolutely defines me, I am disabled and I am not ashamed, and pretending I am not will do more damage, mentally and physically, than just accepting it. I am in a wheelchair and it gives me freedom y'know. It sucks sometimes, but there is no changing it. Good point. And I think that is exactly my point: I might not have realized the disability this will cause me down the line. And you right about the \u201cdefine\u201d line - it is just that I cannot relate and get kind of sad that I might be going have severe problems. Hope you can feel me, and sorry if my language was not well thought through. I am new to this. No need to apologise man, we are all learning. I actually run an account where I post about this stuff every day so I get it :) it is not guaranteed to get worse. As others have said, there are folks with cmt who run marathons, and folks like me who can walk but use a wheelchair to restrict pain and further worsening, and folks worse off than me. Going to the gym is a good shout, I used to go and it definitely helped prolong things. If you have any questions do not hesitate to DM me :) It is not necessarily what will happen. I try to remember that people mostly post about the negative things happening. People who feel the desire to post that they managed a massive hike tend to already be in a relatively bad shape, such that it feels like a big achievement. If you are healthy enough to do it every few weeks, you will not see the relevance of sharing it here. It is only if you do it \\*despite\\* CMT.   \n\n\nKeeping active and generally on your fitness will not hurt your chances. Particularly flexibility in the extremities as I believe tightening down there leads to worse foot problems, and it all escalates from there. I am in a similar boat as you, some people have it worse and I am just not one of them. It is important to be aware of what could happen but otherwise keep moving forward and never give up. I always try to live the life I want to live and not the one CMT could box me in to. Early 30s, CMT 2, and I am a trail ultrarunner. \n\nI definitely have some numbness and I need more sleep than other people my age to feel well rested, but that is about it. I kind of feel like I will just deal with things as they happen rather than worry about something that might not even be an issue. I mean other than staying healthy and active, there is not anything you *can* do, so go live your life! You sound like a really lovely person considering those worse off than you. We all experience different downsides. I am similar to you in the sense my disability is virtually invisible to most. This in itself can bring challenges. When I was younger I had a wheelchair and so people understood my challenges. As a grown up people presume I am healthy unless they see me   trying to do things others find easy. I am often deemed lazy which can be upsetting. But my ego will often prefer this than admit I need help. The unknown element of CMT is hardest. I think it is easy to get wrapped up in the negative stories and feel suicidal. But I try to remember that while things may get worse, even healthy people can be diagnosed with something even worse than we have overnight. We cannot control what is going to happen so it is best to just take each day as it comes but with the knowledge of what we can do to keep ourselves as healthy as we can. Skechers memory foam shoes are also marvellous. Hey there, thanks a lot for the reply. I just have to say: please do not feel suicidal because of a physical health condition. You are bright and smart and can do (almost) whatever you want. My best friend works with mentally handicapped people, and I praise the lord to \u201conly\u201d have my feet being wierd. How people look at you means nothing. You know those of your friends that never even have asked you why you walk a little wired? Find yourself more friend like that, because how you walk means so little to your whole personality. Hope this makes sense! Not sure if you care but I tried a pair of Skechers Hyper Burst sneakers today following your suggestion and I can confirm that these are very comfortable as well! I still prefer the Ultraboosts style-wise but the Skechers will make for a great backup pair. Hey, I do care- thanks for the follow up. Glad you took a look. I had not considered ultrabloosts so thanks for the heads up on those. Always good to share tips ^.^", "Challenges of living with CMT. ", "Poll: swollen feet and/or ankles These past few months I have started having problems with swelling in my left foot when I am sitting in front of my computer. Coincidentally I have also been working from home these past few months due to the COVID-19 outbreak, so I have been sitting in a different chair than I normally do. I am wondering if this swelling is due to pressure from the seat in the chair I am using or if it is a symptom that just happened to occur now due to the CMT progressing.\n\nLast month Reddit got a new ( and in order to test it out I figured this could be a good opportunity to ask the CMT community here on Reddit about swollen feet and ankles. So I would like to ask if any of you experience swollen feet and ankles and if so how did it start and have you found a way to alleviate it? \n\nGoing for a walk reduce all the swelling for me temporarily, however it comes back pretty soon when I sit down in my chair again. I have added a poll with some simple questions about CMT and swollen feet and ankles that can be used in addition to the comment section. Please let me know what you guys think about using polls like these on /r/cmt. \n\n( I have never had a problem with this, however my mother, who also has CMT, has had problems with this for years. I think it is a problem with poor circulation and/or water retention. I suspect, although I do not know with certainty, that CMT has impacted the muscles that would normally help circulation in the legs and this is causing fluid to build up. Since your problem eases when walking, I would tentatively speculate that you are tensing some muscles which help move the fluid out of your lower legs or otherwise encouraging circulation. \n\nI believe my mother got some sort of diuretic pill to help her retain less water and I know her doctor told her to put her feet up (feet/legs level with or above her heart) a lot, to help the fluid reach her kidneys and thus be expelled. If you are having swelling that increases during the day perhaps taking some time to lay down or sit in a recliner where you can have your feet up for a bit mid-day might help. \n\nOf course, I am not a doctor, you should talk to a doctor, ect. I know it is difficult to do these days but perhaps a telemedicine consultation might be useful if this continues to be a problem. I didnt know people didnt have this issue. I have cmt and my left ankle has been swollen to some extent for the last decade Thanks for the insight, I appreciate it. My mother nor anyone else affected with CMT in my family have had issues with this as far as I know. And I am pretty young (or so I would like to believe, early 30s) with overall pretty mild symptoms so it seems a bit atypical to me for this to be caused by the CMT.\nHowever from what I can tell it does seem to be a somewhat common problem for many people with CMT, and the explanation that is proposed is that reduced muscle strength in the calves combined with a sedentary lifestyle cause less venous blood and lymphatic fluids to be pumped back up from the feet. CMT is usually symmetric though and I have no issues in my right foot, so that seems a bit odd to me. I have also started having some pain in my Achilles tendon in my left foot when I stretch it after a period of inactivity, and I also have started to get also acute pain and fatigue in my peroneus longus muscle when walking, which always resolves it self with a short period of rest. I dismissed the Achilles pain as being due to less movement throughout the day in these times of COVID-19, especially because I have had minor achilles tendon contracture since birth without experiencing any symptoms, but I am starting to wonder if it is all connected somehow.\n\nI plan on having a chat about it with my GP soon and also bring it up on my next neuro visit but I figured it would be very useful to also see what other people from the CMT community has to say about it. As luck would have it I will also be going back to work soon so I can see if it persists in my old desk chair (which I have been using with no edema-issues for many years). And to top it off I have a consultation with an orthopedician for new insoles very soon, so plenty of opportunities to bring it up. I have talked with several non-CMT people who have struggled or are struggling with the same and it seems like it is not always easy to get a fixed diagnosis. Usually they seem to just get told to try compression socks and elevate their feet or they get put on diuretics with no differential diagnosis being done apart from ruling out clots and heart problems from the history taken during the consultation. I am sorry to hear that, but it is also interesting that it only happens to your left ankle. Have you gotten any explanation for what is causing it? Does walking help reduce the swelling for you? My ankles are pretty much always swollen but I assumed it was due to all the surgeries I have had From what doctors have told and what research ive found it seems like cmt1a can affect one limb, particularly one leg, more than the others. The swelling is mostly due to frequent sprains on that ankle. It never fully goes down though. I wear a compression sock and have tried those copper socks to help with circulation. Move it or lose it is what they say right? The Nerve Conduction Velocity being symmetrically reduced is definitely a hallmark of CMT. Like anyone else we can have asymmetric muscle development, to a greater or lesser degree, depending on how much we favor our dominant side or otherwise use our muscles asymmetrically. So it could be that this has shown up on your left side first but may eventually happen to your right side as well--though hopefully you can find some methods to fend that off. \n\nSince you mention blood clots, which I had not thought of, I will also add that if there is a chance you might have been exposed to Covid-19 blood clots are associated with that illness. \n\nGood luck with your change in chairs and if you find out anything useful I would encourage you to post a followup, as it sounds like there are a number of others dealing with this issue and they might be interested to know if your old chair helps, or stretching more, compression socks, ect. offer you relief. My girlfriends neurologist said pressure is bad for CMT, at least for her. Any experience with this? i have not had much negative experience with pressure unless i am wearing a brace or something like that for prolonged periods of time I only have swelling in one ankle and that is also due to frequent sprains. But I do not get swollen feet however my mother has CMT and has problems with her feet and ankles swelling. Ahh, okay, cause she was told little to no pressure, for pain relief, swelling reduction, etc. I give her massages, which she likes, just hard to tell if they are actually helping.

Thankyou for sharing it :)", "Gene replacement therapy in a model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 4C neuropathy ", " On My Nerves - Small Irritations  Weekly thread for the little CMT things bugging you this week. I do not know if this is a small thing but lately I am feeling alone. I have HNPP and there is barely anything about it out there. Most things cover CMT but its like I have something very similiar but not at the same time and it feels lonely. I got it from my dad and he is really the only person I know in real life even. It feels awkward to talk to him about it as his symptoms are much more mild than mine. I think its also so frustrating to not have much info about HNPP out there. I do not know sorry for complaining. Yeah, having a rare disease can be really lonely and frustrating sometimes. I have 1A so it is the most common of the CMT types but still practically no one has ever heard of it. The ones that are even less common than mine, it is definitely frustrating that there is not better information and resources for them. I have been tested for one gene common with cmt and I did not have that gene do I will have to do more gene testing to figure out which one I have exactly. My neurologist agrees I have cmt with the deformity in my feet and ankles but still cannot find out what type. Has anyone had this same issue? And what did you do? Tia It really depends on what tests are available these days and in your area. Last I heard, it was easier here to test for multiple genes at once than to test for just one because that is how the most common test was set up. That must have been 5 or 6 years ago. Your doctor should know (or maybe not know but be able to look up) what tests to order. My irritation this week came from a letter i recieved from my health insurance company stating they will not cover the cost of the Genetic testing I just had. So im stressed about how much it will cost cuz I have nonidea the prive range or if the company that does the testing allows payments or whatever. Other than that the next biggest irritation I had it was difficult to open a soda bottle it ws like i just couldnt get a grip to turn the cap. A few minutes later i was able to do that is a plus. I hope everyone has a great day. Insurance companies are confusing and awful. \n\nI am resigned to handing soda/water bottles to the nearest person who is not me to open.

Hey all,\n\nI have CMT1A, got diagnosed in 2018, got really depressed and stopped exercising (I used to go jogging, which is too unpleasant now). Started back up again with a personal trainer in January and have continued doing exercise at home. My CMT is still mild enough that I am able to (I am 29). I remember at my neurology appointment being told something about how my muscles take longer to recover from exercise because of the CMT, and I was wondering if anyone has tried any of the after-exercise powders or found them helpful? I also take lecithin and COQ-10, but I have no idea if any of this stuff helps me at all, really. Who knows if any of this stuff really helps or if we are just wasting our money, but my nutritionist recommended glutamine for recovery. The only thing that meaningfully increases muscle repair are anabolic steroids or other performance enhancing drugs - EAAs, glutamine etc make no noticeable impact. However, if you want to improve your energy after a workout, a fast digesting carb like maltodextrin will help. I have made several posts here before.  If you are CMT1A you should be on anabolic steroids.\n\nIf you are a woman, you should be on 10mg of oxandrolone per day and try doing 5mg mornings and 5 mg at night due to its short metabolic half life.  Hell, I would try to add some nandrolone phenylpropianate (NPP) as well.\n\nIf you are a man, you will need to start exogenous testosterone injections because oxandrolone will signal reduced testosterone needs chemically in your bofy.  You should probably be on much higher doses of oxandrolone and maybe even higher doses of testosterone too. To maintain fertility if you actually want to risk passing this shitty mutation to a new generation, you will also want to be prescribed HCG which you will inject probably weekly.\n\nOxandrolone has shown evidence of reinnervation as well as muscle type grouping.\n\nIt is basically the only viable treatment for cmt1a so far. i can recommend creatine. I take 5 gram of it in my post workout shake. It doesnt help with ur recovery, but you can find some studies where it shows that it increases ur strength even if it is not much. And its not very expensive. Yes. I keep telling people this and I do not understand why so many fear anabolic steroids. They are proven extremely safe and effective treating both muscle wasting and causing reinnervation.  They should be the front line treatment for CMT1A Not bashing creatine.  Its great! But CMT1A is a degenerative disease.  Creatine will not treat it and it will not help with nerve growth/repair in any way.  Jump on anabolic steroids and stop dicking around with things that will not last. How do you get steroids? I have 1A how can I get steroids? The best answer is talk to your doctor.\n\nDepends on your country.  In the USA, you must be prescribed them by a licensed practitioner.  They are what is called a Schedule 3 drug and possession without a prescription in the USA is a felony.   Doctors are given reports about every time a prescription is filled for it as well.  Man, very similar. It was like the day I found out was the last time I went to gym. I think if I get less depressed, enough so that I can exercise, I will be very interested in anabolic steroids. How do you get these legally? Like what type of health provider? Think I will definitely talk to my gp or a specialist about anabolic steroids I am so curious about this! I only heard about steroids recently as an option. Honestly, I was so relieved to discover this board existed. I have not been to a doctor since getting diagnosed by a not-very-helpful neurologist two years ago who basically told me there was no research in development and scooted me out of his office, then I did some research on my own and discovered a bunch of things that are in some stage of clinical trials... but I have felt very on my own with trying to figure out what to do. I have an appointment later this month with a CMT Center for Excellence in upstate NY, so maybe I can ask about them then. I think knowing for me at least created a big mental barrier of just feeling like, oh, I cannot do anything anymore, which lasted a while... When I started working with a personal trainer again, there are also things I was too worried about doing, like anything with upper body training where I am supposed to be relying on my hand grip to hold myself up, I was really afraid I would not be able to and would fall backwards. I am not sure if that is a mental block or an actual reality for me as of right now. It was really a relief to discover there are still things I can do, though. That is pretty much my thought process. I think what I have is similar, it is an amino acid mix. I unfortunately got kidney stones from creatine.  I will admit I did like the results when 1st taking it. After only 1 month - I put on 7 pounds of muscle.\n\nNote: from what I have read Creatine can add water weight to muscles - so I am not sure exactly how much muscle it builds, but I did look bigger.\n\nBut as I mentioned..., about a year after taking Creative I passed my 1st kidney stone.\n\nOnce I stopped taking creatine, my kidney stones stopped. I believe they now have a warning label on creatine products that mention possible kidney problems. Yeah, for me I was going to the gym a lot, but was not able to keep on muscle even though I was getting stronger. And was like, well what is the point if my muscle just going to waste away anyway? So yeah, mostly mental for sure because I should be exercising even more logically. My only additional thoughts to that is just running a test cycle may be safer and just as effective as there is less side effects and more research. \n\nThat being said, I would also have to recommend SARMs as they are not quite as potent as AAS but have less side effects and are easy and legal to get if you know the right places in order to avoid fake products. With CMT1A you have valid reasons for scripts.  Do not dick around with non pharma grade materials Yeah :/ It definitely makes it harder to get motivated. *in the USA. In the UK ive been told by the leading professor on CMT that \"steroids are dangerous\" and that under no circumstance will they be given out \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f you are completely right and it is true that for muscle wasting diseases AAS' are literally the drug designed to combat such an issue but they have such an unfounded bad reputation that now clouds a lot of medical judgement around them. This is why for me the safest option is to go for SARMs from a supplier that has everything third party checked for proof of purity. This is why I recommend doctor shopping.  Many doctors buy into the \"steroids are bad\" bullshit because they were told that for years and then refused to read and understand their valid use cases.\n\nNot bashing SARMs.  They are just not well studied in regards to innervation or have a proven track record of over half a century.\n\nOxandrolone has been shown to have incredible results with a CMT1A patient and dramatically improved their nerve conduction velocity and walkability scores.\n\nWhich SARMs are you recommending for patients who cannot acquire steroids like oxandrolone?  Have you seen any studies showing evaluation with CMT1A patients of those with similar axonal damage? Unfortunately in the UK steroids have to be approved for specific conditions and CMT does not qualify, even though that makes no sense and certainly is not based on any research. \n\nYou are completely right; steroids have decades of actual testing and countless amounts of anecdotal evidence making them a safe bet if you can get them safely and dosed correctly by a doctor who knows what they are doing, but from my experience, a lot of doctors do not know what they are doing...\n\nNandrolone has also shown to have great results in CMT patients, improving muscle mass and neurological functions, which makes me wonder if the Nandrolone derivatives would be useful.\n\nFor SARMs, I have tried RAD-140, LGD-4033 and MK-2866. Personally I found RAD too strong. Being a synthetic testosterone it was causing me major side effects such as insomnia and hot flushes, although was amazing for stamina, even after being sleep deprived for a week. MK-2866 I find good for a recomp or cutting, being able to pack on muscle relatively quickly but honestly LGD smashes them all out of the water. Being \\~3.5x more anabolic than MK-2866, it is not a surprise that I was able to pack on 3-4kg of muscle in 8 weeks while on it, and that is in the circumstance that usually I find it impossible to gain muscle even when eating a correct diet with a correct workout program. \n\nWhile there have not been any neurological tests with SARMs, I may have results in the coming weeks that could shed light on this.

I hope you get some good advice on workouts and absolutely smash every race. X I am a high school swimmer with an s8 classification. I really recommend doing dry land workout between sets, like abs and stretching. I have found it is really helped me get stronger and faster.

For those of you who have to wear AFOs for your day to day, do you remember what your experience was like the first week or two you had them? Was the adjustment period painful? It was just different. I had to go in a couple times and get the adjusted (add padding, stretch some parts) but it was not really painful, if it is you should get them changed up. Hell no! It felt amazing walking normally again. No painful adjustment at all, just make sure you get one that fits *you*. Thanks for insight. I literally just got my afos today and am just having some pretty bad pain on the bottom outside of my left foot - the right brace has been fine. I will give it a few days since this is only day 1 :) If it gets redness or sensitive make sure to go in and get them adjusted. I got blisters once and it really sucked. Also, every time you get a new pair always make sure the schedule a follow up even if  you think you will not need one I had a little bit of pain from foot not sitting correctly. Luckily was able to get a follow up rather quickly and had more padding added to below the arch on the outside edge of my foot. I am good to go now. I went from not being able to leave my yard walking to walking 1 mile around a track. (On a good day lol) My daughter has been wearing afos for a while now (say from like 10 to 16 yrs old).  There is always a bit of a trial period.  They have been custom fit  but after a week or so there may be issues, usually the ppl that made them will do adjustments for free.  Sometimes I am mcgyver and fix them myself.   Even if they are good, if she takes a break from them\u2014like schools cancelled for Covid-19 and she does not have to do major walking, she is not wearing them around the house and if we are doing something that we know will require a lot of walking she might have an issue just because of not using them for a while.   \n\nSo yeah there is some uncomfortableness but usually the beginning period highlights the issues that need some adjustment, and you just them till it works for ya. I am 23 and have worn AFOs since I was 6. The first week and sometimes month are brutal on my feet. I always end up needing padding in the same spots, and sometimes more, so I have to be honest with my orthotist or I am in pain.

If I remember right he quit his job to become a yoga instructor because of this. My symptoms are starting to progress and I have been wanting to do something beyond just weight lifting and I started thinking about this blog again (which I cannot seem to find anymore).\n\nI guess it is that time of the year to start thinking about exercise routines. So, does anybody have suggestions on how to get started with Yoga? In an ideal world, I would love to go to a class where the instructor specifically knows about CMT, that seems unlikely though... maybe there are some videos out there? How has your symptoms progressed? I have just been experiencing slightly more weakness in my legs than before. My left side in particular seems to be deteriorating and I have developed a bit of a strength disparity between my left and right legs and somewhat in my arms too. I also have been having constant muscle twitching that I have tried to tread a myriad of ways, unsure if that is related to CMT though. How old are you if i May ask? And are you limited and cant do certain stuff or? I am 30. The CMT has been very mild most of my life. Like most others my balance is awful and my recovery times after weight lifting are horrendous. Even with moderate weight I am sore for 3 days or so. \n\nBeyond that, though, I would not say I have any limitations.  I do not play sports because my coordination and balance are so bad. I hike mountains and the last couple of years I have had to dial back the intensity because I keep injuring my knees due to an awkward gait on descents. I cannot even seem to straighten this out with PT so I just do not do 6kft descents anymore. I know I am gifted for these to be my \u201climitations\u201d. 6000 feet ascent/descent? Wow! My record is about 3500. I think even healthy people would find 6k a real challenge. I should clarify, I am referring to one specific instance where I did 6kft over the course of two days in the Maroon Bells and it totally ruined my knees. I have done 5kft several times but it is been a few years... I wonder how I would handle it now. \n\nColorado has too many opportunities for these kinds of hikes! Good problem to have. I was searching for the same thing about this time last year and I think I even found the blog you mentioned. I wound up just watching some YouTube videos. I found a channel called \"Yoga With Adriene\" and she is great but it is a ton of videos to parse through. I stopped after a few months because I got bored of it and felt like I was not progressing. That might have been my own fault though.\n\nHowever I am going to give it another shot but this time I am going to a local class. I think I will try to speak with the instructor ahead of time and just explain the condition briefly and express what I am trying to do (loosen up muscles, increase strength and balance) and hopefully they will be able to provide a path to achieve those goals. This would be my suggestion but if you can find someone who knows the disease and teaches yoga that would be awesome. Sounds wonderful to hike over there! When I did 3500 I was in my early 20s and had been hiking regilarily for quite some time, I am not sure I could repeat that now without some buildup first. Can I ask what hiking shoes you used/use? I really want to get back to hiking again this year. :) I bought an expesive yoga mat many years ago but I only used it twice. Yoga was not for me I found out, it did't feel right at all no matter what excersices I tried. Everyone is different of course, but do not buy the mat until you are sure it is for you! I love my hiking boots. They are Asolos but I do not know the model, I have got a solid 5 years in them. I got them on REI on clearance for like $100, if you have access to an REI they are great, you can try a pair of hiking shoes for up to a year and return them for any reason, so you can trial and error and find the perfect pair. \n\nI wear them without my inserts even though my PT and my doctors tell me to use the inserts. I have found it less painful to avoid the insert. Yeah I think I will try to find an instructor who at least knows neuropathy and talk with them ahead of time as well. Where they leather or synthetics? I live in Norway but I import my hiking boots from the US already (the wide model of New Balance 978 GT). I use them with insoles and a thick pair of wool hiking socks in all but the summer months. They are great on slippery rocks and in wet and cold terrain, which is all we have most of the year. But I need some lighter shoes for the dryer summer months and some with a stiffer sole for really rocky terrain. :) Yoga with Adriene is amazing!   \n\n\nI have had a mountain of success with Yoga. Start easy, but I would eventually start to try and target balance poses if your ankles will tolerate it. The thing to remember with CMT is it is the \"little\" muscles that atrophy first (think little muscle = little nerves, so any damage will affect them quicker than the larger muscle groups).  Plus, working on balance will aid your proprioception so you can train your body to react when your feet are not landing where they are supposed to. They are synthetic which I imagine helps with weight. Stiff sole too as almost all the hiking I do is on rocky terrain. \n\nI might try to buy a size up on my next pair and use the insoles, maybe that would help with comfort. \n\nMy biggest problem is always stability, though. I need to invest in a good pair of poles. I am a huge fan of YWA too. I credit her yoga with saving me. Ten years ago just walking through security to board a plane would exhaust me and take a few days to recover. Six years ago I stumbled across her 20 min beginners yoga vid. It was so difficult for me, much I could not do at all. I did the same video every day for about three months. It got easier. Then moved to a longer beginners video. I could tell after several months I had better balance and more strength. My flexibility really increased which helped with cramps and pain. Three years ago I really committed to it and I am on about 850 days straight of doing one of her videos a day. This fall I was on vacation and was averaging 7 miles a day walking, on cobblestones. A decade ago we thought I would be in a wheel chair by now. I cannot do all the fancy yoga moves but that is what I love about ywa and practicing at home. It is all about what works for me.\ntl;dr yoga drastically improved my cmt symptoms. It is been life changing Sounds a bit odd on the outset but I have had really great results with DDP Yoga -- it is a program done by former pro wrestler Diamond Dallas Page, which I think turns some people off initially -- but it is an adaptive program that teaches you to change the moves to your personal abilities and even offers options for just building functional strength.\n\nI dig it bc the on demand offerings (which is cheap) are available on my smart TV and phone, and all I really needed to get started on most workouts was a mat. Thanks for the recommendation. I think I actually heard Dallas Page talking about this on Joe Rogan some time ago. I will check it out! There were always moves in yoga I could not do. I do ten stretches daily that I have been doing since I took martial arts as a teenager and am taking up weights again after a year break. Always thought the main benefit I got was from the weights but discovered it was the stretching that gave me the good feeling", "When is this going to be cure able ", "What are the different types of CMT? Can anyone give me a good source for different types of CMT. My mother and brother both have the disease and show pretty significant symptoms, but different. I might have it, but if so I only show very minor symptoms (weakness in ankles and numbing pain?) I see people on here talking about different types, and I would like to learn more so that I can know how best to support them and understand what they are going through.", "CMT and Post Orgasmic Illness Syndrome (POIS) Hi everyone,\n\nI have CMT type 1a, so not the severest form but I have none the less had a feeling for years now that something was not right. So it turns out in addition to CMT I most likely have what is called POIS, meaning I get sick for a week after orgasm. The biggest symptoms for me are loss of voice, fatigue and having to sleep half of the day, random muscle twitching/jumping, cold intolerance (which I have anyway bc of CMT) is increased and seems to trigger stomach issues which lead to frequent visits to the restroom and there is also the problem of heart racing and social anxiety aswell.\n\nMy only theory is that my POIS (episode) is especially worse because I have CMT (eventhough the doctor says it is unrelated). But I am genuinely wondering how it is possible that for example because of an orgasm I lose my voice and my ability to speak for 6-7 days?! I have not seen anyone with such complicated symptoms on pois forums either which leads me to believe that CMT does play a role in my case.\n\nHas anyone here heard of POIS or knows more about the medicine side of things and/or can recommend something that could help? \n\nI have taken niacin, garlic, zinc, vitamin d and anti inflammatory medicine. Interestingly eating garlic helps my voice to be able to speak a little but the effect only lasts an hour at max. &gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Has anyone here heard of POIS or knows more about the medicine side of things and/or can recommend something that could help?\n\nThat sounds horrible. Sorry you are going through this. I have never heard of anyone with CMT relating a similar problem. I have definitely heard of CMT contributing to problems with the actual sexual act, but as for this? This is the first time and I have been been reading CMT documentation and Q &amp; A's since the 80's. So, I would honestly say it is highly doubtful it is related to the CMT...but...who knows? I see. But thank you anyway for your comment. This entire post will be wild speculation and conjecture so read it with that in mind.\n\nThe exact cause of POIS is not known but according to ( there are several hypotheses, one of them being *\"a transient deregulation of the autonomic nervous system\"*. Studies have shown that autonomic nervous system involvement does occur in some CMT1A patients. With some imagination one could hypothesize that if the CMT has caused autonomic nerve damage and the cause of POIS is related to the autonomic nervous system,  then the resulting manifestation of symptoms could end up different and/or more severe than in typical POIS cases without a CMT comorbidity.\n\nBut you also mention that eating garlic helps, although only for a short time. It is not much to go on, but assuming that this is the case then it lends it self to another alternative explanation. Other hypotheses for the cause of POIS includes *\"a disordered cytokine or neuroendocrine response\"* and *\"an immunological phenomenon\"*. Garlic contains a lot of interesting compounds that does a lot of interesting things, but most noticeably garlic contains many organosulfur compounds that have strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. One of the compounds that forms when garlic is crushed and eaten is called \"diallyl disulfide\" which is known to limit the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines while others are known to cause anti-inflammatory effects through various other mechanisms. If we assume that the cause of POIS is immunological (which seems like the most likely alternative to me at least) then there is reason to believe that eating garlic could possibly help alleviate some of the symptoms.  The fact that you have tried other anti-inflammatory drugs without luck does not have to mean that it is not immunological, because most of the common ones work in completely different ways which will not necessarily have an affect on what is going on when you experience POIS.\n\n( case study however presents a case with POIS that was caused by low testosterone and which was successfully resolved when testosterone levels where normalized. It is just a case study though so not much to go on. \n\nOverall I think it is unlikely that the CMT is making it worse. To me it seems more plausible that the two conditions are separate and that the severity of your POIS  symptoms are due to something unrelated to CMT. Thank you very much for the thorough reply. And for breaking it down for me like that.\n\nIt is interesting because I have heard of the muscle twitching/nervous tick on one's arm from people who have CMT in particular (on youtube) and this symptom for me as far as I can remember, I have only experienced while in POIS (although usually only after 2+ relapses). It almost seems like it triggers it. Which if true would speak for the related-theory, is not it. \n\nAnd I forgot to add that with each relapse all the symptoms get worse in my case. I once had a blood test after only 3 days in POIS and the results came back with normal testosterone (already, to my surprise). And the doctor just said that the results show that I am sick right now and that my body is apparently fighting against an infection.\n\nSo I think testorsterone is not an issue in my case in particular and in a group of POIS sufferers in general. Seems like low T can be ruled out in your case since you have had it tested while experiencing POIS symptoms. Assuming you did not happen to have an infection or immunological reaction to something else on the day you took the blood test (unlikely), then the results strengthens the hypothesis that your POIS is in fact immunological. Perhaps getting a referral to an immunologist could be worth checking out? Although POIS is poorly understood at the moment it could be worth a try, especially if you live in a country with free healthcare. If you live in the US the cost may not be worth it, but I do not know enough about that system to form an opinion about that.", " On My Nerves - Small Irritations Weekly thread for the little CMT things bugging you this week The prolonged change of season in my area (Northern Canada) is causing an increase in pain.

I have CMT-2C, with very mild symptoms so far, but I have intermittent restless leg syndrome. Mostly at night when I am trying to sleep.\n\nI also thrash around quite a bit when I am sleeping, and apparently my dad (also type 2C) does as well.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this? Could it be related to CMT, or is it just a separate condition? I have had RLS since the age of 20. I take Pramipexole to control it before bedtime. Yes!

Currently, I have the Kyleena IUD, which has progestin in it. I have had it for about 4 months now. I feel my self being noticeably weaker, the wasting away feeling I get much stronger, among other side effects (after feeling weaker I did a google search and found someone else with the same side effects). I have already tried the non hormonal IUD. Does anyone have any advice on a birth control that works for them and does not affect CMT? Thanks! I have been using the arm implant for almost nine months now. Which one, and do you like it? I have Nexplanon. I really like it, my only issue is the constant spotting. Everyone has different experiences with it. Okay thanks! And no feeling of getting weaker? Not that I have noticed. Yes. Condoms. No side effects. Very safe I do not have a great answer for you, but know that you are not alone and the science, though incomplete, gives us an idea why it might be bad to take progestin/progesterone if you have CMT1A. \n\nProgestin is known to be able to increase PMP22 expression--if you have type 1A then PMP22 is what your body is already making too much of and progestin can prompt it to make even more. Why it is not on the \"use with caution list\" I do not know. \n\nBirth control in CMT people is an understudied area which deserves more attention. Despite the fact that progestin is known to be able to increase PMP22 expression and despite the fact that people with CMT who get pregnant often get worse during pregnancy (when one's body is making a lot of this hormone) there has never, to my knowledge, been a study to explore \"can hormonal birth control make CMT worse?\"\n\nDue to the unknown but potentially harmful effects I have personally chosen to avoid ever using hormonal birth control. It is a complex decision with a lot of personal factors to weigh. I wish you the best in finding a solution that works for you. Thank you! I used a mirena IUD with no problems. I was having general non CMT related issues with hormonal contraception before, and a family planning nurse suggested it as a last ditch attempt before going to less reliable non hormonal options as the dosing is a lot lower. \n\n\nThere is always the copper IUD, though I have heard it can be a nightmare for bleeding. \n(Kyleena is levonorgestrel, Mirena is progestogen) I have nexplanon (arm implant) and it is been fabulous for me. Only noticeable side effects are uneven periods. I used to take the pill and it made me depressed, but I have never had any physical complications. Hi! I have been on nexplanon for about a year now. During the first three months I was noticeably weaker, but as my body got used to it I have not felt nearly as weak. I would give your IUD a bit more time and maybe you will have a similar result.

In the case of CMT 1A, you need to get the payload into Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, and ideally not into any other cells. That is very hard to do if you inject the vector (that holds the payload) into the bloodstream, and injecting it into nerves does not work either as far as I know. \n\nIn the case of CMT2D however, the mutant gene (GARS) is expressed in the CNS. So to deliver the payload the vector can be injected directly into the brain or the spinal cord, which results in a very targeted delivery and in turn a high efficacy and very little side effects.\n\nSo if my understanding is correct (and someone please correct me if it is not) this is very exciting for those that fit the criteria mentioned above but for CMT1A and the rest of the genotypes that are not expressed in the CNS there are still fundamental challenges that needs to be solved before gene therapy will become a viable option. That said people are working on it, and some day it will be solved I am sure.\n\nThis study was done in mice, and they found little side effects from the treatment so a human trial might happen sooner rather than later. I certainly hope so, it would be a significant achievement to see this work in humans. With a prevalence of 1 in a million they might have to sign up all the CMT2D folks just to do the clinical trials! \n\nSeriously, if there are any CMT2D folks out there seeing this, this is great news for you. I know a lot of the CMT research money gets put toward CMT1A and it is wonderful to see real progress being made on research that could help other types.", "Braces keep breaking at work or breaking me. I have a career that more often than not includes walking long distances, climbing many flights of stairs and even ladders. I have been burning through pairs of braces including blue rockers, toe offs, and more recently the Phat braces 2.0. I have also used the Valganoodle but dealt with lower leg injuries from using those with my activity level. Does anyone know of any braces that are extremely strong while also not extremely uncomfortable? Any feedback is welcome, thank you! Not to be a downer, but maybe this is braces trying to tell you it is time to move on to something less active? I ran through three pairs of braces simply being a waiter and mowing the lawn, I could not imagine doing ladders in my braces without snapping them, I have Noodle, stairs are ok as long as there is a railing. I wish I could do all kinds of things in braces, but they are not there to return us to normal. I would recommend taking a look at TurboMed Xtern braces! I wear them and they are VERY comfortable (fully external to your shoes, so no uncomfortable foot plates) compared to my old carbon fiber ones (Sprysteps).\n\nI have had my TurboMeds for a little over a year and I have gone running with them, go for long walks (2+ miles) every morning since quarantine began, go up and down stairs, and I even dropped a weight on them once and they have held up for me! For context, my manual muscle test scores for my ankles are in the high 2 range, so it is not like I am barely in need of an AFO, they are doing some serious work!\n\nThey also have been really helpful in getting more active - I could not run before wearing them and now I can! They also let your ankle flex forward unlike the carbon fiber braces, so gaining that muscular range of motion back A) makes stairs feel WAY more natural and comfortable and B) led to me actually building more muscle in my calves again (their circumference is seriously visibly larger).\n\nThey may not be perfect for everyone, but they were legitimately life changing for me. There is a very active FB group for them, check it out and see what you think!  I would definitely look at custom fabricated braces for your situation. In my experience a lot of the off the shelf AFOs are significantly less durable. \n\nIf you have experienced a lot of breakage issues a good orthotist should be able to work with the manufacturer to get some made that address your specific failure mode. They still will not be indestructible but they will probably be a lot better. I agree. However, my pair was very costly to me... $250.00  made out of PVC.\nI recently spoke to a friend of mine who holds a PhD in your physiology. He explained in detail more than any other doctors combined in the last 10 years. I am now focusing on my glutes and hamstrings and it is beginning to make a significant difference and my overall pain. Google myofascial pain, narrowing of the foramen and that should get you on the right path in my opinion. It does help a lot with gait to have stronger glutes, hamstrings, and quads. I do not experience much pain from CMT so I cannot say on that.\n\nAFOs and muscle strengthening are not mutually exclusive options, however. The AFOs may still be required even if you have strong upper legs and hips if the foot drop is bad enough. The reason I started wearing them was primarily to reduce the risk of injuring myself by tripping over my toes and falling (I broke an arm that way). Thanks for the recommendation but I have tried Turbomed and they do not feel suitable for me I am currently exploring less physically demanding careers and building the pathways to said careers. I am looking for something that will give me more stability (pun intended) until I can find another way to provide for my family I have experience with custom fabricated braces (with more success than prefabs) I feel that this May more of a materials problem. Not sure if pairs can be made of titanium, steel, or some other highly durable material. My custom Phat braces 2.0 (carbon fiber) were not the answer I was hoping they would be, lasting only a month. That sounds like something to look into. Appreciate the feedback Yeah, I have fairly strong quads but the foot drop definitely creates a conundrum. I think it is absolutely necessary for people with our disease to build on whatever leg strength/mobility they have Fair enough, no brace is right for everyone! Good luck in your search :) There is going to be some trade off between flexibility and durability when it comes to carbon AFOs. In my case I have some custom ones with enormously reinforced struts near the ankle (with very thick carbon fiber). This makes them a lot more durable and resistant to cracking but also makes them stiffer, which can cause some comfort issues. They made these specially reinforced ones for me after I experienced a lot of breakage, by consulting with the fabrication company and having them modify the design somewhat.\n\nMine used to break every 6 months or so when I used off the shelf ones. Now they last about 3-4 years. I am also pretty active and even played volleyball in them regularly at one time. Hey they sounds like a great idea. I will mention that tomorrow when I see my orthotist. If I could get way more durability by sacrificing some of the comfort/energy return I would do it. They just need to be extremely durable and bearable as far as comfort goes Anytime! I broke through all of those braces myself. I had to get custom orthotics.  But, that does not save you, now you are going to have to worry about screws. So I keep a screwdriver handy at all times\ud83d\ude01 Custom orthopedic shoes. I am trying to get these, hoping to get some upper leg strength. Are they durable? I feel these braces apply hormesis, getting stronger because there is left room for muscle use which becomes a stimulus for stronger nerves and muscles. They have been for me! I have had my same pair for over 2 years. I wear them almost every day, have run on treadmills with them, and used them for 2+ mile walks every day since quarantine began. Certainly a little scuffed up from heavy use, but no parts have broken and I imagine I walk more than many users! \n\nThey have definitely lost a bit of springiness, but they are still working great for me and their YouTube channel has a video on some DIY fixes if you need to get the braces back to the original springiness.", "Dating with CMT (25M) I have decided to put myself back out there after taking a bit over a year off from dating. What sort of dates do you guys recommend for someone that has a moderate (I think?) case of CMT?\n\nI do not wear any AFOs or have any other assistance walking beyond a cloth brace. I am pretty limited in the distance I can walk, what surfaces I can easily maneuver, and how long I can stand. Due to that I feel very uncomfortable doing activities and feel like I am kind of limited to dinner, drinks, music, or a movie.\n\nAlso, when do you all disclose something like this during online dating? I have always either said something during the beginning of text conversations or just not said anything until it comes up. I have mild CMT so I am not terribly limited personally, but dating is awkward in general. I like coffee, or a single daytime beer at a brewery. Both last about an hour but can be extended to get a meal without seeming weird, if it is going well. The brewery one, I just think it is important to stop well before you are intoxicated. 2 beers max for me, 1 if they are strong. But, both options are low-key, low pressure, and do not require a lot of moving or standing. And they have a natural endpoint. \n\nAs far as when to disclose, I struggle with this, but I would say maybe date 2-3 for a moderate case. It depends how comfortable you are and maybe also on how obvious the signs are. If it impacts your long-term life/relationship goals, like you cannot work or you do not want children as a result of CMT, I think that is an important conversation to have fairly early on, for both of your sakes. I agree with all this. It is been 15+ years since I last went on a first date but coffee or a beer make an ideal first meet up. \n\nI think roughly second date is a good time to mention CMT. No real point in bringing it up before you think a relationship might have potential (maybe that is me, I had a lot of first dates that did not get a second, lol) but you want to get it out there early in case it is an issue. You can probably start simple with something like \"I have a genetic condition that limits how much walking I can do\" and answer questions from there. That is generally how I have approached it in the past but there is always something in the back of my mind that is kind of worried that it will get stale not doing much else. I know that it will work out when the right person is found but obviously I wish that I could take someone out to go bowling or on a hike. \n\nAnd that approach to disclosing CMT sounds like the best way to approach it. I appreciate the response! As they said above coffee/beer is great for a first date that can lead to dinner or a meal together if its going well, but if you are also wondering about dates to take someone you have been seen a little while you can always get creative. I cant walk long distances at all without depending on crutches, but things like mini golf that often have benches at every hole was actually something new and fun I was able to do with my fiance considering I could rest whenever I needed and it didnt put much strain on my legs and feet. There is also thing you can do like pack a picnic and go sit down in a nice quiet place depending on where you live to where its not just getting stale going to the same restaurants and what not. Or if you or your date have a vehicle or you can drive look into \"safari\" rides or stuff like that where you drive through a park feeding different wild animals. These are a few things I did with my fiance when we first started dating and even now she still loves doing all of it. \n\nThe disclosure part I have put it out there in the very beginning as its very noticeable that I have it, sometimes its one of the first things I have had to talk about after meeting the date, or i told them before the date because if they had an issue with my disability then there was no point in wasting my time with them. I have learned no matter the connection, if they do not want to be in a relationship with a disabled person then it wont work no matter what so honestly just be honest and upfront about it whenever you are comfortable with talking about the issue I am not sure what your financial situation is, so this may not be possible for you but I would highly recommend getting some kind of AFO. I have had AFOs for a while but have never really done much outside of walking on flat surfaces but I recently took a trip and visited some state parks and I was blown away by how much they helped me, I did not trip once and I was even able to do some light climbing and jumping between things.

", "New to group and have a few questions So to start this off, I am a 26yo male who got diagnosed when I was in the 1st grade and admittedly have not done the best in preventive measures with the disability, mot wearing my braces like I was supposed to growing up. Had my first surgery I was 16 and it went perfectly, my foot is still pretty much the same as when they fixed it, but now my other foot is literally completely sideways. (Seriously walking on the side of my foot.) Recently I had a pretty bad fall and ended up getting a fracture and a high and low ankle sprain in my bad foot and now I cant put any weight on it and the pain has just been getting worse. I do have an appointment with my new orthopedic surgeon in a few days. (Moved to another state) the questions I have may be dumb for someone living with a disability but honestly I just do not know what to do.\n\n1. Which doctor am I actually supposed to go to, to get help with pain? Despite being in severe pain daily the only time I have ever had medicine to help is after my surgery, and its getting to the point where I literally cannot take it anymore. \n\n2. Has anyone been through a gradual correction procedure? If so how bad is the process? \n\n3. This has more to do with the struggles of having cmt instead of the actual cmt, but does anyone else always feel like a bother to their partner/family because of the setbacks the disability has given you, and how do you cope with it? My fiance has been doing an amazing job of taking care of me ever since ive taken the fall and gotten even more injured, but I am used to taking care of her so now I just feel like I am a huge inconvenience and its slowly dragging me into depression since I cant do anything for myself\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated I have not needed any surgeries and so cannot comment on the questions you have about those. You might need to find a pain specialist but ideally surgery and perhaps a good orthotic device could mitigate your pain. \n\nTo address your third question, every person has different abilities. In every relationship every person brings different strengths and weaknesses. Look beyond physical strength and see if you can find a way to lighten your partner's burden in some other way--take over organizing the grocery shopping or balancing the finances or doing the laundry or whatever thing that you can do to contribute in accordance to your strengths. Each relationship finds its own balance and something like an injury can shift things, temporarily or permanently. Look for another way you can take over some task your partner currently has. I do know surgery would help with the pain, but the orthopedic surgeon said he would like to do the GCP (gradual correction procedure) to get my foot as straight as possible before doing the reconstruction surgery, and said that that could be at least a year long process and was told to get some dental work done to avoid a higher risk of infections and then the reconstruction would be done in multiple surgeries so its kind of further down the line then I originally had hope and with the new fracture and sprains its just gotten worse, with a pain specialist, is it generally covered by medicaid or does that depend on state to state? Firstly, I am so sorry you are going through so much pain. That is exhausting and frustrating. In terms of which doctor will address that, in my experience it depends on the doctor. It may end up being your GP. Consider starting a symptom/pain journal. It shows a continuous and honest struggle with pain, and I think that can lend some heft to requests for help.\n\nI have no experience personally or through friends with gradual correction. But seek at LEAST two, better three, opinions before doing anything.\n\nIn regards to your fianc\u00e9, grant her the dignity of choosing to care for you out of love, not guilt or obligation. And make sure she knows that if and when she needs a break, that she is able to speak freely to you about that so you can both work out alternatives.\n\nEdit: words", "Change of Diet to improve cmt? Hey guys, i was recently diagnosed with cmt. I was 18 year old when i first noticed a paralysis in my biceps after lifting weights. 5 years have passed since then and i finally was diagnosed with certainty. Now i am about to change my whole diet. I heard from multiple sources that meat and animal products are way better than going vegan. I wanted to ask if anyone has experience with this kind of diet? I have no basis but I definitely eat more meat than recommended and I am doing ok.  The disease is variable though and I am very intentional about stretching and exercise so I could not say with certainty that it helps. I would take diet advice from anyone with a truck full of salt, except someone like a registered dietician with experience in these types of conditions that you are personally talking to. I have personally never received or seen any diet advice for it. I wouldnt ask for input on diet from the web. The most important thing isnt diet with this but staying active.  Jumping in on this, Im currently in the process of being diagnosed for CMT with a long family history.\nCan CMT cause you to crave meat? Since I can remember I have always craved meat and protein. Has anyone else noticed this or had similar cravings? I am no doctor or nutritionist. I have no doubt changing to a healthy diet can do wonders for many diseases. But I do not think any diet can reverse CMT unfortunately. Basically your nerves are being severed and I do not believe there is anything that can regenerate nerves back where they belong.\n\nCan it lessen some symptoms? Sure. Can it slow CMTs progression? Possibly.\n\nI am sorry to be blunt but it is important to be realistic.\n\nWhile your young it is important to make different career choices, like a desk job somewhere instead of on your feet all day.\n\nAlso if your interested in a family one day, it is important to tell your spouse the odds of your children developing the disease. \nI would also look into nutrients like vit B, D, magnesium. I was a bit confused about your post initially because I read it as asking about a vegan versus non-vegan diet but now (I think) I see that you are asking about a keto or low-carb diet. \n\nMultiple sclerosis is caused by demyelination in the brain and that may at first seem quite similar to the demyelinating forms of CMT. However, the mechanisms are very different. \n\nThat said, the idea of a low carb diet for CMT has come up before. There is a school of thought that suggests it could help with CMT type 1A specifically, though it is a bit of a long shot. \n\nThe theory with CMT1A is that PMP22 gets overproduced and clogs up the mechanisms of the cell. Going into a state of ketosis tends to increase the cell's garbage collection and so could theoretically help clear out some of the excess PMP22 clogging up the works. This is a very simplified description and frankly more research on the garbage collection mechanisms of the cell are needed to even say if it totally makes sense, but that is a theory that has been floated in the literature, as I understand it.\n\nI would be curious to hear if anyone here has tried it. \n\nAlso, OP, do you know what type of CMT you have?  Thanks for your words. I experienced the development of this disease on my father. Its true what you say, however i also want to state that a disease can always be treated and healed, if you find the reason why it happens. Currently there is a german study that was successful with treating the cmt1a symptoms of rats with lecithin. There might be hope that one day we might delete this sub. I have the typ where there is a deletion in pmp22 gen. Since i am pretty new to this disease i am not as well read as you seem to be. I will give this diet a shot and will keep you guys updated That would be HNPP, if I understand you correctly. \n\nTo the best of my knowledge there is no reason to expect a low carb diet to help with HNPP. \n\nYou are, of course, free to eat however you would like and find out. Many people find that a low carb diet leaves them less hungry and can therefore help with weight loss, if that is a concern for you. I see. That Is kinds upsetting but i will give it a try nonethless. Thanks for your time and knowledge!  That sounds like a crock of shit. Yeah, MS is not a death sentence. No one would be told they have X years to live unless *mayby* they had gotten to the PP stage without diagnosis or treatment. MS related deaths are overwhelmingly due to the medication side effects, and not the mechanism of disease.", "Common perioneal nerve / fibular nerve Does, or has, anyone else experienced a deep, aching, constant, burning, going down the outside of either of your lower legs? I have complained to my pain med doctor several times about what feels like a very thick, high-voltage wire coursing with power going from about my knees to the feet. The pain, heat, never abate, but the intensity or voltage of the power coursing up and down does change. It is similar to the pain I felt in my legs most of my life, even as a young child, but now it is so all consuming, all present.\n\nI have been doing a lot of sleuthing on google and medical sites and came across some interesting information regarding these nerves. The Perioneal nerves and the fibular nerves both play a significant role in the dorsal relaxation, drop foot, foot pain, and pain along the side of the calves.\n\nI am wondering if these nerves might also have something to do with the never-ending calve cramps that not only seem to be worsening, but also are a primary factor in keeping me from walking?\n\nDoes anyone have any experience, knowledge, insight into the various perioneal nerves?\n\n (Common perioneal nerve / fibular nerve)\n\n ( I have had perioneal calf strain frequently, especially from running or other exercise, but it did not sound as bad as this. Massage and ice really helped my more mild case. I get pain from my common peronial nerve in my left leg. It goes all the way to my toes and makes it feel like the bones in my foot are about to bust out of my skin. My podiatrist did some tests and told me the intimation was starting behind my knee right around my calf and had me start massaging there. It really helped bring the pain to a more manageable level. Hi, I am not sure if it is exactly the same but it sounds similar. My lower leg pain can feel like bags of broken glass that just got run over by a truck with electricity shooting past my knees with a sense of pressure like they are going to explode. Mornings and night time are bad. The nerves send all sorts of mixed up signals. Sometimes if I just think about a leg getting twisted or something I will get cramps that feel like it is actually happening, like right now because I am mentioning it, very weird but that sensation usually goes away soon after I look to see that they are still straight. The best thing I can do is to try and focus on anything else, anything to distract my attention. In the last year I have been trying some arts and crafts as a hobby. I am not very good at it but I am improving and it seems to help. Plus the pain medication. It is good to see you here, I hope you find a therapy that can help ease the cramps and dull the pain more. Take care. Thanks for the response. The calve cramping in both legs is non stop! It is the reason I can barely walk. It is the reason the calves are very painful all the time. It is the reason the thigh muscles are also atrophying. \n\nI am looking for ANYTHING that might help explain or mitigate the incessant cramping. Surgery. Medications? Procedures? Therapies? Test? Thank you for your response and additional information! I, too, feel pain inside my feet. I express it as, all the bones in my feet have been crushed to shard's and each piece is digging into the soft tissue. extremely painful!\n\nMay I ask, do you know what kind of test he performed? Did he mention any other treatment options other than massage? Or other specialist you could follow up with? Are you just rubbing the muscles behind your left knee or are there specific techniques?\n\nThanks again! Thanks for your response and very vivid description of your pain! The pain you describe is the pain I feel 24/7. The only thing that modulates is the severity. Being on my feet, even for just a little time, sends the pain over the top. The pain has been so bad, lasted so long, sometimes days at a time, it just brings me to tears and I want to be done with it all.\n\nI am happy you are able to refocus your attention elsewhere to escape from the pain. Keep up with your arts and crafts, they are a meaningful, purposeful and necessary mental activity.\n\nPrior to my pain levels reaching current levels, i would often spend hours drawing in graphite, charcoal, pastels or painting in watercolor. Those days are gone now. I no longer have any physical, mental, life-force energy and the pain is a constant, ever present companion that will not be denied. She just does a physical exam. What she does is put irritating pressure on different areas of the nerve then immediately tests my strength (which she sometimes does using my arms and sometimes my legs-- it is so odd how she figures this stuff out). When she hits the point I lose strength, she knows that is the point of inflammation or injury or whatever. \n\nShe then shows me exactly how and where to massage (always in circles) and usually pulls out a diagram to show me the nerve we are targeting and exactly where to massage. It is hard to describe exactly where it is without a visual. She usually tells me to massage with arnica gel. She also talked about using KT tape and showed me how to put it on to help that area, but also recommended I go to a physical therapist and have them go over it as well. \n\nI have found there are quite a few good physical therapists on YouTube who do videos showing simple massages to help different areas of the body. Not a substitute for actual going to one, but sometimes helpful in the meantime. Thank you!, Again! It seems odd that a podiatrist would have such in-depth knowledge of the nerves in the legs. Great idea using YouTube! I will search for perioneal nerve massage techniques. Also, perhaps it is time I add a podiatrist to the team. I was thinking perhaps a vascular specialist. So far, I have had ZERO luck managing the pain via medications. I was perhaps wondering if there were any surgeries that might help. I think it is necessary for them to understand all that since the nerves are often what is affecting the feet or causing other issues in the feet. She knows a lot about CMT too I think from seeing a lot of CMT patients. She is a surgeon as well but has said in someone my age (40s) surgery should be a last resort. That was dealing with my ankles mostly though. \n\nMaybe call around to see if you can find a podiatrist who understands CMT. Or ask your neurologist. (Funny enough-- my symptoms are still very mild, so I have not seen a neurologist yet, but my podiatrist wants me to.) I am sorry if I made it into a competition of who has it worst, it was not what I intended. I was hoping to show that you are not alone in this hell. I am not the greatest communicator at times, this is part of why I do not often comment. Sorry. Oh, NO, NO,NO, NO,NO! The fault is all mine! I never, ever meant to do a one-up, who has it worse comparison! I am so sorry if what I posted came across to you, or anyone, that I was making this into a competition. That was the furthest thing from my mind.\n\nI was only trying to share with you, and others, that I, too, found peace and enjoyment pursuing something I was never allowed to as a child and never had time to as a working adult.\n\nEnjoy your arts and crafts! They are important to your headspace, well-being, and spirit.\n\nIf what I posted comes across as a competition, then the fault is all mine. Not yours! \n\nOne more thing, PLEASE, comment more often! The more of us that share info and participate, the more we are all enriched! Fascinating! I am going to guess, just based on what you said about your podiatrist, being a surgeon, knowing a lot about CMT patients, I am going to guess you live in or near what I call a REAL city. \n\nCities large enough to have such specialist and populations where CMT is not a rarity.\n\nGOD,  I miss living in Metro Phoenix! A REAL metro. Now, I live in a very rural area in Delaware. I think I am probably the only CMT person any of the locals have ever seen. They have not heard of CMT since medical school.\n\nI am seriously considering seeing a podiatrist, surgeon, in a real city. I have extremely flat feet that are always lava burning hot. I am convinced the nerves in the foot are damaged not from CMT but from just pounding year after year. I am hoping there is some miracle therapy, surgery, pill, shot, anything, to relieve this incessant burning! How about asking your podiatrist if she can recommend someone that is close to Dover Delaware?!\n\nOf course, if I have to drive to a real city, that means I will have to find someone to drive me as I can no longer drive that far with most of the dorsiflexion gone from my right foot.\n\nI just turned 66 and just the day after my birthday did I FINALLY get an official diagnosis from a M.D. at Penn Med CMT Center of excellence. It is all good, sometimes I think too much, sometimes not enough and sometimes I am not sure which is which. Maybe both at times. Thank you. lol. too funny. yes, I live in a \"real\" city. I am out in the west coast though. But I highly recommend traveling to find the doctors you need. We actually travel to Philly for my daughter's medical care (not CMT-- she had a rare form of cancer, but is doing great). One of my cousins goes to Philly for CMT. I believe she goes to UPenn as well. Usually at places like that they will have a great team or can help find doctors for you. if i were you, I would go back to UPenn and have them help you with a plan of care and pain management. It is a pain to travel, but once you have a plan in place, your local doctors can help.\n\nHave you been prescribed gabapentin? my podiatrist prescribed it for me, but I did not take it yet since I was trying for another baby and it is not a safe drug during pregnancy. I have heard it can really help for nerve pain.", "Recently started going out with someone with CMT, and I have some questions. Like the title says, I am dating someone with CMT. We have been seeing each other for about a month. She told me a few hours before our first date that she has a disorder that made her a bit wobbly,  but did not really get into it. On the date, she told me she was diagnosed when she was basically a toddler, and has had several surgeries on her feet, and has had to relearn to walk twice. Last week she had a nerve test done to her hand(s), and found signs that its progressing to her right hand. She is a musician playing multiple instruments and a singer, so she was pretty heartbroken when she was given the news of progression. She seems to be incredibly depressed about it, understandably, and I have no idea what I can do to help take her mind off it. She always tells me \"it is what it is, there is nothing that can be done about it\". I do not like that kind of defeated response, but from what I have read there really is nothing I can do.\n\nWhat are some tips or ideas to help her understand I am there for her? I have offered foot and back rubs, but beyond that I am kind of clueless. The one thing I ask my husband for sometimes is a steadying hand when I have to navigate rough ground. \n\nEvery CMT'ers capabilities are a little different, but you could ask things that show that you are thinking of her abilities and do not mind making small changes (things like \"oh, is this hill a problem? We could go around\" or offer your arm to steady her in getting across a rough patch). It is nice when someone shows they are thinking about you, concerned about your wellbeing, even if the accommodation is not needed in that instance. Just be there for her and do not take it personally if she does not want to talk about it. Sometimes we push ourselves and it puts us in a place of semi-denial, I think because of the fluctuations.\nUnderstand that some days she will be able to seem able-bodied and do a lot, and others she will not be able to move.\nMy CMT includes autonomic neuropathy as well, so during a flare I am in a wheelchair. When I am not in a flare I can go to the gym, kayak, and walk 7 miles without stopping. It is confusing and frustrating. Make sure you listen and know that symptoms can change a lot day by day for many of us. Be there for her. Even if she is just trying to accept it and does not want to talk about it, be there for her. I went through the same thing. I had played musical instruments for 20+ years and had to stop. It is hard. If she needs to talk to someone that is gone through it, she is welcome to message me. I wish I could be in a relationship but me being a dude with cmt and other problems with my life I feel is holding me back. Sorry if its off topic its just been on my mind. Anyway I would think the best thing to do it to let her deal with it by herself and just be there for her. This is something that cannot be fixed by a simple talking and she needs time to grieve. \"It is what it is\" is not defeatist, in this context though. There is really not much one can do outside of exercise and stretching, which also becomes more difficult. I understand how you think it is, but when you have a degenerative disorder you come to grips with your limitations. I overdue it a lot... then I pay the price of a twisted ankle or fucked up knee. So it becomes a balancing act (all puns intended) of finding that limit.  \n\n\nAs someone else said ask if she want's a literal helping hand when going up inclines or down declines, when standing still in a large crowd I either need a cane (if I remember) or a buddy's shoulder that I can put my hand on to steady myself. Ask if she needs help... do not just go in like Superman... championing or telling me my limitations is a huge pet peeve. If she fall's ask if she is alright then offer a hand up... sometimes you just got to sit there for a second and cuss at the universe.\n\n\\*BTW You are a good person to be asking what you can do to help, not trying to make you feel crummy. Exactly. It is what it is is acceptance. It is not a calm acceptance, or \"making peace\" or anything nice, it is just what it is. It sounds like you are a really good guy. You show that you are there for her and want to help any way you can. That means a lot. If I can offer any advice, it is to recognize when to offer a hand and when to sit back. Sometimes you just do not want to talk about it. As I grew up with this disease I learned to ask for help when needed, but my independence is also very important to me. As any person with a disability will tell you, few things are worse than the feeling of being coddled.  The line between caring and coddling is very fine, and sometimes it just depends on ones mood. But I think your heart is in the right place so you will be fine. \nThe only other advice I can think of is if her CMT prevents you from doing something together, do not dwell on it. If you wanted to go on a hike or something and she is not up for it, try to reserve your disappointment. The feeling of CMT holding you back is one thing, but when it feels like you are a burden on others it is just awful. Be mindful of that.\nGood luck with your relationship! It sounds like she is lucky to have you! Also, when it comes to how she it is feeling, you are right, there is not always something to do or say. And that is hard when you really care. All I can say is focus on what she can do, what life has to offer. Life can but utterly unfair, but it is what you make of it. It is what it is\nIt is not what it was\nIt is not what it could have been\nIt is what it is CMT can be very different from person to person. Some people need wheelchairs, others do not know they have the disease until they are old. Others, like plaidtaco, can experience both ends of the spectrum. It seems like your girlfriend's CMT is moderate. This is super tricky to deal with because of the contradictions she has to handle. Normal but not normal.\n\nThis is why you have to pick the pieces of advice that suit this situation. Your personality and her personality. \n\nThe advice from Joeliosis and Not-Bread is spot on, when it comes to understanding when to help and when not to. \n\n\"It is what it is\", that is a double edge sword. It can either mean defeat, or acceptance. Acceptance is the way to go. CMT is hitting her right where it hurts, music. Just like kdefmuisic. So maybe you should PM that person and see how I he or she overcame that. \n\nOne of the things that helped me overcome this disease is to adapt. I never swim against the current. The possibilities are endless with music, right? Michel Petrucciani chose the piano, and he excelled. All his body was fucked up, but his hands were good, so he went for that. \n\nShe sings, she can compose, produce, mix music, and I am certain she will be able to keep playing up to a certain extent. Nothing will stop her from making music as long as she adapts.  \n\nCMT or not, we should not underestimate our capacity to adapt. \u201cIt is what it is. There is nothing that can be done about it.\u201d Yes. It is not defeat. It is acceptance. And it is important. Accepting where we are is the only way through. I too am a multi-instrumentalist and singer. I adapt along the way. I can no longer play the kick drum, so when I play drums the bass player plays an electronic kick pedal for me. I have trouble playing some things on accordion and flute sometimes. It is okay, I play in bands with original music so I get to change things up and play to my abilities. Acceptance means to stop trying to do what is not working for you or to compare yourselves to others. Your girlfriend got the body that she got. She can wallow over that or she can figure out how she is going to move forward. I think the most you can do for her is listen, let her know that you think she is a badass and that you will be there. That is it. Do not try to fix it for her. First of all do not ever say 'I do not like that kind of defeated response' that is ableist as fuck. You will never understand what it is like for her. All you can do is listen, do not try and fix it. I am a dude with CMT. Reach out to me if you need someone to talk to. You can get into a relationship and not let CMT hold you back, just work on finding what is best for you.\n\nI have had multiple feet reconstruction surgeries, a hip surgery (PAO), and just recently a knee surgery (MPFL). I am married with a couple of crazy kids now.\n\nIt is not been easy and I do get pretty down sometimes, but I want you to know you can reach out to me and talk if you ever need to. I do not know what other problems you have with your life, so I am not going to act like I have the answers or know anything about you. People sometimes think that way because they have been trained to think of disease as something you \u201cfight\u201d. IMO, the battle analogy is a particularly poor fit for an incurable chronic disease like CMT.  Not only is it a lifelong thing, but there is very little you can do about it. It is just something you have to accept and manage because there is currently no effective treatment or cure.\n\nI have even run into this mentality before in other CMT groups. I got told I was \u201ctaking away people\u2019s hope\u201d because I told them the truth: that some whacko supplements were unlikely to do anything to treat their CMT. It is good to be hopeful, but in my opinion it is unhelpful to place hope in things that are unlikely to be of benefit. It just makes it more upsetting when it does not work out. Did you pass it on to any of your kids? They have not been tested yet. It was obvious I had it as a baby, where both of mine do not show any signs. Well, I hope for the best for you and yours. Hey can you PM me, I have tried sending you a message but i keep getting errors PM sent", "Is it possible to build muscle in completely atrophied areas?  I asked the Dr jokingly one time like, cannot you just prescribe some steroids and then lift and just get swole\u2014basically said yeah it does not work that way because no matter how much work you do your muscles are not communicating correctly and your body does not acknowledge the work you are doing (hence the atrophy). Will you come tell my parents that? Lol I thought \u201ctake steroids\u201d for years, but if the nerves are not firing right, it will not accomplish what we want.  \n\nStaying active slows the decline &amp; building other muscles can help some in the form of compensation. \n\nI am recovering from my sixth foot surgery (2 in 83-84, 2 in 09-10, and 2 since March. I am basically a skeleton below my knees...hoping I will be able to wear some AFO\u2019s when I am healed. You should invest in some sweet novelty socks. Makes afos ten times better. I usually wear some high boot socks with a little extra padding on the bottom. Some compression &amp; moisture wicking. Black is my normal jam since it matches the AFO\u2019s. I will have to look into something \ud83d\ude1c You need a functioning nerve-muscle junction to be able to move your muscles, regardless of how strong your muscles are. So the short answer is no, if it is truly completely atrophied.\n\nThe longer answer, for me anyway, is that atrophy is something of a continuum. It is not really like one day your muscle is fine and the next it is completely gone. So by working hard on the muscles you can, you may be able to delay some of the effects for quite a while. You are not going to completely stop it but you might be able to gain a bit of tone or bulk in muscles that you still have partial control over.\n\nIn my case I basically have almost no control in my feet; they are a lost cause for the most part. But I still have a bit of control over my calves, especially near the upper part of them. So, I have been able to get some tone and a small amount of bulk back in those by really working on them consistently for quite a while (over a few years). I do a lot on the leg press machine (because squats are near impossible for me) and also a lot on the bike. But it is hard and you are not going to respond like a non-affected person in those muscles.\n\nAs was said above, it is still really worth doing to gain as much strength as possible in other muscles to compensate. Having more upper leg and core strength really is beneficial for my gait and balance. Also it may help you keep your weight down which is really crucial for people with CMT as it helps reduce problems with your weak legs if you are carrying less weight around. I have no control below the knee but I am also only like 120 lbs All we can do is try. You can strengthen the muscles you have. Do either of your parents or grand parents have it? I got CMT through my Grandmas genes because she had it, so my Mom knows what it entails thankfully.\n\nI have never been one to complain even when I am hurting, which has good and bad outcomes, but I am sorry if your parents do not believe you when you tell them what is wrong. To me, just telling someone about my disability makes me feel better afterwards,  but sometimes it is not easy. \n\nSounds like they think you are over exaggerating the disability and trust me, I have lost friends because of shitty things they said to me. Some people actually believe I was trying to get pity or something when I would just come out and say, I do not think I will be able to make it to the show tonight or I am too exhausted to go to work today and then someone would say, \"must be nice to just take the day off because you are \"tired\".....\n\nPeople were literally upset at me because I literally have spaghetti strand muscles in my legs and some days are WAY worse than others, especially since I quit taking opiates. Sounds like your parents are just at the point where they are blaming you because they do not know what else to do. If you can try distancing from them a bit, if you live with them, maybe try talking about this with other people since they do not seem to care. \n\nSorry to rant, but your short sentence really hit home to me, because I can understand how people that do not understand CMT just start pointing fingers and blaming any reason they can as to why you are skin and bones(in my case, very little muscle, but I try staying active and grit my teeth through all the pain, my feet are callused up real good from being too hard on them) instead of the reason you tell them. \n\nIf you ever need someone to talk to feel free to message me, hope you have a great weekend and find joy where you can. Just stay active, do what you can from keeping your muscles from atrophied even more. I have been able to get some muscle mass back, but you need to push yourself further than you normally would. Alright I will shut up now, did not mean to write a novel but this is a subject I am passionate about. From someone who has tried PED's, that doctor is full of shit. Now, while it is impossible to reverse fatty atrophy, and there is a point of no return with regard to atrophy, you absolutely can focus on an area while on PEDs and grow it out. Currently, I am focusing on my calves, hands and forearms, and so far, have pretty good results. \n\nAlso, considering atrophy impacts practically every muscle in the leg from the glutes downwards, it is really important to build mass and strength before the point of no return kicks in. &gt; I thought \u201ctake steroids\u201d for years, but if the nerves are not firing right, it will not accomplish what we want. \n\nThing is, muscle growth has nothing to do with nerve stimulation. What I have noticed doctors do over the years is confuse \"nerves firing right\" with atrophied muscles. Once a muscle is gone, it is gone. But if you are still able to control the muscle enough to make it move, you can certainly grow it, and AAS is one way to accelerate this as its a frequent treatment for people with muscular dystrophy, which CMT was originally classified as. I have been thinking about PEDs, are you getting it via a doctor or by your own means?\n\nMy biggest concern is it impacting my natural testosterone production. Also, not sure where I would get the blood work done etc.\n\nAlso the legality of recovery drugs and the ped drugs in general. I would really want a doctor working with me, but I do not think this is something my doctors would allow. Unfortunately, my doctors are completely ignorant about the issue of muscle atrophy, but I am lucky enough to live in a country where I can buy a form of PEDs from sport supplement stores. \n\nIf you live in the US, there are definitely bloodwork clinics and youth clinics that will provide PEDs under the guise of TRT, but there is research that shows nandrolone can help people with CMT, specifically nerve velocity, which may be worth discussing with a doctor. \n\nAs for natural test production, cycle recovery, liver health, blood pressure, cholesterol etc, these are all very real and good concerns to have. There are ways to minimise the negative impact of all of these, and unless you do crazy amounts of anabolics at a young age, a doctor who knows their stuff should know what to do. Yeah, I see what you mean. I am in Canada.\n\nI can get PEDs (SARMS) and I did a lot of research and it basically became a no for me because:\n\nA) difficult to do blood work. Or very expensive.\n\nB ) legality of the drugs for recovery etc etc and difficulty getting support.\n\nIt is a real shame that doctors do not take these drugs seriously :(\n\nThanks for the info! What is afos?", "How has CMT affected your lungs? I was diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure when I was 11 years old and by the time I was 20 yo my lung function was a bit above 30%. It obviously has affected my voice and breathing but not to the point where I need a mask to help me breathe yet. I was wondering how often this happens and I was hoping to hear your experiences/tips/whatever. Cmt has not affected my lungs at all. For me it is just my feet (m31). Not at all, however it has affected my breathing in my sleep I believe. I use a CPAP machine when I sleep, and I know many people with CMT do have sleep apnea. I have CMT1A; I would suggest anyone with CMT to take the sleep apnea test. Do you know your subtype? For the most common presentations, lung involvement is unusual (being not peripheral) and it is usually just sleep apnea later in life, particularly if there is some extra pounds.   \n\n\nNo other potential cause? I sometimes feel like I cannot inhale as much as I used to (if that makes sense). I have never gotten it checked, so it might just be in my head. But overall, I am good. However, both of my aunts have sleep apnea and use a machine while they sleep. But they are in their 60's and as far as I am aware, they do not really struggle with their breath during the day. I was not aware of this being a specific effect of cmt, however my aunt did have to have an oxygen tank thing she carried around. But I am not entirely sure if that was related to the condition or not. She and my dad had scoliosis which I presume could impact breathing somewhat. Sorry cannot give you advice as they are quite old fashioned so do not like to talk about their condition so I only know she did have obvious breathing problems which required apparatus. My dad gets out of breath but is otherwise breathing unaided in his late 60\u2019s. Yeah my doctors think that the fact that I had severe scoliosis at a young age affected my lungs (it got corrected with surgery by the time I was 11 years old and it is not a problem anymore) but they also believe CMT has something to do with it. It is definitely the result of BOTH things combined, I forgot to mention the scoliosis part.", "How did cmt influence your long term life choices? TLDR: I do not know how to plan for the future, and I would love some feedback or resources.\n\nI was recently diagnosed with cmt, and I am having a lot of mixed feelings. I always had motor skill issues and through newly met family and a trip to the neurologist, it was confirmed I have it. I still have yet to go for the genetic testing so I do not know what type. I have plans to do it soon but I have got a lot of feelings swirling around, and I would love to hear how the community coped.\n\nOn one hand, I feel relieved to know why I have always had motor problems and tremors and the like. Since I could remember I had the issues and was berated for it by peers and family. But I am really concerned about the future. \n\nI work at a moderately physically demanding job, I always have. However, I have always been slow and over time I am accident prone to trips, falls, cuts, burns, drops, etc. I do not know how soon to anticipate not being able to work my job. I am also trying to transition to another industry for the long run, but I do not know what my limits will be one day.\n\n\nAdditionally, I do not know if and what kind of reliance I will have on my loved ones. I think the biggest thing that scares me is inclusivity among my peers, and how it will affect my partner and I. A lot of them are into a lot of physical hobbies, and when I try to partake I get scared shitless of an injury from being so unstable. \n\nWhich doctors and what should I ask about my future functionality? Does the subtype have influence on long term prognosis? How did you come to conclusions on long term decisions?  \n\nAny resources or suggestions are highly welcomed. Thanks!! Since I did not get diagnosed until 60, I do not have alot of future to plan for. I have to get over being called a faker and a liar for 60 years. Which I have not. Seriously, my family knows my end. I will use the right to die act. My breathing is affected from cmt, whether the axonal 2b1/4c1 or type 3/dejerine sottas, which is demyalating, I do not know. I do \"catch up\" breaths several times a day now. I will end up not being able to breathe on my own. Suffocating is my biggest fear. If I cannot care for myself, I am out of here. I will not be a burden to anyone. I have hurt everyday of my life, I am worn out. I watched a short documentary about death by dignity, and there was a guy with the same fear which brought him to that conclusion. I am thankful that the right to die act is starting to be passed in some areas, because that is a suffering no one should have a say over except for you.\n\nI am 26 tomorrow and just got to a place where I am trying to plan my career and my life. I understand it is usually a gradual progression, but I just dont know what to anticipate as far as mobility goes. My family noticed when I was at least a toddler that I was not as functional as other kids. When I got to kindergarten the school noticed it too but it was stamped as \"delayed motor skills\". I did ot and adaptive gym from k-11 and was eventually taken out of those because the school did not believe I still had problems. I remember struggling to ride a bike and tie my shoes. But that was also highly visible to other kids so I was tormented over it for a while by them.\n\nMy mom was the worst offender on that front though. Teenage parent who did not and does not give a shit. My shortcomings made her look bad. I broke my leg and ankle when I was young. I could not use the crutches so I had a walker. I did not have the arm strength to use the walker to pull myself on the porch from a lower step and she thought it was pathetic. I got screamed at in a store for not being able to walk in heels I had to wear for her wedding. I feel so bad, knowing someone else was tormented like that. I was an embarrassment to my family too. I was sway backed, ugly, nearly blind and clumsy. My bullies were never at school. My bullies were at home, led by my mother. I would cry in pain and be told to shut up and that I was faking. I finally quit saying anything, litterally, and no one noticed. The beating and kicking did not hurt as much as the disgust and hate.\nYears later my mother was diagnosed with CMT. (Though she did not have pain) instead of letting me know I could have the same thing and should get tested, I was never told. My siblings were, but not me. I finally heard about it when I was 60. Got a dna test and have an axonal form (type 2b1/4c1) and a demylanating form (type 3/dejerine sottas). I am not a crazy faker after all. It is different for everyone. Even if in the same family and same type. It is not a death wish for me, it is an end to suffering. They have certain protocals to follow and must be within 6 months of death. If I could do it now, I would. No, not suicidal, just worn out and tired of pain. Maybe if I had medical coverage and/or a Dr who believed me, I would feel different, but I doubt it. I would assume your in US if medical coverage is a struggle. I really hope in the next few years we see some reform to help everyone get the medical attention they need without going bankrupt. \n\nBut yeah absolutely, I can only imagine the suffering. I would feel the same way. Yes, I am. Illeagals get medical care, because it is inhumane to with hold basic care. But citizens do not have a right to it. I am so sorry you went through that with your family. Your mother and mine seem pretty similar in their mindsets. Mine never investigated anything unless it was about herself, and belittled everyone else's issues. \n\nWhen you went for the DNA, did you doc say you need to see a genetic counselor first? Mine will not write the DNA script until then. I was just confused because I thought the counselor was for interpretation of the results. Do they go over the consequences of what the DNA test could be before you commit to it? I would imagine it is for insurance eligibility. I was diagnosed in my early teens.  The first lesson it taught me was to try and have as few long term plans as possible. I got diagnosed at 20, when I was at university. I developed such an interest in \\*exactly\\* how CMT worked, down to a molecular level, that I ended up switching my major to molecular biology from an entirely different science. \n\nUltimately, this had a bit of a downside, in that people working in molecular biology are assumed to possess basic (for the discipline) skills like microdissection (being able to slice things very precisely while viewing them through a microscope). One of the impacts CMT has on me--which I do not think is by any means universal but one of my particular quirks--is that my hands shake. Some days worse than others, but it is quite unpredictable and it is just something I have to work around. \n\nI try to get as much safe exercise as I can. I avoid situations with a high risk of injury. I do not want to be, for instance, on crutches for a broken leg for weeks because the muscle I would lose from being unable to walk for a while I am not sure I could ever rebuild properly. \n\nGenerally speaking, it would be good if you could find a way to transition to a less physical job. It would be good if you could find some less physical hobbies, or at least hobbies with minimal chance of injury. Knowing this does not necessarily translate into being good at a new career or suddenly enjoying board games more than mountain climbing, but it is something to bear in mind as you make choices. Being active is good, for building and maintaining muscle, as long as you are not injured. AFOs might also help, if you are unstable. Many people exercise while wearing them. \n\nSubtype can have some impact on prognosis. If anyone in your family has had a genetic test you most likely have the same type they have. I did go to a genetic councelor first. I had my mother's results and they said it was not considered a positive for cmt and since I am flat footed, they said I did not qualify for a genetic test. I went a round about way to get it. I had a dna test done by 23 and me, forwarded it to Promethease and they ran it anonymously. I was given a number and agreed they could use my results and dna. I took the results back to the genetics office and they accepted them. I took the results to MDA and was told dna did not matter, just the Dr's clinical opinion does. She says I do not have it because I am flat footed. MDA stood by her, so I have gone untreated for years. I feel for you. I was diagnosed at 13 but remember the years prior being forced to do things that was damn near impossible. \n\nI cannot even imagine what it would be like in adulthood when people have stopped treating you as a kid. I am glad you do not have to! I am planning on becoming a teacher, it fits my income and required activity level. I would say you should look at jobs that will give you the schedule, income, and activity level you can handle and then find out which one would give you the most job satisfaction. I was diagnosed at 18 years old.\r  \nIn my case, I decided that I only needed a sedentary job.\r  \nAnd in general, this disease requires work that requires extremely mental effort.\r  \nPhysical activity should only be used to maintain physical fitness.", "Wanted to wish everyone a happy Friday and hope you all have a great weekend :)  Thanks!

Snow Chains was my feeble attempt at humor on a topic that just frustrates me, trying to get around my own house, use the house as it was intended.  \n\nI was thinking something close to what you mentioned, a chains type thing.

The problem with metal studs on rubber wheels is that they become slippery on hard polished surfaces, such as hardwood floors, tiles, parquet, etc. So for indoor use in homes with both hard floors and carpets, another solution would be needed.\n\nCoincidentally, i used to have a Roomba vacuum cleaner, and it navigated both hard floors and carpets fine.

", "Variant of Uncertain Significance Hereditary Neuropathy Panel I am going crazy.\n\nAfter years of suffering for a mystery illness I stumbled across CMT and immediately set up testing. I had a full comprehensive neuropathy genetic panel done so that I could get a clear \"yes\" or \"no\". I am still paying off debt from testing for multiple sclerosis 3+ years ago so I avoid going to the doctor now because they have done nothing to help me anyways. I should have known it would not be as simple as a spit sample - I have a variant of uncertain significance on my AARS gene, which is associated with Charcot Marie Tooth, but the specific variant I have has not been thoroughly figured out yet. If it was completely not something to worry about it would be listed as \"benign\" and if it was definitely bad it would be \"pathogenic\". \n\nI initially thought it was on my mothers side of the family but I asked around and there was no mention of anyone on that side having problems. I have not been able to get much family history from my dads side because my dad and grandparents never kept contact with them when they moved from Iowa to Arizona. I only knew my dad and grandparents who are all now dead. My father suffered from a mystery illness as well that caused him to get severe vertigo and fall down a lot but the doctors never figured it out and blamed it on a biking accident he had as a teen, but the more I think about it the more I think it would be CMT/hereditary neuropathy.  My father also had the coordination/clumsiness that I did along with high arched, boney looking feet with odd walk and the inability to run properly.  This morning I found out that my father needed leg braces as a small child which was a vital piece of information. He died in his sleep unexpectedly in 2017 and I am googling if it is possible to DNA cremated remains. \n\nI do not know where to go from here, everything lines up perfectly with CMT and my previous testing (lumbar puncture, MRI, scans, ultrasounds, blood tests, etc) never showed anything abnormal outside of wonky blood pressure when I am up and moving. Is it possible I have a subtype that has not be identified or am I just full of myself? I am so tired from just every day activity and the pain is getting worse.  My legs feel like they are full of wet sand, I have no sense of where my feet are unless I am looking at them, and my hands and arms are really beginning to hurt. I am also falling more and more which is both embarrassing and annoying because I got my hopes up that this testing was going to be a clear answer and it was not. I am so worried because my younger son did not walk until he was 16 months old and is becoming a real klutz and complains his feet hurt.  I am hoping to have my nerves conductivity tested again because they were on the low side of normal a few years ago and have definitely gotten a lot worse since then.

There are people who have been diagnosed with CMT who do not know their type after genetic testing. You are not alone. A CMT center of excellence could help diagnose you or rule it out. I live in AZ, and the closest one is at Cedar Sinai 413miles away. I think it might be worth making a trip out there. This seems to indicate that that gene mutation has been associated with CMT -  \n\nDo you have a geneticist helping you? When we did mine came up as an unidentified result, because it is rare and not a lot of people have tested with it. In fact they said they have only had 3 family groups show up with it. It is CMT 2A2.so we know it is that but they cannot say for sure just because there is just not enough tests for it. If that makes sense. I wonder if that is what yours is indicating? I live in Arizona I am trying to find a doctor who knows about CMT but I am not having much luck. This article is actually really helpful, thank you so much. \n\nI did have a genetic counselor helping me and she was the one who gave me the referral. My insurance would not cover her so I paid out of pocket. Before I agreed to pay the first time and schedule with her I was told she would review the findings with me when the test was done. Instead she just wrote up a really vague report and wants me to pay out of pocket again to talk about he results and this is exactly the kind of bait and switch nonsense that made me stop going to the doctors to begin with. A couple months ago when I first discovered CMT I contacted the PCP I had before giving up on finding an answer. It turns out she was arrested by the DEA for overprescribing pain medication and I still have not been able to locate the last of my medical records from her shut down office that is still being investigated. \n\nIt is just really exhausting, and I do not have it in me to find a new PCP and go through the whole rigamarole of \u201coh let us test for this first\u201d. I am hoping I am going to locate a doctor that I can afford who is going to give me an definitive answer. Also the variant I have on AARS is different than the one documented in this article. Same gene, but the variant Is different, I believe. Do not give up. It is exhausting but you are disease is not going away. I would strongly recommend joining the CMTUS group on Facebook as you can get a ton of answers and direction there as well. I just searched for the gene there and there is a lot of talk there about it. I did reach out to CMT USA but never got a response. If I ever find a good resource in AZ I will be sure to share! &gt;I just searched for the gene there and there is a lot of talk there about it.\n\nI just tried to do this but I get 0 results. What search term did you use? I get lots (are you in the right group?) here is an example ( ?? Am I in the right group?\n\nWhatever this is on Imgur I am joint thank you!\n\nI reached out to the woman in charge of CMT USA in my area from their website and did not get a response. I have found a few more resources as well that I am. Going to check out! The right group on facebook, when I search the group on Facebook I get lots of results. That is what I meant... Yes I got the info straight off the CMTUSA website If you think that your son is likely to have the same condition consider trying to get the same genetic panel run on him. If you both have the same genetic change and similar symptoms, it will be evidence that this genetic change is significant. \n\nA finding of the same genetic mutation for both of you would give you a lot more substance to talk about with a genetic counselor or a CMT Center of Excellence. Right now I do not know that they can tell you much more than is in the report because there is just nothing definitively known about the gene variant that you carry. \n\nI am sorry that this process is both exhausting and expensive. I think the best you can hope for is that a Center of Excellence can perhaps connect you with a researcher who is doing cutting edge work on this gene. I empathize with you when it comes to the struggle of undergoing a lot of testing and living with uncertainty and doubt. Unfortunately diagnosis can be very difficult in some cases.\n\nAccording to the information you have posted above you have a confirmed point mutation in the AARS gene. Because this specific substitution has not been reported in the literature (I re-checked just now in case something new had been published) it is impossible to say whether or not it is the cause of your symptoms. But in my (unprofessional) opinion it is not impossible that this could be yet another AARS mutation that cause a CMT phenotype. If it is, it could be a de novo mutation, in which case you would be the first in your lineage to have it, or it could be inherited. DNA extraction from cremated remains is almost certainly not possible, so testing your fathers remains is probably not a viable approach to look for more answers. Assuming your symptoms are caused by a novel CMT mutation, there sadly is not enough information at the moment to provide any exact answers. If I were in your situation I think I would do what others have been suggesting, namely to find a CMT center of excellence. At the very least they could rule out other potential causes, and if the only likely culprit ends up being this mutation then it might be described in the future. Your symptoms could also potentially be caused by something else, but of course the only way to find out for sure is more testing.", "CMT1A Calf Pain - Help! Hi CMT friends! I have CMT1A and experienced something I had never experienced before today. I wanted to check with you all to see if anyone has experienced this too or has any tips. \nSo, today I graduated college and planned to walk at graduation. Out of nowhere before the ceremony my calf muscle cramped like crazy. It has not stopped since. I am used to my feet feeing like they got put through the shredder each day but my calf is different. It feels like a constant Charlie horse or like the muscle in my calf is too short and is being stretched to max capacity. Has this happened to any of you all? If so, any tips to help it ease and go away other than some basic stretches? It usually happens to me sometimes while stretching. I just gives some hits on my calf and shake my legs and its gone after some time. Never had it happened elsewhere. This happens to me if I stand for too long. Standing is much harder for me than walking because of all the balance involved, and with drop foot and partial foot paralysis, it puts so much strain on the calves. \nHeating pad should help release it but it may come back while you sleep. Make sure you are hydrated because dehydration exacerbates these spasms. Water-soluble magnesium (I prefer Natural Calm) also helps me, but if you do not have any handy in your home, that is probably not helpful.

If possible.\n\nI am 25 and has had visible symptoms since 18. I would say i am mostly \"cosmetically\" affected right now. People look i bit because i walk funny. Balance is not good. Cannot stand on heels. Can stand on toes. I ride a bike daily but have noticed my right feet sometimes \"slides\" of the pedal forward. Maybe it is my drop foot? But other than that I still hike and go for walks and try to stay active.\n\nI do not wear AFO's or braces. I think AFOs look like a great piece of orthotics - but I feel like for now it is a little bit too much for how my CMT is progressed atm.\n\nAnkle braces on the other hand i believe would be very helpful to improve my walk. Especially after seeing ( i have wanted to get some. My walk i better, but I think it would help a lot. And the Ossur Foot Ups seem very discreet in the way they just snap to the laces. \n\nI am afraid though. Mainly because I think to myself that it will worsen my muscles because i am not \"working out\" the remaining muscles. I am I right to think that? What are your experiences? And can you recommend any discreet braces that might be better than the Foot Ups? I have had leg braces for four years and have only gained muscle. I exercise without them and am doing great! Sounds great! Congratulations. Which braces are you using? I would say that with braces you will be even better off as you will have more control of your movements therefore using your muscles more precisely. Yeah they are not eye catchers in the way you want but I got over that stigma fairly quickly. I wish I took wearing braces more seriously.. I rolled my right ankle one too many times, and now have a fractured cuboid bone in my foot.

I want to get Fabtek Reaktiv braces. The xTern look amazing! Use ace bandage wraps. They are not as ridged and you can adjust them depending on your needs that day.

If I was falling a lot I would look into braces as a broken ankle/ leg will set you back and cause atrophy that is difficult to come back from. I have always been hesitant to wear braces as I also suspected that relying on the brace would hasten my foot weakness. I recently listened to a podcast with Peter Attia and Irene Davis from from the Spaulding Running Center out of Harvard with gave more credence to my concern. Currently, I wear arch supports in a minimalist shoe which works well for me. For me it comes down to whether the braces would prevent falls. If I am not falling/tripping frequently I would wait.

However, I do not really have much to compare to in order to see if what was done to me was beneficial. The high instep is part of the high arch shape (the medical term is pes cavus) which is characteristic of CMT.

I have always wanted to get it but I have to toddlers and I would never have the down time.i often am jealous of people who can walk without pain or just walk normal Just having toddlers would be exhausting for anyone! My advice though is do not wait too long. I was told that recovery is one month for every decade of your age. And if you can have more years with less pain, that is a big deal. I think I might have waited too long. I also had a major back injury that is turning out to be just as bad as CMT. So my other piece of advice is to take care of your back. Seriously.

(Not looking for medical advice just experiences) First a note: I am not looking to find medication combinations or anything like that. I trust my doctors to do that work. \n\nI am in the process of working with a pain specialist to try and find a medication or combination of medications to help relieve symptoms. \n\nI am finding the process a bit tedious (I am on my fourth medication and have had side affects and no pain relief on each) so I was wondering if anyone out there has gone through the process of whittling down medications to find one or a combination that helps. How long did it take of trying before you landed on the right one for you?\n\nI guess I am just hoping for some motivation to get me through another trial of medication that potentially will make me feel worse than better (or perhaps will miraculously be helpful). \n\nInfo: I have HNPP which is the genetic opposite of CMT but presents similarly and is treated similarly.\n\nThanks!

CMT? hey for the past 9 months or so I have been having weird sensations along only my left fingernails and joints, not necessarily pain but discomfort and annoyance that comes and goes in intensity but is always there, got similar situation on my hip left side but not as bad. Is there any tests I should get done for this to rule out anything. are cmt patients more likely just to get these unexplainable problems? I can still function with my hands they sometime lock up for a second as they are hypermobile but that is about it. Its frustrating having these health problems but no known cause for me to tackle As your nerves get dammaged, they cannot carry the messages to your muscles correctly.\nI have had one limb at a time, or just one whole side at a time hurt, get weak, or feel asleep. Muscle twitches, jerks, cramps, spasms and \"startle\" breaths are all the constantly changing symptoms of cmt.\nEach or all can last weeks or months. Even the same type can be different one person to another. It can be different every day.", "What are reasons not to get surgery? Hi,\n\nI have CMTX1 and I am a 25 year old male.\n\nI am not very affected (yet I guess). Do not wear braces or \u201celastics\u201d and gets through the day without tripping. With the right shoes I can hike and be active. My CMT is noticeable though. People ask me if I am hurt and such.\n\nI do feel unbalanced, noisy walking, have tripped a lot on longer exhausting walks, sometimes my right foot slides of my bike pedal, I am not very active in my every day life due to my feet, hate the dark since it makes me unsteady, have trouble standing still in the same spot and so on.\n\nI live in a country with free healthcare and my mother has been offered a surgery. She still walks without any help (56 year old) but her feet start to look crooked and she walks slow. \n\nI am thinking about reaching out to get surgery done. When looking at someone like  it looks like true magic. I know it is a big surgery and that you should not just get it done because of something you saw on Instagram. \n\nI do have 1) time to get it done and 2) possibility of getting it done for free. \n\nWhat are reasons not to get it at this \u201cearly age\u201d?\n\n( Are you referring to heel cord extension? It is a common surgery done to give your ankle more range of motion to limit tripping and help with walking. It will NOT however cure all your problems. \nLiving in a country with free healthcare obviously the best thing to do is talk to your doctor. They can assess your range of motion and decide wether it is necessary or wether you can just focus on stretching. I was diagnosed early and did all sorts of physio and as a result did not need surgery. The biggest reason right now for not having the surgery is possible exposure to COVID in the hospital. I am in California and we are virtually shut down again. If that is not a big problem where you are, the two other big reasons are time and money, but you have time and can get it for free. Then there is the problem of not having access to the right surgeon. Research and at least two opinions, three would be better, would help there. The last reason I can think of is more personal, which is that no one wants to endure the recovery from surgery. It is a bitch, believe me. I was told that for every decade of age, expect a full month of recovery. You might also just have a lot of trepidation about doing it, and my advice there is to trust your instincts and wait. If you are mentally ready, you will do better IMHO. \n\nHaving said all of that, your ankle looks pretty far out of alignment with your heel. That is how mine looked when I had a tendon transfer in my early thirties. Even though my surgeon had little experience with that, and I regret not doing more research to find the right doc, it still helped a great deal. I am a little older than your mom and should have it redone now (and done for the first time on the other foot) I am holding off because of COVID, but the bigger reason is that I am not mentally ready right now in spite of having a lot of pain. \n\n*Edited for typos.\n\nI hope that helps. Good luck! pain manageable? No pain. Where does pain come from? I mean what to look for? well that is great  reason not to That is also my main reason not to do surgery. But I am thinking it could be an investment in the future not to wait. What do you say? I had surgeries done on both feet in 1990-1991. Best thing I ever did. It changed my life for the better. Removed all the pain that I had and straightened my feet too. It basically gave me 20 more years of better mobility. Then the positive effects started wearing off. Still, I would never hesitate to recommend it, it can be a life changer for the better! The problems can come back. The deformities happen due to tendons contracting, and they will continue to tighten and contract as you age - it is why it gets worse as we age. So, this is not necessarily a stop. You may of course no this, but I have seen others post this that do not know that.   \n\n\nThe other reason - recovery time. General surgery risks. Time off your feet is time you are not active and can get worse.", "CMT Impact on weight lifting?

My daughter recently became of age where she is able to start drivers ed.  Her orthopedic surgeon had referred her to occupational therapy to get a driving evaluation done.  In the end it was recommended that she learn to drive with hand controls because between her AFOs and lack of feeling in her feet she did not fare to well with gas/brake pedals on the test.\n\nHow is driving for you folks that drive?  Are you driving normal vehicles or have mods installed?  Do you have issues with reaction time? Do you utilize handicap placards?   \n\nI have found that her learning to drive is going to be a pretty expensive endeavor, but I am going to do all I can to not rob her of this teenage milestone lol. \n\nSide note if you want a great laugh\u2014\n\nLady doing evaluation, \u201cSo what kind of car will you be driving?\u201d\n\nDaughter, \u201cI see myself driving a 1967 Chevy Impala\u201d\n\nMe, Laughing my ass off. \n\nHaha I was like, um yeah keep dreaming kiddo.

They can potentially pay for your daughters driving eval, lessons, and any car modifications (hand controls, wheelchair ramp on a van if necessary, etc.). It is a long process but working with them has saved me a lot of $$ by not having to deal with these expenses alone.  Its amazing, but yes an automatic is prefered. I been through the same process so let me know if you have any questions :) Thank you!  Will have some research to do now\u2014looking briefly who knew so many car dealers will pay a large portion of adaptive controls for vehicles if you buy a car from them lol.  I have hand controls since I took my driver's license. Despite still having the ability to drive with pedals as usual.  I assume you are in the US (I am from Europe), but the modification should be similar. I have no issue with reaction times, the car reacts fine as well. About 6 years ago I left my construction job because it was just too much strain on my body and I found a job driving. It is something I was able to do with little to no added strain. I have been driving ever since but in the last two years I have had to switch to an automatic transmission. My feet and legs would be in too much pain by the end of the day. the change was fine at first but now it is hard to keep my hands on the wheel and hold my arms up. And the leg cramps are getting seriously painful.  Not sure how much longer I can keep it up. Even short trips are starting to ware on me. ", "Anyone else have a lingering fear that they are going to die alone? First off, sorry if this comes off as an angsty teenage rant, but I feel I need to get this off my chest. So, I (16m) am going through one of the more heavy slumps I have been through in a while. I broke down texting with a friend a couple days ago after a rough day at school, where I got rejected by my crush. I have been through 4 operations in two years, and am currently on crutches around school. Over the past two years, I kept a lot of thoughts like the one in the title bottled up in the back of my mind, but after that day, it all came flooding to me, and broke down in tears in my room at home. It was bad at the time, and, ever since, I will go through periods where nothing seems to be worth the effort. Even after I recover from my operations, I will still have Cmt, which will still deteriorate my hands and screw with my legs, and on top of this I have got Scoliosis and a pigeon chest. This all makes me feel as though the chances of me being alone for the rest of my life is a real possibility. It is a thought that lingers in the back of mind now, and I cannot seem to shake it. Sorry if this is an absolute mess to read. We ALL die alone. Death isnt shared. Even if you die at the same time as someone else for the same reason in the same place; you each still have to confront your own death, alone. It does not come over as a teenage rant or a mess to read.\n\nI think most people fear dying alone, its a natural fear but life is full of surprises and you still have years to meet people. \n\n(My wife is a CMT sufferer) It is great that you have a friend who you can confide in, but you should also keep in mind that you are dealing with stress way beyond the usual teenage bullshit that most other people your age will never experience. Have you thought about seeing a therapist? You need to take care of your mental health just as much as your physical health. Talking to a professional can create a safe space to voice these thoughts, check them, and hopefully gain a larger understanding about yourself and your needs.\n\nRegular mental health checkups are something that I wish I had started doing earlier in life, but it took me a long time to shake the stigma that going to therapy meant something was wrong with me and not a completely normal thing to do. Absolutely, I had a lot of these same feelings as a teenager. I was so clumsy and weak I thought nobody would ever want to be with me. It gradually gets better and better. In college you will meet a lot of accepting people and you will start to fear judgement less. I am 29 now and while my CMT is progressing I honestly do not feel like it had any effect whatsoever on my romantic life. It can be a blessing in disguise, it is good to weed people out of your life if they cannot tolerate your neuropathy.  \n\nNone of that is to say that what you are going through now is not difficult  I promise you though, there are a lot of good people out there who do not care at all that you need crutches. Do not give up hope.  I was in a similar situation as you.  I was a fairly normal young child, popular, lots of friends.  Around the age of 10 my body fell apart.  Quit playing sports, became very quiet, and lost confidence in myself.  Developed noticable kyphosis of the spine, had 4 surgeries on my legs, was home schooled my last two years of high school.\n\nAfter my first year of college without ever talking to anyone, I decided to make a change, conduct an experiment.  I started talking to everyone, making small talk with people in my classes, etc.  I quickly made friends.  This new found confidence carried into my career when I left college.\n\nAt my first job, I met a girl and we became friends.  Eventually we started dating.  After our first date I explained CMT to her.  She told me she would never even noticed anything was wrong with me.  She did not care.  Now we have two kids that (CMT free thanks to IVF).  \n\nDo not give up hope and believe in yourself.  Do not care what others think.  You will be fine. Do you have disabled friends? Make some. What are you passionate about? Pursue that. It makes you interesting to other people. Do not wallow. You get what you get. And you got a life with CMT. Be your future self's best friend. Invest in yourself. People will admire you if you have a positive attitude and a can-do spirit - whatever that means for you. Go to college. Meet like-minded people. You are future tripping about something that has not even happened yet. Why do that to yourself? Think about it. If you had a friend that you really cared about that was going through what you are going  through now, what would you tell them? Be your own best friend. Be kind to yourself. Its interesting to read the posts of people that struggle with this stuff then to see the positive replies. Unfortunately when it boils down to it is not that just sugarcoating the situation? Yeah there is the glass half full or it could be worse perspectives but in reality it is what it is and it sucks. Especially more for some than others.\n\nI struggle with cmt...I do not know what type I have but it sucks. I do not think it matters to spend the time and money to figure it out because it wont change the fact I have what I have. Yeah I am grateful I am still walking but the whole thing has been bad since I can remember. I am not a miserable person lol but it definitely has an impact on my quality of life not for the better by any means. Blah I have grown up with CMT and I am 22 now and it is definitely been hard and still is. Those breakdowns you have, I get them still today every now and then. It sucks but I also feel that it is okay for me to breakdown because CMT is not easy and we have to be strong everyday. \n\nOn the bright side, you are young and have so time to meet people. Try to socialize and not worry so much about your issues. Even though CMT is a big part of you, you cannot let it define you. \n\nYou can always message me if you ever want to chat. I love my husband with CMT. It is a pretty obvious case too. He walks like a soldier with high knees of he would always fall over his own feet. His hands shake like crazy. I love hiking, rock climbing, painting, etc. and he cannot do any of those things with me due to the limits of his disability, but that is okay and I still love the heck out of him. He tries his best to keep up and I do my best to slow down. We watch movies, and go on slow walks, I let him drive everywhere because he enjoys it and I love his improve comedy routines and political rants because while I was doing sports growing up he was strengthening other hobbies that worked for him. It balances beautifully and I am sure you will find someone too. I can tell you my story with CMT. I was always clumsy in sports in high school but never let CMT stop me from trying. I had obvious motor issue skills and got into fights because of bullying about it in high school. It made me tougher but I built up a denial about to myself that I could beat this disease, boy was I wrong. You do not beat this thing you work around it and hopefully find something positive you can do to make a living that your body can handle. Before being diagnosed I became a UPS employee and started driving at 21. All my doctors had failed to correctly diagnose me before I ruptured ligaments and peronial tendons at the age of 22. They saw someone who was strong so they would say I had plantar fasciitis or tendonitis and I believed them. After driving as UPS driver I remember coming home to go on vacation and I busted my ass all Friday to get home early and when I got home my legs felt a different type of fatigue. Felt like I sand bags in my legs something I never experienced in sport or any other type of exercise that I regularly did. Shortly after I started tripping over my own feet at work and eventually ended up tearing my ankle apart. I was raised by a tough single parent and I was going to keep going, I was going to beat this shit i thought, so I double braced my ankle first with 2 socks to protect my foot from the braces tearing the skin a compression brace and then a laced brace. I went through this for a year torturing myself day in and day out to take care of my then girlfriend of 4 years. I did this until the pain was unbearable and I could not lift my foot anymore. My body reached its breaking point. I saw a doctor who broke the news that I had CMT. Man was that a dark time in my life. I ended up having failed surgery after surgery to try and repair my foot and ankle. After 5 surgeries over 3 years I got to a point where I could finally walk again. The aftermath was a loss of financial stability. I lost my apartment and my girlfriend left me because of my depression, illness, and loss of financial making ability. I was 26 year old grumpy old man being in pain so much of the time. I had video game addiction along with pain killer addiction that I realized needed fixing. I decided to go to college and restart a new career to get back what I had lost. I am now 4.0 GPA senior about to graduate next year. I have a new girlfriend and we share an apartment together. She is so accepting of me is scares the shit out of me to be honest. I feel I will get left again when things get hard but for people like us things are always hard. Every day is a fight just to get out of bed the day after going to the gym. The more you fight the more you learn to work around this disease YOU CANNOT BEAT IT. It took me 5 years to realize I was doing more damage than good fighting this disease like everyone told me to do. This disease does not mean you will end up alone, only you can decide that with your attitude and how hard you try. If you do end up alone be happy in that enjoy it, lots of people are single and happy. My biggest issue was letting the pain taint my personality I get grumpy and am miserable to be around when my pain is kicking my ass on certain days and my girlfriend is understanding. I know this is a long rant but just realize we are fighting a hell of disease it robs you of your pride but gives you compassion. I lets you see life in different lens. It slows you down to see fragility  of life itself and gives a better appreciation for the life you have. I hope this does not discourage you because this road is tough and has many bumps, but it is how react to them that makes you who you are. Being alone should be the last thing we worry about but the worries are real. I try to just imagine being happy to see the next day working on myself to see where life takes me next. Hugs!

I have no idea what to expect now. Do I need to find a CMT specialist? I began having odd, random  neurological problems beginning last spring; drop foot in my right foot, which resolved itself after about one month. Then drop foot in my left foot which lasted about 6 weeks about 2months later. Advanced neuropathy in both feet and legs. Balance problems, weakness in my right arm. Spinal issues were ruled out, as was MS. I went to Mayo Clinic where they gave me a diagnosis of CMT, pending a genetic test. I received a phone call today from my neurologist today informing me that I have a genetic subtype of CMT. My appointment with her is not until April 1, so until then I have a feeling I will be driving myself crazy wondering what this actually means. She had informed me after I got back from Mayo that there is no treatment available for CMT, to slow down its progression. It this accurate? I am 60 years old, and just trying to not be scared out of my wits until I can see her and get some answers. Any information would be appreciated! No need to be alarmed! CMT is a disease that presents itself in many different ways to different people. You can look up your subtype and see a little more detailed description. It is actually very unusual to be diagnosed at a later age such as yours. CMT is degenerative which means it gets worse over time but this varies greatly. Often one might find no change for decades or degeneration in a matter of years but there is no definitive guideline. It sounds like yours did not affect you very much at all until quite late. It is true there is currently no treatment (although this sub keeps track of some promising treatments in development), instead treatment means physio and streching to mantain mobility and strength. The most important thing is to stay motivated, all of us on here just cope with it and live our lives. If you want ask any questions or even just want to talk about it, this is the place to do it. Thank you! Yes, I have not really had any symptoms until this past year, and then things began happening quite rapidly. I am the first one in my family to show symptoms of CMT so this diagnosis is quite startling. I appreciate you taking the time to get back to me! No problem. I am happy to help I have CMT type 2A. It is genetic in my family, so I was diagnosed at 5 or 6 and have been wearing AFO\u2019s since then (and currently waiting on my first ever pair of KAFO\u2019s at 22 years old). That is about the only treatment, braces and PT. My neurologist in central Texas specializes in neuromuscular diseases, though that might be far from you. I just participated in a clinical study for CMT at the University of Iowa hospital with Dr. Shy, so maybe look into those studies and see if you can contribute to their research if you would like!  You live in central Texas? I am just outside Austin and have not found a decent neurologist since I was 18. I am currently seeing an orthopedic surgeon in Galveston.  Yes! My neurologist is in Round Rock, Adam Horvit at Central Texas Neurologist Consultants. I have seen an orthopedic surgeon in Austin too, but it turned out to be an issue with my brace I will have to check him out. The couple others I have seen in Austin were not very bright. ", "New Joiner! Odd interaction at ortho Hi all-just came across this subreddit today and glad to see all the positivity. Kind of a weird situation for me, I went to the orthopedic for some back pain and hip pain and during my exam she asked if I had ever heard of CMT (I had not) and recommended I look it up. She asked this after noticing my high arched feet and inquired as to whether it was genetic (neither parent has them as big as me) I have had high arches for as long as I could remember. \n\nBeing an anxious person I semi freaked after googling after the exam and scheduled an appointment with a neurologist. He ran me through like physical tests (reflexes, walking on heels, etc). Nothing electric just the manual exam. He said basically everything looked normal, and that if I wanted to take the blood/DNA test I could but he did not see the point as in his words \u201cyou have no symptoms really and there is no cure\u201d. This struck me as a little odd. \n\nLittle more background, I am 29 and have not really had any major physical issues until this minor back/hip pain. Have a bunch of cousins and two brothers and no one has CMT to my knowledge and neither parents seems to.\n\nSo my question is-is this a normal experience? An orthopedic suggesting CMT just by looking at my feet? Do people with high arches usually develop this? Apologies for the wall of text and al the questions it was just such an odd experience I was not sure if I was missing something There could be other reasons but the best thing to do would be to get a dna test ^ That does seem odd for them to bring it up based on just arches. Not even fucked toes to top it off?? By 29, you would expect to see symptoms in even mild cases. \n\n\\&gt; An orthopedic suggesting CMT just by looking at my feet? Do people with high arches usually develop this? \n\nDo you mean do we have these weird experiences with doctors, or that high arches lead to developing CMT? If the latter, it is the other way around. Nerve issues screw the muscles and tendons, screwing the foot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is no harm in the blood test (unless financial, depending on where you are), so it might be nice just to close the door on this for good. High arches (*\"pes cavus\"*) is one of the most common features in most forms of CMT. Because CMT is often undiagnosed, is misdiagnosed or is diagnosed very late in life, an argument could be made that getting more people who show signs of CMT to have a clinical evaluation could result in more diagnoses. However, about 10% of the general population has pes cavus while less than 1% have any form of CMT, so if pes cavus is used as the only criterion for recommending a clinical evaluation you would end up with a lot of false positives. In one study where people with idiopathic pes cavus underwent surgery to correct the foot, they later tested all the patients and found that about 1 in three actually had a neurological disease. So it is possible to assume that the severity of the deformity is better to predict the likelihood that the pes cavus is caused by a neurological disease or not. It might just be that the orthopedic thought the severity of the deformity in this case was so big that it warranted a proper diagnosis.\n\nThe problem with taking a DNA test in your case is that absent any other symptoms, the neurologist will not know which ones to test for. Usually when there is a suspicion of CMT, the neurologist will narrow down the possible genotypes by first doing a physical evaluation, then electrodiagnostic testing to determine if it is a demyelinating or axonal type, and then based on those results they they can order a test either for one specific genotype of for several types at once. However because there are so many different types of CMT, it is often cost prohibited to test for too many at once, and it is still not even possible to test for all of them with one test. At the moment the best panel tests can do 45 or so different genotypes, but I would be surprised if any neurologist would order such a test without performing an electrodiagnostic test first.\n\nNow if you have no other symptoms except pes cavus, and the clinical assessment done by a neurologist came out normal, then the likelihood of you having CMT is very low. Sensory loss is another common feature in CMT, which cause the deep tendon reflexes (such as the knee-jerk reflex) to be reduced or absent, and so that is one of the things they will test for. There is usually muscle atrophy in the extremities, which the \"walking on the heels\" test is for. In most cases there is a family history. If all of these things are absent, then the only CMT types it could possibly be is one of the rare de novo mutations, which a standard gene panel will not detect anyways. \n\nI think in this case it looks like the pes cavus is likely not caused by CMT. But if you experience other symptoms in the future, then perhaps another evaluation by (ideally another) neurologist (it is always a good idea to be evaluated by different people) could be warranted. If you do have CMT, then it will progress slowly over time, so other symptoms should emerge as the disease progresses. &gt; Because CMT is often undiagnosed, is misdiagnosed or is diagnosed very late in life, an argument could be made that getting more people who show signs of CMT to have a clinical evaluation could result in more diagnoses.\n\nDo you have any papers that support that? From the research I am doing, the papers I have come across distinctly say that the majority of people will show symptoms in the first decade of life \\ and whereas \"a small proportion of patients with CMT-1A show signs of the disease later in life\"\\  \n\n\n1.

It can just be that a relatively common CMT mutation originated with you. The extra copy of PMP22 that causes CMT1A has originated many times in many people, it has not all come down from a common ancestor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnical stuff: There was a flurry of research in the late 90s, as I recall, trying to decide if this was a genetic hot spot where mutations were particularly likely to occur since this mutation has originated anew many times all over the world. Eventually I think they decided no--and also that genetic hot spots are probably a myth and it is just survivor bias--the extra copy of PMP22 does not kill you outright like duplicates of some other genes would so it shows up more often.\n\n \n\nA genetic screen would catch most cases but I do not think it is necessary here. Your ortho thought it was worth screening you, someone with more knowledge screened you and found that you do not have any other signs. Pes cavus alone is like 10 times more likely to just happen without being involved in CMT so chances are you are fine. If you develop symptoms later in life you could investigate it further but I doubt you will need to. Just get tested, even if it is to confirm or clear your mind. I had a chance diagnosis because my nurse in elementary school had a husband and daughter with CMT. Her husband worked at a hospital that from day one helped me know what it could be and tested for more than just CMT. Some doctors will not even run tests to check, but if it is offered, I say go for it. \n\nIt is hard to find doctors who know about CMT, plus CMT has a variety of symptoms that doctors do not always link together. Eyesight, deafness, breathing or swallowing problems, weakness, etc. aside from the physical extremities. If you find you do have CMT, it is easier to know next steps and what the years may look like ahead. Thanks all really appreciate the great answers!! Seems like a lot of people are suggesting testing. Honestly looking for testing online is kind of overwhelming, what is the process for this? Is paying out of pocket a possibility of doctor is being difficult? Cost is not too much of a concern at the moment and just wanted to see options. I guess one more question/thing I wanted to add (sorry again for all the questions). Years ago I did one of those 23andme tests and uploaded my Raw DNA into one of those aggregators, Promethease. Now part of their analysis includes CMT, including PMP22 (see attached pics). I know there is a lot of doubt/controversy over these saliva DNA tests but not sure how much weight they hold. This does not impact my decision for blood test just was curious. For the record there are around 48 markers it seems for CMT listed here and I appear to be \u201cgood\u201d( their words not mine) for all of them. Sorry here is the link\n\n\n\n\nSeems like all the big mutations like PMP22 are on here but I know definitely it does not include all them. Just wanted to see how useful/worthless these were Seems like a doctor who may be jumping down a rabbit hole without any real reason - high arched feet are one of many symptoms of CMT and if it is the only symptom you have, it really is not a red flag for genetic testing. A nerve velocity test should be adequate at this stage as there does not seem to be any indication you have the disease, and as nerve degredation stays dominant throughout adulthood in people with CMT, it should indicate whether your nerves are working as expected. Failing that, even a basic reflex test should have been conducted! A similar thing happened to me when I went to see a podiatrist about an ingrown toenail. She looked at my feet and asked if CMT ran in my family. I said I would never heard of it. For the record my only giveaway is high arches too.\n\nI am not in contact with my father or his side of the family but after researching CMT I realised the symptoms looked exactly like my Grandma's hands and feet. \n\nI reached out to my cousin and she confirmed that CMT runs in the family and I am going to the doctor's on Saturday to discuss it. \n\nSo for all those saying it is weird for chiropodists/podiatrists to randomly bring it up, I kind of agree but in my situation they were right and have saved me a lot of confusion in what will inevitably happen to my body. Thanks for getting back! Did you always have high arches or is this a new development? From my (beginning) research the high arches are a product of the nerves getting weaker and so if you were born with high arches and then have not had any symptoms up until adulthood does that usually mean you had hidden symptoms? I have always had really high arches but no other symptoms other than achy legs since childhood and now recently hammer toes.\n\nThe disease is progressive so I am not sure about hidden symptoms but they will definitely get worse as time goes on and they can come at any point (20s, 30, even old age). It is different for everyone.\n\nI am kind of in the same boat as you in terms of not knowing much about this disease that has suddenly appeared in our lives haha. I think you are right to get tested just in case though! Thanks this was super informative!!! Yea I do not really have any other symptoms other than the back/hip pain I originally went in for. Definitely will keep an eye out though in the future. Just a clarification though-hammer toes are known as one of the clinical signs but would not most people with really high arches (CMT or not) have some sort of \u201chammer\u201d? Or are the CMT ones much more pronounced? I was tested through a company called INVITAE. They took insurance, and when I got a positive CMT result (2A)...they tested my children for cheap and both came back negative :-) This reply turned out to be a novel so I apologize in advance. But I got a snazzy new Model M mechanical keyboard yesterday and this reply has been a great way to break it in..!\n\n&gt;Do you have any papers that support that?\n\nKind Of, but it depends on how rigorous you need the evidence to be. I have glossed over a lot of things to keep this short but I am sure we are pulling in the same direction so please assume that my intentions are good if you see something that is ambiguous. I have purposefully ignored confidence intervals in the papers I reference.\n\nMy claim was that \"CMT is often undiagnosed, is misdiagnosed or is diagnosed very late in life\". These are three related but distinct claims, so I will deal with each of them separately. \n\nI will address the last claim first, that **\"CMT is often diagnosed very late in life\"**. \n\nIt is true that the majority of people with CMT will show symptoms in the first decade of life, however that does not necessarily mean that they will be diagnosed in the first decade of their life! The average age at diagnosis varies between countries, but one study from New Zealand reported an average age at diagnosis of 34.1 , while another study from Denmark reported an average age at diagnosis of 42.5 years . Other studies I have read have all tended to report an average age at diagnosis at around 30. In the danish study sample, less than 30% of the confirmed CMT cases were diagnosed between the age of 0\u201329 years.\n\nFrom the discussion-section of the Danish study:\n*\"Due to the heterogeneous nature of CMT, it is reasonable to assume that many patients are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in cases with mild symptoms or atypical clinical presentation. The proportion of false-negatives might thus be high, and would yield a low sensitivity.\"*\n\nI find it reasonable to assume that the average age at diagnosis have gone down over the decades. As far as I know there is no published data that has enough granularity to see if this might be the case, but the danish study does seem to indicate that there is a sharp uptick in diagnosed cases since 2000. The authors of an Icelandic study found that the prevalence had risen compared to a 1960s study conducted on the same population, and credited that to a *\"higher number of neurologists and improved diagnostic methods\"*. However even in this study, which unlike many others looked at a fairly modern sample (1986-2006), the same pattern is seen: *\"Our patients typically had had a long history of symptoms before the diagnosis was made and the mean age at diagnosis was 31.8 years\"*.\n\nJust to add an anecdote as well, I was diagnosed genetically for 1A at age 14, and my mother who was 50 at that time got the diagnosis as well that same year. In the late 80s and early 90s doctors noted some irregularities in my motor skill developments but failed at the time to realize that it was CMT. There had also been an  attempt made by a famous hospital in my country at diagnosing my mother in the 60s, but the doctors back then was never able to reach a conclusive diagnosis, although they came pretty close! Both me and my mother had very obvious (in retrospect..) symptoms since childhood. Hopefully this is something that will be studied in the future, because early diagnosis will become very important once treatments starts to become available.\n\nIn conclusion I will concede that \"very late\" in life is a bit of an overstatement. However, with a mean age at diagnosis of ~30 years, and assuming that the age distribution of the population follows a rough normal distribution, then a more precise claim would be that \"CMT is most often diagnosed well into adulthood\". And even then, the amount of people that will be diagnosed \"very late\" in life (let us say at age 50+) will not be insignificant.\n\nThe second claim, that **\"CMT is often undiagnosed\"** is an interesting topic. As far as I am aware, there are no studies that have attempted to calculate the delta between recorded cases and the predicted prevalence in a population. One reason for this might be that determining the prevalence with any measure of accuracy is actually very hard. The most commonly referenced prevalence for CMT is one in 2500, which comes from a 1974 study of the population of Western Norway. (Fun fact: my maternal great-grandfather was one of the participants in that study!). \n\nMost epidemiological studies are done on a subset of the population of a country, and the results are then often generalized to the whole population. In 2010 another epidemiological study about CMT in Norway was published, and this study found a prevalence of one in ~1200, which is so high that some papers have considered it an outlier. However, that high number is more likely a result of their approach which was to meticulously search for all possible cases in different sources using multiple different methods.\n\nBut even with a meticulous effort like the one they performed, they admit that some cases was likely not included:\n\n*\"Sporadic cases and affected residing in eastern Akershus County from unknown CMT families without contact to the healthcare system is missed in this study. The clinical diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies is difficult (...)\"*\n\nOther epidemiological studies have tended to not be as exhaustive, and this could be one reason why the prevalence varies so much between different studies. A recent review of the epidemiology of CMT seems to rehash this view in the discussion section.\n\nAnother interesting finding that lends credibility to this view comes from a recent study on HNPP where the investigators performed next-generation sequencing on a large population of newborns to look for copy number variations. Then they compared the prevalence using this technique to earlier estimations of prevalence which was based on the number of recorded cases in a defined population. The delta between these two approaches was very high, indicating that the true number of affected people in the population was much higher than the number of previously identified cases. Now this is not directly comparable to CMT, because HNPP often has very subtle symptoms which could explain why the number of identified cases is so low compared to the actual number of cases in the population. However it serves as an example that shows that the only way to really know for sure is to test everyone, and absent that it is reasonable to assume that a notable amount of people with CMT in a population will be undiagnosed.\n\nThe last claim, that **\"CMT is often misdiagnosed\"** is the hardest to support with any literary sources. In fact I am not aware of any studies that directly address this. But my gut feeling about this, based on what I have read from others who have CMT, is that it is a common complaint. The \"journey\" to a final diagnosis seems to be a long and often frustrating one for many people. I have also heard about a handful of examples of people who where misdiagnosed with mild cerebral palsy early in life but who then got diagnosed with CMT later in life, but if that is widespread I cannot really say.\nI did ( that seems to back up the claim though. According to Ahmet Hoke, M.D., Ph.D., from the Johns Hopkins CMT Center:\n\n*\"At least half of the patients neurologist Ahmet Hoke sees at the CMT clinic have been misdiagnosed, he says.\"*\n\nSources:\n\n1.\nTheadom, A., Roxburgh, R., MacAulay, E., O'Grady, G., Burns, J., Parmar, P., ... &amp; Ao, B.T.

I do feel that given the advent of the internet and prevalence of high-quality online resources e.g. journals, papers etc, the age of diagnosis should be on the decrease, although I am not sure if anything has explored this specifically for CMT. The biggest issue to this however, and as you say, there seems to little research into, is the extent of misdiagnosis, which would be compounded by other issues such as access to healthcare as well as the quality of healthcare available.\n\nIn an ideal world, when a person has access to high-quality healthcare and is willing to go to the doctor when symptoms arise (which is not always the issue as parents may struggle with the potential acceptance that something may be significantly wrong with their child), a diagnosis should be made. But life is far from perfect, so it would be really interesting to see how this varies country to country, as well as across socio-economic status etc. It was my pleasure, I learned a lot from this exercise too. I share your views, and I think the point about acceptance is pretty interesting as it applies to my own experience as well. When I got the diagnosis, I had already known for many years that I had what ever my mother had, and we knew it ran in the family. But we were perfectly fine with not knowing the exact cause. \"It is what it is\" summarizes the sentiment pretty well, and a proper diagnosis only came about because a new doctor happened to become suspicious when seeing me for something unrelated and asked me if I would consider having some more tests done.\n\nI also think that a point can be made that hindsight is 20/20. Personally I tend to forget that CMT is not the only illness that affects the nerves and the muscles, and that from the perspective of a clinician diagnosing someone is incredibly complex. Out of all the patients that presents with various CMT-like symptoms, only a small percentage will actually be CMT. Differential diagnoses often take a lot of time and resources, and false positives and false negatives of any tests are a very real concern for everyone involved.\n\nAlthough I do not like the thought of it, a pragmatic solution for this and many other genetic illnesses is to enforce a screening program where whole genome sequencing are done on all infants to look for all known pathogenic variants.\n\nA topic which I almost never see discussed is CMT in relation to the poorer and less developed countries in the world. I am sure there is a gap in terms of both diagnosis and care between many countries. I am sure many people do not even have the \"luxury\" of attempting to seek out a diagnosis. &gt;I agree with almost all of this but I will note that a de novo mutation does not have to be exotic. It can just be that a relatively common CMT mutation originated with you.\n\nFor sure! I might not have been clear enough in the way I wrote it though because what I meant in this case was that if there is no family history and there is inconclusive or even absent medical signs then the only possibility left that it could be CMT is that it would be one of the exotic de novo types. That is the only feasible way CMT could be present without a family history and without signs that would be detected during a neurological examination. Common CMT types caused by a de novo mutation would normally be detected during the physical evaluation. The likelihood of having a genotype with an atypical clinical presentation that also arose de novo is so low that the likelihood that it is relevant to OP is very close to zero, but I just cannot help being pedantic some times. Oh, I see! You were not saying that all de novo mutations are exotic, just that it would probably be both de novo and also a less common type to have escaped diagnosis in the initial evaluation. Yes!", "Documentary Survey Hello again my fellow CMTers!\nHere is my final survey for class that is directed towards just documentary in general. This is to see if people outside of the CMT community would be interested in supporting a medical documentary. If I find that people are interested and willing to support it, then I can further pursue the production of a CMT documentary. \nFill it out and share away! \nThanks again for all of your support!\n", "Does anyone know of medications that help with the pain? Hello-\n\nI have cmt x and get a gnawing pain in my joints ( hands and feet). I also get burning, pins and needles, and have no sensation in one of my legs. I take gabapentin but it does not really help. I have tried tramadol and it does nothing. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? Thank you in advance. I took cymbalta as an antidepressant and it definitely helped with nerve pain. But not as an antidepressant. Withdrawal was awful. Like really really awful. There is a website dedicated to it:  Even still, I have entertained the idea of going back on for pain. I have been happy with cbd. I usually get a 1 to 1 thc cbd product. It is made sleeping a little better and anxiety is not an issue as much.  I am more mild on the cmt spectrum. Early diagnosis,  slow to no progression, feet and legs are my main concerns Thc is literally the only thing that helps me now too but it is not reasonable for every situation like work. I took cymbalta for several years on and off. You are right about the withdrawal being literal hell. Unfortunately it does nothing for my current level of pain. CBD is a little different... you can rub oil on joints and areas and it does not effect you nearly as much as THC. You definitely will not be sober but you will feel a mild relaxation. Granted I smoke a lot of dabs and flower... but there is a noticeable difference... kind of like a relaxation tea vs opiates. Does topical cbd work? I am on lyrica and it is been helping quite a bit with my pins and needles. If it is pure CBD, I am wondering what you mean by 'you definitely will not be sober'. I am familiar with the effects of THC too, and pure CBD isolate, inhaled or topical, is not intoxicating for me Some people it is not noticeable. I know some people who get \"loose\" but not \"stoned\" on cbd... it basically just makes me slightly more relaxed but the effects are definitely mainly dulling internal pain vs thc's cerebral high which is again the big difference. I have used cbd topical oils and they have worked for my hands and ankles. Hot baths, ibuprofen, thc  I am starting LDN in two weeks. I will let you all know how it goes. Interesting! I am trying balcofen so hopefully I can provide a positive update soon. I am on Baclofen. It seems to have reduced my nighttime leg cramping, which is so so so so welcome. My husband is probably tired of all of the screaming while he is trying to sleep. Haha. I have been on 1/2 a dozen different meds over the years, including narcotic prescriptions. (They used to give them out like candy 15 years ago). The only thing that gives relief for pain is marijuana. \nIf you cannot find it, CBD oil high in terpenes, is your next best bet. \nGood luck. I am sorry. Pain is life consuming. Dude that is the only thing I have found that works too. Thank God I am in California. Hehehe that is good! I have noticed I did not get any cramps yesterday despite it being winter... so that is a bonus at least. Hands still feel horrible though. I am 64 with CMT-2.  I am still walking without a walker,  but a walker is imminent. As is a wheelchair at some point. \nMy feet feel like they are incased in ski boots that are 6 sizes too small and weigh 50 pounds.  That never changes. My hands are involved with pain,  lack of feeling, cramping. Pins and needles, shooting pain, throbbing pain, jabbing pain are all constantly part of my daily life in my legs, ankles, feet and hands. My fatique is off the charts. And I am getting worse in every way every single week. How do I cope?\nI see my family doc once a month.  A psychologist every other week for whining and complaining, a psychiatrist twice a year.  I do aquatherapy twice a week. And I throw everything but the kitchen sink at my disease.\nCymbalta, Gabbapentin, Tramadol, Vicodin, Adderal(for ADD but I recommend it even with no ADD), THC (edibles work great along with vape cartridges), CBD cream. Biofreeze is good for leg cramps at night. I take all this EVERY SINGLE DAY. It is very hard to get Vicodin and tramadol together now that the CDC has screwed us all in the ass with their nonsensical war on pain medicine. But when I could take both together,  which I did for five years before being cut off the tramadol,  the combo worked great. Pain clinics in Ohio will not see you if you have THC in your urine. Another asinine regulation somebody dreamed up. As it is I am severely undermedicated, as crazy as that sounds.  The perfect medication for me would be around 20mg of oxycontin two or three times a day.  I would not be able to get that if I had a broken bone sticking though my leg and a trident embedded in my chest. \nFinally, lots of music every day. Sirius,  Spotify and You Tube all loudly combine to keep me rocking. And Eno, Jonn Serrie, rain and thunder,  ambient stuff later at night to help me sleep. I hope this gives CMT pain sufferers an overview of various treatments to try. Oh, I never touch alcohol. Pretty sure whatever lucidity I have would be destroyed if I tried to drink. It aint worth it. Anybody over 50- how did that last hangover treat you?\nGood luck and God Bless to all! Thank you for this very insightful response.\n\nI am sorry you have so much pain. It sucks that there is really no solution. I also smoke every day, eat edibles if it is a bad day, and that is the only thing that works for me. You know, writing about everything helps too!\nI was a sportswriter,  and now I am starting a book.  Online community, seeing a therapist, writing, reading, music, all these ancillary activities definitely help along with drugs. \nI will tell you what does not work- social media insanity and political hysteria. I have never been on Facebook or Twitter. I pulled back from all news, fake or real. It created unnecessary tension and stress and to what end? People that hate other people because of their political beliefs are worthless pieces of shit who must be avoided at all cost.  The negative energy is so damaging. I want friends who can disagree, call me every name in the book, but then pour me an N/A beer and fire up a joint! Fortunately I have a lot of those friends both in person and online.  Also\nfor positive energy, I go to church with my wife! \nI am glad my story was informative. Your insight that edibles and THC help you the most was right on.  If I had to give everything up but one thing, I would probably choose edibles from our dispensary as my form of relief. \nFinally,  as bad as this disease is I recognize I am just a small piece of a greater whole of pain and disease sufferers in this world. I need to stay grateful for what I have,  and prayerful for others. I guess I should even pray for those that hate me for my politics. Even if they are assholes! Yeah, I have noticed also if I get down it affects me physically.

Balance\n\nMix of numbness/hyper sensitivity", "Can I rant about something? I figured this would be the place to do it. My mom has CMT, as do I. When I was 2 or 3, she took a genetic test to be see if she had inherited CMT from her mom (she had no symptoms at the time). Then she got me and my two brothers tested. My brothers did not get it, but I did. We have CMTx. \n\nMy mom had no symptoms until she was 30. At that time, she gained symptoms, but she also developed an autoimmune disease called CIDP. It is impossible to tell what exactly is caused by the CIDP vs what is caused by the CMT, but we are sure the majority of her symptoms are CIDP related. \n\nMy mom's been sick for 15 years now.  She is very close to dying. The only thing that could save her is a Stem cell transplant that has cured/completely stopped in CIDP in many patients, as well as MS in MS patients.\n\nIt is technically still a clinical trial. My mom applied, but was denied because her records had CMT on it. She called and fought for the right for a compassionate care trial. She would get the stem cell transplant but would not be recorded for the clinical trial. The doctor their agreed, if she passed screening, he would allow compassionate care and either save her life or end her suffering. \n\nSo, we drove all the way to Chicago (we live in NC). She was tested (they took 20+ vials of blood!) In many ways, and the last thing she needed was to get cleared by their neurologist. Long story short, the neurologist declared she did not have CIDP and cited the reasons of a test she took. Mom took that test to her neurologist and a third party neurologist and both said according to the list she definitely had \"probable CIDP\" and could be argued to have \"definite CIDP\". The clinical trial only required probable CIDP. \n\nMom argued with them for 3 months. The neurologist refused to say she had CIDP because she also has CMT and he is a self-proclaimed \"purist\" that believes patients should not be treated with CMT. \n\nNow that the main place that is doing the trial rejected her, she is having an impossible time finding another place to do it. It is complete bullshit.

I think if i recall correctly they just did the test on my legs basically. Yeah, I *really* did not enjoy the sensations in my NCS.

It drives me nuts and I feel like I am just constantly buying new shoes. Tell me about it. I have had the same pair of shoes for over a year now. I desperately need new shoes but these are the only ones I can tolerate with my braces. Like you I have my good and bad days. Like today they are bugging the hell out of me.

Feel free to send a message if you prefer!", "Diagnosis Question So I have been going through neurologists and geneticists and I have had symptoms of a neuromuscular disorder since childhood. Mainly, I have muscle wasting in my hands and forearms, high arches, twitches, etc. My father\u2019s side has a lot of symptoms of CMT (flat feet, skinny legs below the knee). Now I am not here to  look for a diagnosis, but I want to know more about the hereditary aspect of the disease. If my father has one type, is it possible for me to have a different type? I am asking because I have vision/hearing issues and muscle wasting in my hands, whereas he does not. I could be wrong, but I believe it is the same gene type that runs in the family, so if they have a certain type, you will also have that type. That is what I thought. I am wondering if the vision/hearing issues are unrelated. They could be related. Even the same type of CMT can vary greatly from person to person, it progresses differently for everyone unfortunately. Many people with CMT can experience blurry vision. My vision issues are pigmentary glaucoma and retinal issues. Nobody else in my family had these issues, so I am not sure what to think of it. Recently discovered I may have CMT. A nerve biopsy was inconclusive but every other symptom is confirms the diagnosis. Currently scheduled for genetic testing July 31st.\n\nFrom my mad dash of learning about a disease I never heard of before, I came across a site that said something to the effect of: while one may be diagnosed with a specific type of CMT, that does not preclude a symptom from a different type of CMT also being in the CMT I have.\n\nAs I too have vision and hearing problems, I googled CMT and Vision. CMT and hearing.\n\nCMT and vision search returned several types of CMT with the common conditions of each type.\n\nI believe it was Type 5 that had the vision problems. I was and still am highly concerned because my vision specialist is at a loss with my vision problems and I have been seeing him and his associates for well over 5 years. They have sent me to even more refined specialist and they too are at a loss.\n\nI suggest you google CMT and Vision problems.\n\nGood luck! If you do not mind me asking, what kind of vision issues do you have? Several different problems. The most problematic for the past 10 years has been what the specialist believe is a retina problem. Therefore, the vision specialist I see is a retinologist.\n\nBasically, one eye has fluid leaking into it from unknown sources. Currently, I have to take 4 different eye drops every day just for 1 eye. 3 of the drops are now down to twice a day. 1 drop is once in the evening before bedtime.\n\nThe 3 different drops I take multiple times a day has ranged from once a day and only 1 type of drop, to 3 and four times a day. It gets to be very confusing. 4 different medications just for 1 eye and each medication can be put on hold or brought back into rotation. And each medication can range from single to multiple times a day. Sounds like my glaucoma drops I take. Yep. Can totally relate. As one of my specialist is fond of telling me, I am, 'a conundrum wrapped in an enigma.'\n\nQuote attributed to Winston Churchill It could still be related. My children have bladder issues related to the CMT whereas I do not. Symptoms vary so much person to person, even within the same family.", "Comfortable shoes? Possible? Hi! So, I was diagnosed with CMT a number of years a go. For me, high arches, hammer toes and pretty severe pain in my feet, especially with a lot of use. Balance issues...Pain in my hands, too... Lots of fun, right? I am not at the point where I am using any additional equipment, but that may be on the horizon. It is more about pain management at this point. All of that being said, once a year my family goes to Disney World. As much as I love it, by day 2 I am pretty screwed up. I lean heavily on Lidocane patches and Advil for relief. For shoes, I have tried many brands, some better than others. It seems like running shoes work better for me than walking or cross trainers. But I was wondering what you use. I would love to hear some success stories, or cautionary tales. Thanks! Sketchers brand, Oxford style, with Aircast braces. Do not hurt yourself - take breaks often.\n\n There are some reports by those of us with CMT where after we push ourselves too far, our muscles stop responding for hours, days, or permanently. I have had muscles stop working for a day before. \n\nDo not be afraid to use an electric wheelchair they provide. It is not worth losing your mobility permanently for pride. I have messed up my ankles worse than necessary for that reason. \n\nHave hope. This is a disability that is rarely fatal and leaves us with excellent quality of life with relatively few adaptive devices.\n\nBlessings. Go get custom arch supports. They are expensive but well worth it. I second this. Custom insoles made a big difference for me. I'be been using new balance shoes before, as I understand it they make models that are higher/wider/etc for orthopedic use. I also swear to Nike running shoes. For hiking I use smooth leather boots with good ancle support that are a number to big. I use thick wool hiking socks inside them, that way tgey act as a cusion against the harder boots which does not fuck up my feet as much. I advice everyone with CMT to visit an orthopedic clinic for insoles, shoes, and/or braces. They can help. Do you know what subtype you have? This has never happened to me and I am terrified. Relaxed fit subtype. \n\nIt is scary how little doctors know. It was never mentioned to me, just found it to be true among family and other CMT people. Research enough in a specific area, and you will know more than most of them. Too few stay up to date on specific illnesses and just ride on what they learned in pharmaceutical-funded schools. \n\nAnyway, do not be too worried. You will start feeling very hot and your muscles will hurt before the muscles just cannot move anymore. \n\nIt is life, we move on. It is far from the worst thing. And if you are even at Disney, you are clearly pretty well off. This is not the end of the world. Just a beginning with more information than before. Live life and enjoy it.\n\n It is just that I am well enough to lift weights and I usually push myself pretty hard. I am scared of just collapsing or worse hurting myself. I have never heard of anyone permanently loosing their ability to use a muscle after using it. That is not something to worry about with 1A. The worst thing that can happen will be soreness and in some cases some pain, that will take anything from one to a couple days to pass.  Ah, you meant subtype of cmt. Sorry.

The problem is that it seems like all of the studies were very poorly done, with the subjects barely training at all and most of them did not even complete their training despite how little there was. I agree with you there, more rigorous studies are definitely needed on CMT and exercise. I think there is good reasons to believe that in general, exercise is important in managing CMT though, however since every person with CMT is affected differently it is not easy to make generalizations. Further complicating the issue is the vast number of genetic variants, each with it is own pathogenesis which will influence both the ability to exercise and the effect the exercise will have.\n\nI think it is fair to believe though, that if hard exercise would cause acute loss of muscle function in people with CMT, it would have been mentioned in the literature by now. The fact that there are no case reports of this to me at least would suggest that if it does happen, it does so very rarely.\n\nThough this is only anecdotal, I have found that I am not able to achieve the same results as my healthy peers when it comes to resistance training. I tracked my progress when I was around 18 and did a serious attempt at building muscle mass, and I found that I initially had some improvement but that I quickly plateaued and was unable to improve my strength even after months trying under the supervision of a professional instructor. Since then I have switched from resistance training using weights and machines to hiking in uneven terrain with a lot of elevation, which has done wonders to my balance and overall strength. I am fortunate enough to live within walking distance from several mountains which makes it convenient to do this kind of exercise.\n\nI used to swim several times a week at the local pool with a group of friends, and this was also a great way to exercise. If I had the opportunity I would love to continue doing that. I do not mean to be rude asking this, but were you eating enough when you were training? Were you using periodization? I am just wondering. I were eating enough, but not utilizing periodization. I kept increasing the load until at one point I had progressed to a weight that was too heavy. And I never managed to go beyond that. I did struggle with fatigue though, more so than I do normally, but I kept pushing for quite some time to see if I could progress further. I have been thinking about trying again with more preparation and better logging, but I think my wrists are so weak now they will probably be the thing that gives out first. \n\nAfter hiking for several years years, I was in the best shape of my life a few years ago. I did a 17km, 900m ascent hike, and was completely shot afterwards. Though it was a tough hike for me, my able bodied buddies had no problems. And I know people who regularly do 40km/2500m ascent trips, which I know for certain I could never do no matter how hard I tried.\n\n I third this. It took many years for me to find custom insoles that are comfortable, but it was more than worth the time and money.

And I have noticed that I look the same, feel the same and I just want to change but I am struggling because of my limited movement in my legs and back.

I am sorry if this was dumb or the wrong sub I just need some advice, please. Are you comfortable biking? I use an exercise bike.\n\nAlso really watch how much sugar is in what you eat. Assuming you are a guy around 40g added sugar a day is just over the recommended. It is amazing how much sugar is in things. Your body likes to burn sugar first because it is easy, if you eat too much sugar it will impede fat burning Hi! Full disclosure, I am not a personal trainer, but I have been working with one for the past 3 months and lost 10 lbs. I have learned a lot, so here are some things to think about.\n\n1) The #1 requirement for fat loss is a calorie deficit. Before I started with my trainer, I ate pretty healthily too! I ate lots of fruits, veggies, whole grains, etc. However, I discovered I needed to be more intentional with measuring portions (a food scale is your friend) and have treats (cookies, alcohol, etc.) less often, though I highly recommend not \"cutting out\" any specific foods. r/loseit has some good resources to figure out a starting point for your calories! \n\nAlso, big tip here, keep things stable for awhile! I am just beginning to reverse diet after 12 weeks in a deficit, and we did not lower my calories below the starting point that whole time. Slow weeks will come, it does not mean you should immediately drop calories lower.\n\n2) You cannot spot reduce (ex. lose fat in thighs and stomach specifically). This is one of the fitness industry's biggest myths! Unfortunately, fat loss is non-specific and where it comes from first on you is largely genetic. So, if you want to lose fat in a specific spot, maintain a calorie deficit and be patient!\n\nI do not know if you use or like Instagram, but for more evidence-based practices and science, I have found some excellent coaches (in addition to mine) that I follow on Instagram. Check out coaches from the groups Fitbliss Fitness, Level TEN Coaching, and KJO Coaching. They put out so much free, high-quality, scientifically based content to help you approach weight loss in a sane, sustainable, healthy way! Track what you eat (personally I use and love lifesum) and make sure you eat between 200 to 500 kcal deficit. You cannot spot lose weight, so you are just going to have to get cardio in to burn calories.\n\nPersonally I hate HIIT but it is proven to be highly effective for fat loss. My choice is using a recumbent bike for 45 mins in the fat loss heart rate zone. Do not think more cardio = better, because in does not. Reality is your body only has so much energy it is able to release in one go, which equates to about 45 minutes for fat loss, then your body will switch over to using carbs for energy. If you keep on going, you will body eventually start burning protein which will result in you losing muscle mass, which is a terrible idea for people with CMT.\n\nI have a lot of exercise tips at  - feel free to reach out if you have any more questions \ud83d\ude42 It is a great question to discuss here. Standard recommendation for CMTers is \"do not be overweight\" but it is not like that is automatically an easy thing for many people whether they have CMT or not. \n\nAt its simplest most weight loss comes down to CICO (calories in, calories out) and the folks at r/loseit have a lot to say on the subject but it boils down to calculating your calorie needs and eating fewer calories than that. Simple, not always easy. \n\nPersonally, I find that eating fewer carbs (sugar, but also simple starches like rice and potatoes) makes it easier because I do not get as hungry when I am eating fewer carbs. Therefore it is easier for me to eat fewer calories but it is the fewer calories part which is important. Low carb diets like Atkins are popular sources of information on that kind of eating. They are criticized for being too limited and hard to maintain for long, so that can also be a factor particularly when you are presumably still living with your parents and probably do not have complete freedom to chose what you eat.\n\nA standard science-based approach to losing weight will often start with keeping a complete food journal for a few days without changing how you normally eat. It is common to be able to spot a problem simply through weighing your food, writing it down and looking at the numbers. \n\nExercise is useful in a lot of ways, one of them being that it increases your calories burned. It is also very good for someone with CMT to maintain their muscles, of course, by being as active as possible without risking injury. \n\nYou can find free TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) calculators online which will tell you a good idea of how many calories you burn day to day so you can figure out what a healthy number of calories is. \n\nSome particular notes for CMT's impact on weight loss or maintenance: people with less muscle than average, including most CMTers, burn fewer calories at rest. Muscle just burns more calories for general maintenance even when it is doing nothing. Having less muscle sucks in this regard. The good news: we generally burn more calories when we walk. There is an Italian study, I will see if I can dig up a link, which measured CMT folks and found that we burn around 25% to 33% more calories just walking across a smooth, flat floor. So walking is great exercise. \n\nThe only way to lose fat in any particular spot on your body is simply to lose weight in general. Spot reduction is a myth, sadly. \n\nI have done my best to summarize the basic science-supported principles of weight loss here. It is likely that someone will read this and want to object that they believe something different. Weight loss is an emotionally charged subject for many people. If you believe the only way to lose weight is to drink vinegar with every meal you can certainly say so but try to keep it civil and provide evidence beyond sales info from The Vinegar Consortium. When you begin to exercise your body will first use the glycogen (carbs) stored in your muscles. As your muscles run low on glycogen they synthesize more from your fat stores. This produces lactic acid, which makes your muscles feel sore after a workout. \n\nBurning either fat or carbs are good. If you take it too far your body can start to break down muscle and that is a terrible idea for people with CMT. How long it takes before your body resorts to breaking down muscle will depend on both the intensity of the exercise and your physical fitness. It actually depends on how hard your body is working. As fat can be converted into more ATP then carbs (hence 9 kcal per 1 gram of fat Vs 4 for carbs and protein), your body will use fat, but the caveat is your body can only use fat if you are not working too hard as the process of fat -&gt; ATP is slower than carbs or protein to ATP. \n\nGenerally speaking, if you exercise in the fat burning heart range (55-65% MHR), you have about 45 mins of fat that can be converted to ATP, then 30ish mins of carbs (iirc) and then the body has to resort to muscle catabolism. Although no process is 100% one source of energy - fat loss heart rate zone utilises about 65% fat, 35% carbs, as opposed to cardio which can be about a 50:50 split. If you are 16, you should talk ONLY to a doctor or dietician about these issues. Getting advice from random adults on the internet has so much potential for harmful or inaccurate advice. Thank you all for the responses and advice, I shall work hard to it! Thank you again Focus on strength and health. Measure success by stamina and strength increases not by numbers on the scale. Just be good to yourself with your fuel and your fitness. A lot of good points have already been made so far. A calorie deficit is the only thing that works, however one thing to note is that it is probably a good idea for people with CMT to only attempt a low to moderate calorie deficit as there is some evidence that suggest that the degree of muscle loss incurred by a calorie deficit correlates with the size of the calorie deficit. \n\nSo to maintain as much muscle as possible, any weight loss should ideally be pursued as a life style change rather than a diet. Slow and steady weight loss will occur with a low calorie deficit (meticulous monitoring of the caloric intake is important) combined with a balanced diet and as much resistance exercise as you can tolerate.\n\nWalking is very good exercise in terms of energy expenditure, in fact it has been shown that the energy expenditure when walking at a moderate pace is almost the same as when jogging, in normal healthy adults. Seeing as walking puts a lot less strain on the body compared to jogging, walking is probably the better choice when the goal is to spend energy. Because of the way CMT affects our gait, walking (and probably jogging too) requires more calories in people with CMT. However we probably get tired more easily too, so this likely balances it out. \n\nIt is important to know that the human body is remarkably energy efficient, and it is surprisingly hard to burn calories with physical exercise. There is a mantra in the fitness world that says that muscles are built in the kitchen and not at the gym, and the same logic can be applied to weight loss. In practice, weight loss begins and ends in the kitchen, and (resistance) exercise should be done mainly to counteract the muscle loss incurred by a caloric deficit. \"Running the kilos off\" is not a good approach, although it is what most people think of when they want to loose weight.\n\nIt is true that people with CMT will have less muscle mass than people without CMT, however I would think the effect this has on our basal metabolic rate is fairly negligible. Many of us also live a more sedentary lifestyle due to fatigue, pain and/or mobility issues, which will have some impact on the basal metabolic rate. In practice, a good approach for weight loss is to determin the basal metabolic rate using an online calculator and then try a low calorie deficit based on that calculation whilst monitoring your weight. Then you can adjust the size of the deficit over time based on your weight over time. This requires meticulous tracking of your caloric intake and weight over time, however when done correctly it is provably effective. You do not have to be overly active to lose weight. I started a strict diet a around August and I have lost about 30 pounds already, 225 -&gt; 195. I have not changed my physical activities hardly at all. Track what you eat, understand that you DO NOT have to be full all the time. Your body will adapt to what you eat overtime and that feeling of hunger will dye down. For instance a common meal for me is  \\~ a cup of broccoli half a grilled chicken breast and a cup of rice. Be lite on condiments, cut sugary foods and drinks from your diet and you Will lose weight. \n\nIs it fun? Hell no, does it work? Hell yes. How much do you want it? CMT is a small factor in weight loss. Life is what we make it, do not let this disease hold you back from what you want. Honestly a lot of doctors know very, very little about CMT and exercise in general beyond the basics. \n\nFor example, research in progress by UCLH is showing that CMT might have an impact on the VO\u00b2 max, limiting it to about 80%. Throw in the fact that neuropathy tends to significantly limit muscle growth and suddenly the advice a doctor gives of \"just exercise\" becomes irrelevant. More so, a dietitian is absolutely not needed to run a calorie deficit or surplus - it is basic math and there is numerous proven ways of working out your TDEE. As long as you adhere to the law of energy in &lt; energy out, you should lose weight. With CMT the real challenge is not losing weight but maintaining muscle or increasing strength. \n\nIf you have IBS/IBD or some other digestion issue, talk to a dietician. If you want to lose weight, theres zero point in doing so - it would be like going to A&amp;E for a splinter. Prior to the last 12 months, I followed a Keto diet. Initially, I was very strict with what I ate. Limiting myself to things I knew the numbers of and I did not have to count or measure or weigh much. As I became more comfortable with the Keto program, I expanded my menu albeit slowly so I could easily determine if I was going off track.\n\nPrior to starting Keto, about 6 or 7 years ago, I struggled with every diet program out there. Spent lots of money, lost little weight, always gained it all back, always gained more than when i began. \n\nNot every diet is for everyone. Personally, I know and I have always suspected, I am very easily addicted to carbs. Carbs of any kind. Lima Bean, yep, give me an entire bowl please. Bread. Pasta. Potatoes. Processed foods, allegedly \u2018diet\u2019 foods that hide their taste in the increase in the carb count.\n\nI joined r/keto within a year I lost 60 pounds. Another 6 months, I lost 18. And it was not hard. \nFull disclosure: Back then, I could walk. I was disabled but I could walk without aid, my feet, ankles, legs, have always hurt so I joined the Y only to use the heated pool to swim. Any other exercise that required the use of feet or legs was too painful. I swam, HARD, 1 hour a day mostly 4 days a week. Sometimes 3 days depending on my pain and medical appointments.\n\nFast forward to September 2019 and everything changed. In less than a year I went from walking unaided to using a cane, to using a walker, to using a rollinator to NEEDING a rollinator, to fighting a wheelchair with what little energy I have left inside. Also, within that same year, frustration and depression eating and I have gained back at least 30 or 35 pounds. I can no longer stand on my home digital BMI scale so I am unsure what I weigh in the buff. But I can definitely feel it in my clothes.\n\nBe aware, I did spend a good amount of time either finding or inventing things I could prepare or cook. Chopped lots of broccoli, grilled lots of chicken breast and pork loin, boiled and fried lots of eggs.\nI did find lots of Keto friendly foods at Costco. Unfortunately, Costco is an hour drive away for me and since my brothers death I have no one to take me and as of the last 12 months, I can barely do local driving. But, I am holding on to driving until I absolutely must give it up.\n\nI found Keto to be the easiest diet to star and stay on. Also the best diet for results to keep me motivated.\n\nAs I said, not every diet is for everyone. If you do decide to check out keto, be sure to read everything on the right side of the page before you start posting. I honestly would not recommend jogging ever as an option for people with CMT due to it being a high-impact exercise that is likely to exacerbate the mechanical issues and weaknesses of the feet caused by CMT e.g. stress fractures, ankle sprains, bursas etc and potentially damaging if you have joint issues which is common in people with CMT. \n\nAlso, trying to counteract muscle loss when running s deficit is not really achievable unless the person is new to exercise - the human body does not want to lose weight and build muscle at the same time, unless PEDs are used, hence the concept of a \"recomposition\" cycle in which two competing goals (fat loss, muscle growth) are aimed for. The best bet would be, as you suggest, slowly lose the weight in order to minimise muscle loss, and then slowly work on gaining muscle once the desired body fat % has been reached using a slight calorie surplus. Your lima bean thing made me laugh way too hard. I hate lima beans but yeah, after a few days with no carbs I could probably eat a whole bowl of them. A dietitian or other professional is not necessary to calculate calories needed for weight loss but it might still be a good idea for a growing teenager to make sure they do not have any vitamin/mineral deficiencies from a planned diet. You cannot outrun a bad diet, as it goes. Focus on diet for losing size, and exercise for dealing with whatever you need to deal with physically. You cannot spot fix fat, so it is going to be a gradual whole body thing, not just thighs and stomach. As long as they have a balanced diet (veg and fruit included with carbs and protein) you will not have any issue with vitamin or mineral deficiencies. You do not know. \nYou do not know with sufficient certainty to tell someone else, particularly a growing teen, that just eating some vegetables means they will be fine.\nI love vegetables and eat a variety of them but I have had a diagnosed B12 deficiency before. That is a scary one because a B12 deficiency will give you peripheral neuropathy. My doctor caught it. \nHealth is complicated. You do not know what other challenges someone else might be facing. Do not be careless with someone else's future. You are a 16 year old girl who wants a flatter stomach and thinner thighs.  Honey, do not try to change your beautiful, female shape.  Just celebrate that you eat healthy and walk regularly.  I was a chubby kid who became a curvy woman.  No, I am not overweight.\nFor heaven\u2019s sake, DO NOT DIET!!!  You can goof up your appetite doing that, and end up struggling with food and weight for the rest of your life. \nIf you want to restrict food, just avoid artificial sweeteners, sweetened drinks like soda pop, and anything made with corn syrup.  Those things confuse our healthy hunger. A balanced diet gets the name from being nutritionally balanced which should also suffice the required vitamins and minerals a person needs. Only in special circumstances do deficiencies happen - telling someone to go to a dietician because they might have a deficiency without any sort of indication that is the case is like a waste of time and money. Now if you had symptoms such as lethargy, \n\nI am not being careless but your advice is so general you are basically saying everyone should see a dietician and it is not even a dietician that you are actually after - what you are talking about is a full panel blood test which just requires a doctor, but as I have said, unless you are showing symptoms of a deficiency, why would you have this test done? I think I was pretty clear that I was saying that someone who wants to change their diet, reduce what they eat, and particularly if they are still a growing teen, could benefit from talking to a professional. Just because you would rather argue against a different set of advice does not make that what I said. You really do not need blood works to be done if you are just looking to run a calorie deficit in order to lose weight. As I said, unless you have symptoms suggesting an underlying deficiency, it is a waste of time and money. Calorie control and a balanced diet is basic biology someone should have learnt in highschool and does not require the same sort of medical attention that someone on performance enhancing drugs would be looking for. At no point did I say that someone needs to have bloodwork done to start a diet. No matter how many times you argue against it, it will not magically become what I said. Having a dietitian give one's proposed diet a once-over to spot potential problems is still a good idea for a teen. How would someone detect a deficiency if they are not having blood works done? You gave an example of a b12 deficiency - I am presuming a blood test was done?\n\nAs I said, a basic balanced diet will be sufficient, and a dietician is absolutely not needed to provide what is foundational, simple dietary information: eat a balanced selection of fruits and vegetables daily while running a deficit. You do not go to A&amp;E for a splinter and in the same way you do not go to a dietician if you are looking to lose a small bit of weight. In fact a dietician is likely to not give you an appointment for something so trivial. Yes, I had a blood test for the B12. It was not a crazy panel of blood  work, it was just a test for B12. Why? Because like just about everyone else with CMT I do have muscle weakness and fatigue. My doctor realized that these CMT symptoms could be masking a B12 deficiency and checked for one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; In fact a dietician is likely to not give you an appointment for something so trivial. \n\nHelping people lose weight is like 90% of what dietitians do. Here is what Johns Hopkins has to say about seeing a dietitian for weight loss: ( So if you want to detect a deficiency, a blood test is needed...\n\nFurthermore, why would not you just go to a personal trainer or follow a diet from training/diet apps? Dietitians absolutely are not 90% focused on basic weight loss, but in diagnosing and treating dietary and nutritional problems such as IBS, IBD etc and for weight loss in regards to obesity (not being slighy overweight) or helping with severe weight loss following illness, as well as a multitude of other things:\n\n\"What is a dietitian?\" \n\nA nutritionist can cover the basic stuff of healthy eating and portion sizes, *but I really cannot understand the insistence that this cannot be self taught.* I was less concerned with how a doctor would advise her due to her CMT, and much more concerned about how a doctor would advise her given her age. She is in a high risk category for eating disorders already, and since dieting is the single biggest risk factor for developing an eating disorder, she is explicitly at risk by taking advice on how to lose weight from strangers on the Internet. \n\nWe have no idea what other health conditions she has, whether she actually has weight to lose, whether her weight is affected by prescriptions or hormonal changes (very likely in teenagers), whether she is already struggling with disordered eating and this is just adding fuel to the fire. \n\nI am not suggesting that people with CMT all need to talk to their doctor before trying to lose weight. I am suggesting that adults do not give CHILDREN medical advice over the internet, and that CHILDREN should talk to a doctor before they engage in behaviours that can take them down a path that is way more dangerous than CMT. It gives me great pleasure to know you laugh at lima beans! Glad I was able to give you a giggle. :) Dieting is a symptom of an eating disorder, not a trigger.  For anorexia, you need a mix of personal trauma, mild autism and OCD to create the necessary mindset needed, so I think it is safe to say that someone looking to lose a bit of weight is hardly \"at risk\" - there is a whole lot of negative presumptions you are making. \n\nWhy are you saying \"children\" as if that changes biology and the basic laws of physics? Where are you arbitrarily drawing the line between internet advice being bad one day and then good the next? \n\nIf the poster follows a mild calorie deficit and eats a balanced diet, she will achieve what she wants. A doctor is unlikely to be helpful because what are they going to actually say? Their job is not to help you achieve your body goals. A personal trainer is far more likely to see the situation holistically and be able to monitor it if you are concerned about a person making poor choices (which should not be linked to their age). I like this advice.", " Friday Feelings - Small Celebrations Little things that went right this week. \n\nTimes when CMT could not stand in your way.\n\nVictories that you want to share. I had toe fusion surgery in January.\n\nThis week I went grocery shopping for the first time since Christmas!", "IVF and Starting a Family Hello everyone! \n\nI hope you are all doing well. While I have read some threads about IVF on this subreddit, I would love more insight on it. \n\nMy fiancee, his brother, and his mother all have CMT. My fiancee seems to have the most severe case out of all of them. Overall, it does not impact his life too, too much but he did receive surgery on his right foot a couple of years ago and is in the process of getting leg braces. We have thought about him using a cane, too. Additionally, he is in computer science so having a desk job has been great for him. \n\nLike a lot of people on this subreddit, we have considered completing IVF to not pass on CMT. I was just looking for personal stories of the process. How comfortable is it? Does it increase the chances of having twins? How long does it take? We are only 25 but I am sure it is a lengthy process so we are starting our research now. \n\nThank you so much for all of your help! Hello! I have one child (before I was diagnosed) and will use IVF with PGD if I have anymore, as I do not wish to pass on CMT if I can help it. Some people make a different choice and that is okay too. IVF is a long, expensive, uncomfortable process, but if you have the means, it can be done safely and the risk of multiples can be minimized. Good luck! Hey there, my husband and I did IVF with PGD in order to avoid me passing along CMT. If you are interested in the nitty gritty of it all feel free to DM me. \n\nBottom line for me - even though it was not the easiest process, it is one that I never have regretted. We have 2 kiddos, 3.5yrs and 9mths, and with all the other complications that life can throw at you I am glad that for them, CMT will not have to be one of them. Had I known I had any, let alone 2, types of cmt. I would NOT have children. My life has been hell and was 60 before we found out what it was! Now I am just waiting to be old enough for medicare, so I can see a Dr and get treatment. My wife and I did IVF w/ PGD.  Have two CMT free kids.  Currently going through the process again to try and have more.  \n\nTo answer your questions.  The only part that was uncomfortable for my wife was the egg retrieval and the discomfort from that lasted just a few days.  It does not increase the odds of twins.  You see these people like octomom or whatever that have 8 fraternal twins because they put multiple embryos into her.  They do not do that unless there is a fertility issue that makes it necessary.   From start to finish it took my wife 3 months to become pregnant, but it worked on the first try for us. Can I ask if you had to have up to date testing prior to this and if so is it a simple blood test? I am considering this. I have already been tested and confirmed but it was as a child so I do not remember it so will need to get tested again using modern tech. Not sure if this will just be blood drawn or something more painful.\n\nAlso I am really happy you had a successful story. Hi I cannot offer any advice but I am also considering IVF route so if you need an ear at any point please reach out. I did speak to a specialist briefly who said it will not be the easiest option but it is one I am considering regardless. I would not mind if my kids are born with this condition however I would prefer they are as healthy as can be for their own future. Yes as a child.  My mom still had the results and I provided those to the clinic and that was enough to avoid testing again.\n\n\nThat said, they tested me and my wife's genes for about 300 other genetic diseases to make sure we were not carries of anything else.", "new gaming controller ", "Elderly father CMT symptoms are really messing him up My father turns 73 this month and his CMT has been effecting him a lot as he is gotten older but it has gotten to a point where driving is becoming more dangerous. He is had 3 accidents over the last year (thankfully no one else was hurt) and I am fairly sure it is because he is lost all feeling in his feet, he thinks he is braked but he obviously did not. I have looked into hand controls but he is also losing the feeling in his hands, I am worried that hand controls will only work for so much longer. Finally, he is looked into those automatic stopping vehicles but I cannot seem to find any studies on how well they perform at night or say, when he pulls into a garage.\n\nHave any of you guys experienced this with your aging parents? What were your experiences? Lessons learned, things you wish you had done differently, etc. I cannot say I experienced this with my parents as I am the first in my family to report any kind of CMT'ish symptoms. (Just met with a genetic counselor and should have the results in 3 weeks.)\n\nI, however; am 8 years younger than your father and am totally terrified of going through what you say he is beginning to experience. I can feel and see myself declining in almost every aspect of my being.\n\nI am relatively new to all this CMT stuff, less than 5 months I would guess, so I am still sorting things out. One thing I have 'discovered' it seems, is there do not appear to be many of us old CMT'ers around, anywhere. And that scares me for several reasons.\n\nWhile I understand CMT does not kill, I cannot help but wonder, if like your father, we end up in accidents, as you rightfully appear to be concerned about, and we old CMT'ers pass from car accidents, falls, stepping off a sidewalk, just walking, or moving.\n\nI hope I have not scared you as that was not my intent. It was my intent to assure you, you definitely have every reason to take this seriously.\n\nIs your father seeing a pain management specialist? Is he taking any medications to manage pain? or any medications that could interfere with cognition or balance?\n\nThe side effects of my medications are numerous and many of my medications are prescribed 'off label' which means, the drug is intended to other purposes but has a side effect that that can be beneficial for some totally different disease. However, that different disease, can also have side affects from that medication. It gets to be a nasty convoluted web of  pharmacology mysteria.\n\nSuggest you get his meds checked out as well.\n\nGood luck to you and your father. My grandfather had CMT and lived to be 80. At about the same age as your father he had a pretty bad accident on the freeway and after that his family took away his license. You should seriously consider that it might be time for your father to stop driving before he gets hurt or hurts someone else.", "Does anyone take any vitamin supplements ? If so, what do you take it for ?  no, because I have no deficiencies, eg recent blood test showed all levels were good. B12 for nerve health, but where I can I try to get it through food.

Shared this before, but I take a \"one a day\" type multivitamin which is 95% useless and mostly creates expensive urine.  However, it seems to reduce the muscle clamps I have.  My neurologist agrees that it is an inexpensive solution even if neither of us has any idea what is actually beneficial.\n\nBeyond that whimsy, no supplements have ever proven useful.

Just, like I said, not a fan of click-baity articles that make it sound like it is already a treatment that you can get. Yep just another hopium based article. We will all be dead before they even come close to finding anything &amp; even when they do. There is no way it will financially be viable for anyone who is not wealthy. I was wondering about how mRNA vaccination (print-instruction for the cells to synthesize genes) could be applied to other diseases, apparently scientists did too:\n I visited my Neurologist last week and talked about this. The clinical trials have been going well and I have been sent a trial to look into. There are other qualifications.\n\nThe biggest thing is that everything's been pushed because of Covid research. \n\nI do think that this will come out in the next 5-10 years. It is not a miracle drug. If it works it would slow down the progression. But it is never going to reverse it. \n\nThat sucks. But it is reality. I believe the therapy referenced here has not been tried in humans yet, are you sure that is what he was referring to?\n\nThe two I am keeping my eye on are the antisense treatment (in line with the timeframe and results you mentioned) and PXT3003. Yes. She said the human trials have been gone thru. She even sent me one to consider signing up for. I am hesitant because of obvious reasons. But my wife and I are seriously discussing it. Huh\u2026 is that trial something you can share a link to? I cannot find anything on the web referencing human trials. Also take a look at Nixye\u2019s comment on this thread. \n\nI am somewhat well read on the therapies in development but would be pleased to learn if another flew under my radar Absolutely. We have not read everything yet, but I will get on the patient portal and see if Ican share it. \n\nIf I am wrong, I will also own up to it. IIRC in cancer research the rate of successful translation from animal models to phase I human trials is less than 8%, while the cumulative success rate from Phase I to III is something like \u2248 10%.\nBased on the number of animal studies and failed human trials that exist for CMT, I would not expect those numbers to be much better for CMT research. Go to ClinicalTrials.gov/. \n\nThe trial number is NCT04762758. Thanks for following up. This is PXT3003 which is unrelated to the RNA therapies in development.", "Does anyone here get a disability allowance through their university? I have had CMT since I was 12 but it is not bothered me that much till now when I am at uni and the work is starting to get really hard this semester and I was wondering if anyone had tried to get extra time in exams to account for fatigue or cramps in your hands from writing etc? I have not done that but see no reason why you could not get extra time with a doctor\u2019s notes Thanks! I am going to speak to the uni on Monday and see what can be done Check to see what \u201cdisability services\u201d offers at your university! Often times they get grant money ect for having you on the team.  \nI was able to get a parking permit for free, books on pdf because they were lighter to carry than the full size.  I was able to use the disabled students Tutoring services. They have a lab with talk to txt and other accommodations.  \nIf you had someone tell you which accommodations were best for you it would not be as effective as seeing for yourself!  \n\nMesa College in San Diego and National University we are both pretty darn amazing!  I felt the inclusion and compassion shown to me helped me get through some very tough frustrating times. Thanks a lot! I am definitely going to check it out tomorrow. Feeling more confident now because of you Yup, I get extra time in my exams, arranged through disability services at the uni. You will have to have a doctor sign a form to verify your condition.\n\nI have been to two different unis. The first one gave me an extra 20min per hour for writing, and for the one I am at now, I get an extra 10 min per hour. It is good to organise it early in the semester, so they can make special arrangements for  your exams. But yeah, get in touch with disability services at your uni, they are generally really great to deal with and want to help you as much as they can. I got extra time while I was in college and it helped. It is reasonable accommodation for your illness and is protected by the ADA. You will need appropriate documentation - if you do not have any medical notes focused on your dexterity, book an appointment with your PCP or neurologist and ask them to do a neuromuscular exam of your dominant hand and put their findings in their note. I have decreased intrinsic muscle strength in my hand generally, and in my thenar muscle specifically, which are classic findings for CMT. I presented these findings to my university and had no trouble getting extra time, which really helped my grades. Thank you! Thanks so much! Yay! Awesome. I am excited for you.  Good luck ! You never know there may already be a few fellow CMT people on your campus.   Keep us updated too :) Will do! Thanks for the support I am in the process of having my access plan for university sorted :) the university takes into account all ways your CMT symptoms can impact your studies.. Using your hands, walking around campus, ergonomic workstation, assignments extensions etc.  When I first went to university 10 years ago, I had no supports in place (I would been suffering with CMT since 10 years old but no diagnosis). Commuting to uni, walking (or tripping) up a million stairs on campus, carrying backpack and textbooks around.. It was all so exhausting I eventually dropped out and started online study which was very isolating. Ask for all the supports you need and deserve for the things you struggle with :) like others have said all you need is some medical evidence.\nI am about to start my masters degree and this time I will have the right supports in place. Woah that is really inspiring thank you! I am not going to lie I have not done the application form yet because I am worried I will not be able to describe well what the condition is and what my needs are but I am going to try tomorrow! I used to struggle with that too.. I would suggest reading others peoples stories and seeing if any of their descriptions ring true to your experiences. Also, tell the uni that this is new too you and you are not sure what your needs actually are.. I had a full needs assessment with an occupational therapist recently (not uni related) but it helped uncover what areas I need support in.  I think we push on through our cmt symptoms for so many years it can be hard to realise what we struggle with compared to what the average person would struggle with.. Normal vs abnormal fatigue and pain. Yep. I get an extra 10 minutes per hour, and typed exams since no one can read my handwriting. \n\nIt has the rather unfortunate side effect of leading to 4 1/2 hours in exam conditions, which does not help the fatigue. \n\nAssuming you are in any of the western countries with some form of disability discrimination legislation, it should not be too hard if you are diagnosed and have some evidence (could be neuro, or even an OT handwriting assessment) showing how it impacts you. Back in the '90's when I went to college I was able to take the test home to type it up on my Word Processor because I was unable to write an essay by hand. I would be very surprised if your university did not offer some type of accommodation. I am on a waiting list just now to get an assessment so we will see what they can do soon hopefully!", "CMT X1 Hi everyone! \nI am looking for people with CMT - X1, especially Moms - as I have inherited it from my Dad.\nDo your kids have it? Have you transferred the Mutation to your kids? We found out about CMT 2 years ago, when I was pregnant with my second child, and now I am really worried I gave it to my kids. CMT X1 involves a mutation on the X chromosome. Therefore, it follows x-linked gene inheritance rules, which are different from the other types of CMT. \n\nFrom the CMTA's site:   \"A woman will pass down one or the other of her two X chromosomes in every pregnancy. Each child of a woman affected with CMT1X has a 50/50 risk of inheriting the condition, no matter the sex of the child. A man affected with CMT1X will pass it on to ALL of his daughters (since they inherit his X chromosome), but NONE of his sons (who inherit the Y chromosome which does not have the gene).\"\n\nAny of your children has a 50/50 chance of having inherited it. \n\nYou may wish to talk to a genetic counselor or have your children tested if you are concerned. FYI, girls usually have a milder form of CMT X1 than boys, often not showing symptoms until later while boys may show it at a younger age. Thanks! Yes, that is exactly how I understood it. English is not my native language so I sometimes struggle with wording things. I have a very mild form and do not really struggle, the occasional stumble or weakness in the arms, but that is about it. I am not worried about myself, but for my kids, so I think I will get testet in the next few years. I just wanted to know if there are women who struggle with this specific type of \"unknown guilt\". Both my brother and I got CMTX passed down from our mother. I got diagnosed at 12 (now 25) when I got hospitalized for stroke like symptom which can occur in CMT1X. My brother who is 16 did not experience any stroke symptoms. Previous to that, my mom did not know she had CMT and she does not experience any symptoms to this day. My brother is experiencing symptoms much earlier than I, but I think it is due to the way he eats and lack of exercise. We both experience weakness in hands, mainly dexterity of the fingers, and a typical foot drop on both feet. \n\nMost of my symptoms began worsening around the age of 22. Through out my life I did struggle with hand writing quality and was much more clumsier that other kids. Sucked at jump rope as well. I was really good at swimming though, which is an amazing exercise for managing CMT. I have been very active through out my life and have a so far successful career. I would not compete professionally in any sport, but I do not let CMT slow me down in any other way. It is a 50/50 chance of for your kids to get it from you. If you do find out that your kids might have it, in my experience, good diet and exercise makes the disease very manageable. It is not the end of the world! So I can maybe speak as the child. My grandmother, aunt, mom, and I all have CMT 1X. \n\nMy grandmother and aunt have been severely affected by CMT. They struggle to walk, and my grandmother has major struggles with her hands as well.\n\nMy mom was different though. She tested positive for 1X but she was an athelete. She never showed symptoms for her CMT. She decided to have kids. She had my two older brothers and myself. \n\nWhen she turned 30, she got really sick. Doctors first told her it was her CMT. She got really worried about all of us. She did not know if she passed it on or not. So she got all 3 of us tested for CMT. It came back that my brothers did not have it, but I did. \n\nShortly after this, the doctors found out her new issue that made her so sick was actually CIDP, so she felt a lot better knowing what was happening to her would not happen to me. \n\nI am 23 now. I have some CMT symptoms, mainly foot drop, fatigue, and leg cramps. I think I am starting to get a little numbness too, but we will see what my neurologist says. I think the really important thing my mom did was test me. Once we knew I had CMT, then she knew to watch me for symptoms. When CMT started affecting my ability to play soccer, she took me to a neurologist and I started to see them yearly to monitor my progression. It is good to have early interventions. \n\n\nAs for the guilt thing... I know mom has always felt guilty for a while. Anytime I bring up my CMT maybe getting worse, I can hear the guilt in her voice. I have never blamed her though or anything, but I think she still feels guilty from time to time. \n\n\nI would definitely speak to a genetic counselor. If you want to like guarantee your children do not get it, they can do some cool stuff where they like check which eggs have the gene, but I am sure it is an expensive (and painful) process, so probably not for everyone. Thank you so much for your perspective!!!\nI will definitely get my Kids tested, after all the Corona craze! Thank you so much.", "Did you guys know you had a disability growing up? If not, did you know something was wrong? I have been thinking lately about how I just thought everyone is feet hurt when walking as a kid, and that I just needed to toughen up. It is always interesting thinking back to all the CMT stuff I dealt with as a kid that I thought was normal. Well, I did not until I did.  I was diagnosed at age 11 and that diagnoses just explained some things that had been happening a few years before. I was always the last kid in gym class  to finish my laps.  And I had frequently sprained my ankles.  But, I had no idea something was wrong until the dr told us. For sure lol, I had surgery on both legs to correct hip dysplasia when I was 7, and then had surgery pretty much annually until I turned 12 to correct broken bones or remove hardware. It was rough and I got bullied a lot for being in a wheelchair at school or having a limp develop after my last surgery. I definitely always knew I was different, even before my operations (I was diagnosed at age 3), my mom was overly cautious about everything I did to the point of paranoia and she did not hesitate to tell me why she was scared and what she thought could happen to me. Never saw any of my friends dealing with anything like what I did, and sometimes I would ask them if they had any symptoms like mine or if their parents helicoptered over them, it was always no. No I did not. I got made fun of a lot when I was little. I was the \u201cweak link\u201d. I was very thin and could barely run. I would be the LAST child in every single time and always got comments, rude indications of being obstinate or plan got left behind.  I think it shaped who I am as an adult.  I learned of my CMT after my son was diagnosed.  He was 12. I had to fight and advocate for him like a momma bear. The teachers and school were on him all the time for his PE crap. I said he said he is not Ok and I believe him.  Remembering what all I had gone through and still not knowing CMT was even a thing. Just know what that daily negativity along with painful mobility issues do to a person.  My son was diagnosed and the doctors finally diagnosed me genetic testing confirmed.  \n\nI am glad I know. It would have been nice to know as a kid. I was 35 I knew something was off from an early age, I was always the slowest runner among my friends and classmates for instance. Even when I grew older and understood that we had something that ran in the family, I lived in the hope that I did not have it. When we tested our reflexes in class once and the teacher could not trigger mine, I did not think much off it either. I think the uncertainly of not knowing for certain that I had CMT let me choose to believe that I did not have it. I was diagnosed at around 14 when 1A was confirmed genetically, and it was a hard blow emotionally to have to confront the truth. Now when I look back I recognize so many little things that I experienced growing up that was definitely caused by the CMT. Hindsight is 20/20 and all that. I got diagnosed with CMT 1X when I was 16. During my childhood, I saw that there were a number of differences in physical funtion between myself and my peers, but they were not so bad that I had the sense that something was wrong.\n\nSometimes I wish I got the diagnosis earlier - I think getting the tendon transfer surgeries done sooner would have been helpful, for example. On the other hand, I am grateful I had developmental years without the added psychological lift of coming to terms with having a progressive chronic illness. My diagnosis triggered an eating disorder, troubles with dating and identity - it is taken me years in therapy to get to a place where I actively own and manage my illness. Before my diagnosis, I had the opportunity to just be a kid. A clumsy kid who could not do some of the sports stuff, for sure, but in many ways just a kid.", "Testosterone to aid in muscle growth?

Ive had symptoms for years but it seems to come in waves. I was in a wheelchair for a week last summer when the weakness got really bad, but generally speaking I can maintain a very active lifestyle between the flare ups. \n\nIm 24M and after missing last season for a shoulder issue, I am working out with the varisty baseball team at my school this winter and I will be playing this fall. I forgot to ask about baseball, but I am wondering what you have all been told (Re: sports/exericise, not necessarily baseball)? Im sure it varies slightly from what I have read, if you can take the pain in recovery you can play.  There is a Facebook group called cmtathletes that would be great at answering this question so might be worth checking out. It really varies person to person, but I know I stopped baseball after rolling my ankle for about the fourth time in a single season. The final time though I do not think it was so much the cmt but I hit first base in a really weird way, probably lucky I did not break it. ", "CMT, JUI-JITSU and depression. Hello, this is my first ever reddit post so here goes.\nI live in the UK and am in my 20's and have been diagnosed with CMT for years now. Last year (2019) i discovered BJJ and have really fell in love with the sport, it allows me to be active without being on my feet to much, if at all. But this is the problem, I love being able to use my body as I have always been told that \"if I do not use it, I will lose it\" but I cannot help feel awful when I go because of my living situation. I receive benefits for my condition and a few other things, some mental as well. I guess I am scared or fearful that somehow me trying to keep myself active will somehow lead to my benefits being taken away and then I would be forced to get a job and be in more pain. Also I cannot fully enjoy the classes because I am so worried that my life could drastically change because of me attending those classes. \n\nBasically, has anyone been or is still in a similar  situation? How did you deal with it? \n\nI hope this post makes sense! I am sorry I do not have any helpful advice but I do have a question. I am not familiar with BJJ but I was under the impression that it was similar to other martial arts, in that everything is done while standing and moving your feet so can you elaborate on the \"without being on my feet\" part? Sure, bjj is a ground grappling martial art. Almost everything you are taught is either from your back or knees. Any sparring starts from the knees also. \nYou can learn takedowns or start standing but I avoid those parts of the sport. \n\nI hope that helps but I am also happy to answer anymore questions! That sounds really cool! Thanks for answering. Maybe I will look into something like that once Covid dies down in the US. \n\nI hope someone from the UK can answer your concerns and I would hope that being able to grapple from a non-standing position will not undermine your disability status. I hope you do! Its done me so many favours, physically and mentally. Good luck dude! I have not been diagnosed yet but my specialist believes I have cmt (cannot afford to take the nerve tests and if I were to be diagnosed I would lose my job.) but I train bjj. It is hard. Simple things like keeping hooks in from the back due to the lack of strength with my feet or sprawling a takedown or base. It is very difficult for me due to my terrible balance and so on. \n\nBut it is the best part of my life. I love it. I can struggle and fail then try again. I really hope you can stay active and keep training, I know your circumstances are much different and I do not have an answer to your question. But for me it is very good for my depression and the thoughts of inadequacy I have. \nBest of luck man! Hope you can train as long as you want! We have the same problems my dude, my guard is broken so easily and I always end up on bottom. But we try, and try, and try again. I am real happy that you also have something that makes the days brighter! I wish the best of luck to you also, happy training pal! This is why I took to the gym and bodybuilding. Competitive sports are very hard with this disability and muscle development is a whole other issue with CMT Dude I know your pain! Also congratulations on the hardwork, I cannot imagine the willpower it takes to have CMT and be a bodybuilder. That is so awesome that you have found something so impressive that works for you!\nI do not know about the uk but in Canada the revenue agency\u2019s #1 priority is not ripping benefits away from disabled people. I do not think they are likely to send some dude to tail you when you leave the house. That being said, if it really is weighing on your mind, take a look at the government guidelines for qualifying. For example, here in Ontario if you are unable to walk 100 meters without stopping you qualify for the tax benefit. It does not matter if you hold a world record for rock climbing, if you cannot walk 100m, you get the money. You do have a good point, I think alot of it might be possibly over thinking. I will have a look into the guidelines as well. Thank you for your advice dude! Np. Once again so cool. I have never considered how BJJ could work with CMT Unsurprisingly I would really recommend it, CMT or not. It can really do alot for a person. Eventually it becomes fun to get your butt kicked once or twice a week, good for the soul and all that. Haha I will bet. My parents put me in karate as a kid for the stretching. I only stayed around for the second year because of their sick Christmas party sleepover. Personally tennis is my thing Yep. I play more open guards because there is no point In me attempting a closed guard. I do train my hip flexors a lot and that does helps some but my closed guard is never rock solid. It can be disheartening  at times struggling with things so simple. Hearing another person train with the same struggles really inspires me. Here I was thinking the internet was always a bummer :) Whoa, I have never heard of someone losing their job because they were diagnosed with CMT. I do not even think that is legal if you are in the US. Well I am required to climb telephone poles with hooks. I use a ladder instead  99% of the time. If it becomes apparent that I cannot use the hooks (straps that wrap around your legs with spurs on the inside of your feet. You dorsiflex your foot while climbing up to keep the spur pointing towards the pole. If your foot goes into plantar flextion the hooks blow out the pole and you fall. Which of course I cannot dorsiflex and cannot climb using the hooks). Thankfully the day to day use of hooks is almost nonexistent but It is a requirement for me to be able to use them to keep my job.\nEdit: Hopefully that makes sense. YouTube pole climbing to get a visual if you want I think one of the best lessons BJJ has taught me is perseverance, it seems you have learnt that to. Honestly besides my family, this post is the only time I have ever talked to others with the same condition, so I understand what you mean and it has really helped my mood and mind. I like to think we do not see our condition as a set back but rather just another hurdle than can be overcome! Stretching is amazing for the body, personally I do some Stretching before bed and when I wake up, as well as some yoga. I wonder the impact it has on CMT?\n\nI have never tried tennis, would you recommend? Maybe that is a good thing. I live in the US, and I have taken advantage of state benefits, but it was always a temporary thing. I do not want to tell you how to live your life, but if you feel conflicted about using benefits then you should try to improve your life and get off them as a goal. Is foot surgery not an option? For me, I tried to use opiate pain killers to get through life (prescription of course). Since I have gotten my second foot done, I have not had any pain comparable to before. I am active, and I no longer take pain pills. Also do not you have your surgeries covered in the UK? To me it seems like a no brainier. \n\nBTW, I got my first foot done at 25, and the other at 29. It is not too late to completely change your life for the better. Eventually I would like to become self sufficient and it is something I am working towards. In regards to surgery I have always wanted seen it as a last resort, I will most likely do it eventuality but I want to wait until I truly need it done. Get the most out of the foot, if you get me? In the US I cannot imagine you would lose disability over a hobby. You should not feel guilty about what you are able to do today. You are not faking your diagnosis, and a genetic test could verify that at any point. You do not have to sit in the corner to prove you have a disability. Martial Arts are a wonderful treatment plan for a degenerative neuropathy. Builds strength and maintains flexibility. Stretching is very important with cmt, especially in childhood because muscle atrophy can severely inhibit your range of motion and many other things.\nPersonally I love tennis. It is sort of just the sport my family plays. I am not sure if it is particularly good for cmt but it is a lot of fun! Fun for beginners and easy to pick up. I thought that too until I was completely hooked on opiates, and they did not even do anything for the pain anymore. When I got my feet done, it changed everything. But you do you. You are right dude. I think alot of it comes from over thinking on my part. Thank you for your message, it helps seeing these replies!", "One of my big worries So while I have not had a definite diagnosis yet, my neurologist is pretty certain that I have a type of CMT, since I have the awkward gait, frequent tripping, the 'upside down champagne bottle' legs etc. So it is pretty likely I have got it.\n\nAnother disease I have is alopecia universalis, making me completely bald since the age of 3 (at least I am male, I guess). I usually wear hats and caps outside and have trouble taking them off in new places. Pairing this with CMT, I guess you can say I am pretty unlucky. And I am only 16.\n\nI have had self esteem problems with the baldness all my life and the awkward walking and the general odd appearance(I am quite skinny) has now added to these self esteem issues. \n\nSo one of my main concerns for the future is...finding a partner. Maybe I am overreacting like a teenager usually would, but I am genuinely terrified of not being attractive enough for anyone in the future. I have good qualities; I am funny, kind, quite intelligent and I am pretty good at the piano too, though I am not sure how long that will last. But I am bald, short, weak - how will anyone find me attractive at all? \n\nBefore you people say it is a confidence issue, I am pretty extroverted and am pretty good at making friends and fitting in. I can mask the self esteem issues pretty well. I have even been able to make decent progress with a crush of mine before; getting her number and all, before being rejected when I asked her out. \n\n\nIt is not a confidence issue, I genuinely feel unattractive. I shower, brush my teeth, wear deodorant and nice clothes. But that is only going to get me so far. I have been pretty depressed over this whole thing before, especially when I was told that it is pretty likely that I have CMT. I was just wondering if anyone can share some advice with me. Perhaps someone has had similar issues to me?\n\nThank you in advance ", "Drug combo PXT-3003 moves to Phase 3 trial for CMT1A ", "Is this likely to be CMT? Hello! Charcot-Marie-Tooth runs in my mother's family. She, her father, her uncle, and 2/3 of her siblings have it. My mother and I are pretty sure that I have, but I have not been able to be tested, and I wanted to get your opinion on it.\nI fall fairly often, but a lot of the falls are not caused by me tripping over anything. It just feels like my legs go weak and I sort of collapse.\nI experience \"pins and needles\", especially in my hands and feet. Also, numbness in those same areas.\nI am VERY slow at tying my shoes and buttoning up my shirts, along with most other dexterity based tasks.\nI have foot drop, and very high arches.\nJust like general random pain for no reason, that is not a result of anything I have done.\nI have been talking to my mom about this for a while, and I just want to get another person's opinion. Thank you for reading. We cannot officially diagnose you, of course, but I will say that you give a fairly good description of my teen years there. High arches, foot drop, and tripping because your legs just stop working for a second? It does sound familiar. And the family history is highly suggestive as well. \n\nYou should see if you can get a doctor to give you the genetic test at some point, particularly if no one in your family has had it done. You might also try to get an appointment with a physical therapist to see how you can stay active in a healthy way and maintain as much physical ability as possible. I understand that neither of these might be possible now, but they will still be valuable things to do when you get a chance, even if that is years from now. Thank you so much!\nI am hoping to get tested and see a physical therapist sometime soon. My mom and I have been talking about it a bit. Sounds like CMT to me. *hugs*. It sounds like it probably is, but testing will tell you for sure.  Stay strong. Thank you! It means a lot to see a community of people suffering with the same thing.  I am planning on doing testing as soon as possible. Thank you for the kind comment. If your Mom  has it, you have a 50-50 chance of having it. Only way to find out is to see a Dr though. There is not much anyone here will be able to tell you as there are hundreds of possibilities the disease could be for the common symptoms that we all share. I actually have a strong guess as to whether you have it or not, but I will withhold comment as it is pretty much useless. I have got a brother, sister, cousins and an Aunt who through the years were convinced they had it too but after testing and see various Dr's tested negative for it. It turned out to be other issues.  \n\n\nSymptoms are not enough for us to tell you either way. You have to see a Dr and be tested. Find a regional clinic for cmt. Are you near the university of iowa? Otherwise look up cmt regional clinics and find a specialist, they can answer this moreso than we can, no one can tell you for sure. If your mom has it you have a 50/50 chance, that is all we can tell you To me it sounds like you definitely have it. I was diagnosed as a child and think the test predominantly is confirmed by blood and family history. But these symptoms are typical of CMT and it is usually genetically passed on. You should try to get tested as soon as you are able to get any potential support you might need and help reassure you. For example, splints/braces (that you take off) and physio may help you. Good luck with it and hope you manage to control your symptoms. :)", "What is your physical condition in your dreams? Curious about other peoples conditions in their dreams. In mine I am never handicapped. Granted I didnt really show severe signs until mid-late twenties so I have spent most of my life (32m) playing sports and music, so that may have something to do with it. I wonder if as it progresses and I have more and more memories of braces and walking canes in my nocturnal life movies will change. Idk really its not something i pay attention to. The one the i can say is there is no pain. So eliminating the factor of pain and the metal limitations i make for myself in day to day life. For instance in a dream if i see the elevator door closing i might run at it to try to stop it but irl i know i have a high risk of a sprain or tear to a ligament so i dont even bother. Its an interesting concept though. Still handicapped when I dream, unless I am lucid, which does not happen often.  Generally speaking though, I am disabled when asleep/dreaming.  I have had braces and multiple surgeries since I was a kid, so that might have something to do with it. I am 23 and have type 2A and have been in AFOs since I was 6, so I really only remember being disabled. But I was just telling my boyfriend about the fact that in my dreams, I have no limitations. Idk if I just do not think about the braces or if I see myself as normal in my dreams. The unconscious mind is crazy I have wore braces since I was 5, and am now in a chair at 55, and my dreams can go either way. Sometimes I am walking and running and sometimes I am in my chair. Sometimes in the same dream. I dream a lot about being able to fly too. Aw man, the flying ones are the best. I once had an otherwise unremarkable dream where I was able to stand on my toes (something I have not been able to do since childhood). This was after a year of 3x/week yoga and Pilates classes specifically trying to strengthen my legs and improve balance. I went to class that afternoon and while laying out my mat, I suddenly remembered the dream and it hit me that I could NOT stand on my toes. It was such a weird moment of shattering disappointment lol", "Experience with achilles lengthening surgery? Hey all, first time posting here but looking for some insight. Today I had an appointment at the hanger clinic to get my braces adjusted. I was informed that at this point adjustments are not really what I need, and that I should talk to my main orthopedic about potentially having surgery to lengthen my achilles to get my foot to go into a flat, more neutral position. \n\nI am really kind of anxious at the thought of having surgery done and would love some insight from anyone who has had it done (what your experience was like, your recovery time, how much it helped, ect.) Hi! I had this done at the same time as a tarsal tunnel release. Recovery went well with a lot of physical therapy. The biggest obstacle was honestly just relearning how to properly walk with changed anatomy. Most of the pain I felt was really the tarsal release so I cannot give you much info there. The lengthening mostly just felt like I was pulling it when I started walking again (hence, lots of physical therapy). It took my about 6 months to really feel \u201cnormal\u201d again but I was walking much sooner than that (with aid of crutches) I had my heel re aligned,  tendons transferred,  and my Achilles lengthened.  My foot plants alot better but visually it looks the same.  \nI am able to lift my foot a little higher and do not trip on air anymore. The most difficult part of the actuall lengthening was getting my calf working through the extended range of motion.  It was odd.\nIf I wanted to add a visual improvement I think a cole osteotomy would have been an ok choice\n Out of curiosity, how long did you have to use crutches for? I had to stay off it completely (crutches full time) for 2 months. Then I could start slowly putting weight on it. And start physical therapy. It probably took me about a month before I could go down to just 1 crutch for balance and to relieve just a little weight. It was about 4 months before I really trusted just walking (shorter distances) without a crutch near by. \n\nMy recovery (I have been told) was a little extreme because of how much had to be done to my foot / leg. I struggled much more with the tarsal recovery than the tendon. Really it was just my balance that was affected with the tendon. A good PT was really important to my recovery. I had it done when I was very young and there is just tiny scars on the backs of my ankles Hi. I had this done. I had my achilles lengthend and they moved two muscles (tibialis posterior and anoher one) from the inside to the outside. The later helped to have more \"pull\"  on the ourside so that the feet will not get pulled to the inside. \n\nI had both feet done in one surgery. I startet to train walking 3 days after the surgery. After I think it was 2 weeks I was released from hospital with crutches. Till then I moved from wheelchair to \"standing wheelchair/stand\" to crutches. I had to do the next months training and physical therapy. Du to the fact that those two muscles had been \"switched\" side I had to train walking again from scratch and had to rewire my brain. It was funny to send the \"thought\" command to pull the feet to the inside and instead it went to the outside. \n\nBut damn...it helped a lot!!! I had  it done about 23 years ago ( I was around 19 at that time). Sadly I have to say that in the last 10 or so years the feets started to \"pull\" more and more to the  inside again. It is a slow process but there is one. \n\nSo, yes it helped. It takes about 3 to 6 months milage might vary. I was \"ready\" to walk again after 2 oder 3 Weeks with cruchtes and was \"mobile\" again. I had no problems until now woth the achilles or the muscles in any form except the general weakening over time.\n\nWould I do it again ? - Yes. \n\nI might would have waited a bit longer as this is a \"one-time\" only surgery. Or so I have been told.But I am not even sure about this. It enabled me to have some great epxerineces in my younger years that I else might not have experienced without the  surgery as I would not have been able to. But now the next step for me would be changing and \"flatening\" the feet bones by breaking them and taking parts out  of it (I think its this cole osteotomy)...NOPE!! \n\nMy tip would also be to keep training after everything is done and your back to 100%.  I did not train my \"moved muscles\" and I guess that is why they also startet to get weaker again. To takte the oportunity when you do PT and ask for additional \"strengthening excercices\" and do them all the time. Good luck.", "Little to no family history of CMT, but I seem to have it I am a 19 year old college student who was diagnosed with having moderate nerve damage in my legs when I was 16. There has never been any record of previous family members having CMT or anything like it. My dad might have a small case of it as of now but it is no where near as bad as mine. My brother is 4 years older than me but has no nerve damage at all. I have not been tested for CMT for cost reasons and wanted some opinions from you guys. Thanks. Also if I do have CMT, are there any ways around preventing it in my offspring down the road? It is genetic. My family has had it for many generations on one side. It does not effect every child or could effect every child... for instance 1 in 3 siblings had it a generation ago, before that it was 4 out of 5, and my generation was both me and my sibling. I think there might be a pill for a certain type of CMT, not the one I am diagnosed with, but then again mine is not super destructive... just a pain in the ass.\n While all CMT result in nerve damage, not all nerve damage is caused by CMT. Do you know any detail about the nerve damage you were diagnosed with? The severity of CMT can vary greatly between members of the family, despite them having the same type. PGT and IVF is available for many forms of CMT. I have CMT1a and am the only one in my whole family that has it - not even my (fraternal) twin brother has it. CMT can be caused by random gene mutation so you may have it. I was displaying symptoms as a baby and got officially diagnosed at 2. \n\nAs far as kids go, it is genetic but there are ways to separate the sperm cells that carry the mutation and only fertilize the woman with healthy sperm. Do not remember the name of the procedure. \n\nAlso there are several clinical trials for cmt medicine occurring across the world. I am participating in one and I am living in the states.  Thanks for replying, where would I go for more info on these trials? I am involved in the PXT-3003 study, and I know Acceleron is starting a new study for a different drug in the states. However these drugs can only be effective against certain types of CMT so it is important to be diagnosed first. \nWhen I started the PXT study, they conducted their own blood test and confirmed my earlier diagnosis. You may be able to get tested like I did, but these studies are only held in a few cities across the US and I have to fly every 3 months to receive the drugs and get tested.", "Looking for recs on helpful gadgets that I can give as a gift A family member has CMT and his hands are really bad. For Christmas this year I would like to get him something that can help with daily tasks. Anything you recommend for someone? Hi, I do not have ideas about help with daily tasks, I already research some tips, but you can invest in a ( useful for the training of the hand. This will not allow you to gain strength, but it may limit the decrease in strength and autonomy. In case you are my brother: I am really hoping for a Walther PPQ M2 so I can operate the slide more easily. No need to wrap it. ;)\n\nSince you are probably not: I have often thought a button hook would be really nice for when I am wearing dress shirts. Buttoning my clothes is irritating and time consuming. \n\nI cannot think of many other gadgets that would improve my life that are not straight up medical devices, or very particular to my hobbies. \n\nAlso, I think it is really sweet of you to think of your family member and his needs. But I will say for my part that I might be a little put off if someone got me tools for my disability as a gift. I would never complain outwardly, but I would like to be treated as capable until I say otherwise. It just makes me feel like a whole person, and would rather find my own adaptive aids as I see fit. Not to shut down your idea, I just want to make sure your family member is open to receiving these kinds of gifts where he might really rather just have the same thing as anyone else. \n\nI will follow this thread in case someone else has a cool idea. Best of luck! That is interesting! Do you have one? yeah, I got one, and in use it regularly, I love it because it connected to smartphone, and I can saw the evolution of my training. It is a small investment but it is a fun way to keep some good strength in your hands.\n\nI think that this objects will be very useful in the future. It is the funniest object for the hand's training. Definitely a button hook at previously mentioned. A long shoe horn maybe. An xbox, my doctor said that using the controller was good for me hands. I could not be without my electric tin opener! So I would recommend those as well as jar openers although I still cannot manage with the jar openers myself. \n\nAside from disability driven gadgets, the standard electric toothbrush is something many of us needed before they become mainstream. An upgrade is always a good choice and will not seem like it is necessarily aimed at their condition, while helping at the same time. I like this thread My parents got me this really cool thing that opens lids. I would starve without it. It has huge gears on it that tighten around the lid and then a long arm so you can open it. I also agree with the items listed above!\n\nAnother thing I could not live without is hammertoe cushions. They are these soft silicone type things that basically wrap around the hammertoe and then have a flat bottom that prevents your hammertoe from curling under your foot. \n\nMy grandfather also had CMT and he had a cool gadget that helped him slide his shoes/socks on. Kind of like a metal thing that goes around the heel and then just slides out when you have the shoe on completely. \n\nMy grandfather also had a thing on all of his keys to make it easier to turn the key when unlocking something. I think they are called key caps. \n\nSomething to help with zippers might be nice too. I usually use a pliers to get zippers but I am sure something else exists!", "Do you swim, cycle or do Yoga? Looking for people who can give advice on low-impact exercises! Hi all \ud83d\udc4b  I am currently putting together a site which is focused on helping people with CMT stay mobile and minimise the symptoms of the disease as much as is realistically possible. A large element of this is by exercising frequently - currently I have plenty of information about strength training, so am looking to expand and include other low-impact exercises, such as swimming, cycling, yoga etc.\n\nIf anyone here participates in any of these and is willing to share some information, useful links, sites, please can you let me know either here or feel free to drop me a message - the more options that can be presented to people with CMT, the better! I swim. It has made me stronger without a lot of muscle strain I do cycle primarily but also yoga, barre, and pilates I will do swimming, stationary bikes, and rowing machines. \n\nI do not like sharing the pool with too many people so I will do the bike or rowing if I do not wake up early enough to beat others into the pool.\n\nThe bike can be a bit too easy since it is only using your legs and I do not want to be there for more than an hour after strength training. While the rowing machine targets more muscles, it is limiting because it can start to hurt my back after 30 - 45 minutes. \n\nI hope you can find something that works for you! Personally I use a recumbent bike when one is available, or a static bike if the former is not available. As for other muscles, I use machines and free weights. \n\nHave you had any issues with swimming or have you managed to swim regularly without any issues caused by CMT? Thanks, have you had to adjust how you approach these activities due to CMT in any way? Sometimes my back can hurt if I am not swimming with the right form. Also, my Achilles\u2019 tendon (normally just one, not both) can feel strained after a long session or too many sessions in back to back days. This forces me to overcompensate with the other foot which can lead to pain there. And, though rarely, I may roll ankle some if I come down too hard on the surface of the water. \n\nI would say I encounter one of these problems maybe 1 in every 5 sessions. I normally swim every other day and might go back to back on some weekends. I swim for about 1.5 - 2 hrs each session. \n\nMaybe the duration is causing problems? I do not know, it just feels nice to be able to exercise for long periods of time and my only concern is exhaustion rather than pain tolerance or being able to walk/limp afterwards. I would not say I have to adjust them but I typically cannot achieve what others can and have to accept that. Most classes offer modifications to make things easier/more doable and I almost always have to take them. I do weight lifting. There are definitely things you cannot perform as well as others when it comes to weight-lifting.\n\nI find with CMT, it is hard to keep muscle mass at reasonably low bodyfat percentage, &lt; 15. But if you are willing to hover at a larger bodyfat, I think you can pull some impressive lifts and work with heavier weights.\n\nPersonally, I like to keep my BF below 15, and therefore I am pretty limited in terms of progression with weights. But, it still helps me maintain my mobility.", " How To Rapidly Fill Your Social Circle With Interesting New People \u2013 My #1 Social Hack ", "Afo, shoe friction noise Hi guys, just to let you know I have tried dryer sheets, Vaseline, and even WD-40. How in the world do you stop the noise between the bottom of your afo in your shoe? I do not even know if it is the bottom it could be the back. The last thing I can think of is moleskin.  Does anyone have any advice? because, ultimately, I can just go with it and smile, but it is kind of embarrassing. Put a dryer sheet between your brace and your shoe! Perhaps baby powder? Socks and shoes that fit properly. I have used baby powder for 30 year and It works! Do not get the kind with starch though, that kind does not work. I have never heard of AFO\u2019s squeaking with no shoes though. Mine never have without shoes. I looked at my brace a lot closer last night, and did not notice the screw is loose because it was laying flush against the plastic?  so that is where the noise was coming from. I did put dryer sheets in the bottom of my shoe and that took care of it, so I thought the dryer sheets just lost their luster.  So I have to go to hangar tomorrow to get it fixed.  \ud83d\ude44 I use moleskin", "Son just diagnosed and I have stupid questions Hello. I wonder if anyone minds if I have a bunch of dumb questions? My son was slow to walk (and talk which is a different issue) but because of this and because now he can walk he has an unusual gait, the dr tested his genetics. The result was that they have no idea why he is not really talking but that he has CMT. We will be speaking to a geneticist in a few weeks or so but right now we know nothing that cannot be googled.\n\nMy husband, his sister and his mum have feet with extremely high arches. His mum\u2019s toes are starting to point upward and she walks with a limp which she says was due to a broken to from over a decade ago. Could this actually be a mild form of CMT? And if so, would that be a good indicator of what to expect for my son?\n\nMy husband and his mum and grandfather also had a condition that makes them lose feeling in the last few fingers on each hand. Those fingers curl inwards too. My husband had his operated on at 14. Could this also be a symptom of CMT?\n\nPlus, he is only 3.5years old. Might his legs hurt, especially on long walks? He is non verbal and cries a lot so it is impossible to really know if he is hurt or just wants to be carried or if he just wants a cookie as it is the same cry (no tears) for all of it.\n\nFinally, my daughter is 7 and has shown no mobility issues, but I guess she may have it also? Is there a high probability of both kids having it?\n\nThank you for reading this. I know they are questions to ask the geneticist but I am struggling to be patient and want to know as much as I can.\n\nX Hello and a welcome (with mixed feelings) to the community. It is not very exciting to find out that your family has a genetic disorder but it can certainly be a relief to have a name for it and be able to start to piece together a road map for how the condition may evolve over time. \n\nYou say that you son had a genetic test. Do you know his subtype? That will make a difference in how likely it is that other family members share this. \n\nFrom your description I think it is entirely possible that your husband and some of his family members may also have CMT. They may wish to have genetic tests themselves to confirm this or to rule it out. I think when the first person in my large family got a diagnosis there were a lot of other family members who got diagnosed over the next couple of years who had previously thought themselves to simply be a bit clumsy or have minor physical quirks.  \n\nThere can be considerable variation in how CMT progresses even within the same family. My sibling has a far more severe case than I do, for instance. If your husband has CMT and has the most common variant (which is type 1A) then your daughter has a 50/50 chance of also having inherited CMT. There are a lot of \"if's\" here though. It would be reasonable to keep an eye on her and consider having her tested. \n\nThe general course of CMT is slowly progressive. Even though there can be a lot of variations between how severe different cases are you can guess from how early symptoms show and how serious they are at a young age how they will fare in the future. For instance, if your daughter does have CMT she is likely to have a more mild case than your son. \n\nI think it would be worthwhile to talk to a physical therapist about how to make sure your son gets a good amount of exercise without exceeding his limits. I cannot begin to guess if he is having pain after walking a certain distance but perhaps a professional can and/or recommend a series of exercises to make sure his muscles develop optimally now. You will want a physical therapist who is very knowledgeable about both neurological diseases and children so you may need to look to a major children's hospital or a CMT Center of Excellence if there is one near you.\n\nI hope this helps to answer some of your questions. I have CMT directly from my mother, and my sister does not have any symptoms. I would not worry about your older one for now, as she could very well not have it or she might have a very mild form and start seeing signs later in life. \n\nIn terms of prognosis, it is very difficult to tell. It is generally an extremely slow progressing disease, but certain individuals do see symptoms appear more rapidly. If you do more gene testing and identify the specific type he has, that could provide more accurate information. \n\nIn terms of your and your husband\u2019s family histories, those things all sound like potential signs and symptoms of CMT. However, if your husband had surgery for his condition, I am surprised that they would not have done any testing to see what condition he has. As you know from your son, the testing is conclusive, so it would have been easy enough to test your husband as a child. Also, lots of symptoms like high arches or difficulty walking could indicate other diseases or just be idiopathic. \n\nI am not a doctor, but I would recommend just letting your son continue doing physical things that he is been doing and assume he is fine. CMT can lead to muscular atrophy and it is good for him to keep doing physical activity. As a child, I was horribly uncoordinated and fell down constantly, but I am glad that I was not sheltered inside or treated differently due to my disease. Obviously, if he is really struggling with physical activity in the future, it should be addressed, but if he does not seem distressed by physical activity, I would stick with it. CMT until very recently was not really treated so well IMO - it is not really curable, and there are so many types, with different types of symptoms etc - if he truly does have it find the regional CMT clinic and take him. You will get all the best care and answers you can ask for by people who just treat CMT. The closest to me was university of iowa. He is so young, he will benefit immensely as will you. It is also valuable to know if someone is a carrier for the CMT gene. My former husband (now best friend) has a severe case of CMT and my daughter may be a carrier. I agree that it is valuable to contact your regional CMT clinic, and their advice on the treatment for dealing with this disease early in your son\u2019s life. I should also add that genetic testing is a good idea to find out what type you have, should they suggest it Thank you so much for your answer. All I know is from a zoom conversation with his paediatrician and it was a muffled and brief call. He had a blood test and it showed duplication on the 17th chromosome. I think that means CMT1A? We will have a more in depth meeting with a geneticist at some point. Everything is taking a long time due to Covid19. He already has a physio involved so we have contacted her. She is great so hopefully we will get some good exercises for him. When he walks he lifts his legs up too high and looks like a Thunderbirds puppet. Now I am watching him like a hawk. I am sort of drifting between thinking it will all be ok and oh god it is going to be really tough. He was diagnosed Thursday and I have lost 8lbs since. Xxx Thank you for this. He is at school and loving running around with his funny little gait with the other kids. I am trying not to let him see my worries and he is a happy little boy. I have been thinking about my side of the family. I break toes a lot. Like at least every three months. Sometimes my hips feel like they pop out their sockets and they have to be popped back. Plus I have horrific repetitive strain in my hands when I write. My sister had hip problems that cause her s lot of pain and my beloved late uncle used to have terrible pain in his legs if he sat down for any length of time. So the CMT may come from my side. It does me no good mulling over it I know, but I cannot help it. I know I will come to terms with it all eventually, but right now it is too fresh and raw. Xxx I am going to make some enquires about whether we could get tested too. It is the nhs though, so while they are amazing and free, they may not test us if we do not have sufficient symptoms. I hope you guys are doing ok xx Thank you for this! I will have a look, are they in the U.K. too? He got tested. I think it is CMT1A because he has duplication ok his 17th chromosome. Google dr shy, university of iowa cmt clinic. I do not know if they have international locations, but you would be able to find any info or links thru that website. Otherwise reach out to the  muscular distrophy organization locally to you and ask if they have any info. They are very helpful. I have 1A as well, lots of good info out there but drop me a pm if you have any additional questions. Take a deep breath. Nothing is going to happen overnight, you have time and you are finding good answers for him now which will help guide him towards maximizing his potential, and really that is all anyone can do. \nIt does indeed sound like he has the most common form, CMT1A, the duplication on the 17th chromosome. That is what I have, too. The good news about being a part of the biggest group of CMT'ers is that it is the group which gets the most research attention. While there are no treatments (or cures) yet there are researchers all over the world working on multiple approaches that could lead to a good treatment in your son's lifetime. \nLifting his feet too high sounds like he is having some footdrop, which is to say that he is not able to reliably lift his feet when he takes a step and is compensating by lifting the whole leg more so that his toes do not catch on the ground and trip him. Eventually he should probably get evaluated by someone who can prescribe AFO's (Ankle Foot Orthotics) because sooner or later he will probably benefit from them. AFO's are braces which can hold his ankles at a rigid 90 degree angle while he walks. Lots of CMT folks wear them and find that they help a great deal with mobility. He may not need them yet; I am just giving you a heads up that this might be coming. \nRemember that you need to take care of yourself so that you can take care of your children. CMT is not going to cause a sudden crisis more serious than a skinned knee right now, this week. You will have the time you need to sort out a plan with the professionals who are helping with his care. The first genetic test for CMT only became available in the late 1990s, if I recall correctly. It was expensive, not necessarily trusted fully by all doctors (it was one of the first genetic tests commercially available for patients) and may even not have been approved at the same time in the UK (I only know about the US). \n\nJust some CMT history. Possibly relevant, possibly not. Thank you. I know it is a slow moving thing. I will calm down in a week or two. I worry that 3.5 years old is extremely young to be showing footdrop, so I hope I am wrong. I am having a tough couple of weeks to be honest. I had to call an ambulance for my mum because she was having terrifying trouble with her heart. My uncle has been admitted into hospital and we have been told he will likely pass away over the next few days. I am bleeding out and my dr is fearful and has set me up with a bunch of tests to check it is not cancer. In the meantime I am exhausted with anaemia, exhausted with worry and I have whiplash and two broken toes. On the plus side, the toes and neck are mending well, the initial tests have not found cancer and my mum is back out of hospital and beginning to feel a little better. Also losing that 8lbs has put me back under my BMI! \nI really appreciate your support. I cannot talk to my mum about it, I have not even told her because I am scared her heart would not be able to take it.\nXxx Even in a year when everyone is already dealing with a lot at once, that is a lot to deal with at once. I wish your family the best. Thank you xxx Ah, that makes sense why her husband may have been too early to be tested. Hi! I was finally diagnosed at 26 (which is incredibly early still but I have had this pain since I was a child), so just know that knowledge this early is powerful. Only a doctor can give you specifics on what will work in your sons specific case. It is hard to be patient but this will be a lifetime of information that can only benefit him and his health. Things I have been recently told to dig in to: sleep positions, splinting (under guidance of a doctor!!), and physical therapy. It is all lifestyle changes at this point that you can now help your son reinforce from a young age rather than relearn later in life. Remember to breathe, it can be easy to forget while taking this all in! Thank you for this. We are calling in all the help we can get. I do fear that he is in pain, but he is not able to communicate that with us because he cannot really talk. This will also make things difficult when it comes to the physio too. But we will do everything we can. Xx", "Painting AFOs? I am supposed to get my first AFOs in a long time in a couple weeks. My orthotist and I decided on either the BlueRocker or ToeOFF, depending on which feels better (he had a pair of tester BlueRockers for me to try at my consultation, which worked well, but wants to try the ToeOFFs before he takes me back to the shop to fit them to me.). The problem is they are kind of ugly as sin. \n\nSo! How the heck do you paint them? I read that painting carbon fiber is difficult and that you have to treat it like fiberglass or something? And would painting make them noticeably heavier? If I have to, I can just wear funky socks, but I want people to be able to look at my assistive devices when I am not wearing/using them and say, \u201cOh. Those are biteytheswitch\u2019s braces,\u201d you know? I am not sure of any painting options that would actually last. AFOs get put through so much stress. I would say if you have to option for the color plastic go with black, they are easier to work around with a color pallet unless you prefer pastels then I would say a lighter color. I know BlueRockers are pre-made so It all depends on what your Ortho Doc has access to I am not familiar with the ToeOFFs though.\n\n&amp;#x200B; Thanks. Yeah, ToeOFFs are the same brand as BlueRockers, so the options are pretty much the same. My orthotist did not ask what color I would prefer, which means I am probably getting the default black. Oh, well. Time for the brightest, most obnoxious knee high socks. XD Have you had the blue rockers before? I went through two sets in under 1.5 years. Shits are not cheap. They did work well, just the part on the side that connects to the foot plate kept becoming compromised. Granted I was a server and did shit loads of walking, and ride a bike often. ", "Piriformis Muscle Hello fellow CMT'ers! \n\nAs someone that has had ALL the diagnostic testing and yet still cannot get a confirmed diagnosis of CMT let alone a specif type of CMT, I find myself having to much of my own medical research as best I can, when I can.\n\nI do have an appointment in Philly with the Jefferson Medical at the CMT clinic but that is not until the end of May. As far as any local support, or even any help in this backward state, Delaware, there really is no one in the entire state, at least not that I have been able to find or any MD I have seen can recommend.\n\nMy questions pertains to an unbearable sharp, piercing, pain that at times seem to emanate from somewhere in the spine or the pelvic area. Sometimes I think it is the SI joint but that has been ruled out by my back dr. At other times I think it is the very end of the spine, the tail bone, but that appears to be ruled out by MRI's (GOD I HATE those things!).\n\nSo I always seem to end up back at the Piriformis muscle. Currently, I have had 2 sessions of botox in both calves, the 2nd round was about 25% greater than the first round of shots, to aid attempt to subdue or reduce the pain in my calves.\n\nThe 2nd round had an unexpected result for me, it appears to have also semi-reduced the killer spasticity I experience in the thighs, both the hamstrings and the quads.\n\nSo, my question is, Has anyone ever heard of anything regarding the Piriformis muscle and CMT?\n\nDo the DR's do anything or recommend anything to bring the pain, emanating from the piriformis under control?\n\nI am sorry for the length of this message. I was trying to provide as much info up front so as to reduce questions I hopefully answered in my tldr post.\n\nThanks in advance for ANY help, info you can provide. Have you tried using AFO's? Possible that abnormalities in your gait are causing other muscle groups to compensate and be overworked. Usually hipflexors  compensate for weak CMT dorsiflexors.. Not sure if piriformis could be involved.   I have had pain in my tailbone and groin for years and diagnosed with SI joint dysfunction. When I had my hipflexors/psoas muscles worked on all muscles released and felt so much better. I trigger point and massage my piriformis using a foam roller when flared up. Wear a SI belt too from time to time. AFO's have been great with unloading the overworked muscle groups and overall muscle pain is down. Hope you will find something that helps soon! Thank you for such an awesome, in depth response! The Physiatrist I began seeing months ago wrote a script for braces, I do not know if they are specifically AFO's. The same day I ordered the braces, I received a call from my Pain Management DR's office telling me she and the Physiatrist talked it over and decided to hold off on the braces until the Spasticity in my legs is under control.\n\nNow it is months later, the Spasticity is still not under control.\n\nPlaying phone tag with the Physiatrist for 3 weeks and he just now tells me he does not remember him and the pain dr coming to that agreement.\n\nStill do not have braces. It seems the botox injections in my calves have diminished some of the pain but now I do not know if the weakness in the legs is caused by botox, neuropathy, atrophy, or this maybe, most-likely, but unsure, non-committal CMT.\n\nI just do not know which way to go next.\n\nI cannot get an appointment with the Physistrist until the end of April at the latest. The neuro-muscular specialist I see is the only one within a hundred miles, she does not speak English well and does not comprehend English well, one visit shes says I have CMT, the next I do not have CMT, when pressed she says it probably is because it cannot be anything else. but,...\n\nI do not know if I should order braces or not. Would it, could it, make things worse?\n\nI have an appointment with a CMT specialist at Jefferson Medical but that is not until the end of May and for the most part is nothing more than a meet and great. Hello Awwman,\n\nI am curious to what has been done so far for your Spasticity.\n\nI have it slightly, kind of looks like worms going up &amp; down my calves.\nAre they having you do any physical therapy, or tried any medications?\n\nAnd, (on the side) have you tried any THC/CBD indica edibles before going to bed? \ud83e\udd14 I found this to calm my muscles greatly... \n\nPersonally I have noticed less Spasticity after doing tibia muscle exercises.\nThe exercise is actually for people with shin splints, but I noticed afterwards that it also calmed my muscles in my legs a bit.\n\nHere is a video: \n\nI would love to know what you have tried as well, thanks! Be glad to share whatever info I can. \n\nWhen the spasticity was just my calves, it looked like bugs, running up and the calves just under the skin. Many times it was so bad when someone that was unaware of the condition saw the zooming bugs they were totally grossed out. They actually thought something was inside me and traveling.\n\nAs far as, what has been done, unfortunately, very little. It took me years to find a pain management specialist that would prescribe medications. All because of this damn state! HELLaware is backwards in many many ways.\n\nOnce I found her we began working on a diagnosis but until something plausible presented we began what I call, \"medication roulette\" . Apparently, my system is quite sensitive to many medications or to some cocktails. Ended up at the ER TWICE this past thanksgiving due to a new cocktail.\n\nI have been on Baclofen and Tizanidine for years. They barely help but they are better than nothing.\n\nJust started a new round of PT specifically for spasticity. Had the 2nd appointment today, 2/27.\n\nStarted botox about 5 months ago. I have had 2 rounds. The first round helped my calves but not the thighs. The first injections were only in the calves.\n\nThe second round, again only in the calves, seems to be helping with the Spasticity in the thighs as well as the calves. However, there is a constant feeling, hard to explain, that that the spasticity in the thighs is just about breaking through. As if the botox is barely holding it at bay.\n\nI have not tried any edibles but I certainly want to! If you have any recommendations as to kind or source I would love to try them out. If they can only be purchased via a 'state store' again, HELLaware makes that almost impossible to get.  But, I need something. Over the years, my will has been depleted and the pain is winning. I nearing the end of patience and time.\n\nWilling to try just about anything! Thank you for the tons of information you just shared with this group. I know it was I that asked the questions, but this kind of information is a great resource for others!\n\nThere is so much to take in &amp; unpack that I might have to come back later &amp; do a separate post.\n\nSo just to compare &amp; provide a foundation as to where my CMT ends &amp; yours begins...,  so far I only have Spasticity in my calves. \n\nI currently have no restless legs at night, (but my calve muscles will lock up when I am sleeping if I do not drink enough water that day, or mess with caffeine). I can look back to my childhood and definitely tell that I had CMT, but at the time I never knew what it was...\n\nSo I grew up just thinking I had skinny arms &amp; legs, and just needed to workout more, (and it was my fault for being so weak).\n\nIn a way, I believe that mindset actually helped me. I never went easy on my self and just pushed past my limits when I was still in my teens &amp; could adapt. \n\nBut eventually...\n\nBy age 35, I really started feeling fatigued, sore back, and my feet were killing me..., and even THEN I just told myself it was nothing... \n\nBy age 40 my mother was diagnosed with CMT and shortly afterwards I was tested... \n\n\nThere are so many variables for each person that I just do not know what to try, or do..., besides staying active, eating right, not over asserting my body and drinking lots of water. \n\nI still do hit the gym three days a week. Every bit of muscle I can reclaim (if possible) is a victory won. I used to have much worse back, neck and leg pains. It is taken me almost three years just to put a modest amount of muscle on me..., but the hard work has been worth it!\n\nBut when my back or legs are just beyond what normal medications can handle..., I consume 10mg of THC/CBD edible, (the indica strand that helps with relaxation) about two hours before bed time. I usually buy a box of cannabis cookies, (1 dozen) for around $24 bucks - and that box can last me months... \n\nWhat happens after eat a cookie? \nAbout two hours later I feel like I am sinking into the chair. All my muscles feel like someone massaged them into rubber. I begin to feel sleepy, (and yes the munchies are real so have something close by to snack on, but also have lots of water too). \n\nEventually I hit the bed and it feels like im melting into the mattress, completely relaxed and sleep comes quickly.\n \nI wake up in the morning feeling amazing. My legs feel like that actually slept..., like they are supposed to. \n\nOne caveat. I personally noticed that if I take more than two cookies a month, (over a few months) I began to become extremely sensitive to everything. So my feet begin to feel the smallest discomfort, my hands hurt from turning a key in the door... Etc. \n\nIf I refrain from edibles for a month, all symptoms go away. This may be an issue only for me, but still wanted to share. \n\nNext question may be: what if you do not live in a legal state? \n\nHere is what I learned while visiting Vegas;   you can contact almost any Vegas physician (that deals with muscle pains) and they will register you for a medical marijuana license. Once approved..., you will have a doctor's note that will allow you to buy cannabinoids online from Vegas vendors. And this process is easier that most people think... You just keep a doctor's note with you at all times and I believe this will cover you in Maryland, (but you probably want to do some due diligence in your area as well, just to make sure). \n\nI know the whole \"marijuana license\" is hard to fathom, but I actually have three family members that all went through Vegas to get their own. I personally live in Washington State area for the moment, (I travel a lot) so I am all set for a bit. For those that may be interested going through the Vegas route... \n\nHere is a link to a resource:\n\n\n\nI do not have much more advice besides getting exercise, drinking lots of water, taking a good vitamin, and having an edible when needed..., I personally do not know what else to try.\n\nI believe I am a lot like you when it comes to medications, hence why I have stopped trying years ago.\n\nMy mom has tried electro therapy, (that people with neuropathy are known to use as therapy) but unfortunately this ended up doing more damage to her legs.\n\nYou just never know what may work or does not, and or even may make things worse.\n\nApologies for the wall of text. \n\nBut please let me know if I can calify on anything above.\n\nAs well, thanks again for delving deeper into what you have been through &amp; tried. I may start a whole new topic for this next question, but maybe you can take a crack at it, (as I honestly do not knowing much just yet).\n\nThe question is: Disability\n\nI have personally have never been needed any form of disability, (or even if this is something available to CMTers) but as my CMT progresses I believe I should learn what options may be available to myself and others.\n\nWould you happen to know more on this subject, (if I am being to personal then I apologize). \n\nThanks again either way! I am not sure I understand. The question is disability? or, the subject is disability? Disability is a very broad and very deep subject. It covers many aspects of medicine and life. Honestly, I would not know where to start. As I am not sure I understand from where you are thinking of tackling the subject it would be best if you began the initial post and see where it goes from there. Good Luck! Thanks for the response and the link! Definitely going to check in into the NV option! Here in the Land that Time Forgot, a.k.a. Delaware, it is not that we do not have access to THC/CBD edibles, it is that the state makes it as difficult and expensive as possible. $125 annually, just to purchase a license to buy anything. If you do not give the state their mafia money, you do not get THC/CBD.\n\nI have some aquaintences in the area with various qualifying diseases that spend well into the $400 - $900 monthly for medically approved issues and they say that does not begin to get them through the month. With the new level of nephropathy and spasticity even they say my level of pain by far exceeds theirs. \n\nThere is no way in the world I can afford that kind of money monthly for medicine. Funny when you think about it. Coons, one of the delaware senators, is always all over the insurance companies and the drug companies for their cost and their prices and yet his own state intentionally gouges its on citizens suffering and I do mean suffering, with and in chronic, longterm, debilitating pain.\n\nI am still going to try the NV way, cause something has to give! Apologies, I can see where my question is vague in nature.\n\nTo narrow down what I am wondering about...\n\nHave you, (or anyone else you know with CMT) ever received a disability check?\n\nI have read many stories on this page of people barely able to stand more than 10 to 20 minutes at a time, or are to fatigued to work a job.\n\nBut no one elaborates on how they are getting by without working a 40 hour work week.\n\nI am sure some have help from family &amp; friends, but for everyone else that gets to the point of not being able to work anymore..., have they tried getting disability checks?\n\nI will be asking my doctor next week for a handicap plack, (to hang from my car's mirror). I believe that is a good place to start building a case that may need future assistance. I can totally feel my overall energy dropping each year, so I believe it is important to look at all my options now and not wait till when my body is at its lowest...\n\nBut If you are not aware of any CMTers receiving disability, no worries! \n\nI will report back here next week, (after I ask my doctor) and share whatever he tells me. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nOh and..., the costs for THC in your area is ridiculously high and I am really sorry to hear that.\n I meant that is so messed up, because all of it is dirt cheap in Washington State, Oregon, and Nevada.\n\nAlso, I truly was not prepared by how professional the stores were &amp; the amount of knowledge by consultants &amp; the diverse amount of products.\n\nThey even have a cream for people with neuropathy. The bottle was 40 bucks, but can last a month or two.\n\nThey had THC /CDA infused epson salts, dozens of blended strands, (that consult explains each one, tailoring it to your needs) ..., the list goes on &amp; on. \nBut what I noticed the most was the sheer number of people in these stores asking how cannabinoids can help them, or their family members with their ailments. \n\nI heard very few people in line, or heard talk near if) me of people just wanting to get high &amp; party. It is undeniable; most people going to these THC stores are usually there because of an ailment, and or returning because the stuff works! Did you end up trying braces? I hope some progress has been made between the pain management doctor, the physiatrist, and neuromuscular specialist.\n\nI have been using braces for the last few months and the pain in my SI joint is completely gone. They kind of reset my walking pattern, so even when not wearing them I am no longer engaging the wrong muscles as much.\n\nAll the best! I was just measured and molded for braces today. Due to the pandemic, manufacture will take approximately 4 weeks. Then I still have to find even larger shoes to purchase before I can even begin to wear them. Guess time will tell. That is a coincidence that I commented that day you got measured! I hope they help.  Depending how chunky your braces are you could stay the same shoe size but with extra depth and/or width. A lot of people go up a full size instead (adding unnecessary and annoying length), but I managed to find a website where shoes can be ordered especially with extra width/depth    \n\nHow has your piriformis and spacisity been? Thanks for the link! Without braces I take a 13-14, 4 WWWW\nI fear finding shoes for my extremely big, totally FLAT, fat feet is going to be next to impossible. Especially when I need to consider cost of shoes and a VERY short lifespan as my feet have always been very hard on any kind of shoe. Any update on this? Did you get a genetic test? I am here are a lot of things that can affect the Piriformis muscle Hello. I totally forgot about this post. Genetic testing was done. Discovered 3 genetic abnormalities. \n\nThe second gene mutation was labeled: Dominant CMT type 2D\nAnd yet, one specialist says it may or may not be CMT.\n\nAnd to make it even better! The 3rd mutation is a muscle wasting condition and the best part! The best part is that it could lead to Vocal Paralysis!!\n\nAnd for the cherry on top !! The hospital I was doing all the work up with, ALL the imaging, ALL the neuro. ALL the physitary work and AFO braces, well, they decide to stop and not do a fucking thing since March! Every appointment with every dr has been scheduled and cancelled either, 3, 4, 5, 6 times! And each time, all they do is blame Covid!\n\nI am, we are, the OTHER covid victims the mass lousy media chooses to ignore.\n\nThat is my update. Sorry for the rant.

I am a 25 year old male diagnosed with CMT type1 A. I was diagnosed over six years ago after having a qPCR analysis done that confirmed that I had a pmp22 duplication. I am a Norwegian citizen but this is a small country and there are no support groups or organizations related to CMT here. I have been a member of the CMTA for many years and I really recommend that everyone with CMT check them out! My mother and her mother before her both had CMT 1A, now I am the only one left in my family with the disease. I do not wear braces, and thankfully I do not have much pain, but I do get tired a lot and my balance and strenght is not what it is supposed to be.. And things are, as expected, slowly going downhill despite my best efforts to maintain as much strength and function as I can. \n\nAnyways, I write this in case anyone with CMT stumble onto this subreddit and want someone with CMT to talk to. I know a lot about this disease from a theoretical standpoint as well as how it has affected me and my family, and I am up to date with the latest research and news. Feel free to pm me or reply here, I will check this account once in a while for a long time to come. (so  even if this post is weeks or months old when you read this I am still lurking from time to time).", "Progression speed + Waiting on diagnosis Hello all!\n\nI have (28F) been lurking on this sub for a few years as my Mum has CMT. And after potentially finding out I could have it to, I was hoping for some advice/words of support. \n\nI started having issues with my hands a couple years ago after starting a cleaning job, and as I am also an artist I always thought it was carpal tunnel or rsi. The doctors still could not figure out what it was and ordered a nerve conduction study after they found I have no reflex in my legs also. They ended up testing for the wrong thing, so I am still waiting.\n\nBefore the doctors found the problem with my feet, I had no noticeable symptoms other than high arches. But the 2 months since then, I have started having issues with my balance, cramping pains in both legs and episodes of weakness when walking.\n\nMy Mum's cmt progressed very fast. In about 5 years she went from walking and driving unaided to struggling to walk at all and not being able to drive. It is been scary enough thinking I might have this, but I am very scared about how quickly the symptoms have shown in my legs/feet. I walk a lot (10,000 steps a day) but I have done nothing else to exasabate them.\n\nI am just wondering how quickly things have progressed for you?\n\nSorry for the long post, but any thoughts are very appreciated. I am sorry that you have to deal with this now. The uncertainty can be maddening. Do you know what type of CMT your mother has? That could help people share relevant experiences. \n\nI am in my 40s and still walking at least a mile or two every day. I have had mild symptoms, including everything you listed (high arches, a complete lack of reflexes, poor balance,  leg/foot cramps, some unexpected weakness when walking) since I was a child. My sibling who also has CMT was much more heavily impacted. So even with the same type and in the same family there can be a lot of variation. \n\nI find that walking regularly helps to maintain my strength. I also do some strength-building exercises, though it can be difficult to find the right balance to build/maintain strength without risking injury. I often tended to overdo things until I had a few sessions with a good physical therapist who specializes in neurological disorders and who taught me to pace myself better. Aww thank you so much for letting me know! I think I am going to keep up the walking to keep my muscles strong. And I think my Mum has type 1, but that is all she is told me so far. Thanks again! Just want add on that stretching is very important for cmt! Mine has been very slow to progress but I have type 2. I had a big burst of progression like that in my early twenties but it is been fairly stable since then (I am now 40).  Unfortunately even if you know what type you have it is very hard to say what your prognosis may look like; there is usually a ton of individual variation.\n\nWhat I can say is that probably the best thing you can do for yourself, if you do have it, is to stay as active as possible, and exercise the affected areas as much as possible. Stretching and balance exercises are also a good idea. I personally lift weights and ride a bike, and both those things have made a difference for me in slowing down the worsening of symptoms, I believe. Thank you so much for the info! I am definitely going to look into staying as active as possible. Thanks! Just waiting on doctors to diagnose so I can learn what stretches I need to do No problem, hope you get some good help!", "questions and a little off my chest regarding making friends and what to do about certain plans especially when symptoms flare up \nI recently made a friend at a party/reunion for someone at our college when covid numbers had gone way down. I guess I look like an outdoorsy type(and,I am), so she asked if I wanted to go hiking or biking sometime. We have gone about 3 times since then, so the friendship is very new. I am a shy person, have not had friends for nearing a decade, I also have ADHD which for me comes with rejection sensitivity dysphoria-this will be important.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe last time we hung out, I found an \u201cin\u201d to let her know that I have a neurological disorder. I am an adult learner at 30, she is nearly done college at 22, and I have never told anyone about this besides my long term partner who is obviously aware anyway. So, I am sorry if this sounds weird. I am mostly able to hide my symptoms and do not have any friends IRL besides her now and my bf. But yeah, I was not sure how she would respond but she seemed totally fine, though we did not talk about it much than \u201cthis is a thing I have\u201d,not describing it much other than a neurological disorder and mostly having a numb calf/foot.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis week, she sent me a text to ask if I would like to go rock climbing at a gym close to my house. The initial response from the person I am inside: YES!!!! and I impulsively/excitedly said yes. She said she would get back to verify for this weekend later in the week, so it is not set in stone but, I feel awkward canceling. I feel like I need to do it today since it is mid-week. It is something I would like to do, but my fingers have become increasingly numb this week. And as mentioned, I have no feeling in my left calf, but I can move it. I usually wear special shoes so that I can hike, and I do bike but very rarely. I have an adventurous spirit and love doing active things, but now that I have let it settle a bit, I am actually scared. It is weird to explain because my symptoms are not even always consistent and I definitely look \u201cfine\u201d. Even my SO does seem to forget at times, and it is understandable I think if she forgot too because I just told her 2-3 weeks back and did not talk much about it. And I can still hike pretty fine unless there is a very sharp incline. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI guess right now I am worried about my hands, upper body strength, and my left leg. I also am afraid of falling. I am scared of heights too, but climbing is something I always wanted to do. So I am a bit nervous. I would prefer to go on a non weekend day maybe with my bf because he is aware of all my symptoms and is much larger/I know he can help me \ud83d\ude05 he is also recently asked to do similar things and I turned him down due to lack of upper body strength/my hands.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI just feel like my impulsivity in responding and turning her down now is going to come off really poorly and I am worried about letting her down. I think that would be a normal concern in this situation for anyone, but RSD has me feeling like I am going to be coming across as unreliable,boring and inflexible, and I am ruminating and I do not feel I am able to think rationally about what to do next, which is why I am here. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI sort of wish I could explain my situation more in person because it is less awkward for me than via text. I know this was a dumb thing for me to do and I should have considered it more before agreeing. I guess I am both excited because though it seems a bit too late for me, I always wanted someone to do things like this with and also nervous because I have lost many friends in the past due to mostly my ADHD and other mental health symptoms. I would like to continue to do things together, but I am afraid I have come off as someone very active and will not be able to follow with much more than the same or similar things as we have been doing. It is complex too because as I know many of you will know, you do not know when things are going to flare. Even if I was not having one, I would probably want to at least try this out with my bf first because i feel a bit safer that way. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHow should I approach this? Obviously I need to let her know we will need to do something else, but my mind is getting in my way and I do not know what to say. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd for those with fluctuating symptoms who appear \u201cnormal\u201d for the most part- how do you explain this to people? I have no idea how to socialize. I would say something brief about how your condition is acting up - you do not have to go into terrible detail about specifically how bad you are feeling or all of your concerns - and suggest an alternative activity you feel you would be able to do. Do you think a hike would be better, since you do not have to use your hands? Maybe check out a park you have never been to, or take her to a spot you really like. Even if you decided meeting up for lunch might be more your speed, proposing an alternative activity plan ensures you will not feel out of your depth doing it, and will show you still have interest in getting together.\n\nMost people I know are super fine with some changed plans or understanding if I am tired and a specific activity is not going to work for me that day. Of course the sooner you say this the better, but even if something changes the day before people are usually receptive. For instance, I was going to go to the pool with an acquaintance one weekend and the morning-of I felt like it was not a good day for me and swimming. I texted her and said \"Actually, I am not feeling like being out in the sun at the pool today, can we get coffee instead?\" So we met at a nice shaded outdoor coffee spot and hung out for awhile. The goal of most social times is just that - being social and together - sometimes the activity does not matter as much. \n\nAnd good luck to you - I also enjoy hiking and biking! But it always takes a little extra planning to make sure I have the energy and gear I need. So I feel you there. But in my experience most people I know are fine with changing plans if I find I have limitations - and really I only want to know people who have the ability to be understanding about my experience. I think that you will find if she is a compassionate and friendly person, she will be okay with some changed plans. You can always go climbing when you feel more up to it. There is nothing wrong with saying that your condition has flared up and that you do not think you are up for trying the climbing thing right now. It might be helpful if you can say something like \"maybe next week\" or \"maybe next month\" or \"I can never predict how long these things will last\" just to make sure you are both on the same page about maybe trying again and how far in the future it might be before that could reasonably happen. \n\nThen if you can go on an easy hike or something instead, try to give her an opening to let her ask questions in person if she wishes to do so. I would probably refrain from giving many details if she does not ask. \n\nThat is largely my personality, I think, but I try not to go into a lot of detail unless the other person really wants to know. I could ramble for quite a long time about CMT if I started and let us be real, no one wants the combination of my personal medical history and knowledge of neurophysiology that would come out of that :) I also have ADHD and accept plans before thinking them through quite often. I like to be honest, just say that my condition is flaring up and can we postpone. I have never had anyone be upset by this, and people are always understanding. This may be just be the people I hang around with but I have generally found people in their early 20s like your friend are extremely understanding and considerate of disabilities and limitations.

I have experimented with lots of substances, I have done LSD specifically 10 times and never had a bad reaction related to CMT...I have had bad parts of a trip but It has never affected my CMT in a negative way.  Thank you for sharing your experience! anytime, enjoy your trip!", "Girly shoes! ", "A word from your moderators: New Flairs and more You might have noticed the new flair options implemented recently by my fellow moderator /u/btgreen which allow you to indicate the type of CMT that you have for those of us who have it. You could also use it to indicate which type is of interest, if you are here on behalf of a friend or relative. There are dozens of types of CMT recognized now so we have implemented tags for some of the most common types; if you want one that is not listed yet just let us know and we will get it added. For myself, I have CMT1A so I am sure that colors my perspective of what CMT is like. \n\nWe are also going to see if we can join our tiny sub to a network of other rare diseases or find another way to get us a little more attention. We are a low traffic sub and I think there are a lot of people on Reddit who might fit in here if we do a little outreach.\n\nFinally, by way of a little introduction of myself, I work in the general field of biology and while I do not study CMT I have more than a passing interest in it so if anyone has general science questions, I am happy to take a stab at answering things about the basic science of inheritance of the different types or what myelin does in the body anyway or whatnot. My schedule is pretty erratic so I cannot always promise that I will answer as promptly as I would like but I will answer.\n", "How to build muscle but not using wrists? Hi all, found out I had cmt today. My mum knew 10 years ago when I had foot drop but did not tell me. So now I have a reason for my ugly feet and weak legs and arms right? Lol oh well.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I tried to do chest presses, but my wrists especially hurt so much. What arm exercises can I do that do not hurt my hands or arms?\n\nSimilarly my podiatrist recommended doing stretches, I have a high foot arch and curled toes and tense/tight tendons. He also recommended yoga. What do you guys do?\n\nI am 24f and do like to walk a lot so want to manage this as much as possible  If you can, see a physiotherapist (physical therapist). He/she will be able to show you how to exersize without hurting your self. The CMTA have some videos about exersise as well. It is important to not overdo it and excersise too hard, with CMT that can have a negative impact. I think yoga is an excellent idea and wish I had the patience for it. I do a lot of ankle stretches, anything to stretch your Achilles tendon is important. I bought some \"Kootek\" brand grip strengtheners to work on my wrists, it seems to be helping as I am able to steadily bench my body weight now where I could not before. \n\nI am really sorry your mom did not think you should know. I know everyone is different and will not presume anything, but, my dad has CMT and never told me, I found out on my own when I was 18 after many years of embarrassing sports situations, falls, neurotoxic drug usage, eventually lack of excervise and depression all which could have been avoided had I only known. I really resented my dad for this and it is put a permanent strain on our relationship, hope you are doing alright with the news. If you find yourself wanting someone to talk to please do not hesitate to DM me, sounds like you have a good attitude about it though!  Just a quick question to the CMT community; CMT wears out muscle stamina twice as quick from what I understand, does this mean workouts will go twice as fast? &gt;CMT wears out muscle stamina twice as quick from what I understand, does this mean workouts will go twice as fast?\n\nMuscle strenght and endurance is genrally impaired in people with CMT. However, the CMT genotype, age of the individual, and other factors such as \"interindividual variability\" and weight contribute to the severity of the impairment. It follows that people with CMT would statistically get tired faster than controls if they were following an exercise regimen tailored towards normal healthy individuals. For the record, current research indicates that \"moderate aerobic exercises\" can aleviate CMT symptoms.\n\nSome relatively recent information on excercise and CMT  is summarized in the following article:\n Thank you very much, I have it myself and will probably make a post with some more questions and try to take up physio therapy. That sounds like a solid plan to me. The more information you have on CMT the better you will be at managing it. If you have not done so already, I also highly recommend talking with a neurologist about your CMT. And if you need answers for a specific CMT-related question, the CMTA have a section on their website called \"ask the experts\" where you can get answers from professionals. They usually respond within a day or two and you can read old Q&amp;As.  I just wanted should checkout Charcot Marie Tooth Association website for sure. Definitely look into their list of neurotoxic medicines people with CMT should avoid. \n\nFacebook also has several CMT groups that are more active than this sub. Thank you all so much for your help. I am going to check out some online help. I am getting orthotic insoles soon, which should help with keeping up activity. My girlfriend does a lot of stretching as well as resistance band &amp; yoga ball exercises. She cant really do much with free weights, so the resistance bands really help with adding resistance and allowing her to build strength were she once could not due to the lack of grip strength. Everyone is situation is different, and i do not know if this information will be useful, but i hope it at least helps.", "CMT Surgeries Hi guys! I have posted in here a couple of times, and have a question about the different surgeries. I have seen a lot posted on foot/ankle surgery, but I have not yet seen the surgery I had. Has anyone had double hamstring and calf surgery to lengthen the muscles? That is what I had at 13! Have not seen it again yet, but wanted to ask :) Thanks guys! No, but I have recently been referred to a surgeon to look at something similar. \n\nMy understanding from what the doctors have said is that it is not too common in CMT as the muscle weakness causes more of a problem than the short calves. My father had his Achilles tendon cut so his foot would be flat. I had several procedures during my surgery including nerve repair. Hi,\n\nNo, i have had pins in my heel, tendons moved, bones cut out and stapled back together.  How did it go ? It totally makes sense that they would be more focused on the muscle weakness than the short muscles! Granted, this was now a little over 12 years ago, so maybe he was just fixing the problem he saw (I could not physically put my heel on the ground.) Well, afterwards, I could put my heels on the ground and not walk on my toes! So I would say that is a win!\n\nHow did yours go? My dad had this surgery back when things were much more new and that was the main solution. They also flattened his feet, straightened his toes and a few more thing I cannot remember. He has had over 20 surgeries between both feet. Interesting! Yeah my feet are completely flat and pronated in, however, that was a result of hip to the feet straight legged casts pushing my feet down. Did he notice a change for the better after the surgeries? Check my post history for my surgery story and pics. It has been the best choice I have ever made. No regrets. At first I thought I could get through life with pain pills, but soon those became ineffective. I am fully healed now, in my early 30's, and I just went snowboarding on Tuesday. I went all day without my boots getting the least but uncomfortable. Before surgery I could not even wear hard shoes, high tops, boots, etc. All no problem now!! I have a surgeon who has done many operations on me and my family he has done calf legenthing and has done bone alignment wedges and heel wedges he operates out of st.petersburg florida\nHis name is Adam D. Perler and he works for alexander orthopaedics the office phone is 727 547 4700 Do not know about that particular surgery, but I can recommend Dr. Glenn Pfeffer\u2019s Instagram for CMT foot surgery. He does amazing work", "New treatments and research for CMT.  They were not kidding about entering a golden age for neurological treatment. This is exciting stuff it is my firm belief that soon we will see some definitive treatment for CMT. Not sure this is helpful for the most common types of CMT, since this drug affects oligodendrocytes and not Schwann cells. I feel the same way after reading the article, though I have not read the full study. The demyelination in this case seems to be due to the creation of a signal molecule that inactivates certain pathways related to myelin production in the oligodendrocytes. If you stop this signal molecule from being created (which is what they want to do by stopping the enzyme responsible for the reaction creating them), the oligodendrocytes will just resume their normal function. Since there is no such mechanism at play in any CMT genotypes that I know of, and since this research is about removing this mechanism as opposed to say compensating for the damage, I do not see any direct relevance to CMT either. That said there are definitely a lot of research out there that is not about CMT specifically but still have direct relevance to CMT. Man you hit it on the head for sure. I was getting a little down vote fear in how I called out the title for that reason. It is another huge step in understanding the central nervous system that gets me excited for future treatments, but this is not the miracle drug to end CMT. I really hope so, man. I cannot thank these docs enough for showing interest in our condition and researching a way to treat it. Been doing the pxt3003 \u201chome brew\u201d for 2 months... starting to feel numbness where I had no feeling at all. \n\nThis is starting to sound promising", "Viks vapor rub My wife has been doing research to find things to help with my pain. I cannot reasonably take most pain meds that would help because of my job. Most pain meds cannot be talen 5 hours before my shift and not at all during my shift. \n\nShe read that for peripheral neuropathy many people will rub viks vapor rubbon their feet and wear socks when they go to bed...ive only done this twice and it seems to have helped I dont know if its a placebo effect or not. Has anyone else tried this or heard about it? Try Amish Origins rub (Amazon) instead of Viks. I just put it on during the day though. That always works better for me. It is some pain relief but not as good as medicine. But I do not think it is a placebo effect because I notice on the days I forget to use it. What kind of pain are you talking about? I am personally affected by severe Plantar Fascitis and it is a constant struggle that is never quite alleviated. I am just interested in what kind of pain you feel? Not sure what to say other than I am in boots for 12+ hrs a day at work and my feet are killing me by the time I get home. When i describe it to my wife she says it sounds like nerve pain. I aint great with this stuff to be honest. So idk if its on my feet all day pain or cmt related nerve pain. Sounds like you have Plantar Fascitis, which does not just affect CMT sufferers, although it is fucking horribly painful. I have very high arches in my feet and thin ankles so I have been advised not to wear heavy footwear because I do not have a lot of power in my lower leg muscles. Do you have particular sore spots or is it an all round pain in the foot/feet? Aside from all that, look at getting some lightweight safety shoes, there are some really good ones out there at a low cost that will not be so taxing on your feet/lower leg muscles. I have a pair that are as light as trainers/sneakers. I also put memory foam insoles in them as well for double protection. \n\nThere are ways around it my friend :) I wear a pair of 5.11's there 8 in leather uppers with a zipper side...do you know if there is a safety shoe similar or do you know a reputable site I could look at? I also have custom insoles made from one of those companies that scans your feet and what not I just went on Amazon and found a pair. Just typed in lightweight safety shoes.

Hi,\n\nI am looking to get all new socks. Was wondering if there is anything I should go for which is better for my CMT?\n\nThought about these: (\n\nWhat works the best for you? I have wondered about the compression socks too I personally like afo socks. Basically just no seams and fabric designed to not bunch up. I really like the Vermont Darn Tough socks... they have high and low sizes pretty much for any weather, they are very thick and cushiony which is nice for my feets :) I have maybe kind of unusual needs, in that I have \"venous insufficiency\" and I get edema sometimes but not a lot of neuropathy. Not sure that is common with CMT. I cannot wear normal socks though, between my feet and calves being big and the edema.\n\nI have not found any socks I really like. Ideally I would probably wear compression stockings but those can run $100/pair. Currently using XL non-bind Wigwams. Not sure what you are looking for in a sock per se, but I have a lot of trouble getting my socks on due to atrophy in my hands. They tend to bunch up and get stuck and I cannot pinch to pull the sock over the right parts of my foot.\n\nI wear these now with my AFO\u2019s and they are really easy to slide on and pretty comfy. I like them a lot. The brand also seems to have compression socks but I have never tried them.\n\n I find bamboo socks good. I buy mine from sock shop.

", "CMT and fatigue Okay so I have 1A and was diagnosed aged 3 (now 22) and I have always had problems with physical fatigue i.e. not being able to walk very far without getting tired, doing physical chores make me more tired than most people more quickly etc etc. However, in the past 5 months or so, I have been through a pretty rough flare up and developed really bad cognitive fatigue - I constantly feel tired in my mind, not just my body like I am used to. It is incredibly difficult to concentrate on tasks, I get distracted easily, my memory is now dreadful. These are very new and quite different experiences of fatigue compared to those I have had for my entire life with CMT and wondered if anyone has any similar experiences or ways to cope with workload and daily tasks despite being so mentally drained all the time. I have the same type although I was diagnosed at birth with it.\n\nAmongst other severe symptoms, I have not woken up well rested in a long time (just turned 22) \n\nNo matter how much or little sleep I get or whether I am in good sleep routine I am always tired constantly and easily - the only thing really not affected there is my memory - I have a really good memory! I find it difficult with regular work hours because by 3pm all I want to do is sleep and I cannot haha \n\nYou are not alone though! I have CMT-X and I feel similar physical and cognitive fatigue. It is important that you can exclude other factors, for example depression, sleep apnea, iron deficiency. I was diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea. I sleep with a CPAP now which makes me feel better through the day. I also tried Ritalin which helped a bit but not long enough to help me through the whole day. Right now I just take naps when I need them. What kind of braces are you wearing? Ok, so I have had similar issues and here is what I have found;\n\n1. **People with CMT have a high chance of suffering from some form of sleep disorder** i.e. sleep apnea, or muscle twitching. You will want to start off with getting a sleep tracker or if you can, just go straight to a sleep specialist. I am now on clonazepam due to by sleep problems. It is changed my life as I was at the point of falling asleep whilst standing.\n2. Physical fatigue seems to be an issue as **people with CMT seem to struggle to develop muscle**. More research is coming out showing that sadly, we suck at developing muscle (cardio performance too). The solution here are PEDs, but that is a whole different ball game. I can confirm that they do work. That they make a huge difference. And that if you do not know what you are doing you could accidently cripple or kill yourself.\n3. When you go to you doctor, emphasis that you are suffering from both **physical fatigue** and **daytime sleepiness**. They are 2 separate conditions which most doctors confuse with just being fatigued. What are PEDs? Performance enhancing drugs Man I can relate to the sleep, 30 years old here and I get a good night\u2019s sleep like once a year. I do remember reading there is a connection with CMT and sleep apnea, for what it is worth. I had a couple sleep studies done but both showed only very mild central sleep apnea, I think it is worth looking into though. Do you have muscle twitching and does it disrupt your sleep? I have started having daily muscle twitching all over my body and I thought it was not related to CMT (because it will happen in my face, abdomen, etc.) but maybe I am wrong... It is so strange  cause I sleep soundly, and I am tired enough to sleep - just I am tired all the time and my brain can still focus for a while but once I hit peak tiredness I just want home. I do not work long hours I work 40 hours a week and that completely just obliterates me haha Thanks for your reply. That is one of my biggest worries now since having all these new symptoms is that I will not be able to stay awake or mentally engaged in a full time job. Hope it gets easier for you though. I get twitching everywhere too - tends to happen more so on bad days but I have definitely wondered if its CMT or just one of those things. I also get bursts of neuropathic pain through my feet and toes which is really annoying and can stop me getting to sleep but does not normally wake  me up. I very rarely wear mine during sleep as I find they make me more uncomfortable and did not benefit much from the AFO's during the night anyway. I used to take them off in my sleep without realising which also could not have been good for my sleep quality. I guess because I have always been like this I am used to it unfortunately.\n\nMy main symptoms are:\nSevere hammertoes\nSevere high arch in my feet\nNo reflexes\nCurved shoulders\nLoss of balance\nHardly any sensation in my feet \nMuscle pain and sometimes nerve pain mainly in my upper back and my legs \nCannot stand for longer than 15 minutes\nCannot walk long distances\n\nMy doctor says I have quite a severe type of it and it is strange as I am female when it is more severe in males usually so I am just super unlucky in the gene lottery haha I have sometimes been so sore I am basically bed ridden because I have maybe overdone it\n\nIf you have any further concerns or questions, feel free to message me (I am not a doctor but happy to help what I have been through)\n\nI manage working fulltime fine but it sometimes is a struggle because of tiredness all the time but like I said I cope haha :) Performance enhancing drugs e.g. anabolic steroids I have minor twitching in my calf muscles, but not enough to disrupt my sleep. My sleep is disrupted by non REM parasomnia (Brain just does not like going into deep sleep). However my CMT is rather mild and it is common for people with more severe CMT to have muscle twitching as an issue. That is interesting - I share most of those symptoms with you though I have one flat foot and one high arched foot! (I am yet to find someone who also has this combo!). Thanks for your comment, I certainly will :) I never heard of wearing them to sleep. I am asking what kind of AFOs you are wearing.l maybe you need something more reactive - something that has a strut for energy return. I was so fatigued before I got AFOs. Also, exercise helps a lot. When you get stronger (especially in core and quads) moving becomes easier and it is not quite so tiring. I am exactly the same. I do not wake up in the night and I fall asleep just fine but I wake up feeling slightly hungover every day. It is a real bummer. And if for whatever reason I do wake up by my cats or something during the night, when I eventually wake up properly for the day I am just shattered all day. It is crap especially when you have stuff to do and you do not have time to be tired :( weirdly and probably selfishly though I am glad that I am not alone! It is a good idea to check other factors. A couple of years ago I was having more trouble with fatigue and it turned out that I was slightly anemic and quite B-vitamin deficient. It was not a miracle cure, but having a round of vitamin shots did help. I believe some people wear afos of some kind at night to prevent contractures. That is really helpful info, thank you. Do you have any recommendations for PED's? I have zero knowledge about them and would love to know more. It is quite difficult for me to do much exercise at the moment but it is also something that I know needs some work and would be super grateful for any advice. Likewise, great to know we are in it together haha. I woke up at 5 this morning and have been driving all over my state having meetings with customers, it is 2:30 now but it may as well be 10PM with the way I feel... gah. We can do it! Haha Same here. The CPAP's no miracle cure but it helps a little. Same with the Ritalin which I will probably try again but with an additional dose at noon instead of only one in the morning. PEDs are very complex as it all depends on where you live and how much risk you are willing to take.\n\n So the most common PED are anabolic steroids. They widely vary from ease of use, availability, side effects, and legality. I would only do these under full medical supervision.\n\nThe PEDs I use are SARMs (selective androgen receptor modulator). They are a modem take on steroids and have far less side effects, although are not as potent. The legality on buying them also widely varies i.e. illegal in the USA, buy off the shelf in the UK. \n\nI would just spend a few months researching PEDs in your own time as far too many just start taking them without knowing the whole picture and the cost. I am 23 and was diagnosed when I was a year old. I have type 1B and also experienced the mental fatigue. \n\nBecause of the mental fatigue it is made being in school difficult and therefore have looked into many things to help with this. One of the things that worked well for me was taking Rhodiola Rosea. It is an herbal supplement listed under a type of nootropic. I take it consistently for a month then take a break for about 2 weeks and repeat. \n\nI would recommend doing research and looking into ways to help fight the fatigue. It is possible.", "Research Gathered on CMT1a Hello, my name is Ryan. I have cmt1a like many if not everyone else in this group. I am 26 years of age, and dealing with mild symptoms related to my cmt1a. Like many of you, I was told by doctors that very little (to nothing) can be done. And I accepted that, for a very, very long time. Until one day, I decided to do my own research on the internet, and gathered as much medical and scientific data as possible, compiled it onto a sheet, and I would like to share this research with all of you. I would like to say that I am NOT a doctor, I am not a person with ANY medical experience or expertise, and I would go so far as to say that I am a layman, I am a regular man that has done his due diligence in gathering research and data in hopes that it can benefit myself or someone else facing similar circumstances. Below is a summarization of gathered data and research relating to cmt1a and supplements that have scientifically and medically been shown to help along with sources. I have personally been using everything below now everyday for almost 3 months, and personally I feel more confident in my movements, less fatigue, I do not wobble as much when standing for long periods, and things seem generally just a bit easier.

Tumeric Curcumin (a spice)\n\nGENERAL USE:\n\nTurmeric is an antioxidant used for conditions involving pain &amp; inflammation.\n\nAS RELATES TO CMT1A:\n\nTumeric curcumin may be effective in alleviating the symptoms of CMT1a disease, as suggested from a rat study. Curcumin has been effective in promoting nerve repair and enhancing myelin production, but in its original form it is rapidly degradaded, difficult to absorb, and rapidly eliminated from the body, limiting its use.\n\n\\*It is recommended to find Tumeric with BioPerine (black pepper), which is a substance that enhances curcumin absorption by up to 2,000%. Without this, most of the curcumin just passes through the digestive tract.  \n\n\nSOURCE:  \n (  \n\n\n(\n\n\\*\\*Tumeric Curcumin does NOT require a prescription and can be found in markets.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n  \n2. CO-Q10 (a supplement)\n\nGENERAL USE:\n\nCoenzyme Q10, or CoQ10, is a naturally occurring chemical that exists in almost every cell of the human body. CoQ10 carries out several vital roles, including promoting energy production and neutralizing harmful particles called free radicals.\n\nAS RELATES TO CMT1A:\n\nA clinical trial completed in 2013 tested CoQ10\u2019s effects on CMT, hypothesizing that \u201cdaily supplementation of CoQ10 taken as a \\*300 milligram\\* wafer twice a day for 3 months will produce a statistically significant reduction in weakness, fatigue, and pain, along with a significant improvement in QOL \\ as indicated from scores in both standardized physiological and scale measures.\u201d   \n\n\nSOURCE: (\n\n\\*CO-Q10 does NOT require a prescription and can be found in markets where supplements are sold.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\n3. Lechithin\n\nGENERAL USE:\n\nLecithin is a fat that is essential in the cells of the body. It can be found in many foods, including soybeans and egg yolks. Lecithin is taken as a medicine and is also used in the manufacturing of medicines. Lecithin is used for treating memory disorders such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAS RELATES TO CMT1A:\n\nTherapy studies with diseased rats that were given lecithin in various doses not only showed that treatment with phospholipids promotes myelination. \u201cIt significantly eases the course of the disease regardless of the start of the therapy\u201d, explains Ruth Stassart, a neuropathologist from the Departement of Neuropathology of Leipzig University Medicine and Max-Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine, who co-lead the study. \u201cThe promising data from the animal testing and especially the already proven compatibility of with humans, promote Lecithin as a therapeutic agent for the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease as well as possibly for similar demyelinating diseases\u201d, adds Michael Sereda, a neurologist at the Department of Clinical Neurophysiology at the University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen and group leader at the Max-Planck-Institute for Experimental Medicine who co-directed the study together with Ruth Stassart.\n\nUsing lecithin, the reduced fat production of Schwann cells may be circumvented and the disturbed myelination in CMT thus be improved. Lecithin is produced from soy or yolk and consists of phospholipids. It is a harmless dietary supplement and the main ingredient of myelin. Initially, the scientists were able to show that the phospholipids in genetically modified rats were absorbed by the Schwann cells and used for the production of myelin.  \n\n\nSOURCE: (\n\n\\*Lechithin does NOT require a prescription and can be found in markets where supplements are sold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Thank you so much for sharing this! It is a real bummer when a professional tells us \"nothing can be done.\" I simply will NOT believe that or live in that mindset.\n\nI have been taking lecithin as well and do notice an overall difference in my well-being. I also meditate with the intention of healing the areas of my body struggling most and find it helps as well.\n\nAppreciate you doing research and sharing it with us as living with this disease can be so daunting, especially when people we trust (medical professionals) can often be so negative.\n\nCheers! Thanks so much for this post. Where do you find these supplements on a budget? Thanks for sharing! I definitely found this interesting and I am now considering giving some of these supplements a try. I personally buy them from amazon, there is a company that makes CoQ-10, Tumeric, and Bioperine all together in one capsule, which is SUPER convenient. I will put links to everything below.\n\nCo-Q10, Tumeric &amp; Bioperine (all in one): ( (I take two a day because that is what the bottle says.)\n\nLecithin softgels: ( (Bottle says I can take up to 3 of these a day, I normally only take two a day.) I normally spend about $30 or less a month for those stated above and they last me a month. Godspeed. Do these supplements reverse pre-existing nerve damage? Or potentially stop or slow future damage? A lot of these supplements seem to have anti-inflammatory benefits which is not a bad thing. It is important we treat our symptoms so thank you for your research. It is extremely hard to say for certain, all I can really do is look at the medical page to see HOW certain things help. From my understanding, lecithin helps because it promotes myelination. To give a quote from the article:\"Heidelberg and Aachen now discovered that diseased Schwann cells show a decreased fat metabolism during their development which causes the impaired myelination. \u201cThe production of myelin is extremely laborious for Schwann cells. A disruption, like the one the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease causes, leaves the nerve fibers without myelin, which limits their functionality\u201d\n\nAnother important part of the article on lecithin: \"Therapy studies with diseased rats that were given lecithin in various doses not only showed that treatment with phospholipids promotes myelination. \u201cIt significantly eases the course of the disease regardless of the start of the therapy\u201d, explains Ruth Stassart, a neuropathologist from the Departement of Neuropathology of Leipzig University Medicine and Max-Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine, who co-lead the study. \u201cThe promising data from the animal testing and especially the already proven compatibility of with humans, promote Lecithin as a therapeutic agent for the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease as well as possibly for similar demyelinating diseases\u201d, adds Michael Sereda, a neurologist at the Department of Clinical Neurophysiology at the University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen and group leader at the Max-Planck-Institute for Experimental Medicine who co-directed the study together with Ruth Stassart.\"\n\nThis would lead me to believe that (with lecithin atleast), it would atleast SLOW DOWN the demylination, by virtue of it working directly against demyelination of the nerves, and apparently (from the article) promote nerve repair. All this being said, it is EXTREMELY hard to draw anything concrete, I just look at the data and it checks out, but as far as HOW EFFECTIVE it all is? Really only time will tell, but I trust the data. I personally feel its helping. Oops, husband duties prevented me from finishing the post. Silly me hit send earlier and not save draft haha. So here is the whole thing...\n\n\u2013-----------\n\nDo these supplements reverse pre-existing nerve damage? Or potentially stop or slow future damage? A lot of these supplements seems to have anti-inflammatory benefits which is probably why you feel better. It is important that we continue to treat the symptoms with methods such as this. I am not a doctor either. I am 35 now and it is been hard coming to the realization that there is in fact nothing that will reverse the nerve damage that is occurred. But preserving what little feeling I currently have? I am willing to try something to do that and I do not think it will hurt either of us if we took those supplements. I have been in denial for a long time, hoping for a cure, hoping it was some other disease. Now I feel I am in the acceptance phase. I put a towel down on the bathroom floor now so I do not slip after a shower, 2 years ago I did not because I refused to accept I am broken.\n\nI have had countless fancy genetic tests and two biopsys and they they all are negative. My dad had symptoms before he passed away, my uncle has symptoms. He cannot feel anything below the knee. His symptoms begun in his 30s like me. They were both diagnosed with CMT, but today a doctor needs a genetic test or biopsy to diagnose. Best diagnosis I have is \"heritatary and idiopathic peripheral neuropathy\". I stopped pursing a answer beyond that for the time being because the top neurologists in my area cannot figure it out... Yet. \n\nI have had really bad leg cramps for a few years. I have convinced a autoimmune doctor (I was really hoping it was another disease at the time) to give me methotrexate, Prednisone and gabapentin. Which actually permanently stopped the cramps and inflammation I experienced and I feel way better (I have been off medication for 2 years now). I still have foot drop and I am very wobbly. I hold onto anything I can. My neurologist gave me a script for a carbon fiber AFO which are a love and hate relationship. I love being able to walk far without much fatigue but man are they restrictive. We\n\nThe things that are in your control is shaping your future, which probably will be vastly different then what you imagined you would be doing when you were younger. You might not want to pass this along to your children especially if another family member has symptoms as well so it is important to tell your partner early on in your relationship. You might want to find a career where your not on your feet all day. \n\nI do not want you thinking I am telling you to give up hope and dreams, hope is a good thing. But it is also necessary to be realistic. If you wanted to be a dancer or roofer, good for you. But I would have a desk job to fall back on if at all possible. I mean yeah the data is certainly promising. This is one of those things where I should take... For the rest of my life. If I had taken it for years and my emg's, etc are the same as the last time I had the test done, then we could say that it is indeed helping. I kind of wish I started taking this 10 years ago before I noticed any symptoms. Although studies done on animal models of CMT are super interesting, it is important to note that most of them have historically failed phase I/II clinical trials. Moreover, if the compound in question have not passed a phase I study, the safety profile of it has not been formally assessed. And lastly, extrapolating dosages based on animal testing is not always straight forward.\n\nIn this case, all of the compounds have a well documented safety profile and are generally safe to consume in fairly high doses. Some things to be aware of though is that curcumin could interact with certain prescription drugs, and the phosphatidylcholine component of lecithin have when consumed in large quantities been linked to atherosclerosis and an increased prevalence of depression in sensitive individuals.\n\nAs for the potential of these compounds, curcumin is promising but in trembler-J mice curcumin is only effective in newborn mice, and not in fully grown mice. And in the trembler-J model, the PMP22 mutation is a missense mutation and not a duplication of the gene as in CMT1A. This is important, because the proposed mechanism for why curcumin has shown an effect in this model relates to protein misfolding and subsequent aggregation and not the overexpression of PMP22 protein. Although PMP22 protein aggregation is likely a part of the disease mechanism for 1A, elevated PMP22 protein levels or the fluctuations in PMP22 protein levels likely also play a large part, which curcumin does not alleviate. \n\nQ10 is interesting, but as far as I remember the Phase I/II study failed, which I suppose is also why the results of the trial was never published. I have not seen any more activity in the literature about it either. Based on its biological function, I think that it is more likely that it will work on CMT that are caused by mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g. CMT2A) and not CMT1A.\n\nLecithin is the most interesting of these for 1A in my opinion, especially so because its such a ubiquitous and cheap substance. I have been purposefully increasing my intake of lecithin by eating more soy and other lecithin rich foods for the past couple of years, with an intake roughly comparable to the 0.3% soy phospholipids diet in the Max Planck study. I have not noticed any changes in my disease progression, but I have had no side effects either. I have been contemplating increasing the amount of lecithin I consume, but I have not decided yet. I took 1,5g of vitamin C for a couple of years way back in the day while waiting for the phase II vitamin C trial results, and stopped when they demonstrated no efficacy. Since there is no Phase II trials in sight for lecithin, its going to be hard to know for sure if eating it actually has any effect. I actually take all of those supplements now except for lecithin which I stopped a few years ago because it was bothering  me. I have been taking them off and on for 25 years and I have tried all the other ones that people with CMT recommended (it is a very long list). \n\nUnfortunately none of them have helped with my CMT. in fact, of the 15 supplements I now take I mostly take them to help build up my immune and circulatory systems. Nothing has noticeably helped with my CMT. COQ10 is one of my favs for energy and I take curcumin to help with inflammation though you have to be careful it can be rough on your stomach if you take too much!  One I have experimented with the past year is Lions mane mushrooms. But that is seems to have been a dead end too for CMT. I have not found any supplements that have helped heal or better my CMT and I have tried everything I can. \n\nMy encouragement is to not take supplements for CMT but for your overall health. And be careful, some like Vitamin B6 are toxic to us which is why I avoid multivitamins. ( tested whether a modified form of **curcumin** has beneficial ( in models of **CMT1A** \u2014 the most prevalent form of **CMT**. This work was done in cells in a dish and in rats, not in people.\r  \n\r  \nAfter treating rats with this form of **curcumin**, the researchers noted several **positive results**, including:\r  \n\r  \n1. Better conduction of electrical signals in the nerves\r  \n2. Improvements in behavioral measures of nerve functioning, such as grip strength and balance\r  \n3. The improved thickness of the myelin sheath around axons in the nerves\r  \n\n\nFurther analysis suggested that the treatment may work by **reducing oxidative stress** in the **nerves** and **muscles**. Something not being taken into account is that curcumin's effectiveness can be boosted up to 2000% using Bioperine. The study did apparently conclude that it was only effective on newborn mice, which is not a surprise as they are so young that ofcourse they would absorb curcumin better (maybe). Curcumin by itself is hard to absorb and rapidly eliminated from the body UNLESS its effects are enhanced from bioperine. There is a potentiality that the adult rats yielded no benefits because of lack of bioperine, as it is absolutely necessary for the tumeric to be effective. Do you have source on the vitamin B6? ( specifically says that vitamin B6 from food have not been shown to cause adverse effects and that only \"megadoses\" may be harmful. You Will not get megadoses from food, just Supplements. Vitamin B6 has been on the toxic list for a very long time. I know when I had actually taken it it caused my legs to burn so it definitely has a bad effect on me if I Take too much. You will be fine as long as you keep it under 100% of the FDA recommended levels though it is the megadoses you have to look out for. That is a fair point, however the study shows that although serum levels were low, curcumin did make its way into tissue. The difference in the measured curcumin concentration in the sciatic nerve of adults (453 ng/ml) and pups (674 ng/ml) was fairly modest, which suggests that bioavailability is not the only factor at play. The authors suggest that more active myelination in the pups could be part of the explanation.\n\nBut even with increased curcumin uptake, I am still a bit reserved in terms of its effectiveness in Schwann cells with WT PMP22 duplication. In trembler-J Schwann cells, misfolded PMP22 protein aggregation in the ER is the direct cause of Schwann cell apoptosis. In Schwann cells with a WT PMP22 duplication, PMP22 protein aggregation in ER due to an overload of the ER quality-control system is only a part of the problem and the apoptosis ratio is only about half that seen in trembler-J despite identical PMP22 expression levels. \n\nIf curcumin induced increases in protein trafficking is beneficial in PMP22 duplication Schwann cells, I think it is prudent to expect the effect to be modest and to assume that it will only be present in very young individuals.\nFor young patients with 1A caused by point mutations in the PMP22 gene however I think this holds some promise, and it would be very interesting to see it tested for this subgroup of 1A patients.\n\nThis is just my 2 cents though. Hopefully more studies will be done using both trembler-J and other models in the future that addresses these questions. I would really like to be wrong about this. This. \nAnimal Vs human, 1a Vs 2, duplication Vs misfolding... I did pharmacology degree and this commenter has grasped the differences that cause the researchers such a headache. A conference for 'neuromuscular translation research' is the best place to try and bridge the gap between lab ideas and clinical practice.\nNot to dissuade you OP - you have researched some good info, but applying it to CMT1a is a bit risky. \nI got into the 'Anti-sense mRNA' stuff which is interesting but delivery to nerve cells is next to impossible. PIGD IVF is the only way to reliably stop our silly genes! PMP22 duplication in humans causes excess myelin production. The build-up causes onion bulb formation and subsequent myelin removal and axonal damage. \nRats have misfolded proteins - circumin helps the wonky proteins escape the cells - they are a good model for CMT2 not 1.\nBoth are demyelinating but the cause is different. Thank you for taking the time to write up this.\n\nLecithin has been on my radar for a couple of years as a tentative possibility. I agree that it seems like the most promising of these though I have not tried taking it myself thus far.", "Iowa CMT clinic (UPDATE) Hi guys!\n\nMy mom and I had appointments at the CMT clinic in Iowa today. She has been several times to the clinic in Detroit, I have not been to either. Now, the one in Detroit is barely a unit anymore. All the people moved to Iowa, so we went there instead of Detroit.\n\nIowa City is a college town so there are PLENTY of options for hotels here. Our hotel was just 2 1/2 miles from the hospital. Finding the place was not hard either. Everything was very easy to follow. When we got there we checked in, signed some different consent and privacy forms. We were quickly moved to a room where one of the doctors took both my moms and Is short history: medicines we take, if we smoke, vitals, etc.\n\nThe day was filled with a lot of people and a lot of tests. all the tests are noninvasive which is awesome. No needles ever :). You can refuse to do anything at any time. Since I am under 21, I had to do the more extensive PEDS tests, which measured my balance and strength more thoroughly than the adult tests. At the same time,since I am 17, I also underwent the adult tests. Most of these are pull or push on their hand or some kind of scale to see what kind of strength you have.\n\nThe only uncomfortable thing was the EMG. They attach little things to you and give you a little shock to test your nerves. they do this on several places on your hand, arm, foot, and leg. Its really not bad though. I do not do needles, pain, etc, but I do not mind doing this. Its nothing more than a little shock and then your hand or foot will move a bit. Lasts less than a second and they do it a few times each position. They made it very clear that at anytime I could stop, which is very nice.\n\nSo after doing PEDS testing and adult strength test type things, we met with an occupational therapist. There was not too much to say here. Mom has been sick so long with an additional disease that she is kind of managed and figured how to work everything herself. I only have mild symptoms So there is not much to change there. She did give me a cool thing to help grip and open bottles because that is a big weak point for me.\n\nAfter meeting with her it was close to 1pm, so we had a break for lunch. There are plenty of places to eat within the hospital, and its not shitty or overly expensive hospital food. Around 1:30 we went back up to the research clinic. We then both underwent a full neurological exam by Doctor Shy. Actually, to be exact, he had a fellow do mine while he supervised, but he himself did my mom.  I also walked down the hallway and they filmed me walk for future reference.\n\nThe exam was much like this: \n\nAfter that exam, they went to go finish scoring our test results. We met with the physical therapist. Not a huge lot to say for my mom, because she has a huge team at home. They just went over all her stuff that she does. She talked to me about stretching as my Achilles is getting tight. After talking to her, an MDA person came back and asked if we wanted to register with them, as they can help with many things such as wheelchair replacements, orthotics, etc. We went ahead and did so. We also met the orthotist. He gave a great recommendation for my current afos that I use for soccer, that we are going to tell my orthotist at home.\n\nAfter he left there was a little bit of waiting. Then the genetic counselor talked to us, mainly me since I had not been. We have cmtX so its extremely easy to track. she talked about being able to pretest before pregnancy, etc. \n\nFinally, we got to the end of the day. It was around 4:30 pm now. Dr shy, two fellows, and another doctor or two that had been helping throughout the day all came into a big room with us to discuss our scores. Mine was very good, very mild which is awesome. Doctor shy actually pulled me aside to assure me that I do not have much to worry about, which if you saw my mom and aunt, you would end up being really worried. Moms was high, but that was expected. They thoroughly went over everything we did that day, gave us time to ask any questions and then we were officially done.\n\n\nAll and all, the 1000 mile 18 hour drive was worth it. It was the most through testing I have ever undergone, and I felt so comfortable the whole time (I hate doctors and hospitals so that is big). They can make great recommendations if you currently have not started any treatment and all the data they collect gets put together for research on CMT.\n\nHere is their website :)\n\n", "CMT - Muscle Building &amp; Sleep Apnea? Having been diagnosed over 10 years ago with CMT, it is becoming worryingly  apparent to me that there are a lot of unknowns, either that or my consultants just have not been keeping uptodate. I would like to ask other people with CMT out there if they have any of the following:\n\n1) Problems with muscle growth *in general*. Apparently this should not be a problem for anywhere other than extremities (feet, hands, wrists), but after years of going to the gym, I am sure some other mechanism is at play because I cannot seem to get any muscular development at all, including chest, arms, upper legs and so on.\n\n2) Fatigue and terrible sleep. More research is coming out that Obstructive Sleep Apnea and CMT are linked. Do people hear have issues with fragmented sleep? Has anyone found a solution to this?\n\nI would be really interested in hearing what people have to say, and if anyone has been told differently!  Hello\n\nSo for 1 - I have always had CMT relatively light in comparison to my dad and sisters, however I get real frustrated with how hard I train, how clean I eat, vs the continuously mediocre times (comparatively) I get at races (triathlon, running and biking races). The biggest take away I got from working with a local trainer who has a doctorate in human kinesiology was that my brain needed to be trained how to communicate with my muscles. For that we strayed away from a lot of the more traditional gym exorcises and focused almost exclusively on small balancing and posture training muscle groups. The results were amazing and I now how less mediocre race times to which I just leave off to I am doing good enough. \n\nFor sleep apnea my dad has this bad. He uses a c-pap machine that makes him look like a fighter jet pilot. It seems to help, only now he wakes up because he has a mask on his face that feels a little unnatural. \n\nI have been taking melatonin before bed, it is a nice way to relax my brain and help me sleep that does not require a prescription. \n\nYou should look into your local CMTA group. They will likely have some solid resources for you also. At least be able to get you in touch with folks who have experience working with CMT-ers. \n\nGood luck and stand tall.  What kind of CMT do you have? All the different CMT genotypes affect the nerves and muscles in different ways, so what is true for CMT1A might not be true for CMT1B, or 2A, etc. I have CMT 1A.\n\nAs for your questions:\n\n1)  I have problems with muscle growth in general too. When I was around 18, I was getting frustrated with the lack of progression I felt like I was getting in the gym. Together with my personal trainer at the time I started to track every session, noting the weights, number of reps etc. After a couple months of both eating optimally and following a strict intense exercise program, I saw very little improvement. This is only anecdotal evidence of course, but over the years I have gotten a stronger suspicion that the current understanding of how CMT 1A affects muscles (Schwann cell demyelination, eventually secondary axonal damage, causing length dependent muscle atrophy) perhaps is not telling the whole story. The fact is that at the present, the exact pathogenesis of CMT1A, and most of the other genotypes, are not fully understood. There are several hypotheses for various molecular mechanisms and pathways that might be responsible. But the Schwann cell, the neuron and the muscle cell are far from being fully understood, let alone the extremely complex interactions between them. Personally I think that it is not unlikely that CMT 1A interfere with our ability to build muscle through resistance exercise. I believe there was a study done where people with 1A got anabolic steroids that demonstrated no effect, but I will have to look it up. I might be mistaken about that one.\n\n2) Fatigue is a real problem with CMT1A. It is well documented in the literature, but in my view I feel like the severity of the fatigue that I and others I know with CMT 1A experience, is more severe and have a much larger negative impact on our lives than what current studies seem to indicate is normal for people with CMT. My hypothesis is that because fatugue is something subjectively experienced, there is perhaps bias in how it is reported. For instance I have not explained the full extent of the fatigue I experience to my neurologist I suppose partly because I do not want to admit how hard it impacts my life, and partly because I do not want to seem overly negative during my consultations. And also partly because even though it affects me hard, I have found ways around the limitations it has put on my life, so it doesen't seem so bad after all. It is only when I start comparing what I can do to what others without CMT can do that I realize how much of an impact the fatigue and the other symptoms have on my day to day life.\n\nThe current model for explaining the fatigue in people with CMT, is that as we loose the normal function of the muscles in our extremities, we start to compensate for the lack of function by using other muscle groups. For instance, the ankle plantarflexor muscles play an important part in normal walking. When these muscles are weakened due to CMT, the hip flexor muscles take over much of the work. This is less efficient, and as a result we spend more energy performing the same task. As the disease progresses, we compensate more and more and so we spend more and more energy doing the same tasks, with the result being that as the CMT progresses we feel more and more fatigue when doing daily tasks. What this model fails to explain, at least in my case, is that I have felt fatigue ever since I was a child with very few if any symptoms of any disease progression. So I have a suspicion that fatigue as well might be influenced by something else as well, perhaps some signalling mechanism/feedback loop from affected muscles/nerves or if all nerves and muscles perhaps are affected as discussed above perhaps that could be the reason. Though I want to stress that this is only pure speculation on my part.\n\nI also have issues with my sleep, in that I often feel tired when waking up. But I have gone through a sleep analysis and I do not have obstructive sleep apnoea. There are studies that show an increased incidence of obstructive sleep apnoea in CNT1A patients, and this have been hypothesized to play a part in fatigue that many CMT1A patients experience. There are also a lot of studies on sleep and other kinds of CMT.  I started working out a while ago and was actually surprised by how quickly I was building muscle. I did not observe a global problem on that front.\n\nMy sleep has always been garbage but I attribute that to bad habits more than anything else How long do you mean when you say a while ago? Also what severity do you have?\nI ask because I found after 8+ years at the gym (with a big focus for the last 5 years), that I plateaued after the first 12-18 months. Nothing would help me get through the plateau e.g. no change to exercise, diet, supplements etc. I have CMT1A and I take testosterone cypionate weekly. I have noticed huge improvements with both peripheral and non peripheral muscle growth from before I started taking it. Unfortunately most of my peripheral muscles have already atrophied pretty bad so they are definitely not where I would like them to be in terms of development at the gym.\n\nSo I can definitely say anabolic steroids have been a huge boost to my ability to stay healthy. Go get yourself tested for low testosterone. I too struggled at the gym for many years until I finally got tested for testosterone levels.   I came in pretty low and was prescribed testosterone cypionate as a weekly injection. It changed everything at the gym. I honestly think that because of her muscular issues when we have cmt1a that we should all be prescribed enough anabolic steroids to push us slightly above range for a normal person.  Not saying we should go into the range is where people take steroids to abuse them, I am just saying I think we should go sign the above where the ranges are for testosterone replacement therapy in order to help compensate. That is pretty interesting, I am going to look into it more closely. How much do you take and for how long have you taken it? Had that checked and while it was not sky high, it was not low enough to be considered an issue. \nHowever, in terms of anabolics, you are completely right. Thre reality is, as said by an endocrinologist I saw, that they do not actually know all the factors involved in muscle growth and it is possible that CMT limits regular growth. A recent study gave a patient regular doses of Anavar and 1) muscle growth was extremely prominent but more interestingly 2) nerve velocity actually increased. While i am waiting for my consultant to catch-up with this breakthrough, I am going to have an investigation into SARMS as they are legal in my country and are used for muscle wasting conditions.

I want to help out the CMT community but I cannot stand needles, so my testing is kept to a minimum sadly.\n\nIve been to the CMT clinic in Iowa and let them do a bunch of tests on me to add to their data base. Mainly strength/balance tests, and nerve conductivity.  Oh goodness, I am very sorry for you.  Keep busy, realize your limitations, and live on! That helped ; kids, adults, scientists, doctors and the yet unborn.\nThank you for what you could and did do I really hope it did! I am one of those lucky cases that my CMT had not affected me much when I went. I am 21 now and am having problems now, mainly with leg cramps and pain, so I hope to go to Iowa again to update my information there. There is a current drug trial for leg cramps in folks with CMT.  Your closest MDA clinic should have the information.\nI did not retain it since it was for Type1(X) and I am Type2 I was diagnosed in 1990 when I was 8. I have a distinct memory of going into a board room full of doctors where I walked a line while barefoot. I think that it was for a study. Otherwise I mostly had the usual EMGs (haaaaaate) and motor response tests. This was at the children\u2019s hospital in Boston.\n\nIn 2016 I volunteered for a clinical trial run by Columbia in partnership with Pharnext for their PXT3003 treatment. After going through a round of testing (more EMGs) I ended up being disqualified from the study because my nerve response was too slow. It was very frustrating to be told that I was ineligible for a treatment because my CMT was *worse* than what they wanted. That experience is shit, and I am sorry for you.  That is just horrible. Look into the sidebar for proper doctors Yeah! I actually reached out to them in Florida. When I originally reached out, I was only having cramps once a week, so I did not qualify. Now I am having them almost every day. \n\nI have been meaning to reach back out, but it also required me to go to Florida for a day or two. They pay for the hotel, but I do not know if I can afford to take off work to go. :(\n\nIm not sure how long clinical trials last, but I know in a year I am hopefully moving to Florida, so maybe it will still be an option then. Not quite the same, but I can relate on that frustration. My mom has an autoimmune disease, and the current clinical trial is a stem cell transplant. It is meant as a last resort, because it can kill you, and it is very rigorous. \n\nThe first place my mom applied told her she was not sick enough (I am not sure how, she is got one of the most aggressive cases of her disease...)\n\nThe next place told her she was *too* sick. Yeah I have been considering going to an anti aging clinic to get testosterone because I have a problem retaining muscle growth and strength in my peripheral areas like my arms and legs, so I have to use wrist wraps a lot for heavier weight. I have an amazing neurologist. She actually contacted the chief doctor for the study to see if he could make an exception but it did not happen. Despite this experience I will say that the school of neurology at Columbia in NYC is a great place to find treatment. Are they associated with any CMT organization?  How do you find your muscle growth elsewhere? For example, are your traps and biceps continually improving in size and strength?\n\nI ask because I have a suspicion that CMT limits muscle growth as a whole, as many patients I have spoken with quickly reach a relatively weak plateau, which I have only been able to break through with the use of SARMS.  I am 5'11, 210 lbs, Male.\n\nBench is 305 lbs.\nSquat is 315 lbs.

Even when I do muscle atrophy. But you might be right, I just do a shit ton of lifting and do feel that for the amount of time and months I have spent at the gym, my progress is a bit lackluster. Maybe you are right. How on earth did you get all that healthcare?I did not even know there were doctors that treated the condition and have simply limped around falling down all my life.  Since finally getting an EMG after the age of 40 I have never met any doctor besides the neurologist who diagnosed me who knows what it is, and, despite losing all heat cold sensation my extremities I have never found anyone to do a nerve biopsy.", "IFV for CMT? F20, 1A\n\nSince I am getting into adulthood, the thought of kids has become a bigger topic. As of now I do not really want kids for personal reasons, but the biggest reason being that I do not want to pass CMT down to my child(ren). You know how hard CMT has been for most of us, and there is no telling to what degree it will effect people no matter the type. I do not want to risk that and have them suffer the same or worse than I have. \n\nEmbryo/gene modification is not possible, legally anyways. I am not an expert on IFV or CMT but what the specialist have told me is that it is pretty much 50/50 if one parent has it and the other does not (seems more like 80/20 if you ask me). \nSo I guess what I am asking is, would it be possible to get embryos that do not have the mutation? Is it possible that it could show up later on? And, if in the future I, or others were to get gene therapy, would that erase the mutation in sperm/eggs? Yes, it is possible to do IVF and then check each embryo if they have the mutation and then only implant the ones that do not have it. Unfortubately, in my country this is currently not legal.\n\nIf one does not have the mutatiom then they will not get CMT. However, obviously there are all kinds of mutation that can occur, so no CMT does not always mean healthy.\n\nAlso, the 50/50 is true, but you have to have a 1000 or more babies, for it to really be 50%. Yes, it is possible. My cousin was the first person in my country to get IVF treatment to rule out CMT. Her daughter does indeed not have CMT, unlike pretty much everyone else in our family. It is definitely something I am thinking about doing as well, once I feel like I am ready for kids. It is possible and I cannot wait to have babies using ivf :) my husband and my future children deserve long, happy, and healthy lives. The ivf is the path to do it and I personally get so happy each time I remember I live in a day and age where I can have healthy children! (I would not risk passing down cmt otherwise) Everyone is correct that IVF can be used to check for CMT mutations. This is a process called PGT (preimplantation genetic diagnosis), if you would like to look more into that and if it is available where you are.\n\nTo your second question, gene therapy will not erase the mutation in sperm/eggs. Gene therapies are designed to target a particular cell type based on the disease. In the case of CMT, gene therapies are being designed to target nerves and therefore will not have any effect on sperm/eggs. My wife and I have two CMT free kids thanks to IVF with PGD.  Definitely worth looking into.  I would of never had kids if this was not available. If you do not mind me asking, how much was the procedure? Without insurance probably just over $30,000.  We paid about $12,000 and our insurance covered the rest. I feel life that is the responsible way to go for any kind of genetic diseases/conditions", "Zoloft So I saw zoloft on the medications to avoid list and I was wondering if anyone had any reactions to it? I loved it while I took it but I was scared to take it for an extended period of time. If it does have major effects, what is a medication some of you would suggest for anxiety and depression that would work? I have tried Buspar, escitalopram, bupropion, and zoloft of course and zoloft is the only one that has kind of worked so far. Buspar caused brain zaps and the other two did nothing I take Zoloft and was never advised against it. What is the specific reason that it is contraindicated? According to ( there have been a handful or so reports that it can worsen the CMT neuropathy. It was classified as a \"uncertain or minor risk\" then and it still is, so I think it safe to assume that there is still a lack of data about it. Yeah, I saw this. They analyzed 20-some studies and none of those specifically documented cases of CMT patients taking sertraline. It was just extrapolated from the studies they had that showed minor issues with some related drugs. This seems more like a very new, not yet proven theory, not an actual likely problem. According to the study linked, there were at the time 21 different cases of patients with CMT taking sertraline recorded in the CMTNA database. 5 of these cases reported a clinical worsening of the CMT symptoms after taking the drug. The CMTNA Database is a registry of clinical details of CMT patients, that among other things is used to document exposures to medications and possible side effects. \n\nThe authors also write that *\"Anecdotal but unpublished communications have noted an increase in symptoms with certain serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), most commonly sertraline. The unexpected number of entries in this series (5) supports this association, although additional detail is needed to establish a stronger association.\"*\n\nPersonally I take no chances when it comes to my CMT, but everyone is of course free to make their own judgements. When it comes to SSRIs however there are a lot of alternatives that does not have this uncertain or minor risk with regards to CMT associated with them. It definitely made symptoms worse for me. Add in no clinical benefit and it was a no brainer to stop taking it. It is not like the chemo drugs where you are weighing up cancer VS worsening neuropathy. Yes, I suppose it depends on how severe one\u2019s depression is to do a risk benefit analysis of whether taking an SSRI is worth it. If you are going to kill yourself or self-injure or be addicted to substances without your medication, the minor risk to exacerbating CMT is probably worth it. What are some of the alternatives? Not all SSRIs have this uncertain or minor risk though, there are alternatives. That depends on what condition(s) the doctor prescribed it for. But just to mention a few, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) and escitalopram (Lexapro) are SSRIs with no recorded contraindications in CMT. Always consult a doctor about these things though.", "Heroes (2017)coverbyTerranceVardy  You post have been removed from /r/CMT because it is not about Charcot Marie Tooth disease.

Something I recently discovered in my never ending quest to find relief from the infernal fires of hell from my lower legs to the soles of my feet.\n\nThere are several articles in ( as well as just doing a search using your favorite browser.\n\nAllegedly, per the articles in Spine-Health.com, CLT has been used successfully in treating pain from:\n\n    * muscle spasms\n    * Arthritis pain\n    * Back pain\n    * Carpal tunnel syndrome\n    * Fibromyalgia pain\n    * Knee pain\n    * Neck pain\n    * Tendonitis\n    * Muscle and joint pain\n    * Stiffness associated with arthritis\n    * Pain associated with muscle spasms\n    * Hand pain and wrist pain associated with Carpal Tunnel     Syndrome\n    * Neck pain\n    * Lower back pain\n    * Wound healing\n\nSo, if CLT works for all those pains, I am thinking it might work for those KILLER MUSCLE SPASMS!! And, if it works for Fibro, associated with a feeling of BURNING, why not try it on my legs and feet from the depth of HADES?\n\nThoughts? See what research is it there to backup those claims. There are lots of snake oil sellers looking to capitalise on people's suffering, but there are also breakthrough technologies as well. I would recommend peer reviewed journals as your best source. Thanks for the suggestion. I have been investigating CLT. Just did not want to recreate the wheel from scratch if someone has all ready been on the hamster wheel.", "Supplements: Do You, or Do not You? Wondering, does anyone take / use supplements recommended by their CMT doctors? One of the nuromuscular MD's I used to see recommended I begin taking Magnesium to combat the ravages of CMT. It has been about 1 year of 1 mg every morning and I can honestly say I can tell if it is doing anything positive or am I just throwing good money away?\n\nAnother doc has suggested I being taking B complex vitamins and another has suggested [CoQ10[(\n\nI know the CMTA site does not endorse the use of vitamins but I am asking you, the consumer? Honestly I would not say a single off the shelf supplement is going to help CMT in any meaningful way. \nIf you workout a lot, a good multivitamin is wise, as well as vitamin D depending on where you live. Other than that magnesium, CoQ10 etc are a waste of money. The latter can help with cholesterol, but that is got nothing to do with CMT!\n\nAs I work out 5 times a week, have bad joints and cycle SARMs, I have a massive stack of supplements I take, but for your average CMT Joe, stick to vitamin D and that should be enough. I personally see no point. There is no strong scientific evidence behind any of them being of any benefit for CMT. If it makes you feel better to be \u201ctrying something\u201d, great, but I would not get your hopes up.\n\nI take vitamin D and that is it, but that is not because of CMT. I agree with others... supplements are one of those things, it is hard to tell if they are doing anything. I have been taking Lion's Mane along with niacin off and on, there is some evidence that it can help mylenate nerves, highly doubt it will do anything for CMT but how would you even know if it slowed the progression, right? Lion's mane is supposed to have some cognitive benefits too. Besides that, I do supplement Vitamin D in the winter months and take B vitamins for energy. Do you think B vitamins help at all with energy? I am always rundown, tired, low-energy, lethargic, ...\n\nI never used to be this way. Now, every movement takes SO-MUCH-ENERGY!\n\nAs I understand, a complex B vitamin is also, allegedly, good for nerve health. How? I have no idea. I am just tired of being tired and tired of seeing MD's and tired of no answers and tired of spending $$$$$ and TIME, MONTHS,  on new medications. None of them work for me. Neither do the pain meds.\n\nI have been taking Vitamin D for years now that I am living back east. Never need it in Arizona. No idea on the mechanism where B vitamins would help the nervous system but I am not very technical. I can say there are definitely times when I take a stack of B vitamins and get an energy boost, it does not last long, maybe 45 minutes, and it does not happen every time. I take niacin + B12 + B2. \n\nHow do you do with caffeine, does it help at all? I have tried modafinil which is a medication they prescribe for people with shift related sleep disorder. My neurologist prescribed it to see if it would help, it definitely helps with alertness and mental energy, which in turn helps me summon more physical energy. It is not an amphetamine. \n\nStupid bodies betraying us... If fatigue is the issue, pharmacology might not be the right route. A deficiency might make you tired, but if you have normal levels, an increase in vitamins rarely translates to energy. \n\nPhysio or assistive devices to help get through the day? I can speak to Vitamin B and nerve health a bit. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to peripheral nerve damage much like CMT symptoms. I actually dipped into the deficient range for B12 a few years ago and had the joy of a series of vitamin shots to get my levels back up. Once I was back to normal I switched to taking a normal B12 supplement pill every day. Further bloodwork has confirmed that this is enough to keep me solidly in the normal range.  \n\nAny vitamin deficiency can cause some sort of damage--that is what vitamins are, substances that bodies need to keep functioning correctly. A B12 deficiency happens to be one which causes peripheral nerve damage--mimicking CMT symptoms--so it might be good to get checked occasionally since any symptoms from it would be masked by our normal symptoms and would appear to just be a worsening of CMT. \n\nIf you have enough of a vitamin in your system to be within the normal range more will not help. So while enough B12 is important to keep your nerves as healthy as possible more than that will not do anything. Indeed, as B12 is one of the water soluble vitamins any more than what the body needs will be filtered by the kidneys and discarded, doing nothing more than making expensive pee. I take vitamin B12 because I have been deficient in B12 in the past and my doctor and I have determined that this keeps my levels normal. Most people probably do not need to take this but it might be useful to have the blood test done to check, because it can cause peripheral nerve damage that would be less obvious in CMT people.\n\nI take vitamin D just as general \"I live pretty far north and do not get a ton of sun all year\" precaution; my healthy spouse takes this as well.\n\nNo doctor has ever suggested to me that I take any vitamins or supplements specifically for CMT. As always, /u/NixyeNox , thanks again for your insights and sharing your knowledge. So, with that said, it sounds like the prudent path is, first, have lab work performed to determine ALL B level states. I was considering purchasing, ( based only a recommendation of an MD as she said B Complex is beneficial for nerve damage. But, as you said, if production is adequate, why would she recommend taking augmentation? Again, as you said, over dosage of B would literally be flushing it down the toilet. It is possible that she had something specific in mind that I am not aware of. The only way to know would be to ask her for more specifics. \nShe may have also figured that just taking a vitamin pill is faster, easier, and cheaper than having the tests run. For lethargy, have you ever had a sleep study conducted? I was told that it was my CMT causing low energy, but further investigation showed it was actually non-REM parasomnia.\n\n**Also, be EXTREMELY careful with B vitamins, if you take too much of several, such as niacin or B6, you can cause liver and nerve damage.** I have been taking them for a few months. No noticeable difference. (Vitamin B, C, D have all been suggested at diff times). That being said, I am young and I have had multiple surgeries so I am at the point that I figure cost of some vitamins is less than paying for endless surgery and recovering from them. How is your progression with working out your legs? Especially calves How is your progression with working out legs. Especially calves? Good, but not as much as I would like - thanks to covid and some other medical issues I have not been able to get to the gym enough. My last cycle I took was 10mg LGD every day which resulted in fast strength improvements although I was able to see that my hamstrings are definitely suffering from atrophy more than other leg muscles. My calves got a good thrashing and improved strength and stamina but due to a chest infection I had to call off the cycle after just over 4 weeks, which is not ideal, but that is life! I emailed her assistant, asked for clarification. We shall see. Thanks for the suggestions and warning, u/JoeBob85 \n\nNever had a sleep study conducted. Pretty much, I just do not get adequate, recuperative sleep due to chronic, uncontrolled pain.\n\nIn addition to having CMT2D I also have 2 genetic neuropathies. Between the CMT, the 2 genetic neuropathies, the medications, the atrophy of both feet, ankles, and lower legs, I am just out of energy just from doing what used to be 'simple' daily chores or everyday 'things' one does without thinking anything of it. Sorry to hear that - good quality sleep is vital to having good health which is more important than normal for people like us with CMT. If you can, try talking to a doctor about improving your sleep which may require stronger painkillers before bed. Again, thanks. Have recently settled on a bedtime cocktail of about 6, maybe 7 prescription drugs + a minimum of 1, Acetaminophen PM, + a minnium of 1.5 oz of good Costco Vodka mixed in with a cranberry juice, and about 3 -200mg Ibuprofen. With all that, I may get a few hours sleep (1.5 -2 mg Atavan, also) but it seems to work for me. \n\nBefore someone comments, yes, she is aware I drink alcohol, only 1 drink nightly, because that is what actually gets me over the edge and into sleep. Protein powder though - I still get benefit from that with CMT1A right? Or no? Oh yeah absolutely, everyone to be honest would probably benefit from protein powder as it helps balance out a diet unless you are having large amounts of meat every day. If you exercise regularly, then getting adequate protein is essential, and unless you want to eat a lot of chicken (depends on your weight etc), protein powder is definitely the easiest way of getting in a balanced diet - I have a protein shake at least twice a day so much so I forget it is technically a supplement  \ud83d\ude02 Good to hear. Are you able to squat heavy? Lol okay good. Thanks for the info. Yeah I regularly have protein powder too: would suck if cmt ruined that one too lol. I have very low flexibility in my achilles tendons (less than 15 degrees) so unfortunately I do not squat at all due to balance issues. I have the same problem. Dont you think stretching the hamstring and especially the calves will solve this? With enough time and perseverance, probably? But honestly I am not sure how much time would be required - is stretching the calves for 10 minutes every day enough? Or 30 minutes split between morning and evening? I will have to take a look into research to see if there is a given amount of effort that would result in lengthening, as that would be really good to know. After visiting the Center of Excellence in Iowa, my wife started taking Magnesium - I will confirm this - as it was recommended to combat muscle cramps she would get. Practically eliminated them. I will ask her what else she may be taking Thank you for the info and response! I have been on Magnesium, high grade quality, for approximately 1 year. My calve muscle cramps are incessant, literally. The only variables are intensity and duration. So far, the only noticeable difference with Magnesium is there is less $$$$ in my wallet.\n\nEDIT: Perhaps I should investigate MAXIMUM daily dosages? I think stretching at night for 30 minutes is a good start. The stretching doesnt have to be very intense Unfortunately no off the shelf supplement will even slightly help with CMT. I have tried them all and had zero results. Anything that does work is either acquired via prescription or lives in a very grey area of the law. I cannot squat but I can use the incline plate loaded leg press and hit 270 kg for reps. It is an average weight but it is a good start for someone with CMT and muscle wastage. (I also use PEDs) I hope you do not mind me jumping on the bandwagon. I rarely eat meat, take vit D supplements on doctors advice. Never tried protein shakes. Are they fattening? Would they still be useful for someone who does not exercise and is pretty inactive. I take vitamin D on doctor advice but I have not noticed any benefit or negative to taking it- I just do. I have recently been looking at trying other supplements for energy/fatigue. Would be interested in finding something that helps leg cramps. I have been taking vitamin D ever since I moved back east, almost 20 years now. Never needed it back home in Arizona. Oh well, those days are gone.\n\nI am going to have blood work done soon to ascertain the necessity of taking any kind of B supplement. \n\nAs far as leg cramps, I wish you luck! Do not forget your friends here at r/cmt when you find that magic carpet ride!!\n\nGood Luck! Thank, you too :D Nope, protein shakes should not in any way be fattening! A good quality one should be over 90% protein so it is just great for helping gets balanced diet and maintain muscle, even when not exercising.

Even if you are not a scientist I believe everyone can take something away from articles like these, and there is information about almost anything related to your CMT. Accessing the source of most of the worlds CMT information can be a rewarding and interesting activity, and staying informed can be hugely beneficial for both your self and others you may know who have CMT.\n\nThere are for instance over 50 new articles on CMT in pubmed since january of this year, and many of them are interesting reads. Some that particularly caught my eye are Barreto et al., *Epidemiologic Study of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease: A Systematic Review*; Hong YB et al., *A Mutation in PMP2 Causes Dominant Demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy*; and Tajima F et al., **.\n\nIf you want to read more than abstracts, check out the sidebar in /r/scholar.\n\nAlso, if anyone here is passionate about CMT literature and would like to help me categorize CMT articles by topic, I would love to hear from you. I plan on putting up a link to a register of every single CMT-related article in the sidebar in /r/cmt according to some broad categories, to make it easy to find articles based on interest such as genetics, epidemiology, orthopedics, pain, treatment trials, etc etc. Keywords and other search methods cannot beat a manual exhaustive categorization effort, and as far as I know no such thing exist. It would be a really nice and convenient resource to have, but I could really need some help doing it. It is ~100-200 articles/year for the last 20 years, and ideally each article should be classified based on reading the abstract or (even better) the entire article.\n\nAlso, if anyone find any particularly interesting articles or information in articles about CMT, feel free to share it here for everyone.", "Alternative Solutions What are you all's alternative solutions to pain and discomfort? \n\nI am 24 with CMT2A \nI picked up the habit of vaping. I have zero nicotine juice and I got a CBD additive that has zero THC.\nI am on tradition medication. I take Tramadol and Lyrica. Honestly I have been vaping CBD for about 5 days now and it is helped more for my physical pain and discomfort than the meds I have been taking for years.\nBonus is this habit has helped with period cramps. I use THC and it helps a lot. \nIce never tried CBd.\nDo you get immediate relief or does it take awhile?", "Generic Testing Hello everyone, I am a 26 y/o male and my maternal grandfather passed about a year ago from breathing complications due in part to his CMT. I have recently started noticing my right leg has been twitching, not constantly but enough to know that is it is significantly more than any normal twitching. I know that there are a million benign things that can be associated with twitching. My question is: I am going to my doctor for a physical in a few months, is my grandfathers CMT something I should bring up? I do not know that an increase in muscle twitching is a major cause for any concern. Is genetic testing for CMT easy and would it be worth it?\n\nThanks for any of your insight. I think it is very reasonable to ask the doctor about testing for CMT. While I am a big fan of the genetic testing (it is easy, just a blood sample) your doctor may want to do other types of testing first. It would help if you knew what variant (subtype) of CMT your grandfather had, as that can tell your doctor something about likely inheritance. If you do not know, you could also think about who else in your family has or may have had this; you say your maternal grandfather did, so did/does your mother have symptoms? Your doctor might want to talk a bit about to get an idea of your risk--just a heads up so you can be prepared when you talk to them. I have lots of twitching from cmt. As Nyxie said, testing is easy. I have had two genetic tests recently and they just used saliva. I definitely think it is worth bringing up. You can also get genetic testing on your own for specific diseases through Invitae if for some reason your doctor is not willing or able to set it up. Thanks for all the great info. I talked to my grandmother and they said they were not able to get a definite subtype on him... I will plan on discussing it with my doctor in a few months. Thanks for the reply, a lot of good info. I appreciate your help. Make sure you have long term disability insurance and life insurance before doing this. I did not do that and I regret it. Yes, definitely bring it up and ask for testing.\n\nCMT is dominant so it will run through the male side of your family. The thing which makes CMT very unique is that it seems to be random in the severity of what you inherit i.e your dad could have it so mild he does not know, and your child could inherit it and be severely disabled from it (hopefully not though!).\n\nTwitching is a common symptom of it, along with high arches in your feet and poor walking ability. Good call did not even think about that CMT is autosomal dominant. This means that you mother or your father (whoever is your grandfather\u2019s child) would have to have it in order to pass it on to you. If your parent does not have CMT, it is very unlikely that you do as it would have to be a spontaneous gene mutation on both parents sides. do you get twitching in other parts of your body besides legs?  I recently started having twitching in my triceps every couple of minutes for the last week or so and was wondering if this could be linked to CMT. Yep. My biceps twitch almost constantly and so does my tongue. I guess the question is, does OP's mom have it?", "stroke victims with CMT I was diagnosed with CMT when I was 25 years old. I then had a stroke at 38 which was 2 years ago,  and they had no idea what to do with me.  does anyone here suffered a stroke, and is dealing with CMT? one of the biggest things I do not with after suffering a stroke come up with that my knee hyperextended, and I had to get a full leg brace, among other things. after about 6:30 in the evening I am dead tired, in my balance is all shot to hell double now. Ouch! That is rough! No advice from me, have you been able to find decent medical help?", "Patient Survey and AFO Improvement Greetings! We are a group of undergraduate students at the Medical Devices Center at the University of Minnesota. We are doing a critical analysis of current AFOs to alleviate some symptoms of CMT. We are looking for voice of customer inputs on some of the current limitations of AFOs, whether it be cosmetic or affecting treatment and comfort. \n\nWe are also looking to do patient interviews. If you, or someone you know would be interested in speaking with us, please let us know!\n\nThank you,\n\nEthan  Have all the undergraduate students put on a set of AFOs, then try to put their shoes back on.  Then take their cellphones away and take them out shoe shopping. They only get their phone back when they find a pair of shoes that will fit.  I do not know which type of CMT I have, but my symptoms included hip dysplasia, which resulted in two corrective hip surgeries as a teenager. Due to the surgeries, one of my legs is just slightly shorter than the other, and I have a very exaggerated gait. \n\nI definitely wish there were more shoe options. I saw an orthotist two years ago who said there was only one type of brace that would work for me and only one type of shoe that would work with the brace. I am in my late 20s, and the large black shoes that my braces are in make me feel like I belong in a nursing home.\n\nI must add, though, that I do think the orthotics guy I worked with was terrible, and did not actually try to keep up with industry changes. Unfortunately, at the time, he was the only orthotist in my area, and he is no longer in business. \n\nI tried to get him to adjust my braces and shoes, and he refused to adjust them, saying they were fine. Even my doctor said they needed to be adjusted, but there was nothing I could do. So, sadly, I cannot even wear them anymore because of the pain they cause me, and I cannot get new ones made because I no longer have insurance.\n\nAside from that, I would really love if there was a way I could easily put my brace in and out of other shoes. If the shoes could be even slightly more stylish, I think I could actually have a little more confidence. I used to work for an advertising agency, and I definitely stuck out like a sore thumb in an industry that makes its money on good-looks. \n\nI hope I was of some help. Let me know if you have any questions. I am happy to help any research that might help people like me.\n\n If you provide proper links to your department, plans for the data, and funding - sure", "PXT3003 Anybody know the timeline for PXT3003 FDA approval?", "Podiatrist Advice Hello everyone! I found out the other month that I officially have type 1A, and my doctors really want me to get to a podiatrist asap. I have not been able to go just yet for other health reasons, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice? Experience in what to expect? I am a little afraid of being talked down to or getting somebody weird. I went to a podiatrist years ago as a teenager like 13-15 that age range. They were not creepy and i dont recall hime talking down to me. I do not really have any advice but bestof luck i hope you can go soon. You can check reviews online and try to find someone that is well thought of. Even better, if your neurologist has recommendations go for that. Has you Dr given you a reason he wants you to see the podiatrist? I always find it best to know why I am seeing a specialist and have a clear idea of what I am expecting.\n\nI have seen heaps and never had anyone weird but there has been quite a bit of variance. Some just seem to do general foot maintenance, like nail trimming, dealing with calloused skin, etc. Others have been more about gait assessment and making shoe inserts and assisting with shoe selection.\n\nEdit: My current podiatrist picked me as having CMT the second he saw my foot and was very pleased I was diagnosed. He would have sent me to a neurologist if I had not been. A good podiatrist will be able to pick up on a lot of foot and ankle problems. My feet are becoming different sizes and my balance is going. They want me to see a podiatrist for shoe help and potentially getting leg braces for daily use. \n\nThe main reason I ask about strange doctors is my neurologist was oddly cryptic about being able to leave if I do not feel comfortable. Really could have done without him saying that lol Maybe he meant it like if you end up feeling emotional you can leave? I know for a lot of people myself included especially when you are still young or newly diagnosed it can be a very sensitive topic to discuss in person so directly. That is how it was for me. Call and ask if they are familiar with CMT. That will be really important.", "Foot reconstruction and Different sized feet I have had foot reconstruction on both of my feet(each separately at different times). Where they have flattened out my arch. Just wondering if it is common for my feet to be visibly of different lengths(not sure about shoe sizes because im still recovering from one, but it seems the newer foot is a good inch longer than my other I feel like my foot got longer, but my toes curled up more from not walking while recovering.  It all kind of evened out haha My daughters feet are two sizes different (hey if you see this do not be mad I am talking bout ya\u2014just trying to be helpful!!!). She is had several surgeries on both feet, like tendon loosening, bone stuff, toes straightened.  When we buy shoes we get the larger size, because she wears afos and it mostly makes up for it\u2014we just make sure that they are high quality (shout out to healthyfeetstore.com) but we get her shoes to wear as well for the occasions she does not wear her braces (say short trips, not a lot of walking) and we just make sure they are shoes that provide good ankle support. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 My feet are different sizes, about an inch.

Do the surgeries actually help?", "Disability Status? Does anyone name CMT as a disability when filling out job applications or other forms that ask if you have a disability? I never do, but I am curious if others do.", "Welcome to FumblesOfDisgamer ", "What do you look for in a neurologist? I got my old neurologist through my chronically ill mother, when I was young. Sadly, he had a stroke a few years ago, and I have not seen a neurologist since.\n\nMy CMT is getting worse. I went from it barely affect my life to nonstop leg cramps and pain/soreness. I figure it is time to go see someone.\n\nI am just so scared of getting someone not good. I have had issues with other doctors, and neurologists. There is no CMT center of excellence near me, so I am not sure what to look for. Any advice? Unfortunately I have found with CMT that neurologists tend to be so moronic it borders incompetence, and I am under the care of the top people in the UK (albeit not private healthcare). \n\nLook for a neurologist who is willing to try and improve your quality of life instead of throwing their hands in the air saying it will get worse no matter what. Most of them simply see CMT as incurable and therefore outside of monitoring nothing should be attempted. None I have met so far have considered looking for solutions to the symptoms, which are actually out there (SARMS, AAS etc). If I had to list the characteristics of a good neurologist, I would say it is someone who is academically uptodate with research and willing to push the boundaries rather than play it safe and do nothing.  Best of luck. Yeah I have had this issue. Or rather, I have seen my mom have this issue and she is shielded me from it by giving me an amazing neurologist for 10+ years until he had a stroke.\n\nNow I am hesitant to see anyone. I am even tempted to wait until I move to Florida in a year because there is a CMT center of excellence there. I cannot be sure of how healthcare in the USA works, but it may be worth talking to people outside of CMT in the meantime, before you move to Florida. What I am discovering is that the symptoms caused by CMT result in it being a multidisciplinary field, and I am having better luck talking with people who deal with those symptoms rather than just CMT e.g. sleep/epilepsy neurologist, endocrinologist, as they are not looking for a cure for CMT, but a cure for the symptoms, which is far easier.  That is not a bad idea. My main complaint right now is leg cramps and pain (today is actually one of the worst days. I am laying in bed literally crying because of an aching pain in my calves). I am not sure who else to see about that other than a neurologist.  If you are in USA, use either ( or ( to find experienced professionals. CMTA has their centers of excellence but the closest one is 6-8 hours from me :( Look for an MDA clinic closer; that is the best way to find physicians who are involved with diseases like ours.  If a doctor does the time to be associated they will not be completely incompetent but you will still have to check their experience and knowledge, then decide if that is the fit for you. I know this is an old thread, but in you or anyone else sees this and live in California I HIGHLY recommend Stanford's neurology department. The entire staff is competent on CMT and they even have an annual CMT patient conference, when I go in they have me see a doctor, physical therapist, and respiratory specialist and they all take time to talk you through lifestyle changes, tips, etc.  This helps a lot. Because I am from the Central Valley and would love to learn more about my CMT. My mom has a severe case of it. My twin brother and I have it. But growing up my parents never made a big deal about it. But I have notice I am getting weaker in my legs. I am a 24 year old male.  Sounds like you are in the same boat as me, though I was clumsy all throughout my childhood as well. I am 28 now but can still hike and backpack for multi-day trips just fine. I seem to be breaking my toes very easily though. I would recommend Dr. Day at Stanford, he is excellent. Worth the drive. ", "Regaining Muscle I know there was a pretty good write up by one of the mods (nixye or pmp22?)  about the speculated nerve mechanism of muscle wastage, but I was wondering if anyone had any good insight on regaining muscle once it is fairly gone?   \n\n\nFor context, I am butting heads with my orthotist. I have been prescribed a fixed afo, but have to pull up to stay in position due to tight calves/achilles (no amount of strapping in place has worked). I need the afo because the dorsiflexors are weak. So, I am being told to strengthen those muscles. If I strengthen those muscles, I no longer need the afo at all as the dorsiflexion is the only real issue indicating afo use. I am confused. I wear afos for the same reason. I have enough muscle to walk but not enough to walk properly. So I wear afos to pick my feet up. I am starting to use resistance bands. I have used them in PT before and they seemed to work a tad bit. However I have had my Achilles tendons lengthened - which released my muscle tightness a good portion. I am on the same track to build muscles as I assume most people with CMT are. This road is a difficult one. I have looked into the lengthening and been told it would not be appropriate. But I have stretched as much as I can stretch and I cannot stretch anymore. First of all, I hope you do not mind me saying your orthotist sounds like an idiot. If you need an AFO to improve your gait because your dorsiflexors are weak but the AFO requires that your dorsiflexors be stronger it just sounds like he or she needs to find a different AFO design to offer you. This is literally the job, finding the right orthotic to work for your particular situation. \n\nSo, in a perfect world strengthening your dorsiflexors \\*rather\\* than getting an AFO would be great (as opposed to strengthening the muscles and then wearing an AFO anyway which, what?) but can you? There is no way to know unless you try (or have tried). \n\nIf your dorsiflexors do not respond at all when you try to move them the odds that you can strengthen them enough to be useful is, in my non-expert opinion, very remote. However, if you can move them but they just do not have quite enough strength to lift your foot properly you might be able to improve them enough to delay getting AFOs at least for now. \n\nThe best approach would be to find a physical therapist who specializes in neurological difficulties and to get them to professionally evaluate you and design exercises to optimally strengthen your muscles. I recommend this generally all the time but particularly in your case you sound like you are right on the cusp of being able to walk without AFOs or not and if so now would be a critical time. \n\nAn objective professional evaluation can help decide if you have enough muscle response to work with, can help specifically target the muscles you need to improve, and can help you find the right amount to push yourself. Growing up with CMT before my diagnosis I constantly pushed too hard in every physical activity because I was constantly slower and weaker; I was told or it was implied that I was just inexplicably lazy. As a result, I have a life long habit to throw myself recklessly into every exercise. It took professional intervention to teach me that a scientifically designed program gets better results with far less strain. \n\ntldr: the only way to know if you can strengthen a given muscle is to try and a physical therapist who specializes in neuromuscular problems is the right person to consult on that So it looks like the root cause if the pmp22 production in CMT also will cause issues in growth hormone, igf-1, and NGF regulation (you will have to little of all of the above). This means that when these idiot doctors just say \"build strength\" it is going to be impossible for people with more severe CMT and extremely hard for people with mild CMT.\n\nAlso once you have nerve death it is impossible to rebuild that muscle so the only solution is to over develop the muscle you have. This can only be done via medicines used to treat muscle wastage. I had my Achilles surgery when I was 13 one of the worst cases my specialist had ever seen of cmt today I am 25 and go to the gym daily it took years but I have not worn afos for years and have completely higher than average muscle mass \nI honestly never went to therapy after the surgery I just pushed myself every day for the past 12 years it is a rough road but completely possible", "CMT and Physiotherapy Hi there, guys and girl!\nMy best friend has CMT type 1, and I am studying physiotherapy. He is a wonderful actor but I realized that his clumsiness is becoming worse with time.\nI already talked to him about physiotherapy but he think that is not useful.\nI am really concerned for his future, so... Can you suggest me something to push him into a rehab program based on your personal experience?\nThanks in advance!  Just suggest the reasons you think it will help.  Im sorry but do not try to \"push\" him into rehab if you respect him.  The fight with CMT can feel and often is very personal, there is a lot of distrust of doctors (at least in my case), that they cannot really help. A lot of times this can be misplaced, but it is a reaction to years of doctors who have not heard of CMT.  \n\nLet him know your concerns and tell him you care, the first step would be to establish that you are really interested in helping. Listen to what he says he thinks the physiotherapy will do to help, and respond to his concerns.  If he does not want to talk about it then just give him space on that subject. I do not want to be rude but if you \"push\" too hard there is a good chance he will push you away so he can struggle in peace Thank you for the response! He is more like a brother, I do not think he will push me if I insist. But for sure I will be more kind and I will try to use some logic.  Ok if hes more like a brother than maybe push a little harder, but be careful to not come of like you think you know better than him what is good for him.  It isnt something people with CMT are necessarily used to talking about, it can be difficult to even want to talk about.  \n\nSense you want to help then my suggestion would be to research on your own how physiotherapy is used for conditions like CMT and presenting it to him in a respectful way.  Researching the disease is something hardly any friends do (in my experience), their suggestions come off disinginuous when they cant explain what the root cause of the symptoms is. Keep in mind that CMT is a hetrogenous disease caused by one or several mutations in different genes. If you research resistance ecersize and CMT, make sure you know his exact CMT type (genotype) so that you can be sure you are looking up information that is applicable to him. There are studies on physical ecersise and CMT but at the present the topic have not been studied extensively and more research is surely needed especially for the less common CMT genotypes. Most neurologists recomend as mush exersise as we can manage to maintain as much streght as possible, but in practice many with CMT struggle with fatigue, pain and other issues that can severely limit their ability to exersise. Also keep in mind that people with CMT respond to exercise differently than people without CMT so care should be taken when textbook physiotheraphy is applied to people with CMT. I will continue my study and try to create a personalized program for him and his family (his brother and uncle have CMT too, but in a more advanced state).\nUnfortunately, now, we are living in different countries but I will come back as soon as I finish university.\nI know he will be pleased after the first results.\nHe has CMT1, so I am still in time.\n\nThanks to all of you. Your thoughts have been a great help!  Rightyo, where to begin;\n\n1. Physio does help immensely. Due to the biomechanical restrictions CMT causes, this results in pretty much every muscle group in the leg being far too tight. This then results in making your balance and posture worse.\n2. A result of having tight muscles is that you will start to develop other issues such as seized joints and arthritic joints in your feet. This again, will mess up walking and posture.\n3. Stimulation of the legs massively increases circulation which helps bring back sensation to the foot and alleviates pain if you have it, and again helps with balance etc \n4. If he has muscle wastage then look into obtaining PEDs. There seems to be a massive link between CMT and an inability to develop muscle mass. PEDs seem to resolve this and the results of having developed leg muscles again alleviates most CMT issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that is what I have personally found. As for getting him to address this, he needs to confront that he has a disability, there is no magically cure for it, and **it will get worse if ignored.** So unless he wants to be looking at being an actor always casted as someone in a wheelchair, then he needs to get on top of this disability. You can also check out this page on CMT and Exercise, it contains a lot of good information:\n\n &gt;PEDs\n\nWhat performance enhancing substances have you tried that you feel have had a positive impact? A relatively new group of PEDs called SARMs; \n\nI have tried 3; Ostarine (Enobosarm), LGD 4033, and RAD140. All make a big difference at the gym (as in they actually allow muscle growth to happen), however LGD is by far the best. I have had more gains on LGD after 3 months then I have had after 3 years. I raised this with my consultant and she reluctantly admitted that there may be a link between CMT and inhibited muscle growth.\n\nHowever like with all PEDs you need to monitor your health when taking them e.g. liver function, cholesterol, testerone levels etc That is very interesting. What dosage have you been on and if you are comfortable sharing it here, what is your weight? Well it is all legal in the UK so happy to share :D\n\nHeight; 185m\n\nWeight; 82kg (though use to always be 65-70kg)\n\nCycle of PEDs;\n\n* I have done Ostarine at 10-25mg, 25mg a day being the best result. You will develop muscle at what is most likely the normal rate for someone without CMT.\n* RAD140 at 4mg and 8mg, but that was not for long as I had to take a break due to other medical issues\n* LGD4033 at 4mg and 8 mg a day. Last cycle was 12 weeks long (8mg) and was great. I managed to add about 2 inches to my forearm which I was told would be almost impossible due to having CMT. I have also developed my quads to a decent strength which helps with balance and posture. I have just started another 12 week cycle and by the end I will have my annual consultation at UCL, so I am aiming to do some serious development on my forearms and calves to show that PEDs can get around the lack of nerve stimulation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B; Your friend is lucky to have someone like you. I can tell you my experience and thoughts as someone who had physical therapy for several years after two hip surgeries and as a parent whose son is currently in physical and occupational therapy.\n\nIf you are not going to be the one treating him, I would avoid therapists who mostly deal with athletes. It is one of the biggest problems I encounter. It is hard to describe, but I have had at least 3 therapists who acted like I was never doing enough, and they never took the time to acknowledge how CMT affects my recovery time versus someone without CMT. It is hard to find motivation when you know that no amount of therapy will stop the disease, and it is even harder when your therapist looks down on you because they are judging your recovery through the scope of how an athlete would progress. I also find that those types of therapists do not look into recent studies and instead go off their memory of outdated information.\n\nOn the other hand, if you *are* going to be working with him, maybe he is hesitant because he does not want you to see him in a situation that will highlight his weaknesses? It can be embarrassing when you are not able to meet goals and experience setbacks. Not to mention, it will probably change the dynamic of your friendship. \n\nHe might think it is not useful because it can feel as if any improvement will be eventually negated as the disease progresses.  Wow!!!! 2 inches!? Is that possible lol Very possible as most of us with CMT will be starting with emaciated/highly underdeveloped forearms. The tricky part and the unknown will be how large can you grow your forearms. A pro bodybuilder can get up to 19 inch forearms, and a normal bodybuilder can achieve 16 inches, so how large can a person with CMT get their forearms?", "Alternatives to AFO's Going To give some short backstory if that is okay. I have recently gotten a new pair of AFO's after 6 years of having the same pair. Needless to say I was pretty stoked since my old ones were not doing much for me anymore. They bring out my new pair and I am floored... They are identical to the pair I was getting rid of. \n\nI started looking for some lighter alternatives, since my biggest symptom is foot drop. I came across a few braces that just go on your ankle and either hook to your laces or the lace holes. I was curious if anyone had tried these as a replacement for AFO's during light activities and if you had some feedback. I have, and I find they work well. To know for sure you would really have to try them yourself. I do not have a huge foot-drop so it may not be as effective if you do.\n\nI use under knee brace type AFO's during winter months as it is the only thing that fits in my winter boots (Canadian winters...), and in the summer months I use the ankle brace that clips to shoe laces in front.\n\nOne thing to mention, I do not know where you are from, but unlike the brace types, the ankle one was not covered by my medical insurance and I had to fork the $$ for them. Yours may be, but it is worth checking first. Are you referring to this  I have always wondered about it. My mother used a design similar to this (other manufacturer). From what I remember, she was happy with them, and used them quite a lot. I use the Richie brace. Overall very happy with them. Light and easy to get in and out of.", "Sophie 1 ", "Mothers with CMT I have a question for the mothers of this group. My wife has CMT and we do not have any children yet, but we would like to some day. Her father and grandfather both had it but as far as they know, none of the women in their family had it. I was wondering how it affected you mothers during your pregnancy ? I have a 6-month old and have only recently realized how much pregnancy affected my CMT. I have more weakness, more stiffness, and experienced nerve pain for the first. I would still say I am just mildly affected, but there is been a big noticeable change. I did not realize it was my CMT until I went to the doctor. That said, I plan on doing it again. It is so worth it! What about your balance, my wife has broken/dislocated her knee numerous times, broken her shoulder by slipping on ice and we live on the first floor because of how many times she has fallen down the stairs. I know CMT messes with your balance but is it something that will worsen with the pregnancy? And thank you so much for responding to this, it honestly means a whole lot to me I have had balance issues but I think they may only feel worse right now because of the weakness and stiffness. But the more I move, the better it gets. So, for example, i cannot walk downstairs with my baby first thing in the morning. I need to walk around before i pick her up, then I wait until I have been up and moving for at least 30 minutes before I attempt the stairs with her. I will do it without her, but not while holding her. So when she was really a newborn, I bought a little mini fridge for our bedroom (as her crib is in our room) and made sure I had everything I needed upstairs. But it sounds like you have already accommodated for that. \n\nI had talked to my perinatologist about CMT and pregnancy and he said about a third of women see their symptoms worsen. So there is a chance your wife will not tell any changes. I am also 43, so I had my first baby much later in life which could make a difference as well (and had a rough pregnancy totally unrelated top CMT). \n\nMy worst fear is tripping while holding my baby. That fear was pretty intense for the first two months when she just seemed so vulnerable. But I was always so cautious looking at where I plant my feet particularly on stairs. I am sure your wife will be the same way. That fear has mostly subsided now (ironic since she is so much heavier now and often practically lunges out of my arms!). \n\nI kept my CMT in mind while registering/buying baby stuff. For example, when we are looked at strollers, I would collapse and open each one. I had a hard time with a lot of them. We finally found a lightweight one that you just pull up the bar in the middle to collapse it. I love it. (And it was not expensive at all!) I have an almost 9 month old now and have CMT. Pregnancy was difficult, I fell more than I did before. I started to bleed 3 months in (hematoma) (I was doing various jobs that involved alot of stuff I should not have been doing) and that was more or less around the time I started to get weaker and felt more numbness overall or my legs would just give out. It was tough, I will admit, and I really was not supposed to have/be able to carry my daughter. But we made it, with a few spills and lots of tests. At the very end, I had to try and induce because my body was giving out on me and I was uncomfortable with pain. Took me 3+ days to go into labor because of medication tolerance and the epidural did not work, nor did some other kind of medication till much after, though labor was nothing but slightly uncomfortable. \nIf anything, make sure you have an obgyn who knows what is what and that will research it, or go the extra mile to ensure mother and baby are safe. You can also do genetic testing before, during, or after birth.\nI wish yall luck\u270c\ud83c\udffc Thank you so much for all of this information. I know my wife and I will worry about the possibility of her falling while pregnant, or while holding the baby. I already kind of freak out if my wife just stumbles, and she tells me to calm down (which I know I should) I just really worry about whether or not she will be ok during those times The falling part is what I worry about. I am very happy to hear that you and your child are well, even after all the issues I have head that when it get worse during pregnancy, it will go back to how it was before the pregnancy. Did that happen with you, or did it just kind of stay that way? More or less, it is not till around a month or 2 ago that it is changed noticeable . I am weaker, I have fallen 5+ times in a span of 2 months instead of a year. My numbness has spread upward, toward my thighs, and embarrassing as it is, I have lost more of control of my bladder. Other things, nerve pain, my vision and hearing loss, have not changed. It is just an overall weakness, makes it is difficult to get outta bed on some days, when before that has never happened. But I go through it, knowing when I am losing feeling is becoming instinct, so I ask someone to hold her or (and this sounds bad, but she is getting use to it and thinks it is funny) I lightly toss her on the bed while I fall wherever. I have become more hesitant with holding her, but I will be damned if I am going to never do it. I have fallen once with her, and as a person whose lifetime is falling, I fell backwards, her always tucked in my chest. She was 5 months and held on pretty well. It is scary, having this and a baby, but they grow. It gets easier, bit by bit. Plus, she loves wheelchair rides. Tossing your daughter onto the bed Does not sound bad at all. If it makes her giggle then it is clearly not hurting her, and you are doing it to avoid hurting her. It is not like you are spiking her or trying to go for a three pointer/slam dunk Yeah, it is better than the alternative. Whatever way I can find to entertain her while I am crying on the ground, I will do it. Aw that makes me sad a little Same, but I want her to think I am playing around, she is starting to pick up on feelings more, and she knows when I am crying. But I smile to show her it might hurt, but having her there makes me happy. She is safe and that is all I care about. Sounds like you are a great mother My mother has CMT. She says it got significantly worse for her after she had me. Did it recede back to how it was before she got pregnant? Did you inherit it? Thank you. I am trying. Hi trying., I am dad. I actually do not have it but from what I understand it was a 50/50 chance to get it.\n\nIt never went back to the way it was before. She always had more pain, balance problems and fatigue after having me and ended up leaving her job for disability a few years later. \n\nShe always said it was worth it to have me but I cannot say for sure how much she just says that to make me feel better. She definitely wishes that she had known beforehand how much it would change her life prior to the pregnancy so I think it is great that you are asking questions now. I have always wanted a child, my own blood, but I have always worried that what happened to your mother would happen to my wife my biggest concern since my wife and I started talking about having kids always has been and always will be the safety of her and our children. I am open to the idea of adoption, hell I WANT to adopt also. Thank you for sharing this with me. I think the epidural messed me up the most. But yeah, I had almost no symptoms before pregnancy and lost feeling in my feet after. My kid is almost 5 and I have been slowly progressing ever since. I was not diagnosed until after my pregnancy. I have a 7 month old and feel that my CMT (type 1a) got mildly worse during my pregnancy, but I also feel that it was completely worth it and I would do it again. My only lasting, new symptom is increased numbness in my feet.  \n\nI also developed carpel tunnel during my third trimester due to pregnancy related swelling. My hands got really bad. I was not able to make a fist or grip things with my left hand almost at all. My OB said this can happen during pregnancy and that it would go away 6 weeks postpartum. It took more like 8 weeks for me, but my hands are back to normal now. It was hard to tell how much was CMT related versus pregnancy related, so I was relieved as I got function back in my hands.\n\nAs a side note, I was prescribed Diclegis (contains pyridoxine) for nausea during pregnancy. Pyridoxine in 10 times the daily allowance is listed as moderate risk for progressing CMT by the Hereditary Neuropathy Society. The amount of pyridoxine in one Diclegis pill is small, but the official directions are to take multiple pills throughout the day. I was not able to get a clear answer on if it was safe for me, so I just did not take it. Hopefully no one here has the need for this medicine, but if so, maybe you can get a better answer than I did regarding it is safety for both mom and baby when baby might also have CMT. I was diagnosed with CMT in my Last pregnancy. I kept falling and my Neurologist ordered the genetic panel that confirmed CMT.  I had to use a walker when my belly got really big.  And after I had my daughter I took extra care to monitor my mobility.  I made a \u201ccrash cart\u201d to roll around the house so I had all the babies needs within reach. \nI got the best most stable Buggy/stroller for walks with my baby. That was a large investment but worked as my walker and stroller.  Being a mother is amazing. Knowing you have CMT and being prepared is beneficial. And that baby is a total Blessing!   Love kindness and support will be needed as in any pregnancy! Best of luck! My father in law did not know he had it until my wife was diagnosed. His father had it so it was just called  \"grandpa's feet\". And we have bought her a wheelchair for days that we do a lot of walking, if if we want to go out after a long day at work. We do not plan on having children for some time but I just want to be prepared. Thank you for your input and I hope nothing but the best for you and yours", "Golf I searched and it does not look like we have a thread on golf, figured I would start one. \n\nDo any of you play? I am curious how CMT has affected your swing as time goes on. I am finding ankle stability to be my biggest problem. \n\nMy dad has been playing for 30 years and has CMT bad enough that he needs AFOs to walk. He is found that opening his stance way up makes for an easier swing. \n\nJust curious in general on people\u2019s experience with the game. Little late but I am a big CMT golfer. Luckily pretty moderate but I certainly notice stability becoming more of an issue. Have not had to adjust my swing much yet, but I find that I am less likely to lose my balance with a slower swing. I can hit it 15-20 yards further when I try to crush it but I am more likely to shift my weight and send it either right or left. Not much different than any other golfer really but just my experience.", "Progression of symptoms  Everyone will progress at different rates. I just suggest you try and get good exercise and keep doing what you are doing. Nothing will help as much as good exercise to keep the decay of muscles at bay. And for now just be grateful it is not changing! Case by case...\n\nHNF founder Allison Moore ( was in her late 20s and prepping for a marathon, when she was hospitalized and treated for a tumor in her leg.

Also, keep your eyes and ears peeled for the new pharma drug for 1A that drops in the next 12-24 months hopefully! I deeply wish they had it for what I have got. If you do not mind me asking, what have you got? Although research for 1A is at an all time high, a lot of developments are on going for other genetic types as well. And a lot of the research for 1A might come to benefit other types in the not so distant future.  Between my Father and I, we have spent a shade over $100,000.00 to figure out what we have. And still no one knows. \n\nTruth be told it is not in the CMT family at all. They cannot even tell if it is nerve based, which it has to be based on the symptoms. It is very close to HNPP which is an under expression of PMP-22. But it is not that. \n\nSo we bounce between neuromuscular, mitochondrial, and nerves. Doctors spend our money to tell us things I know more about at this point. \n\nIt is hard. It is so hard. I just want to know what I have.

I am just done. \n\nKindly,\n\nNicholas  I am not a medical professional, so you should probably take everything I type with a generous amount of salt. And I am sorry for your situation, but for what it is worth there is always a cause even though it cannot always be found. My best advice if you have not already is to find a skilled medical professional who is competent and willing to go out of their way to try and figure out the problem in a systematic way. Finding the right diagnosis can sometimes be a lifelong journey.\n\nYou say you feel tingling, burning, throbbing and twitching sensations. That can all be caused by a neuropathy, but unfortunately there are a very large amount of other possible causes for symptoms like those. And without having more information to try and exclude other causes, the \"sample space\" is simply way to big to try and isolate any suspected causes. Just to give some examples though, there could be a problem with any part of your sensory system, from your receptors, to the sensory ganglions, to your central nervous system (CNS). It could be caused by cancer, or a nerve compression, medication, toxins, it could be an inherited problem, or it could be caused by an infection like say lyme disease. Or it could be a damage or malfunction in the CNS which caused a sensitization. Or it could be caused by parasites, or it could be autoimmune, or even mental as in somatic symptom disorder or through any of the more esoteric mechanisms related to phantom pain. It could be a secondary result of any number of systemic illnesses or afflictions you may have had prior to this occurring, or it could be something exotic that arise through mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. Unfortunately in terms of sensation, there are still a lot of unknowns.\n\nJust as a random example, if your symtoms are systemic, it is known in the literature that hyperexcitability of the spinal cord can occur after peripheral nerve damage. Substance P, which is involved in the transmission of pain signals and is usually expressed by \"A\u03b4\" and \"C\" fibers, suddenly starts to be expressed by \"A\u03b2\" fibers. This causes hyperexcitability without there being the presence of any noxious stimuli. And if you were to look for the causative peripheral nerve damage, you would not find it! Another example, if your symptoms are not systemic but rather localized to say your arm, you could have MPNST (a kind of malignant cancer tumor originating in nerves). If you were to do a nerve biopsy or even an NCS it would probably not reveal anything abnormal (though an EMG might).\n\nA genome-wide linkage analysis like I mentioned earlier, is something that is being done within the scope of medical research and is not something offered in a clinical setting as far as I know. And without a strong indication that you might have a de novo mutation (like if there were a family history for instance), then it would be a shot in the dark anyways.\n\nWithin the scope of clinical neurophysiology there is something called microneurography though, which is basically a method for investigating peripheral neural traffic in humans. One approach could perhaps be to record C fiber activity using microneurography while you are experiencing the symtoms and when you are not. If there were no difference, the cause would likely be CNS-related. Or a more crude approach, you could have a nerve block done. If symptoms persist with a nerve block, the cause is CNS. From there, a spinal block to isolate spine or brain as the origin.\n\nAnother approach could be to try medications that modulate or block various parts of the sensory system, either systematically or just randomly to see if you get a \"hit\" and take it from there.", "Supplementing Lecithin? Is it worth supplementing lecithin? Has anybody seen *any* improvement or is supplementing futile? Thetre was a study publihed last year from a group at Max Planck that showed that dietary intake of lecithin promoted Schwann cell myelination and improved outcomes in a mouse model of CMT. I can look it up when I get off mobile. Results in mouse models very pften do not translate to humans, the ascorbic acid trials and others are a good example of that. But since lecithin is concidered harmless I do not see any reason not to try it. I plan on looking into it further and most likely also try it out. Would love to see the study! \n\nps. loving the username :) ( is the study and ( is a summary. \n\nThey used a product called ( from the Sigma-Aldrich Corporation which contains about 55% Phosphatidylcholine 20% Phosphatidylethanolamine. Commercial soybean-derived lecithin on the other hand typically contains about 20% Phosphatidylcholine and about 14% Phosphatidylethanolamine in addition to other classes of phospholipids. Some sources claim that the actual contents of many commercial lecithin supplements vary widely in some countries because of lax regulatory oversight, so it is probably a good idea to look for trustworthy products.\n\nAlthough I suspect soybean-derived lecithin would be a decent alternative, I know that lipid chemistry can be complex so I also think it would a good idea to talk with someone who knows more about it just to be sure if you want to try it out. It is always a good idea to try and mirror the composition of the product used in the study as much as possible. Both Phosphatidylcholine and Phosphatidylethanolamine are also associated with increased cardiovascular disease, however I have not looked into deeply so there may or may not be details in the lipid chemistry that makes it an irrelevant concern. If I get more information I will make sure to post it here, and hopefully others will share their thoughts and information about this as well.\n\nI was quite surprised that nobody had claimed my user name when I made it! :) I bought a bottle on amazon and have been taking it for some time now. Do not notice anything different but I figure it does not hurt to take.  Thanks for sharing! What type are you if you do not mind me asking? I have 1a. I also participated in the Pxt3003 trial and did not see any positive results so I may just be fucked, but I am still trying! Keep trying! Have you heard about ACE-083 trials? Those guys at Acceleron are up to something realllly good since people are reporting re-grown muscle tissue! If you are in the US, I would suggest you quickly jump on the bandwagon and sign up for the trials.  I have heard of that trial and it does sound really promising. I do not think I could get into it as I have already participated in one trial, but hopefully they release it commercially soon.  It is going to be released at the end of this year if all goes well - 2019 could be a true breakthrough, so fingers crossed and keep your chin up :)", " Friday Feelings - Small Celebrations Little things that went right this week. \n\nTimes when CMT could not stand in your way.\n\nVictories that you want to share.

I was thinking about getting something that provides good ankle support which is why I was looking into boots. The only thing is, most boots do not seem to have much arch support either. Are there any boots or shoes that you guys would recommend? I always recommend this website; all styles of shoes and easy to find wider widths and stuff.  Just took a quick look and they got a good selection of boots there.\n\n Do you wear AFO\u2019s? No, my CMT is very mild but I do roll my ankles a fair amount with just normal sneakers. \n\nFor shoes, while they may not be the biggest name on the market, Hoka One One are phenomenal in regard to the level of detail they provide around their shoes, covering weight, stability and cushioning. Check them out and see if there is anything that fits your needs. If there is boots you like, and arch support is the issue with them, why not orthotics in nice boots? Sneakers, I like to get performance basketball sneakers, Jordan\u2019s, Nike etc. I like how they look and they are the most comfortable. Boots, Hiking boots have the best comfort and support.  I like vasque, and Columbia. You can get custom inserts made at a podiatrist, I have some but do not really like them that much. Nicer looking boots, redwing, Frye etc, do not have good support, so inserts might help. I do not wear AFOs and have found that barefoot shoes with a custom arch support work best. I wear xeroshoes but I like barefoot shoes because they have a wide sole and toe box. Thanks for the site! I am desperately in need of shoes that fit, are comfortable, and reasonably priced! Thanks Much! The key to shoes is Ankle support. Personally I like Chuck Taylors for summer months, cause I can tie the high tops pretty tight for extra support. \n\nFor boots a logger style boot probably the best way to go if you can stand it. They are pretty tall coming up to usally the low to mid calf area, but just like the Chucks I can tie them tight. \n\nThorugh my experience I buy cheap summer shoes cause I have yet to find a pair that last all summer, but with boots they are worth the price and if your boots  wear out on the sides you can get them resoled for a fraction of the cost of the boot. I have had my Carolina brand boots for almost 7 years and the leather is just now starting to split. Crocs \ud83d\udcaf I wear Meindl light hiking boots. Love them and I am wearing nothing else.
