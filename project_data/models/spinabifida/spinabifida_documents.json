["Advice For Straight Cath Hi! I am a school nurse and I have a student with spina bifida. I have to straight cath her once a day. About two weeks ago, I started getting resistance and could not insert the catheter in more than an inch. I called her urologist and they suggested I wait a bit and try to insert it further when the student is more relaxed. Her mother has some issues but not like this. I think the student is just not comfortable in my office. I have tried everything. I even went to my students house to see how the procedure is done at home.  She was so easy to cath prior to getting a UTI and now it has been quite difficult. Any suggestions? Has this happened to anyone? Are you cathing her while she sits on a toilet, or is she lying down on an exam table-type surface? If on the toilet, I have found that the height of the toilet and the angle at which I have to sit makes a big difference. I am short, so if the toilet is really high, I have to kind of hunch forward so that my toes can at least hit the floor and give me a little balance. Make sure if she is sitting up that she is sitting straight and not leaning in a way that would make it difficult to insert the catheter. She is laying on her back. She is only three, nonverbal and autistic. I used to do it on the cot in my office. But mom does it on the floor at home. So I just tried the floor today. I got a mat and a comfy blanket. She was a bit more relaxed but I still met resistance. I watched mom cath her yesterday with no issues so I am trying to mimic that. At that age, I really do not want to assume urethral constriction but I would tell the mom to consult with a urologist. It might also be a UTI. To put it bluntly, those are a bitch for those of us who regularly cath.", "24M, been single my whole life.. At this point I honestly wish I was aborted so that I would not exist in this miserable world where I have accepted the fact that I will be alone as long as I live.\n\nI had a heart-to-heart talk with my doctor and I fully opened up to her and told her that the only reason I am alone and not actively dating anyone is because I know for a fact that the moment I get a girlfriend, that is when she automatically becomes my assistant and I am not going to put anyone through that misery.\n\nThe other reason is because of my bladder issue. \n\nThanks for letting me vent. I would not discount yourself just yet! My brother is also 24, has no problems and I mean\u2026 isnt in any relationship either. I know times can be hard, and I hope you have or can find things in your life that you enjoy and love doing. You will get there! And about the caretaker part, naaaa\u2026 have you been self sufficient already? That would not change a thing. People Sometimes like helping others out because they love them. Heck with kids that is literally the first 15-20 years of their life! And that doesnt stop the love that can be shared between people. I am a mom, have a partner and I have Spina Bifida. Why would a girlfriend become your assistant? What stops you from being independent? Lots of people understand bladder isssues. I mean there is someone for everyone out there, you just need some confidence and independence. I think a lot of people have the same feelings as you do, you are in good company but many things can be overcome! Hey /u/gabzlel\n\nI want to start off by saying your feelings are valid. I was very lucky to have met my soulmate at the age of 20. However, getting to that point was not overnight and it was not easy. I do not want to tell you that it is just a phase because that is too cliche.\n\nBut, I will say that a good heathy relationship with someone else requires you to have a good relationship with yourself. I would start by making a list, however long is up to you, of everything good you can think of about yourself. Even if that is just one good thing, I do not know where you are at with your mental health journey, is enough. Then, put that paper on your mirror every morning where you will see it. Have it be your reminder that you are an amazing human being. You have limitations, but you are not limited. You can do *anything* you set out to do. You just got to do the work and wait for the right time. Breathe!!! You belong here, and you deserve to take up space in this ginormous universe.\n\nI encourage you to seek counseling. The fact you spilled all that to your medical dr says you really need to let some stuff out. Why would not you? We go through some *rough* shit. *But you are going to be okay.*\nWe always think if we just had x then I would be happy. Get comfortable with yourself, figure out why your happiness and reassurance that you deserve to live is so dependent on if you had a partner. You say you would feel bad that a partner would be a nurse anyway, but you *also* want to make that person your reason to live? That is a lot you are putting into one person whom you have yet to meet (\u201cyet\u201d because you literally cannot tell me that you know without a shadow of a doubt, that you will be forever alone).\nMost of all\u2026just breathe. That helps me when I feel this way. \n\n-Signed, a psychotherapist who also happens to have spina bifida. I have spina bifida as well and am a wheelchair user. I also have never been in a relationship but I will not say I will never be in one. Every person on this earth has their problems, some more so than others. That does not mean that someone is not out there for you, and giving up will not get you closer to that person. You and me both have very limited experience in this reality, and at times it can be cruel, especially in our limited position. I too have had thoughts of \"Hmm, maybe being aborted would have been a better outcome.\" but we were not. We are here, now. I am sure you can agree that there is unparalleled beauty to be experienced in this life, and it is very helpful to remember the best times in your life when things get difficult. Just be patient, be confident, and do whatever you have to do in order to take care of yourself. If you can manage to love yourself, in time someone will come to you. In the meantime, remember that you are loved, and keep moving forward. For what it is worth, I love you. If it helps, you are not the only lonely cripple out there. There are lots of people that do not mind taking care of others. I have spina bifida and my wife has cerebral palsy. We have been married for 28 years, and have a 24 year old son in his senior year of college. I finally found happiness when I quit waiting to find someone to love me, and I learned to love. She is my assistant, and I am her's. We are a team. I wish all good things for you. Do not give up on love, or anything else. Find a new psychologist. The way I see it, you will not be single as long as you live unless you accept it as so. Sometimes because of the hand we were dealt in life, we have to fight pretty hard for what we want. But I believe that a happy, romance filled life is worth fighting for. 51m, been single my whole life too. You are not alone. I am not sure if it is an option for you, as I do not know the severity of your symptoms, but have any medical professionals discussed intermittent self-catheterisation with you? Starting to self-catheterise was probably the biggest life changer for me in terms of managing the bladder issues part of my condition. The catheters I have are easy to use and discrete enough to take in a bag or jacket pocket.", "Pregnant with spina bifida Anyone here have experience being pregnant with spina bifida. I am 13 weeks pregnant and have been experiencing urinary retention. I actually have not cathed since I was a teen so I recently started to help with the retention. I can barely pee on my own which is not normal for me.  I can usually pee enough that I can avoid a uti but I already had one from a day of cathing. \n\nAnyone have tips or resources on how to cath safely and if you have been pregnant has your spina bifida affected your pregnancy in anyway?", "Lipomeningocele anyone? I made an account just to reach out in this thread.\n\nSo,  I am a 26 year old woman born with lipomeningocele, a type of spina  bifida (hence I am here), but I have never met anyone in my entire life  with my condition. I was fortunate enough to be born in Canada where  healthcare is free and I have had two spinal surgeries, one at a few  months old (allowed me to walk) and another as a teenager (allowed me to  make a heel-to-toe rotation), both were highly successful and I can  live my life invisibly. To that is to say, you would not know I had  lipomeningocele unless I took my clothes off and turned around.\n\nIt  makes \\*other\\* people uncomfortable when they see it. I understand that  it can be quite jarring to some able-bodied people to see someone with a  tumour the size of baseball on their lumbar spine and a surgery scar  over a foot long coupled with scar tissue. While it used to bother me  during my formative years, it is a part of my identity and I have grown to  embrace my different body. The only thing I do not care for is the  lifelong chronic pain, but what could I expect when I have had 8 bones  removed from my spine and 4 of which were replaced? Arthritis is just a  part of my life.\n\nBut I am kind  of... lonely? I have great social connections, but I have never met anyone with my condition. It is that \"only one\" syndrome.  I know  it is not as uncommon as one might think, and I am sure there is so many  other people with lipomeningocele out there but I have never had the  opportunity to talk to anyone about it outside of the medical community  who understood. I am just looking to talk to people who have this  condition, swap stories and maybe get some advice.\n\nSo, does anybody else have lipomeningocele in this thread? My daughter does.  She is 10.  She had a lump of fat the size of a lemon attached to her spinal cord.  She is also had two surgeries: one to remove the fat and detether her cord and a mega one on her feet/legs.  \n\n\n\nIt is a wonderful message board and they can help you get connected within the community.  There are a good amount of Canadians on there. \n\nAlso reach out here:  \n\n Hi. I am a 46F with Spina bifida. Like you, it is not visible. People do not know unless I tell them. I am also in Canada. What part of the country are you from? I have it, but more and more I have stopped describing it as a form of spina bifida because our trajectories tend to be so different. I am also in Canada and an adult. \n\nYou might find a spinal cord injury peer support group in your area. I work for one such org and we consider lipomeningomyelocele a form of incomplete SCI. The complications are very similar and there are far more people with incomplete SCI  around. Feel free to join our fb group if you like:  \n\nLMC is a rare condition. The last time I read the research about it it was thought to be 1/20,000 live births in North America, and 3:1 girls: boys. The fact that it is often lumped in with MMC Spina bifida (far more common) in smaller centres means it can be hard to know who has it without asking. \n\nCan I ask why you still have your tumour? Mine was \u201cdebulked\u201d when I was 11months old when I had my first decompression and detethering surgery but it gains and loses a little weight whenever I do. It is just a soft... mound, I guess I would say. \n\nSounds like you are more ambulatory than I ever was. I had a lot of trouble with scar formation and tethering. My initial lesion was at L1 and scarring progressed my paralysis to around T11 when I was in uni. That is another reason you might want to meet some folks with incomplete SCI - issues like arthritis pain and invisible disabilities are something that comes up a lot for them too. \n\nI have a group insta chat with 4 other ppl with LMC if you are interested. Pm me if You want me to add you. Welcome to the subreddit. Unfortunately I do not have lipomeningocele, I have myelomeningocele. I wish I knew the difference lol. Hi there! I have lipomyelomeningocele. I am not sure if it is a different condition, but I have heard it be called both. I had 3 spinal cord detethering surgeries as a kid, but I have always been ambulatory and for the most part it is not apparent I have a condition, on the surface.\nCompared to many others with similar conditions I am lucky to have a mostly normal everyday life. I have never really met any other people with the same condition, other than maybe passing them in a hospital. Very interesting. I am 41/F and have LMC though most of my life it was lopped in with MMC. I am L4/L5 and where an AFO and KAFO, and use a wheelchair for long distances. Did not realize it that it was more invisible for most and that it comes with chronic pain. Great summary. Thanks! I think it *can* cause chronic pain. Kind of depends on how your lesion went, how well the surgeries went for you, how much walking you could do. Yours is pretty much the classic LMC picture that I am familiar with. I have Lipomyelomeningocele which is a slightly different condition, but I have lipomyelomeningocele too! It is considered a different condition from lipomeningocele, but they are closely related. It is very similar to how myelomeningocele and meningocele are quite closely related, but not the same condition. :) I am not sure what the name of it is I have but I have a lump at the bottom of my back around 10-12cm and also what came with my spins bifida was a right side wasted calf \ud83d\ude1e bowel problems and chronic back pain but hey I am damn lucky to walk \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc", "Incontinence options for my 8yo son I am not sure where else to turn at the moment, but could use some guidance from the more experienced!\n\nMy son was born with TCS and has ongoing complications from that related to incontinence. We are doing a fresh urodynamics study next month as his lack of response to oxybutynin, and leg pain, suggest he might be retethered. We are facing another surgery later this year if MRI shows it.\n\nUnfortunately, we had to drop the oxybutynin due to retention. He has almost no control now. (He really did not before, but now there is no hope a \u201cright dose\u201d will fix things.) After he and I discussed the pros and cons of traditional underwear and accidents versus switching to an underwear alternative, he wants to try something disposable/waterproof. \n\nThis is my first time having to help my son make a decision like this. I know he is anxious about feeling like he is in a diaper and being judged by other children, and I want to be sensitive to his concerns while also helping him have some relief from accident fears.\n\nDoes anyone have recommendations for products, approaches, anything\u2026? His spina bifida team has been all but useless on the day-to-day management end of things.\n\nThank you in advance. I feel so lost but want to give my son hope for more normalcy in his days. 1) does he catheterise? Sounds like this might be needed to make sure he is actually fully emptying the bladder when using the bathroom.\n2) Botox is an alternative to oxybutynin - it is been an absolute game changer for me. \n3) where are you located? Is there a continence clinic where you are? It does not need to be specific to Spina Bifida but if you can find a clinic that specialises in continence issues/products they will be a huge help. 1. I also want to know if he uses a catheter.  Sounds like maybe no? If so, he probably should be.  Then all you will be/should be dealing with is dribbles.  Which are much easier to manage.  \n\n2. Please do not be scared of cathing if you are not yet.  100% life changing.  \n\n3. My kid wears pullup up style underpants (she is 12) most of the time. And period panties the rest of the time.  She is self conscious, but prefers the security of an absorbent layer.  \n\n4. Sounds like you need a new SB clinic.  If you are in a small or rural city, it is 100% worth traveling to a larger metro area and big children\u2019s hospital.   Where we started in central IL they have SB clinic once a month.  In Chicago they have SB clinic once a week.  Exponentially more patients being seen and more clinical experience.  It was like night and day when we switched.  \n\n5.  If he is constipated it will make everything bladder- related worse. Our Nero always tells us that a once tethered kid will always look tethered on future MRIs so they go off other cues, like the leg pain and bladder changes to help make decisions. But the incontinence issues could be their own issue and not a retether. I would piggy off polishladyanna above and say you can try the botox next. Urodynamics can show how much they are holding, before spasms and can help find out if they are fully emptying or not. Botox is a round of shots to the bladder to relax the muscles from spasming. Has diminishing results and needs repeating eventually.  May take a few weeks to fully work and the last for 6mo and start to whine down, But it could certainly help. If he caths then making sure he completely emptys is key. Kids can often be lazy/forgetful and they may not be doing it enough times a day, or keeping in long enough when the do. That all goes into how much urine they can hold before spasms start and simply increasing the frequency of bathroom trips may fix the problem. If they are cathing 4x day, try five, or every 2 hours during the day. Whatever it takes. Please see edits, and thank you so much for the response!\n\nI have doubts that he is fully emptying every time even after coming off the med. When the urologist called immediately to address a troubling ultrasound last week, he asked again whether we have ever used a catheter, and I said no, then asked, \"Is your concern with what you are seeing right now that it is time to consider using a catheter with him?\" He said yes, but we had to come off the oxybutynin to see how much retention was med related vs. more going on. \n\nShould we expect that with the urodynamics we will be having that discussion? Is it something we will have to push for help with, or will the doctor give us resources and education? Thank you so much for your feedback! We do not cath \\*yet\\* but it is been suggested it is coming for us so I am going to be coming back to this advice. My son also has ADHD and is notoriously a shortcutter in managing his self-care habits, so I will have to be on patrol for signs routines are not being followed through to completion.\n\nI am curious what signs they will be looking for on MRI considering what you said. I would hate to put him through another surgery without conclusive imaging. His leg pain has been a recurring complaint of the past several months and is enough that it got my attention, but not enough to rule out the possibility it is just growing pains.  (His neuro said that the pain in conjunction with the bladder issues are what is making them consider urodynamics + imaging.) 1) See edits; we are not there yet and looking for advice on when and how we get started, if independently or under doctor's guidance.\n\n2) We will both be nervous to get started no doubt, but as with all things, we will adapt and overcome.\n\n3) What brand pull-up style do you use? Any recs or ones to avoid?\n\n4) Honestly, we attend a reputable clinic, but someone else suggested a continence specialist and it seems like we might just need an \"add-on\" to his specialists to get support in this area. I will investigate further and press his urology team when we go back next month for stronger guidance. \n\n5) We just got through six weeks of PT for constipation issues and we have seen considerable improvement there, which is partially why urology is digging further. A common culprit for bladder-control problems was ruled out.\n\nThanks for taking the time to help! Your experience with your son sounds very similar to my experience when I was younger and I think it would be very good to be prepared for the catheter discussion and frankly, push the doctors into the discussion if they keep putting it off. Because they did the same to my parents and the end result was permanent damage to my kidneys, one of which ultimately had to be removed.\n\nIn terms of resources and education, in Australia at least this is done by the continence specialists. They were extremely supportive - you get an assessment done where they look at your needs, they go through different kinds of products with you (and you would be surprised at how many different kinds of catheters exist!), they do some education on how to use them, organise for you to get samples of the products you like the look of and then support you in evaluating those samples and making a decision on what you want to use. We currently receive medicaid benefits so there are medical brands of pull ups available free of charge if you qualify as well as cathing supplies. But if the bladder is constantly full it can lead to kidney problems so that definitely needs to be worked out first and then pull ups may not be necessary.\n\nInsurance in general will sometimes pay for medical pull ups or over nights so if this becomes a permanent expense check with your insurance provider to see what may be an option for you. Medicaid generally covers all our expenses, we use catheters , as well as bowel regimen supplies an occasional overnight pullups My son was put on oxybutinen at a young age and because it causes retention, that is when we started doing catheters. He is 5 now and been on it for about 4 years now. We Cath 4-5 times a day and he hardly ever has bladder accidents. He just wears a diaper until we find a good bowel routine. Im really confused as to why your docs did not start him cathing sooner. It think that is his best option. If he is not having bowel accidents then doing intermittent catheters will keep him in traditional undies for much longer. Wow... first, I am so sorry you went through that. And I appreciate you sharing your experience. I am going to send a follow-up message to the urologist first thing Tuesday (Monday is a holiday here) and see if I cannot light a fire under his team's asses to not just assess, but *help*. I want to start him on a cathing routine before he goes back to school after the holiday if that is what we need to do!! Why put off the inevitable and risk the kidney concerns they have us looking for on a routine basis?\n\nYou have been helpful beyond words. Thank you. Would it be a trouble to message you directly with more questions on starting the catheter if needed?\n\nAlso one more q: how is using a cath during school? I have a feeling he is going to need support but I do not know what that looks like because we have never done this. Amazing. Taking your encouragement along with everyone else, I agree this is the best option for him. \n\nHe only has bowel accidents when he is a bit backed up, otherwise he is much improved there. That is what we worked on with PT earlier this summer. Seems the more we avoid constipation, the better he does on that end, but it does nothing to improve his bladder situation. Absolutely no problem messaging me with questions, happy to help; I will PM you with the answer to your other question in a min \ud83d\ude0a Sounds like you have gotten a lot of helpful responses already. I would be just like to add that I relate to your son's struggle. I had a detethering surgery when I was 8, and had a lot of incontinency issues after. It was not total loss of control, so I stayed away from catheters. The process scared me, and I also wanted to be as similar to other kids in school as possible.\n\nIt was not until my 20's that I tried again. But I did not get any help/training in it and kept getting UTI's.\n\nFinally, in my 30's, my urinary issues worsened to about 10% control. Luckily, I figured out a way to cath that dropped infections to a very rare occurrence, usually just when I am traveling. I am still trying to figure out how to do that part better.\n\nIt sounds like you got the info you needed, but feel free to DM me for any info I can help with. I have SpinaBifida Occulta, and intermittent self catheterisation was a life saver.\n\nMy tethered cord was not diagnosed until I was 15, but I would had the wetting etc through out childhood.\nThey tried pants, alarms, pads, drugs, hypnotherapy, everything, but nothing worked.\n\nAs my untethering was so late in growth it did not reverse the damage, so the wetting symptoms remained, but the appointment with the continence specialist is what changed my life when they started me on catheters.\n\n\n\nOne of the things I think folks find difficult when talking about wetting/incontinence caused by potential neurological issues is how do you explain/question the \"I need to pee\" feeling to someone who has potentially never felt that before?\n\nI had family members, urologist &amp; specialist trying to discuss \"when do you know you need to go\", \"how do you know you are empty\" etc etc and I obviously tried to answer as fully as I could, in hind sight it is kind of like asking a blind person to describe what they see.\n\nI was peeing when I thought I need to pee, and pushing pee out until I thought there was no pee left, but I clearly did not have the control/feeling/nerve connections to be able completely empty the bladder.\n\nCatheterisation meant that for the first time in my life I had control.\nI could go and empty, and then run, jump, cough, laugh, fight etc etc in confidence that I did not need to worry about peeing.\nTo all intents and purposes I was a normal kid, and could catch up on all the stuff i missed out on like sleep overs, camping, parties etc.\n\nI am 38 now, and still ISC, and I honestly think that it was the best thing that ever happened to me. At some stages in my childhood my outlook on my future looked pretty dark and bleak, so I honestly think catheterisation was not just a life changer, but a life saver.\n\n\nI do not know if this answers any of your questions, but might just give a little insight into what kids sometimes face.\n\nI am here if you (or anyone) has any questions etc they think I might be able to help with. It felt like stepping into my son's mind reading your post. He is a born comedian who loves to laugh and make people laugh, and he cannot do so without incontinence. It breaks my heart to know that he could have gone as long as you without help, and I am here because I do not want him to go that long. He deserves laughter.  \n\nWhat is been hard is that over and over, his PT has asked him how he knows when he needs to go and he seems lost on answering. He nods when she asks, \"Do you feel... \\*fill in the blank\\*?\" But I can see that he is just going along with things because he does not. I even tried to explain to the urologist a couple weeks ago that it feels like he is giving up and I cannot blame him for it, and the urologist took it as a psychological refusal to use the bathroom rather than **he is physically incapable of proceeding past where he is and he does not know how to communicate that**.\n\nIt is so aggravating. I feel motivated to sit down and write out my concerns and \"demands\" from urology+SB team just to make clear that my son cannot go on like this. He needs hope the same way you did.  \n\nThank you for taking the time to share your experience. It offered insight into an experience that I am only witnessing and trying to make sense of since my son cannot always communicate what he is going through and I cannot always communicate to him what we are trying to understand. When you said he was a born comedian I felt a real \"ahh he is going to be ok\" as a positive mental attitude is hands down going to be his greatest personal strength throughout this, with the second being the love and understanding of his family and support network (but the fact you are here asking these things sounds like that is in no doubt).\n\nI know everyone is expiriences are different, but he sounds like he is coping with it in a similar way to what I did, and I deflected and sidestepped the worst of the situation using humour, comedy, and being the class clown. It also helped me to process what was a pretty lonely position to be in most of the time.\n\nI was not obviously disabled, I did not look like I had anything \"wrong\" with me, but the wetting and inability to get involved with what everyone else was doing was an inability just the same, and marked me out as different. Wetting at any age is a very anti-social thing to have to struggle with, and although  I did get a bit of bullying from time to time, it was only a tiny fraction of what I would imagine some kids would have expirienced if they could not use humour to get folks onside first. Even with my issues I still look back on my childhood fondly, and had some great friends throughout it.\n\nLooking back though, if I could offer any insight, is that sometime my humour and levity was used to try to lessen the hurt I could see my Mum was experiencing, with the frustration of the situation. So sometimes the humour is not there for him, but it is to try to make things more bearable for you.\n\nWriting down your concerns and demands would not be a bad thing.\n\nOne of the issues with toilet subjects in most cultures is once kids are toilet trained we do not really talk about it ever again, it is almost a taboo subject taken care of in private.\nIt might sound really strange (so please bear with me) but has anyone actually said \"how do you go for a pee?\"\nNobody asked me that, and certainly nobody actually stood and watched how I urinated at any point.\nEven now I find it incredible that \"normal\" people just stand at a toilet, stare off into the distance and just tell their body \"OK, now you can let your pee out\" and it just happens.\nWhen I go to the toilet I have to really focus, tense my abs as hard as possible to and really push to make pee come out, which I thought was how everyone does it. Because it never gets talked about, I knew no different.\nIn hind sight, if someone had assessed that it might just have proven that there was no \"relax\" signal from my brain to my urinary valves getting through. The pushing technique ticked the doctor's box of \"he is able to pee\" but it was not fully emptying the bladder, so there was always pee left, and always potential for accidents and wetting.\n\nSo yeah, having a sit down, discussing this stuff with your Son, and writing it down could only be a good thing.\n\nAs for catheterisation, I would definitely recommend a trial run.\nI do not know what it is like where you are but in the UK you can order them from chemists, or get samples sent from the suppliers. There are even cool telescopic ones nowadays that are in a marker pen sized tube, so really easy to carry covertly.\nIf he is anything like me he would feel self conscious, and maybe a bit of physical discomfort at first as you perfect the nack of catheterising, but I cannot describe the elation that first time I ever had a completely empty bladder and realised I could run up a flight of stairs without peeing. Of not having to live in fear of getting a cold as every time you cough or sneeze you would wet, or letting my self properly belly laugh at stand up comedy, or being able to sleep in a hotel bed without worrying about wetting in the night.\nCatheterising for me was night turned into day.\nSo like I said, I would definitely recommend a trial run in parallel to whatever else the doctors want him doing, it is no cure, and does not fix any root causes, but it could manage the real world symptoms that would mean he is able to take part more fully in the world around him.\n\nI have been thinking of writing my expirience from start to finish, so when I do I will post it on here as there might be some parallels that resonate with folks going through similar.\nBut if you (or anyone reading this and recognising anything I have said) ever want my number or email or anything just let me know. I have helped a couple of folks over the years now trying to translate to adults what being a kid that wets is going through, and I am only too happy to help whoever/wherever I can. I wore diapers until I was 12 years old... Until, one enlightened urologist at the SB clinic told me to try doing kegel excercises.  I did them constantly, over and over, and a few months later I slowly gained some control.  It was life changing for me.  I was always careful about making it to a toilet - I would scan for them upon entering a new building, and I still do.  Now I use catheters because of neurogenic retention and BPH (old guy stuff), but I am forever grateful to that one urologist that could think outside the box, and not just assume I could not gain some control because of SB. I am pretty sure at that age he can still fit in Pampers and then pull-ups for daytime possibly.  Once he is too big for that go to   get Abena Jr or Tranquility ATN  youth size.", "Lipomyelomeningocoele anyone? My 13 yr old M child was diagnosed with this at birth through MRI. He had a acrochordon and fatty bump just above his butt crack. TC diagnosed too.\nHe is 5 ft 4 now, fully mobile, fully continent, and yet at birth we were told he would definitely have problems. \nShould i be suspicious that the MRI of a 24 hour old wriggly baby was wrong?

No prognosis is going to be 100%, your son got pretty lucky. My kid!  Although she did not have any outward signs and we did not find out until she was four.  \n\nIf they sedated the 24 hr old wiggly baby, the mri was probably fine.  Their prognosis at the time was realistic but SB is suuuuch a snowflake diagnosis that you just never know how it is going to turn out. \n\nDo you have yearly clinic visits? Seems like you should just to at least monitor.  Esp during the rapid growth stages of puberty.  If you do not, I would recommend getting an appointment at a children\u2019s hospital with a spina bifida clinic and have your sons records copied and forwarded. No sedation. He was lying in his daddy's tummy We have yearly appointments, this fast growth puberty phase is a concern with the stretching of the cord.

I was diagnosed after I fell off a horse and thought I had broken my tail bone. Turns out I ended up have Spina Bifida Occulta along with scoliosis, I also only have 4 lumbar vertebrae and one of those is a pretty messed up transitional vertebra with an interesting angle that ends up placing a vertebra on my sciatic nerve. Along with these issues I can also easily partially dislocate anyone of my ribs just be coughing or sneezing wrong. I can barely sit in a chair for longer than an hour thanks to all of these things combined I am assuming, which makes going to college and doing any kind of work that requires sitting difficult. I have a doctors appointment next month and am looking for any input on things to look into with my doctor to try and help with the pain. I have thought about trying to qualify for disability but a part of me feels guilty for trying as even though it can be awful at times and I can barley get out of bed, I still have days I feel okay but looking back now I do not think I can remember a day I have not had any kind of back pain.

I could be paralyzed giving birth, but of course that would be worth it.  Life is full of risks and only you can decide which risks you are willing to accept. He did advise against it however. With that said, studies have been done and back and neck injuries are exceedingly rare in this sport.  It is mostly ankles, knees, and arms you have to worry about.\n\nI am very careful of getting stacked or slammed. My partners know not to do takedowns for the most part.

I have had five tethered cord surgeries, assuming that is what you mean by the scar, it is about 4-5 inches long on my lower back. I have got scars all over my spine :( I do too! I have scoliosis as well and have had 15 back surgeries in all, so the entire scar runs down my whole back, so I feel you on that one. I do not think it is anything to be sad about though, scars are cool! :) Yes!! I am not ashamed of them. Because super-heroes have scars \ud83d\ude0e My daughter has a thin scar that goes from the middle of her lower back to the tip of her booty. This scar was very thick and purple/red for her first and second surgeries, but was redone by a plastic surgeon after her third de tether and it is very clean now. There are small, probably 1/4 of an inch, stitch scars going down both sides of the scar and there are two other drain scars, very teeny,   one on the upper right side of the scar and one on the upper left side. She also has a scar on the top of her pubic bone from a bladder surgery.

Imma mess right now cause everything cost money too keep up with my health My original scar is a very thing pale scar that goes from about 3 inches about my but and kind of joins my but crack. I had my tail bone removed so probs why it is so low. I also now have a scar from my belly button down from more resent surgeries and a few little scars dotted across my abdomen 3 inches is 7.62 cm depends on the severity some are lower on the back some are higher. I personally have it at L3 so lowerish on the back (Lumbar region) anyway It looks like a mishapen indent/scar on my back!

It was amazing overall!! Yeah I always do a ab/core workout after every session no matter what but I feel like I could up it a bit but I am not entirely sure if my gym has medicine balls.... may be upstairs I would have to check lol Bulgarian split squats and lunges cool! idk what split squats are but ill look them up I was in crutches as a kid up until high school, I gradually stayed in the wheelchair more and more, as strong as I am I was never really able to stand more than 45 minutes before my legs were jelly, so I stayed in the chair, I feel 18 years of crutches gave me a decent base, I discovered in 5th or 6th grade I could flex my pecs, so pushing a wheelchair has never been difficult for me, and I am stubborn, if I want to go out, more than likely I am going out.  I never really went to a gym, though in middle school and high school when the rest of the class did something they did not think would be safe for me they stuck me in the weight room, I used free weights, a medicine ball, a nautilus machine I believe it is called, where you pull the bar down and one where you do curls or a pulling motion for forearms, by my 20s from crutches, pushing a wheelchair and the little time I had every day in the weight room I maxed out the lat pull down bar, could bench 200 my first try fast forward to 39 before my mom got diagnosed with cancer, I started wheeling a mile up the road to a local park doing 6-8 laps, and wheeling back home for a total of 8 to ten miles, I was doing anywhere from 103 miles to 123 miles a month of just cardio, now I feel bad leaving her home sick while my dad is at work, so I only go on weekends weather permitting at 530 am before the crowd hits and as of yesterday I have done 780 miles of cardio since October, I want to hit 1k by this October. So if you want to bulk up, If you do not use a wheelchair, I suggest at a gym, using the machine, some curls, a row machine would be excellent and the battle ropes if they have them, buy a power twist bar on Ebay, they are like 10 15 bucks, great for your chest and biceps maybe some other parts if you find some specific exercises on YouTube...and eat right which I am still working on, was doing good till shtf.

When my bladder gets full (I can feel when it is full) I get back pain and I am REALLY concerned I am damaging my kidneys Go to the ER. NOW. Your kidneys may be failing. Mmmmm I do not think so..... the pain goes away when I pee so. This has happened before I am seeing my urologist Thursday (unrelated but I will bring it up) Just need to cath more often. If you can get more regulated and try to go before it is full the pain should not be there. Waiting until it is full every time can definitely cause some damage. \ud83d\ude33 ok thanks.... well I am definitely bringing this up then. I know this is what I asked for but I am a HUGE hypochondriac. It sounds like it could be some kind of cystitis. Mention it to your urologist next time you get a check up. I will bring it up then I only say that because I had similar symptoms a decade or so ago and blew it off and ended up with kidney failure. The drs did not realize it because I had no painful urination and my urine did not test positive for nitrates. It went on for months until my organs were shutting down and they finally did an ultrasound and I had hydronephrosis and sepsis and started seizing. Could be a slew of other things I am sure, but the post took be back to that and the way I felt like \"it is probably nothing serious\". Was it constant pain like it did not go away or did it come and go? Either way I am seeing my urologist for ironically a urodynamics test (unrelated to the pain) but good circumstances I guess I just wanted to throw this out there for awareness.  Know the signs for bladder cancer. I am(39F) with SB. Diagnosed with bladder cancer less than a year ago. Likely due to catherization and UTI's my whole life. For me, it was back pain, constant leaking, bladder pain and blood in my urine. Bladder cancer!!! \ud83d\ude33 that causes it!? I am 15 but oh god I hope it is not that! Sorry, I never realized you were so young. I did not mean to scare you. Just want other people with Spina Bifida to know the signs. I have never been told by my doctors there was a chance of getting bladder cancer. But frequent UTI's can make for a recipe for BC. Just talk to your urologist. I have had back pain and flank pain for years, does not necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. Just over your lifetime, if you see blood clots in your urine. Tell your doctor right away. Luckily I have never had blood in my urine but I did have recurrent UTI\u2019s about 2 years ago and I still get them occasionally but I have come to the fact that if I drink enough I do not get them so I go for 64 ounces of water a day. Otherwise I am very healthy I go to the gym 3 times a week I play sled hockey and I am not overweight plus I eat very well so I got a lot going for me. My goal is to keep myself as healthy as I possibly can That is great!!  Keep it up! I never use to drink enough water because I hated having \"accidents\" all the time. I have learned my lesson now. So important to keep our bladder flushed!!  Take care! Oh yes of course those are the worse. I have a urodynamics test tomorrow because my urologist think I have more control then most people (I can feel when I have to pee and can sort of hold it in a way) but she thinks she we could get the results and try some medicines Initially it was intermittent, first couple months. The last week or so it was obvious that something was very wrong, constant pain. Oh well I just got back from my urodynamics test and and the doctor said my bladder neck stayed close the whole time! She also did say my bladder is 75% the size of a normal one as well as my bladder pressure is high but she gave me medication to make that pressure go down.

I cannot seem to get a good thing going here, I am either passing rocks from a lack of laxatives or diarrhea from too many and of course none means I am not going lol. Honestly, I know this is bad for me but I just wait for my body to pull an emergency evacuation once a week or so. I have tried every regimen for laxatives and stool softeners and they always started working exactly when I did not need them to. I have been scheduled for surgery to rig my bowels and bladder to work better but the first time, I was a 19 year old dipshit and ran out of the hospital the day of surgery and the second time, the world decided to have a global freaking pandemic. Damn man you do not want a bowl obstruction Yeah, if my docs do not already have a plan for people like me that pulled out of procedures due to COVID, I am going to talk to them about it in March. I am 28 and tired of dealing with screwed up plumbing lol. Yeah I do not blame you man! Sick of taking a whole day to stay home to take care of business a few times a week. I hork down lots of fruit and fiber, every day, every day, every day - as far back as my memory goes. Dried apricots are my latest enjoyable \"snack\". Prunes, All Bran cereal (anything with super high fiber). Apples, salads, etc. If I do not, shit do not flow. I tried smashing down the most bang for my buck which was the fiber one cereal that was the highest fiber one. The amount I needed to keep it flowing made me feel so full all the time. My guts just felt packed and if I drank water I felt like a water balloon lmao You guys should look into a daily enema routine. It is not a good idea to use \u201ccontrolled constipation\u201d for bowel management, and lack of muscle tone will make the use of laxatives unpleasant.  \n\nLook up cone enemas, peristeen or the MACE, which is a surgical procedure to make a little hole so you can flush water into the colon from the top down. \n\nIf you are on facebook, I highly recommend the group \u201cbowel management for spina Bifida\u201d. MACE was the exact procedure 19-year-old-dipshit me ran out of lol. I spent the whole night before in a hospital room shitting out things I ate for lunch 5 years ago just to tell the doc first thing that I was leaving. On one hand, literally everything was telling me to GTFO but on the other, worst mistake of my life and I kick myself for it on the reg 9 years later. I am so glad you are reconsidering it.  My dd is 12 and getting hers 2/25.  Good luck! :) The problem is that the only doc in my state that can do the MACE is my old pediatric urologist and there is a snowball's chance in Hell of him being able to do it lol. Yeah, there are other alternatives but I am trying my best to not have to wear shit/piss bags the rest of my life, pardon my French. Daily regimen of frozen fruit in bags (red and green grapes, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries) that I prepare monthly into ziploc bags and 1-2 dried mango strips ( that I put into my daily medicine pill box.\n\nThat is what I have found to work for me. I have previously tried daily consumption of plums and metamucil.  Those worked to some degree, but I eventually abandoned them because I got tired of the flavoring. I attempted fiber pills, but found them to be inconsistent.\n\nI have also heard that drinking water is important, but I have yet to build a good discipline around this. I used to force in just bran and it can get tiring. Now it is a handful of raisons, some shredded wheat biscuits (with cinnamon and sugar), and half a bowl of bran. After +50 years of that pre-shit, I had to mix it up or I would stray. Also an apple with lunch and the aforementioned dried fruit before bed. \nIt does not leave a lot of room for non-fiber food but pain is a good motivator, at least in my case and circumstances. Ugh I wish I could just blast mag citrate every day Ya, water is a big one. I am better when working from home, otherwise it easy to get distracted. That and lots of drinking means lots of opportunity for leaking. Likewise. I just saw a friend who has their apple 2 watch connected to a smart water bottle that lights up to remind him to take a drink. I might have to look into something similar. ditto the enemas. i had no idea just how constipated i was until they did an x-ray and showed me. until then i was 24 years old and still having regular accidents. i started doing cone enemas daily or every other day and it is made all the difference I would be interested in enemas, I am just afraid of some kind of bowel perforation since I cannot feel anything in there. The most I have done myself is suppositories and that is just cause they are soft. that is a fair concern. i think the cone enema tips are a little gentler than the regular enemas that you see in stores. i do not have any sensation and just have to feel around for what i am doing and use a lot of lube, but i can feel some pressure so if something were to rupture i think i would have a little bit of a heads up So you can rock an enema every day and there is no consequences to that if you do it correctly? i have been doing it daily or every other day (sometimes i will skip two day if i am lazy lol) for 3, almost 4 years  with no consequences (fingers crossed!)i would talk to your doctor about it if you can. i am sure there is risk, and it is been enough years i should probably check in with my own doctor, but other things i tried just were not working for me i would say too for my experience, not to be dramatic, but it is been life changing. i had grown so accustomed to being afraid for having accidents. especially since most of the time i would not know i would had them. and i was so used to being bloated and uncomfortable. i was either constipated or having pebbles or never being able to empty completely it is really helped me to feel so much more comfortable in my body in a way that i did not know was possible! \n\ni think for me the biggest risk that a doctor said to me once is that the skin between the rectum and vagina could tear. i am not sure how safe it is for long term cone enema use with that risk but again i should probably check in with a doc about it. Interesting that really makes me want to try it cause fuck am I so full of shit all the time (literally) lmfao I swear it interferes with fully inflating my lungs lol that is so real! and long term constipation comes with its own set of risks, so even if it gives you some temporary relief in between another solution. my insurance does not cover them under DME so i have to pay out of pocket like $60. i was told to use a new one every month but i am bad and stretch it out longer and clean the tip with antibacterial soap after every use Fresh water enemas. been doing it for over 60 years. Controllable and predictable. Probably not the best thing for my colon, but it enabled me to have a career. Nothing else ever worked. Laxatives suck, I reccomend doing enimas (sorry i this comes off as rude in any way, i dont mean it to, im just not good with words)", "My best friends had a sweet baby that was diagnosed with SB.

Kudos to the films' creators too for finding a treasure trove of historic footage -- amazing to see. I do think that if it had won, more people would be encouraged to see it. There is always a big post awards push by the producers to have their films seen.  I was glad to see the folks that were invited to the party.

I am 20 weeks pregnant and recently found out that my baby has Spina bifida. It was definitely a tough pill to swallow but now that I have fully accepted the fact, I am choosing to move forward and do what is best for my baby. I was offered to do the open prenatal fetal surgery. My baby does have hydrocephalus and bc his brain ventricles are so big, dr. said they he still may need a shunt with or without the surgery. However, I am still contemplating doing the surgery to help improve his chances of walking and to possibly reverse the Chiari malformation. They also told me that baby most likely will need a catheter. This freaked me out the most bc i have no idea how I am going to do that for my baby. I have talked to all the doctors and specialists but I just wanted to get some perspective from real people who actually live with it.\n\n1) if you have Chiari, how does it affect your day to day life?\n\n2) do you have a shunt and have you had any problems with it? \n\n3) do you use a catheter and how is that experience? Does it hurt? Did it hurt as a little kid?\n\nThanks to anyone who takes the time out to respond. Hi. I am also the parent of a child with SB. This sub is not very active so you may not get any responses. If you are on Facebook,  there are many groups available  to join where the members are very active and open to questions. It was super helpful to me when i got my sons diagnosis. I can answer tour questions for my 3 yo though.\n\n1. His chiari malformation does not effect his day to day life. He is asymptomatic so its never been an issue thus far. \n\n2.  He has hydrocephalus so he does have a shunt that was placed one day after birth. Since then he has had two shunt malfunctions that required surgery (both before his first birthday). Other than the rare malfunctions (a clog, a twisted tube, etc.) The shunt does not bother him. \n\n\n3. We do intermittent catheterization 4-5 times a day so it does not stay in. We insert the catheter during a diaper change drain the urine from the bladder, then remove it once empty. The process usually takes less than 5 minutes since we drain directly into a diaper. We started doing this when he was a baby so we are all used to it by now. He has told us that it does not hurt at all. \n\nI hope i was able to help. Stay strong. Feel free to message me with more questions if you like. \n\nP.s. there is also an FB group specifically for parents that have done the fetal surgery and they are super helpful as well. 1. I have no insight into this.\n2. My daughter received her shunt at 2 years old, she is going on 14 now with no issues so far. \n3. My daughter did not start cathing until she was 6 years old. She had a mitrofanoff and M.A.C.E. procedure done. It does not hurt her and only takes a few seconds to cath for urine. As for flushing her bowels, that takes considerably longer but it is not something you would plan to do outside of the home. Hello! I am a 21 year old woman with SB. I live a pretty normal life as my SB impacted the lower part of my spine. However, I do self catheterize 4-6 times a day. I had spine surgery at the age of 2, where they inserted a metal plate into my back, and as I grew this plate grew with me. Growing up I had bowel issues, and would sometimes have accidents, But as I got older I was able to learn and get better at controlling this to the point this never happens. I am currently in college with a 3.5 GPA in the sciences, and if you looked at me you wouldnt even be able to realize I have this condition. If you have any other questions, feel free to pm me :) &gt;Hi all. I am 20 weeks pregnant and recently found out that my baby has Spina bifida. It was definitely a tough pill to swallow but now that I have fully accepted the fact, I am choosing to move forward and do what is best for my baby. I was offered to do the open prenatal fetal surgery. My baby does have hydrocephalus and bc his brain ventricles are so big at 15 mm, doctor said they he still may need a shunt with or without the surgery. However, I am still contemplating doing the surgery to help improve his chances of walking and to possibly reverse the Chiari malformation. They also told me that baby most likely will need a catheter. This freaked me out the most bc i have no idea how I am going to do that for my baby. I have talked to all the doctors and specialists but I just wanted to get some perspective from real people who actually live with it. His myelomeningocele is at L5\n&gt;\n&gt;1) if you have Chiari, how does it affect your day to day life?\n&gt;\n&gt;2) do you have a shunt and have you had any problems with it? \n&gt;\n&gt;3) do you use a catheter and how is that experience? Does it hurt? Did it hurt as a little kid?\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks to anyone who takes the time out to respond.\n\n\n\nHi, I am a 30+ yo male born with mylomeningecel at the L5 S1 location. My Spina Bifida is very mild and I largely pass as an adult without disability. To start with your questions:\n\n1) I have a mild Chiari Malformation. It did not affect me much as far as I can tell. Only sign I ever had it was some neck stiffness and head pain prior to my tethered cord surgery as a teen.\n\n2) I have never had a shunt. Only mild hydrocephalus that never caused me issues.\n\n3) I have catheterized 4-5 a day since 7ish. It definitely was a bit scary as a child. Granted I know most children want to stay in diapers no matter what. Lol. But once my nurse and parents showed me how to do it a couple times it became no big deal. The \"pain\" of the first times are really more just fear of the unknown of putting something into your body in an un natural way. Now I do not even think about it. It is just going to the bathroom. Absolutely no pain. Just wanted to say hi because it sounds like we have some similarities in our experience. Congratulations on the 3.5!!! That is what I managed to pull off too! \n\nCool to hear about other Stealth SB people in the sciences! I have Spina Bifida (28F). Mine has mostly effected the lower body so no Chiari and no shunt - but I had my left foot amputated because it did not develop properly and I have issues with kidney/bladder and have used intermittent catheterisation since I was 6 years old.\n\nCatheterisation was quite literally a lifesaver for me. Without it, my system was not able to work properly (even though it seemed that I was able to use the bathroom normally) and one of my kidneys was irreparably damaged before they realised that I was not emptying properly. It ended up being removed and my remaining kidney operates at ~90% efficiency. I am just saying this because I have seen parents who try and insist that their child is fine and does not need catheters and the doctor is overreacting - I guarantee a doctor will not advise catheterisation if it is not necessary.\n\n I am completely used to it, no pain or anything and the technology has steadily improved. One of the types of catheters I have is literally the size of my lipstick and not noticeable at all. What you need to be careful of are UTIs - they are inevitably more common when you catheterise. You need to learn the signs to make sure you catch them before they reach the kidney. Keeping up with water intake is also vital and cranberry tablets also help. \n\nAlso, I do not know what country you are from, but catheters can get expensive (the lipstick size one I mentioned cost $5AUD per catheter, which is why I save them for going out not for the everyday!) It could be worth looking into what funding options you have available in your country so you are not overwhelmed later down the track.\n\nAlso I will say that none of this has ever slowed me down. I lived overseas for 3 years, I have travelled and visited over 30 countries, I have a Masters degree in Education and I work for the government in education after nabbing a spot in an extremely competitive graduate program. Spina Bifida will not stop your child from living a full and happy life \ud83d\ude0a 1. I have a Chiari malformation and it did not start giving me an issue until my mid-20s when I started having neck pain. Before that, I honestly did not know I had it cause my docs never really brought it up.\n\n2. I do have a shunt. Again, it did not start giving me issues until I was well into adulthood, when I had to have it replaced.\n\n3. I do use a catheter but my situation may be different because I do not use an indwelling catheter. I am going to sound like a broken record but again, no issues until I was well into adulthood and the repeated motions of inserting and removing the catheter multiple times a day caused false passageways in my urethra.

At L5 I really think the positives win out and you should get the surgery done. Just my two cents, not that you need anyone else making your decision for you.

If you have specific questions about the surgery or the results, you should check it out. I could get you some contact info if you want it. Hi all, 37M with Spina Biffida and a essential catheter user.\n\nMy spina bifida does not have many visible symptoms apart from a slight kink to my lumbar.\nMy main issues growing up were lack of feeling in the backs of my legs (I have got a dwindled calf), and insides below my waist including bladder control.\n\nAs a result I have to use catheters. The type I use are intermittent, meaning I insert one each and every time I need to pee (as opposed to a permanent one).\nSo I have inserted and withdrawn a catheter approx 8 times a day, for the past 30 years, so I would say I am a bit of an old hand at it lol.\n\nFor the first week or so of using one it will feel weird, uncomforable, and downright sore until you figure out the angles that feel the best, but trust me, before long it will not feel like a chore and you will sail through the process on muscle memory.\n\nI can do it in the dark, laying down (camping in a tiny tent), and even while drunk (to the alarm of the other guys using the urinal in the pub!).\n\nAnything I can help with just give me a shout.", "Parenting: Expectations and Reality                 I am a graduate student from Memphis, Tennessee studying how alternative healthcare models offer distinct approaches to people who are pregnant with a child who has been diagnosed with Spina Bifida or for mothers and their partners who have been pregnant with and given birth to a child with Spina Bifida.

The last time I had a shunt replacement was when I was a baby so I do not remember any of my surgeries I have had (not just shunt surgery) but I get a lot of tension headaches or at least I think their tension headaches. So I am wondering what a shunt headache feels like? Is it like a stabbing pain or a tension pain? Etc just want to know just in case Any sort of headaches should be discussed with your neurosurgeon for assessment. Everyone can exhibit symptoms differently, so it is best to talk to the doctor that knows you. I have not had one since I was a kid but I clearly remember a throbbing pain. It was severe. But yes if you get headaches frequently you should get them checked out. Honestly it is just stress they go away when I get away from the trigger I think it is probably just stress to be honest I only get them when I am anxious just wanted to be able to tell a difference just in case shunt headaches often come with other neurological symptoms eg confusion, sleepiness or blurred/double vision Oh alright then! Then there is no way I had a shunt problem lol as that was 10 hours ago with no symptoms other than the headache and I am still alive Glad to hear you are still alive! as others have said it might be worth seeing a doctor if the headaches continue I did about a year ago my doctors just said it is anxiety (I worry about everything) It is going to feel like a headache that will not let up. It may not get worse but it will be a constant pain. It also will not go away with OTC medicine like ibuprofen.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that a headache on its own without other symptoms is likely just a tension headache. However, if you are having a headache that will not let up coupled with sluggishness/tiredness, nausea, blurry vision, or major bodily fatigue, go to the hospital. Nope just the tension! For me it is mostly tension on the opposite side of my shunt and it feels...great! I often get it after waking up!

Im not even 30, i just cant deal with the idea that my physical peak has come and gone because of the condition. I use intermittent catheters so I do not know personally but do you have a urologist you can talk to? I think it would be fine to play sports but I am not sure about water sports because of the possibility of UTIs.  \nI did a quick google and it seems like it is fine to do it, you just have to be careful to keep everything clean and there are even special products you can use like a smaller bag so it will not be easily seen if you wear a bathing suit. I do not know if you can if you leave it in all day but intermittent yes I also use intermittent, so if it is those then absolutely! Get the ones in the small packaging with sealed water for when you are out and about.\nIf you have a indwelling then you are running the risk of popping your bag if you fall. If you empty it right before you go you will probably be alright. You are also running the risk of leakages and overflows if you are not careful too and get carried away. Obviously you consume more water when you are doing sports so that bag will fill faster! You can get the bags with buttons so you can detach the bag and plug it, however you are running the risk of a potential accident since your bladder would not be able to hold much. That is my knowledge but you are better off speaking to a professional! Hi there,\n\nWhat type of sport will you be playing? Swimming might be okay but risk viral exposure. Surfing my big concern is the impact of waves. Other contact sport will have similar issues. I have played soccer with friends with one in and it was not comfortable, but it works. Whatever i can do that wont put me at serious risk.Im favouring water sports because of my location and the fact that my feeling on my feet is not good (Ive lost a toe from carelessly ignoring a foot wound that subsequently got infected., no more road running for me)\n\nIf i could sumamrize my interests it would be rowing, swimming, surfing ect. anything that wont rip my catheter out or cause impatc wounds on my foot soles Hey!\n\nSorry for the delay! From these, I would suggest rowing is the best option. That is because the motion would limit the movement of the catheter. I would wear long pants if you can to limit thee impact of the water and mitigate infection. Practice the movement slowly at first to see whether it works for you. Hi, that is good to hear. I should addd that i have a rowing mahcine at home and that ive been using the machine since before i got the thing installed. Now its justa  matter of finding a team in my area that takes adults.

We are worried about in utero surgery because with a lesion this high and large if she were to be one of the babies born super early they said her condition could actually get worse.

I am \"technologically-challenged\".....anyway, I am struggling with \"patient portals\", as I am seen at different hospitals (all with their own separate portal) for different conditions.  I am struggling to keep straight all of my different portals, and the log-in information/passwords for each one, particularly because I seem to have to \"create a new password\" every damn time I log in(!!!).  Hell, at this point, I am not even entirely sure - with the exception of one of them which seems to work flawlessly every time, to remember what my (up-to-date) log-in information/passwords really even are anymore, because I have changed them so much.\n\nAny suggestions on how to rectify this issue?  \n\n\\*\\*\\*Note: For the record, I am currently using not only one, but a combination of TWO \"password managers\" to store this information on (as one allows me to store some of the information on it, but not all of them, and vice-versa), and yet I am still struggling terribly. I also have this issue.  I have not found a way to combine access though.  I literally keep a spreadsheet on my computer and have individual spiral notebooks and folders for each dr/hospital.  When I am hospitalized, my husband has been able to bring those folders and notebooks to get info to whomever is treating me.  I mentally lose function sometimes with the infections.  Asking me my rx history and dosages is useless. dammit, that is exactly what I expected someone(s) to say.  I do not know why this shit has to be so complicated....and it completely \"screws over\" those of us that are unorganized (thanks to my disability, lol - oh, the irony) It sounds like a password manager would be useful for you, but I would namely trust one partnered with antivirus software or from a company that uses secure login credentials, encryption, protects customer data, does not permanently store your password, and does not have a history of data breaches.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, it would also be a good idea to have a physical password journal or logbook that you keep hidden from prying eyes.\n\nIf a company has ever had a data leak with one of your accounts through an email, you can look that up ( and make note of the compromised account to change the password.\n\nI believe healthcare providers also have to notify you if your data has ever been compromised, but even the most complicated password cannot protect against a breach. It is best to frequently change passwords and not use the same one too often, but at the same time, this makes logging in difficult to manage. I would generally not save a password to a device that could be lost or stolen, or used by a family member or friend, even if trusted. Password managers themselves should have a secure password only you know.\n\n( offers a free and secure encrypted email, though I do not think that I have ever had a data breach through Outlook either, but have with Gmail and Yahoo accounts.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: I see that you already are using password managers. I would migrate over my passwords to the most secure one, and if neither are secure, get one that uses encryption like Norton, and then generate new passwords for those accounts. Writing them down will only get you so far if you frequently change them, but it would be a good idea to log password edits by the day they are changed so that you always know which is most recent. There are also handheld electronic password vaults, but I do not know how long the battery is good for, and you would not want to lose something important like that which could be left somewhere, damaged, or stolen. Always have a backup or an alternate way to login. I already KNOW this is a stupid question, but: are there any that use encryption (like Norton) that are 100% free?\n\nI am on a fixed income because my disabilities (compounded with a severe lack of knowledge and experience) have essentially rendered me \"un-hire-able\" by even McDonalds - (although they turned me down because I was - and I quote: \"OVERqualified\".  What a load of crap.)  Anyway, the point is, I cannot afford to even pay for a password manager, that is how limited my budget is. Browsers will manage your passwords for you. Firefox or Chrome will do it for just about any site. Firefox is the winner in my opinion, and they are much more up on privacy than google. \n\nAn app/extension option you can use is LastPass. LastPass is more secure than the others, because you have to remember your one super secret password, but you are done for if you forget that password, so make it a good one. \n\nLet me know if you need any more help with any of that. 1) in my experience, browsers do not remember passwords and log-in names for Medical websites and things of that ilk (I could be wrong, and feel free to correct me) out of privacy - like HIPAA laws and such.\n\n2) LastPass (one of the things I currently use, along with DashLane) seems to only be accessible with certain websites, same thing with DashLane.

In my city, Portland OR, USA, they have a Spina Bifida clinic that people can go to once per year for checkups, and there is probably setups like that around the world.  I went once and it did not seem very helpful though. I do not use a catheter, and know I am very lucky, and in the minority. Hi.\n\nThere is not any adult clinics in my area, Denver, CO, just trying to find a primary care doc that can understand my situation a bit.\n\nI also was born with hydrocephalus, and found out (about 15 years ago) that the tubing for my VP shunt migrated to my abdomen, and at that time, docs felt like it would be worse to go in and fish it out then just leave it in there. Oh geez, that sounds rough.\n\nFor the adult clinic part, the place here in Portland is actually, technically for children but they also see adult patients because spina bifida is a very specialized condition.  If there is a children's spina bifida clinic in Denver, it might be something similar.  Anyway, I did not love it, so I am not necessarily recommending it, but some people might find it useful. Yeah... I have contacted Colorado Children's Hospital about it.... no go.... and do not think I would benefit too much from a clinic either, anyways. Well that is good.  I was going to give you some awareness into my situation. I was diagnosed with bladder cancer two years ago. I had to have my bladder removed 5 months ago and I have a urostomy now. It is very likely I developed cancer from catheterizing and frequent UTI's.  In all my years, I have not found many family doctors that are familiar with SB. Best thing to do is to try to build a relationship with your doctor and make sure you get referrals (urology, neurology etc.)  SB clinics for adults are basically non-existent here in Canada. I was followed in an awesome clinic until I was 18.  Since then I have struggled to get the care I have needed.  My back and legs are constantly in pain. Although now that I am no longer working, the pain is not near as bad.  Unfortunately you will need to advocate for yourself and educate whatever doctor you have about your unique disability.  That is what I have experienced anyway. I move around a lot so that does not help when you have to keep changing physicians. My left foot is fucked up too. I had a couple surgeries on it.  My ankle bone was cracked (purposely) and bolted together so that it does not turn in as much. Still kind of flops but it is a bit better. The joints of my big toe are fused together because I kept tripping. My toe would fold in under and not come back up. It is happening to the other toes on the foot now. But that is something that just started these last couple years. \nSo I do not want to put any fear in you but be aware of the signs of bladder cancer. If you see any blood at all in your urine, tell your doctor immediately. It is the first sign. I was treated for a UTI and I went back to my doctor because I knew something was not right.  Make sure you get a cystoscopy,  demand it if you have to. So where we are, we are lucky enough to have an excellent pediatric clinic for my son nearby. \n\nBUT we have also got a good working relationship with his pcp, and he is basically let us know that he will do his best to the best of his ability, and then make sure he defers us to the best specialists he can, and send referrals and insurance paperwork to make sure those visits get covered.\n\n(For instance, the clinic we see does not currently have an ortho, so any time we need to see ours we can count on a pretty painless referral from our primary.)\n\nUnfortunately I know (or have heard) that maintaining that kind of clinic care is hard to come by as adulthood happens.  Our clinic maintains care to 25, and then after that it is a matter of finding the individual specialties you need. Oh dang, that is rough.  I am sorry you have had to experience all that.\n\nI have heard from someone else with SB on this subreddit that they had to get screws in their ankle.  My ankle keeps turning in at random times while walking.  I am surprised I have not sprained it yet.  Fingers crossed that it does not progress.  Thanks for sharing your experience. I live in the Denver area too.  Finding primary care can be hard.  I am 65 now.  When I was a kid, my mom took me to Colorado University Hospital for their twice yearly spina bifida clinic. I would see urologists, neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, and many students -  all in a one day marathon.  This was how my parents could afford care.  Now days I try to stay with a primary care doctor even if we disagree, and try to help them go in the direction I need to go.  I like my urologist, and the orthopedics are just a lost cause at this stage. I do wish doctors are given more training for adults with spina bifida. I agree with you... Mind if I pm you?", "Any tattoo experiences? Hello beautiful people, my best friend has SB and uses a wheelchair. We would like to get matching tattoos but I am not sure what to expect or ask of the studio. The tattoos I have done in the past have been lying down a high bed/surface, which would not be suitable for my friend. I was thinking it could be done in a wheelchair but the location of the tattoo might make that tricky. \n\nObviously I will have to contact a few studios and see what they can do but I would love to know if I should request specific things to make it easier for her. Any tattoo experiences here and tips for her? i got spina bifida and am tatted up lolz idk how much info i can give tho i got all my tats in prison im sleeved out lolz Mines just on my leg so cannot help too much No, I do not.  Not a needle fan... I am right there with you not a fan of needles, so I am a collector of motivational bracelets bracelets. Hahaah my friend is the same! She laughs about it because she is had so many needles throughout her life but is still a bit scared of them! But I think her desire for a tattoo outweighs the fear at the moment Ahahaa love that!

(I purposely get thick tough shoes but that does not help either lol)", "How to make enema when traveling easier? So I am in Florida for the week and of course my enema needs to be done. Usually I use a stool and a table to help make the process easier. The problem is I cannot bring a table or stool on a plane so that is out of the question. I have been doing it while traveling for years but I am at a breaking point in super frustrated with it and there just has to be a better way! With that being said any ideas? It obviously will not help you immediately but look up ACE Malone. Talk to your urologist about it. Literally a life changer. The worst mistake I ever made was booking myself for the ACE procedure when I was 19, spending the night before in the hospital with a NG tube in me and going through all that shit, only to have a feeling that something was going to go wrong so I told my doctor I was going home. Basically a decade later, I am still kicking myself for it. And I do not know if I can do it now because the only doctor in my state that can do it is my old pediatric urologist. Yeah I know what it is but I do not really like the idea of having a hole in my stomach I can easily walk so it is not a mobility thing it is more of a lack of equipment thing so I have to improvise. You literally cannot tell that something is even there. Especially if you have a belly button that goes in. I was scared about that as well. Not sure if it is allowed for privacy reasons of other patients but maybe ask your urologist for pictures of the hole of other patients without their names or something like that?\n\nI can easily walk as well. I went on a 4 mile hike today. Not sure what that has to do with making a bowel movement easier to do with minimal equipment that can fit in a discreet sports type water bottle.\n\nYou said you were frustrated and I was just mentioning what works really really well for me. I have done it when camping even. I am not sure what you use the tables etc for, but we have used the suitcase stand with a suitcase on it topped with pillows before.  (My kid could lean on it or use it to prop her tablet.). We have used hangers on the shower curtain rod to hold solution bags.  I have improvised a baby medicine syringe as a catheter syringe.  Sometimes you just have to think like MacGuyver (not sure if you are old enough to understand that reference.  Lol).  \n\nAlso wanted to chime in about the MACE.  I/we felt the same that we did not want a surgical solution when my kid was fully ambulatory etc.  HOWEVER, when her enema routine stopped being effective we decided to go ahead with it.  And it has been the best decision ever.  She 100% agrees.  Idk what will happen if she ever gets pregnant or when she is 60 but for right now, it is the bomb and totally worth those unknowns. I asked around in my online SB groups and people were very happy to share what their mace stomas looked like. Yeah I appreciate the suggestion definitely I think I just need to talk to my urologist and go from there! Thanks for the help though Using wire hangers on the upper bathroom door hinges to hold the bag worked well for me when I traveled. Use 2 hangers if you need it to hang lower. I always used plain fresh water, and did not mix anything. My child used peristeen. Very effective and didnt require a table etc", "Motivation ", "Our new baby boy, Theo ", "Question about the disability. ", "What should I do? Possible Slit Ventricle? Need Advice Hello everyone!

Long story short, I was supposed to have lived in a vegetative state but I am quite the opposite and from the outside I look normal except for the fact I have had 7 surgeries. I use a catheter to urinate every 2 to 3 hours through a hole in my lower abdomen (sort of) after having mitrofanoff surgery a couple of years ago.  Well, I have had a sexual life but in my opinion I dont think it is normal. I do not ejaculate normal semen I would say but rather liquid. I also do not last erect for a long time and I ejaculate rather quickly. Anyone else with some input about their secxual life? Thank you. About three months ago I did undergo a surgery that could partially restore absent penile sensation. No idea if it is relevant for you but if it is I might be able to give some information but that could help to last longer IIRC, one of the studies I read did mention sonething about it.\n\nApart from that I do not have much more, I cannot say much about ejaculate, that is something you might want to ask to someone who knows a little more abou that. Can you post more of the details of the surgery (name of procedure, where you got it, how it works)? I know some people who would want to more about it for themselves. Sure. It is called the TOMAX procedure, in order to bring back penile sensation the groin nerve is used as a neural bypass. They do that by connecting it to the nerves of the penis. Because of how the brain works it will initially still interpret the signal coming from the penis as if it comes from the groin but by touching your penis while looking at it the brain can be \"rewired\" to recognize where the signal comes from.\n\n(\n\nI got it by making an appointment with the specialist who came up with the method but asking an urologist about can also get an appointment with a specialist. Im the same, iva asked mu urologist and he says its basically down to the catheter sometimes pressing against the prostate, the \"wierd semen\" is the fact that the bladder does not constrict proeprly so it cant give the \"jet effect\" it normally does", "Mild spina bifida Just wondering a family member has a 1 year old who has spina bifida, she is walking now so I am presuming it is a mild case. Just wondering will she be able to walk normally? Will she grow to full height? Her dad is introverted so I do not want to ask him about it unless he brings it up My daughter is 9 and walks, runs, jumps and climbs like any other kid. So you would not even know she had it? Does it affect her at all? Yes she has bladder and bowel paralysis and needs help using the bathroom. But if you do not know she has it you would not know anything is wrong Must be hard on you and her. That is a lot better than what I was expecting to hear, thank you It is hard on her yes, but she is also one of the happiest children I have ever known. Her zest for life is incomparable. We expected a wheelchair bound child so when she began walking we were thrilled Bless her soul she is a little miracle, you must be so proud of her cannot imagine how scary it is being told your baby has an illness, hugs to you It is actually her bday today just had her party! There are pics of her in my post history that you can see and you cannot tell at all she is disabled Happy birthday to her!! I just checked, she looks like a beautiful happy healthy child, and wow so brave with the snakes, hope she had a great day today Thanks! Sb varies so wildly from person to person so a prediction is impossible to make. My son used to walk but now that he is older and bigger he uses a wheelchair. He is had several surgeries so his legs are likely to be shorter than otherwise expected. He has a brain processing disorder (that is due to the shunt in his brain, so indirectly related to sb) that makes school difficult even though he is a bright kid. This is not uncommon for kids but is also not ubiquitous. Sb is a \u201csnowflake disease\u201d - no two are alike. This is very true. For me I look like every one else as a kid..  with my braces on or off just a mild limp... I was a cub/boy scout camped also work on staff in on the major scout camps for a few Summers...  I just had catheters and diapers , I get around very good.  With my chair or walking. Depends on the type and level I did not get diagnosed with spina bifida until I was 16 (24 now) all I have is some chronic pain and bladder issues.  It is definitely a game of chance. I have spina bifida and I am 6\u20192 and I can run,jump,skip,and walk normally.I have always been told it is a lot about your mentality i was never given a chance to think\u201dyou will never be normal\u201d my parents would not allow that they always said if you doubt yourself you will never be able to do anything in life so I got up and walked granted I did fall at least 5 times a day from the age of 1-10 but now I am 17 and I walk normally. The thing I am trying to get across to you is never let her think she is not able to do it she will always be able to do anything she wants and if you plant that seed of doubt in her head the only thing it can do is grow. While some SB kids do not show any outward differences at all to non SB kids, most deal from some more private issues like bowel/bladder incontinence. But as kids grow, and hit growth spurts, bodies change and conditions can change. Surgeries repeated. One of our drs once told us it is like a roller coaster.

Are they located all over the back, or only at the bottom/lower part? in my case, right above my ass crack and its like 2-3 inches long. its soft. and its very very ill-advised to press hard on it or to hit it. There is only one scar, where the spinal cord protruded at birth.  \nYes I agree it getting touched too hard sends a feeling throughout my body like I hit my funny bone and it radiated out. My scar is there too and also very sensitive. has it leaked fluid too? \n\nthese things are ticking timebombs. i though theyd CLOSE up the hole at birth. they DIDNT. they just cover it with a bit off fat tissue....which causes problems, i promise you. im in my late 30s. Its only around the lesion, mine is around 4 inches long just above the top of the pelvis.  Its not particularly sensitive but if i sweat (easily done with a black wheelchair back in summer) it gets itchy. Really? I am in my 40s and I never had a problem that I can recall. You should probably get that checked out if it is leaking. This is not normal. Please get that checked. Mines is above my ass about 3/4 inches long, it almost looks like part of my but crack! Iv n er had any issues with it at all and it is totaly numb so cannot feel if somthing was to touch or hit it. \nIv got other scars from surgeries that Iv needed due to issues caused by my sb but the one on my back is what I would refer to as my sb car that has happened only twice, with no big issues to follow, it was like a blister and then waterlike fluid came out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit dawned only afterwards on me, that that might well have been spinal fluid....but well. never happened again so far. \n\nthat said, again: you have a hole that is barely covered with fatty tissue there. please be careful, people, or ask your docs if they can re-do that surgery. i think, it will not be a big act. My original scar was smallish, in the crack to create an anus-hole, which did not exist at birth. Born 1962, operation done at LA Children's Hospital. No leakage from a fistula but my anus does not close well. However, at 7 I developed a fatty tumor and the scar became much larger. It is now just below my belt-line going horizontal for 2-3\" and then down the butt crack along the original scar to the anus.

Hi,\n\nI am 23 years old living with Spina Bifida (MMC). I have ALWAYS been overweight, the only time I was not overweight and actually in good weight was when I had my scoliosis surgery 4 years ago. \n\nHowever, I liked how I looked then and would like to ask you if it is possible to lose weight by just changing the diet and maintain a healthy lifestyle?  \n\n\nI have done some google searches myself and some says that it is possible but when the diet is withdrawn the weight gain begins again. I would like to ask this community if you have the same struggle or had the same struggle and have you solved it? Do you have kidney problems? If not I would recommend keto! I have L3 myelomenengocele and went ok keto after I was morbidly obese and I lost 50+ pounds in 8 months! I would look it up you would be suprised with what you can eat! (I am 15 now I lost the weight when I was 12) what I am saying is if a 12 year old can do keto and do it for 3 years anyone can. As for exercise I would say it depends on your mobility level I can walk but with braces so I can do almost everything a normal person can do. If your stuck in a wheel chair I would say obviously focus on upper body! I ask about the kidney problems because keto can cause kidney stones (very unlikely as long as you stay hydrated). Lastly the most important aspect of weight loss is a calorie deficit. Keto helps get the weight off fast the deficit is what gets the weight off. So your first step is finding a calculator that will calculate how many calories you burn a day and eat under those calories (200-300) under you will lose a pound a week. You do not necessarily need to do keto to lose weight at all but this is what worked and what got me results the fastest but of course everyone is different! Hope this helps and sorry it is so long This is a really tough question because we all manage our bodies a little differently.  I am a 41 year old Mom of two.  Although I am able to walk, my balance and endurance has never been close to normal.  Before my kids, I did alot of videos at home and made sure to get some cardio in.  Once I had the kids...that has been a whole different ballgame.  My infections, stones and spina bifida have all generally become amplified.  Due to so many surgeries, the herias, scar tissue buildup along with just general gravity have all worked against me.  Anyway, I decided that if I gained too much wait and lost mobility at the rate I was on track to, my weight would become not only a health burden but a burden to whomever would be assisting to care for me.  10 years ago I had a lap-band placed.  It helped me really become aware of what I was eating.  I also made sure to contact a local personal trainer who had a weekly gig at rehab centers and senior homes.  He was very able to create some modified programs for me that take into consideration my limitations.  I feel like no one solution will fit everyone.  Alot if my friends are really into cycling (sol cycle) but I hated it the few times I tried.  Swimming...hated it.  Diets...well I will say....it really depends on if you have a bowel routine to take into consideration.  Trust me...fiber is your friend.  Too much protein is complicated for the kidneys and bowel situation.  Talk to your doctor.  Talk to a physical therapist. I do not recommend keto stuff is garbage.... It is just a paid researchers funded by meat and sugar industry. There has never has been a diet with meat that can reverse cardiovascular disease or kill cancer. Best and fastest way is smart vegan choices. I have done them all these diets nothing compares to fasting a vegan diet.

And this happened to me once before but I have not had it on 2 or so years but to this day I have no clue what that was? So any thoughts? It could have just been a coincidence, if it only happened the one time I do not think there is really any need to worry about it. It happend twice (once before it) but I have not had it in like 2 years so I was just curious That is happened to me a few times - if you have a shunt, I would get it checked ASAP! it is shunt-related? interesting I had a period of 3 weeks 2 years ago where I had pretty bad pain in my neck and head where the shunt was placed but my Dr said everything was fine and it just disappeared a few days later and I have not had it since. It would make sense that this shunt may be shutting down though as I have had it for 16 years but I have felt completely fine for 2+ years so I am 52 now, had my original shunt put in in 1969 when I was 7 weeks old. I had no issues at all until I was 12 (1981) &amp; literally OUTGREW it/ran out of tube in my belly due to my height. That one just randomly wore out &amp; had to be replaced in 1992 (I was 23). That is when they put my current one in, a whopping 29 years ago!\n\nBut back to your original concern - my neurosurgeon growing up always told me that SOMETIMES a small piece of scar tissue can slough off &amp; pass through the tube, cause shunt problems/pain anywhere from a few seconds to a few weeks, and if it passes on its own, not to worry about it. That is probably what is going on the scar tissue. I was told my my neurosurgeon that sometimes you can just outgrow hydrocephalus to begin with and there is a chance my shunt is not working anymore because it is been 16 years since my last replacement but I highly doubt that is what going on I pretty sure it is still working Yea there was a doctor when I was about 14 tell my mom that he wanted to take my shunt out, for no reason, and \"keep an eye on me\"... that was the last time we ever saw that idiot LOL That does not sound to safe \ud83d\ude02 I go to CHOP one of the best hospitals in the US and they said nothing about taking it out and honestly I would rather have it in even if it is not working", "Hey amazing peeps, I am looking for some information on meningocele Spina Bifida, any resources would be great, thank you!  Meningocele means there is a hole in the the meninges   (Membrane converting the spinal cord) but no nerve involvement (the myelo portion of myelomeningocele).  What resources are you looking for? \n\nTypically a true meningocele would be considered \u201cless severe\u201d than myelo type. However if this is a prenatal diagnosis, do not hold your breath, especially if it. was given by anyone other than a neurosurgeon.  Any nerve involvement is too small to see on an ultrasound. And mfms and other fetal specialists many many times have no idea what they are talking about.  \n\nA true meningocele would probably mean a surgery at birth to close the back and then monitoring during their life to make sure no symptoms are popping out.  But a lot of times once a neurosurgeon gets in there to do the repair, they find some nerve involvement, or a subsequent MRI does.  \n\nMy child was initially diagnosed as \u201clipomeningocele\u201d which is meningocele with a lump of fat, but no nerves.  Once they got in to do the surgery it changed to lipomyelomeningocele. There is a lot of info on it if you google it. I have meylomeningeocele. The Spina bifida association has a lot of info also. Thank you for letting me know, I am looking for a reputable source to see what the prognosis for meningocele is. I have found a plethora of articles on the \u2018myelo\u2019 type, although that is not really what I am looking for. The reason you probably cannot find much is that in the scheme of things, true meningocele is rare.  And true meningoceles just require an initial repair at birth and there are likely no other problems during the persons life, because no nerves have been impacted.  So there is nothing to report.  But if even one teeny tiny nerve is broken or out of place, then you have myelo. I do not know how helpful this will be, but here is what Seattle Children's Hospital has on myelomeningocele: (\n\nHere is a report on meningocele: \n\nMy son was born with a tethered spinal cord and sinus tract leading to his spine. At first they thought he had a meningocele, but it ended up being a myelomeningocele. He had spinal surgery when he was 4 days old, with 12 neural surgeons working on him. Nothing showed up in any prenatal testing.\n\nHe has no measurable neural issues. At 11 years old, he is running around and doing all the usual kid stuff.\n\nHe was part of a spina bifida study at Seattle Children's, which they used to send us yearly reports on. I think his was an unusually positive outcome, but from I could tell, each result was unique. I think there are different factors that can affect the prognosis for meningocele as well, based on the report I linked to. Start with the SBAA website. Incredible!!!

It is invasive and, I think well-intentioned, but not appropriate for a mother to do to her child.  \n\nFor me and others especially at that age, we find it very difficult to be with other people who have our disability or something similar.  We are already nightmarishly self-aware and then we are also perceiving others as others perceive us and it is not always a good cocktail for confidence.  \n\nIt would be like if your mother tried to make you hang out with only other parents who also had disabled kids.  Weird. A little off. Not a good idea. That is good information to know. \n\nMost of the time he is the only kid with a wheelchair. He also has crushes on able bodied girls. It would be awesome if he does end up with the girl of his dreams. I guess I think he would have more luck if his pool was bigger.

Maybe I think about them and hope they find love too. They are also paralyzed from the waist down. He is actually stoked when he sees others in wheelchairs. He tries to engage with them but most of the time they do not respond back in the same way. Maybe it is because of perception like you said. \n\nAside from his cousins, all his friends are able bodied. If there were other kids at school who had spina bifida I know he would search them out and try to be friends with them. He goes out of his way to be friends with another kid at school with down's syndrome. In our area we had an event where kids from the whole state with wheelchairs met at a skate park and he thought it was awesome. I have ADHD. It is not some big bad disease or disability haha.

I am a bit of a \"late bloomer\" in that I have been mobile my whole life but have had to start wearing AFOs in the last 5-years. It was surprising to me how emotional it was for me to stop wearing the shoes I loved! So I am always looking for brand recommendations on shoes that fit AFOs well. I have mostly worn Dr. Comfort, Hush Puppies, and New Balance. What I really miss wearing is tall boots so if anyone has any good shoe recommendations for those I would be very grateful.\n\nShout out to my first pair of Dr. Comfort sandals\\~\n\n Check out Propet. &gt;Propet\n\nThank you, I will! Asics is a good brand May I ask why you wear the AFO's?  I have also always worn normal shoes, but it is becoming increasingly difficult in the last few years for some reason.  My left foot is very curved, making it slightly shorter in length than my right, and I have hammer toes on it.  I have been trying to get new shoes but every pair I try makes the callouses worse or the skin actually starts to come off.  I also cannot feel in my feet, so I do not know until much later that something is wrong. I only wear shoes from the shops even though I have got AFOs! It is quite the search to find those because the length and width have to be right but it works! The shoes that work the best are adidas and sometimes Nike! that is kind of where i was at when i started to wear AFOs. i have always had hammertoes and struggled with my feet turning in as well as had neuropathy. i sprained my left ankle one year and the doctor recommended an AFO to prevent myself from injuring it worse in the future. then i got a callous on my right foot that turned into a wound, but because of the neurpathy i never realized how deep the wound was. i did physical therapy and wound management with an AFO for 5 years until i finally just had surgery that is taken the last 2 years and a few surgeries but i finally am wound free on my right foot. i will be getting an AFO for that foot as well now to provide support. Wow, I feel like I just looked into a crystal ball of my future.  I also have neuropathy and my left foot turns in frequently.  I am amazed I have not sprained it yet, but keep waiting for the day it happens.  A few years ago when the callouses started building, I had a big one on my left foot that concealed a lot of damage underneath, but I did not feel it because of the neuropathy.  It took a bit to heal from that, but nothing as intense as you described with the surgeries and PT.  Still, I am thinking that will be me soon enough in life if I do not start using proper footwear.\n\nI try shoes from random stores and nothing seems to work.  I did get inserts from a podiatrist before, but they felt insanely awkward after a week or so of walking in them.  I know I should have gone back for more help, but I am so used to being disappointed with Spina Bifida related treatments, that I just flung my hands in the air and went back to regular shoes.  \n\n\nIt sounds like you are liking the Dr. Comfort shoes, so I will have to check those out. My only word of caution would be to put off surgery as long as you can or to really shop around for a good foot surgeon if you do go that route. My first surgery was botched and it is taken 2 years for me to get back on my feet. I know it can be daunting but I would use my experience as a cautionary tale to encourage you. I ended up with MRSA in one of my wounds and had part of the bone amputated. \n\nYeah I really like Dr. Comfort! They are a bit pricey, but they have lasted me 5 years. I probably could have taken better care of them, the leather is pretty worn, but otherwise they are in great shape. Thanks for the info!  Sorry you had to go through that mess Hello! I have not tried them yet, but I discovered Billy Footwear today! The shoes all unzip, and they have wide sizes as well. Hoping they will work with my AFOs!! I am a teen girl and absolutely love shoes lol. So I have tried many different ones for all of my AFOs. So far what has worked for me best are DC and the Adidas Originals. These shoes are naturally a little bit wide and also come in many colors for both men and women. My AFOs that I have now are carbon fiber and can even fit in Vans, but my AFOs are a bit thinner than the ones that you have but they could possibly work for yours too! I can usually get any shoes over my braces if I get a size above the size I am supposed to be ex.

For me, it is the mental health issues that can stem from having Spina Bifida. Ironically, the mental health issues are much harder than any physical symptom. Through therapy, I have recently discovered that I have *several* issues that all stem from being confined to a wheelchair. Now that brings up another question. Why phrase it as \u201cconfined to a wheelchair\u201d? That is the trauma I am working through talking. I am working on rewording how I talk, to myself above all. That is good!

My 11-year-old with Spina bifida has a MACE (Malone antegrade colonic enema  for 5 years It has Always caused distress. Cramps, nausea, sometimes vomiting. We have tried varying intervals daily, every other day, we have tried fleets biscoydal before flushing with tapwater/MiraLAX combo. We use about 300 to 400 mL for the flushing part we have experimented with various temperatures.  His procedure takes two hours every night.  Nothing we have tried has made it any better. \nIt is affecting our child\u2019s quality of life in a big way: Depression, anxiety, hopelessness. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. MACE was the easy half of having a Mitrofanoff done at the same time for our son. Many Mit revisions. We did fine with Miralax. Is there anything orally that can be taken? Miralax? How about position while on the toilet/voiding?  Lean back a little? I remember a nurse mentioning warm water and mild soap.

I know bowel management is super tricky. Thank you! I did read some lower messages  and came across that face group I am waiting for approval to join. Thank you so much for responding 31 year old that has had a MACE since my teen years. It took maybe a year or so to get rid of the severe issues you are talking about and I still have some of the minor ones to this day. I will try to list different things I have done to learn how my body handles it\n1. diet- the cleaner you eat the easier your system can process things\n2. Dietary supplement/stool softener- I do not really take a softener, but I take a men's multivitamin/dietary supplement that eases things up a bit\n3. The amount of water. I have always done 500mL. I do not know how big your son is or what his system can handle, but anything below 500 does not feel like its flushing enough out for me which makes me to cramp up something nasty\n4. Time of day- this one is overlooked a lot. My program is the easiest BEFORE night time. If you do it having gone a full day without using the bathroom it is putting too much strain on your body from the back up which can cause the nausea. \n5. Postioninig on the toilet- I have found using a foot stool so my knees are up and i can lean my chest over them makes things flow easier. If things start to feel stuck i just gently rock bakc and forth while rubbing the left side of my stomach or where i feel the cramp. Usually the whole thing takes less than an hour if I am consistent with it. I do it about 4 times a week. Hope some of that helps. That is very helpful. We have never tried the stool softener or dietary supplement with fiber I think that might be a good idea. We have one of those squatty potty\u2019s but our kiddo is so short their feet do not actually reach it. We need to build something. Thank you very much for your help Do you think doing it every Day is better than every other day? They hate it so much that we have tried to space it out and I have not really noticed that it is worse when we space it out symptom wise. It sounds like from what you are describing in item four that if you get too backed up it makes it significantly worse I do not think I can answer that for you. It is just how your son's body works. When I first got the surgery I was doing it every day for a year on the surgeon's recommendation. After a while, my body got used to a routine of every other day and now I can even skip multiple days if things are flowing well without it. I think whatever you try you have to be consistent with it for a few months regardless of how much he is struggling. As a biffer, our bodies are weird and sometimes our systems take longer to adjust to things. I would pick a time, preferably before the last meal of the day, and stick to that schedule for a bit to see how it goes. Remember, the MACE is not a total flush out on the first go. The GI tract is long and you are putting in the water below the highest point so the strain is coming from the bloat of expanding what is above the entry point. If you are full while doing it, it will always hurt. I hope this helps! I am so sorry your son is struggling with this. I am now 65, but I remember the emotional challenges at his age.  I never have had the MACE surgery, but have used fresh water enemas every other day for my whole life. I always had the best results early in the morning, after the evening meal is well processed, and before breakfast.

I have L3 and a shunt I have been noticing my memory getting worse as well I have had pain around my shunt for about a year but besides those 2 things I feel good. My doctors do not seem concerned I\u2018m not suggesting to get a new one Jesus xD I was mainly asking that because then I can relate to that problem! Your memory loss might come from too much pressure on your brain due to the shunt not deriving enough neural fluid! That can be fixed by an implant behind your ear! It is basically an addition to the shunt to regulate the pressure and amount of fluid being derived from your head! Oh hey, I am chill lol. Sorry did not mean to sound like I was yelling at you, just explaining. All good buddy xD This is interesting since i also am struggling with visual memory. Ive been teaching msyelf coding and its become ridiculously difficult to remember the simplest things. My head is becoming like a sieve It is important to eat right so your stomach can digest food in correct lt. Example if you eat stuff with gluten it will block your b vitamins because there are such things as anti nutrition. The stomach is the second brain has more nero transporters then cats brain. So if you block then b vitaswith gluten you will not get to your brain to work correctly to send anything correctly to the body. \n\nLook up leaky gut syndrome hope this help", "Shoulder Press  def would be a good idea to slow down your reps and you could even do fewer reps to get better results if you were going slower. what weight were you lifting here?

I was born with a sacral dimple, i thought for my whole life that it was the standard because i never had any problems with it. When i was about 10 my mom and i were talking about the circumstances of my birth and stuff (she had a risky  pregnancy and i was born prematurely), and she mentioned that the doctors \"found a sacral dimple\", when i was born, which made me realize that it was not normal (she didnt mention any further tests or diagnoses done for it, but she said i could have surgery on it. I live in a developing country so the condition must be really rare even to doctors). Again, never found problems with it (other than slight discomfort sometimes and the inconvenience of having to clean it out of lint and other stuff) so i did not think much about it. \n\nAnyways, today i decided to look up on it, just because, and i found that in some cases, a sacral dimple is a sign of sbo, so i decided to read symptoms and stuff because i like that sorta stuff. Suddenly, my whole life makes a whole more sense. \n\nWhen i was 6 months old, i had a really bad uti or some sort of disease doctors believed i would have to get a kidney transplant or surgery on that, and i remember looking around when i was younger and finding an x-ray of my bladder from around that time. \n\nI have scoliosis and bunions (i am not sure if the bunions are a part of sbo, but since they are an orthopedic deformity i am guessing they can be). When i was 13, i started having back pain/contractures? that literally left me breathless. Honestly doctors did not pay much attention to it, told me to just take NSAIDs, and i started having milder, more chronic back pains when i was 16, and after practically begging my doctor made me take an x-ray and diagnosed me with scoliosis. \n\nWhen I was 7 i was diagnosed with ADHD. I also was (and still am) really bad at maths. My reading was not so bad at the time, it definitely became worse over the years, although it may be because i am not receiving treatment anymore. Nowadays it is really  hard for me to read and understand large chunks of text, and sometimes i mix up words and letters, even though i am not dyslexic. \n\nAlso, i have always had sensory issues, from processing audios to being touched/tickled, textures, sounds and some smells. \n\nHonestly, i am speechless. I do not have problems with it that require me to get diagnosed/tested, so i am not really worried or anything, i am shocked and slightly amazed. Also, it can either be sbo or just be a coincidence and i am not sure which one would be more weird/amazing, and as i browse this subreddit, i feel more identified. Just felt the need to share this. Maybe some of you all who have confirmed sb/sbo can give me your insight on my signs/symptoms of something.", "Can you get pregnant with SB?

Maybe it sounds selfish, but this is how it is.\n\nP.S. sorry for such a hard question. not since leaving those awkward teenage years where being physically different feels utterly catastrophic. \n\non a side note, the notion of non-existence being a form of relief is strange to me. being in a state of non-existence is not comparably better to existing because if you do not exist then there is no mind to even perceive relief. i feel the same about suicide too. and even then, so long as you do exist things have the capacity to change for the better, be it your own health or advances in health care or even just your mindset. the big drawback of non-existence is that its pretty permanent. It really hurts my heart to see that you feel this way. I cant imagine that the world would be a better place without people like you and my son who also has SB. I was given the option but never in a million years would I have done it. You mean something. I know it is tough right now but I have hope that your life will get better. Stay strong. You are loved.

His was lack of folic acid", "Antegrade colonic enema (ACE) I have spina bifida myelomeningocele and in April 2019 I underwent an ACE-surgey. Since then, I now empty my bowels by flushing them every night. I was wondering if anyone here has any experience on ACE? How has it been working for you if you have it? Most of the time mine works really well, but some days it takes forever for the flow to start which makes me feel sick until it starts emptying. And sometimes I keep leaking and feeling bloated for the rest of the evening which has had a major impact on my social life.\n\nI am grateful for any advice. Thank you. My daughter, who is 11, had the ACE surgery a few years ago. It has taken some time to get it to some degree of consistency and even then it is not always consistent.\n\nBUT, overall it is so much better than before. Before the ACE, we tried the peristeen which was horrible, she cried almost every night when doing it.\n\nBefore the persiteen, there was really nothing except the occasional Miralax and, if I remember correctly, daily Benefiber. Nothing kept anything consistent so she was going throughout the day.\n\nNow, with the ACE, she flushes every night and sits there for an hour. We use 29 ml glycerin mixed with saline- enough to get in a 60 ml syringe. Put that in, wait 5-10 minutes, then flush with about 300 ml saline. We have upped these amount lately because we are finding she is getting blocked up more often. Mind you she is 11, so your values would obviously be different and maybe completely different depending on what your Dr. has prescribed. After her ACE she always wears a pull-up. 90% of the time it is fine and no leaking, but sometimes she does, so we have put a pull-up on. During the day, she wears regular underwear. \n\nAbout every 4-6 weeks, she seems to get constipated so we do what we call a small clean-out. This is the same amount of glycerin but about 400-500 ml of saline with 4-5 capfuls of Miralax twice a day for several days.\n\nWe home school her so this is easy for us. I do not know your age or school/employment status so I am not sure how this would work for you. And I do not know what she/we will do when she does get older. But, I am just letting you know this is what we do that seems to working for us. It is not perfect by any means. There are tonnnnnnnnns of people with the ACE/MACE.  Find the \u201cBowel Management for Spina Bifida\u201d Facebook group.  Lots and lots of experience and knowledge there.  Also, how old are you?  Where did you have your ACE done?  See if your facility or somewhere nearby has a bowel bootcamp.  Here you will have an intensive week of personalized treatment to get your solution and technique just right for you.  Cincinnati childrens has one and luries in Chicago has one and there are others out there as well.  Eventually you should get to the point where you do not need any laxative and have no \u201caccidents\u201d.  I am glad you reached out, my friend.  Keep asking questions.    Thank you so much for your responses! I believe they will be very helpful in my search for better working bowel management.\n\nTo answer the questions you had - I am 22 years old and have had this enema only since I was about to turn 21. I am a student so I have lectures during the day, so I flush in the afternoon/evening. And I live in Finland so the surgery was done here. I have had mine since fifth grade (I am 20 now) and it is always worked super well for me. I have not experienced leakage, but I definitely have experience with it not flowing right away. Im not sure what your exact setup is, but I would say that when you insert the tube and turn on the flow, push the tube in and out until you find that sweet spot where the liquid starts flowing. I am not sure why, but there is always a certain length of the tube that I have to put in before it starts flowing, I would recommend just gently fiddling with it until it starts if you are able to. Hi! I was having a similar issue for several years, then switched form using a glycerin/water mix (which also caused me extreme pain/spasms/nausea every single time) to using saline in a gravity feeding bag!

Hello! \nI am not sure if this is the right place to post or not, but any resources you could possibly share would be amazing. Or point me in the best direction and I will move on. \n\nMy father was born with spina bifida and was able to be surgically corrected by the age of 5. (This was in the 70s) I was born in the 90s and was told growing up that I needed to be careful when having kids because \u201cno one knew\u201d what my chances were to pass it along to my children. \n\nI recently found out I am pregnant. And I have been trying to do research with my husband, who was adopted and does not have a medical history, and I am having a hard time finding any research on the children of those with SB having kids. In truth, I did not think I could have children for other reasons, so this has been a bit of a ride. \n\nI want to put out there that should baby be born with SB that is not going to change our desire and want for baby, I just want to have all the information I can to provide the best care for baby before and after birth. I have spent days googling and reading but nothing is quite what I am looking for, as it tends to pertain to parents who have children with SB but not children of parents with it - having kids. \n\nResources, personal stories, advice, anything, is gratefully accepted. Thank you! Hi there! I am not a professional or anything, but am currently pregnant with my third child after my second was born with SB.\n\nFirst of all, let me just commiserate with you about the lack of information. It is freaking mind blowing that something impacting so many people has so few resources available.\n\nSecond of all, here is what we did to try and be sure we had a happy, healthy baby.\n\n1. Make your OB visit as soon as possible. When you are there make sure you discuss the family history, and tell them you want to speak with a geneticist if you can. There are several blood tests you can get while you are pregnant that can help diagnose much earlier than even an ultrasound scan could. (One of these is a fetal DNA scan, where they can look for any genetic indicators in baby\u2019s DNA, and another looks for the protein given off by exposed nerve endings.)\n\n2. Take LOTS of folic acid! It is in most prenatal vitamins, but you want to take even more than that. Depending on how far along you are, baby\u2019s spine might already be developed, but everything helps and it never hurts.\n\n3. Ask for more frequent scans to measure baby\u2019s head and spine, and check for heart concerns. This will also likely show clubbing in the feet, which can be a really early indication for SB. (The clubbing in his left foot during an ultrasound and signs of hydrocephalus were our first clues with my son.)\n\n4. Start discussing with your husband how the two of you may want to handle it if your child does have spina bifida.  I know you mentioned your dad having it, but a lot has changed since then (for the better!) \n\nI am not sure where you are, but I know in the United states at least that doing spinal closure while baby is still in utero has had incredible results in a lot of cases.\n\nI hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any questions! Thank you for the reply! As soon as we got the positive pregnancy test I started taking the Folic acid. I just hope I was able to get it in me soon enough. \n\nI am in the US, but new to the state so they do not have a lot of my history. I have tried conveying it over the phone that it is important I see someone asap, but I do not think they took it seriously. I have 16 days till my next appointment at this point. I have only been \u201cconfirmed\u201d as pregnant. \n\nHaving so many \u201cwhat ifs\u201d between the two of us, it is kind of daunting. But thank you for this information. I did not know about the added blood test and scans and will be sure to push for them. Hi there. 38M born with Spina Bifida. My wife and I are currently in the midst of IVF, and made sure that we did all the genetic testing we could with the embryos that looked good.\n\nI know a natural pregnancy is different, though I agree with the genetic testing that is available. Thank you for commenting! \nI know there is a lot of controversy over genetic testing. So hearing that you agree with it for SB does help put me at ease. This whole post I have been worried about how I might sound. I totally get you... and if we have a child with SB, we would love them, advocate for them, and do whatever we have to for them...\n\nthough, even as someone with a mild form of SB... I would not want to put my child through the ridicule, and stress that I have faced in my life. Well truthfully, even the early scans and blood tests cannot be done until a little later on. Even knowing my history and being able to fully plan in advance, I was not able to get my first scan until I was 10 weeks along, and it was only to get the earliest measurements of her brain.\n\nThe dna testing was done at 14 weeks, and the protein test can be done after 15. This week I will have my 20 week scan at both my regular ob as well as the high-risk clinic to get in-depth measurements. \n\nSince everything has been healthy up to this point, if we get good responses and healthy measurements at these scans, I will be able to move on with the rest of the pregnancy like everything is healthy. So it does carry in the male line? Ive never met anyone that can confirm this In my family it does, but that does not have to be the case. I am unsure if it is dominant or recessive gene, I just know that environment plays a factor in it as well (the folic acid point)", "What is the longest you have gone without a UTI...? Any tips on how to avoid them? I hate them I have SB as well. I have had a kidney transplant close to 20 years ago. I also self catheterize. My biggest advice is to make sure you are emptying your bladder regularly. The longer the urine sits in your bladder the longer it has to grow bacteria. You may want to talk to your urologist about being put on a preventative antibiotic that you can take over a long period of time\nOr put on something like Hiprex which acidifies the urine. It is harder for bacteria to grow in an acidic environment. Yes, cranberry juice helps but only to an extent. Water intake and emptying your bladder regularly, good general hygiene are the keys to avoiding UTI\u2019s. 2.5 years and counting- longest stint I think I have ever managed. About a year in my GP called me and I thought the streak was done but she wanted to tell me that the urine result that came back was the best she would ever seen from me and she was just super impressed \ud83d\ude02\n\nI was already doing Hiprex and cranberry tablets, main 2 things that changed: I started taking a low-strength antibiotic (when I started it was daily, after ~6months 3\u00d7 a week, since the beginning of this year it is been 2\u00d7 a week); instead of taking ditropan to regulate pressure I have been getting botox treatment every 6 months.\n\nI am not sure what made the biggest difference - I am too terrified to even remove the hiprex or cranberry in case it is just all working together but man it is made a gigantic difference not having to do a full antibiotic cycle multiple times a year, I have even found that my gut is getting healthier. 13 years old. Only had one when I was too young to remember. I do not know how long, I know it is a few years. But only one tip: 1) DO NOT wash+reuse catheters My GP told me that sometimes people who Cath just have 'cultured urine' and she only prescribes antibiotic if it is symptomatic, and we also try pyridium first. Pyridium was my best friend when I first started cathing.", "Anterolisthesis Anyone ever develop A anterolisthesis from having so many surgeries? I had my last cord release a little over a year ago and was doing pretty good until this summer when symptoms hit harder than ever. I had to quit my job and start delivering food cause I can sit down and I basically can only do stuff for a short time before my legs get weak and my back hurts. This isnt how my tethered cord has ever presented itself and they recently found I have a 12mm listhesis on l5-s1. Has anyone had these symptoms from a listhesis and is it correctable? I can still be pretty physically active like I can still run 2 miles straight, my back just starts to hurt and my feet get number and start to fold inwards. If I sit/lay down and ice it for a few hours it starts to come back and within a few days it goes back to where it was. So strange.", "Spina Bifida Occulta DAE DAE have the occulta version, with pain? I have it, and have had pain on and off in my lower back since I was 16 (now 34). I am just wondering if anyone else has had it, and had treatment for the pain? What was your experience?\n\n  \nI get pain in my lower back that feels mostly like someone is gripping my spine and twisting with both hands. I also have a vertebrae that is turned down and there is not cartilage in between to cushion. It is aggravated by not being in shape and then trying to do physical activity, but sometimes it happens with no rhyme or reason. I do not know if the pain is to do with the Occulta or the turned down vertebrae. I have read that 1 in 1000 with SBO have actual symptoms, so I am wondering how many of the 1's of the 1000 there are! I am also curious if you did have a treatment that was a surgery, what did they do? I am 31 years old also born with spina bifida but I am not in a wheelchair. I do not know a whole lot about spinabifida tbh. I had surgery when I was around 5. I think I got occulta tho. Is that a certain kind of spinabifida or what?? I am still trying to get health insurance. They have denied me twice already I could not believe it \ud83d\ude29 Are u in a wheel chair or use a walker or what?? No, occulta is the most mild form. I walk unassisted. Spina bifida just means your vertebrae did not form correctly when you were in utero, and there are varying degrees of it. Occulta usually means that you just have a malformed vertebrae and no other symptoms (the hole is not big enough for spinal cords to come out), and usually is not detected or diagnosed unless they get an xray or mri for some other reason. I have had back issues since I was 16 so when I got xrays, they saw it. \n\nIf you had surgery from yours at a young age, you probably have one of the other forms (Meningocele/Myelomeningocele) where a fluid filled sac grew outside your body, or the fluid filled sac also contains your spinal cord stuff). Did you get denied because of your spina bifida? Yes. I am 28 &amp; have had back pain as long as I can remember (like middle school gym class, laying on the gym floor to do sit ups or crunches and my back pain was sooo sharp in my lower back )\n\nSaw a chiro around age 25, he did xrays and found Spina Bifida Occulta and Spondylolisthesis at L5-S1, grade 1. \n\nBut I have read that neither should cause pain. But I am in pain. \n\nFrom about midback down the the top of my butt has such terrible palpable pain (meaning, if you poke me gently with your finger anywhere on this area, it  is super sharp). \n\nI also am dealing with chronic stiffness In my lower back, and neck.  And aching pain in my lower back, hips. \nI also have bilateral heel pain which sucks!\n\nCurrently seeing a rheum as a had a positive ANA but so far no other positive antibodies. I relate to a ton of the Ankylosing Spondylitis symptoms but my HLA B27 was negative so he will not consider it. \n\nSorry for the life story (:", "Question For Those With Spina Bifida What do you like? What are your interests? What are your hobbies? I am an adult with Spina Bifida and been in the community for several years now and there is something I have a hard time understanding. Why do not any of you have a hobby or interest? Seriously I try to have a conversation and every reply is \u201cidk\u201d \u201cok\u201d \u201cyea\u201d \u201ccool\u201d and so on. Every question is answered with idk. Why? Why is it so hard for those in the community to like something as simple as a tv show/movie/video game? How are so many people in the community empty shells? I do not get it Cannot speak for the entire community but from personal experience, it could be depression and/or anxiety, lack of social interaction growing up due to bullying or isolation (whether self-caused or just being an outcast), being in a rural area away from all the cool wheelchair sports and activities, having niche interests that you do not want to share cause you will come off as a total dweeb, just a slew of reasons why we are the way we are lol. Your answer is still better than anything I have heard from anyone with SB in seven years I agree with what JCStensland said. But to answer your first couple of questions when I am not working I like watching the New York Yankees on tv and in person, spending time with family, cooking, going for walks, reading, listening to music, and watch documentaries and other things on YouTube. I read a lot, go hiking when the weather is nice on the weekend (or cut my grass in the summer if it is needed instead), I do Spanish lessons online everyday and watch way too much TV! Sorry people usually catch me at a bad time, I am not an adult, but I am a very busy teen. And when I say idk I normally do not becuase up until I joined the community, I was ashhhamed of myself and my dissability, so generally I did not want to know anything about it. I think a lot of those idk responses are probably from young people who just do not have much life experience yet. They may live in rural places without access to a lot of accessible activities or with parents who do not make it a priority to make sure they can get out and do things. As for me, I work full-time and have a second job on the side, so I do not have a ton of free time, but when I do, I love to travel, read, do jigsaw pluzzles, play board games, and go to concerts. They are not from young people. They are from people ages 25 and up. Very interesting. I have only met one other teen with SB. The people with SB I have met either have been children or adults. No in between Chess. Going to museums. Classic films. Bird watching. Board games. Jigsaw puzzles. Collaging. Tweeting about baseball history. All sorts of things. Oh, I have met one adult and one person who at the time was a kid one year older than me who both had it This still live? Yes i work 50 hours a week and do not really watch tv or have time to go to the movies. i like to paint if I have some spare time. That is great I do not have SB but my 17 year old son does. He is a Boy Scout working towards his Eagle. He is in his high school's film club and he makes his own stop motion animated shorts. He even has a youtube channel. He loves Marvel and Godzilla movies and will talk and argue about them ad nauseam. He told me just the other day that he wants to be employed in film making one day. He is not on reddit but he is all over Instagram and snapchat. He is involved with way more stuff than I ever was. 13M. When I am not wrapped up in school or physical therapy, I like doing sled hockey on weekends and hanging out with my best friend. I am also a boy scout. It are not much of a hobby, but I am also really into gaming as it is a HUGE social neutral zone. I can tell you this kid, you are doing so much more than adults with SB I have met Thank you. I appreciate that. You are welcome. I am an adult with Spina Bifida and I do my best to encourage others I do not have it by my brother does he is 13 and does rock climbing from time to time ( he is wheelchair bound) That is good. Try not to use the phrase wheelchair bound most people do not like it I am sorry about that It is cool. I had to learn a few things like that when I got involved in the SB community haha I am still learning my brothers on a board he sits on close to the ground and is mowing the lawn.", "Does SB carry in the male line? I understand that it can carry through the female line and that a lack of folic acid has an effect. But i cant find anything conclusive online about whteehr or not males can give it to their kids. Do we know? It is not hereditary as far as I know. I do not believe males have an affect My late aunt and cousin would disagree. It is hereditary, and I seem to remember there were certain odds our son would have it because I have it and my husband does not, and the odds would have been higher if my husband had it. But I cannot tell you what those odds are now, I am sorry. Heres an interesting recent link i found that touches on this topic if anyones interested.\n\n I do not remember anyone having this shit in my family. Everyone is healthy enough. Maybe some grandgrandgrandfather had it but fuck him. And as I know, it is not hereditary, it is just a birth defect. Well I supposedly have it due to my dad's exposure to Agent Orange.

I love him dearly but the amount and the ways in which my life has changed is not something I would choose again. \n\nIf that is not the kind of option you were asking about then I am sorry, I will try to help you with other questions you may have.\n\nCleveland Clinic is your best bet, they are one of the best and most innovative in the country. You will eventually need to see  a developmental pediatrician (they are like the special needs version of your regular pediatrician, you will still need the regular ped but the developmental is the umbrella specialist) neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, gastroenterology, nephrology, physical therapy and very likely neuropsychiatry. I would try to get appointments with them everyone to find out what you need to look out for and at what age you should begin consults with them. The  most urgent of those would be developmental and neurosurgery, so see them at the very least. Orthopedics will be around soon after birth so you will want to see them too if you can but they are not as important. \n\nYou will want to get hooked up with a good social worker that can help with Medicaid and SSI if you need it. Surgery is expensive, so is driving all over and missing work for appointments. \n\nMake sure your current insurance is paid up properly and there are no lurking problems with coverage. We got stuck with a large bill when our son was born due to a one day insurance gap with a new job. Guess what day I went into labor? \n\nThe latest research shows that there is no difference in outcomes for vaginal vs. c/s births. I chose a c/s just to be safe. \n\nI do not really have advice for your wife. Finding this out about my first born put me in a terrible depression for the rest of my pregnancy, watch out for that I suppose. I have no idea how I would have done things differently to prevent it though.\n\nLike I said, my son is 12 now. He is had 17 surgeries, started using a wheelchair most of the time about a year ago. He has some learning difficulties,  a lot of pain and hates that he is disabled. He also has friends and plays wheelchair basketball and is one of the most chill kids I have ever met - he is not phased by much and makes the best out of what he has in front of him.\n\nSpina Bifida sucks, I am sorry to hear to that you have to deal with it. \n Sorry if that is all very blunt. I am in general, I do not think that the rose colored glasses everyone wears when they look at and talk about special needs kids does anyone any good. I am also on my phone so that makes me seem extra short. I am more than happy to answer any more questions you may have, about what you might expect or what my own experience has been. Hi :-) SB Dad here. Daughter #2, now 8mo, with an L4 MMC. Fetal surgery @ Children's Hospital of Philadelphia this past January.\n\nGot To put the kids to bed, but I will be back to write down some thoughts later this evening. \n\nWife says I should point you at the \"Expecting &amp; Considering Fetal Surgery for Spina Bifida\" Facebook group. She is found quite a bit of knowledge and support from the SB-related FB groups, and they are generally more active than this sub :-)\n\nOur hearts are with you. More in a bit. I have a 12 year old son with myelomeningocele t12-l4.  We live in Virginia but have taken him to Cincy for their bowel management clinic and had a great experience with them.  We do not have any other experience with them so hopefully you can get info from others who have more experience with them.  \n\nYou definitely want to meet with a neurosurgeon before your son is born.\n\nThere is a Spina Bifida Parents group on Facebook that would probably be helpful and is much more active than this subreddit. \n\nI am happy to answer questions for you and your wife too. Feel free to pm me. First days/weeks after diagnosis are a real whirlwind. Do not let that get you down. Being a newly-minted parent on top probably also means a few more learning-curves in the advocacy and instinct departments. Trust yourself, trust your gut (and your wife's!)! The M.D.'s might be experts but they are regular old humans too, with all the failings and imperfections that implies. You are the Parent. Ask questions until you are completely satisfied. Do not be afraid to advocate fiercely for your precious family... healthcare can be a maze of dazed paper-pushers.\n\nDo not know much about Cincinnati, but it looks like they have got an established fetal center so they are probably a good place to start. As far as I am aware, the window for Fetal Surgery (FS) closes around 26wks, so I imagine life's going to move quickly for you guys over the next couple weeks, especially if you are interested and candidates... it certainly did for us.\n\nI could go on for quite a while -- My wife and I are more than happy to engage on the subject at length, please feel free to PM! I will try to keep the rest of this short-and-sweet for now.\n\nHospitals/Experts: \nWe cannot speak highly enough about Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or Drs. Adzick, Flake, Heuer and the team they have built at CHOP. They, along with Vanderbilt and UCSF, ran the ( and are *the* pioneers in fetal MMC repair. Having \"shopped around\" a bit now, CHOP has been an experience heads-and-shoulders above every other care provider we have interacted with. Even if you are not pursuing FS, these guys are the place to beat.\n\n( is also pioneering a fetoscopic surgery method. Some of the SB families we have encountered who were not candidates for open FS were candidates for fetoscopic repair.\n\nWhat to expect?:\nRight now: The emotional rollercoaster, an overwhelming amount of information, and big decisions in a short period of time... it is all a normal part of the gig. Relax into the wave and ride it out. Processing it all takes time. You can do this. \n\nOutcomes for SB range wide. There are a ton of factors involved, some of them more observable than others. You will probably hear a lot of \"we will not really know until he gets to that point in early childhood\" generalities and not nearly enough certainties. Hopefully you will hear a lot of guarded optimism during your consultations too. \n\nThere will be complications and substantial disruptions to life, though none of us can predict type or magnitude without a lot of hand-waving. Some are harder to swallow -- especially when it comes to the potential impacts of shunt revision or cord de-tethering. Many of the complications are quite manageable. There are a lot of SB kids/adults/parents out there who are thriving despite the challenges.\n\nYou can expect a permanently more complicated life than whatever your definition of 'normal' might be, but it eventually becomes a new 'normal'. (You can expect some people just will not understand.) You can probably expect health insurance to play an important role in future planning of life and career. \n\nYou can expect specialists and hospital visits to become part of routine life. While you will probably be dealing with a ton of specialists, many of the specialty centers (including, it seems, Cincinnati) now have SB clinics to help manage, coordinate, and navigate multidisciplinary care. \n\nI would advise against expecting that the healthcare industry generally has their stuff together... you are likely to be disappointed.\n\nYou can expect tears and heartbreak... but, then again, I am not convinced that is so much different from plain old parenting. You can also expect the joys of parenting. If you are like any of the SB parents I have met so far this year, you can expect to be a different, stronger, much more coffee-dependent person in 12 months.\n\nFor now, be patient ... especially with yourself and your wife. Give yourselves lots of grace. Get all the information you can. Make the best decision you can make with the information and resources you have. Know that you are not alone.\n Though it is out of state for you, Loma Linda University Medical Center in Southern California is the leading research clinic for Spina Bifida. They saved my life as I was born with myelomeningocele.  I am incredibly grateful for the info.  I have got a blast of other referrals going out all over the country, because my wife has been (initially) disqualified from Cincy based only on a telephone call and her BMI.  \n\nI have gotten very frustrated, because other than BMI, she appears to be a perfect candidate for fetal surgery &amp; correction.  \n\nThe fight begins, I suppose.\n\nOther hospitals I am requesting referrals:  Nasville/Vanderbuilt Children's hospital, Seattle Children's, Neonatal care center in Aurora, CO (Denver), Children's hospital of Philadelphia, Baylor University in Tx.\n\nIt looks like we have got 4 wks to make this happen or \"the window closes.\" I do not mind blunt.  Yours is a real situation and a real perspective.  I appreciate the candor.  Thanks for also opening up about what this means in \"real life.\"  Information is not good or bad... I am just glad to have it. Thank you u/hollerspring for everything above.  That is incredibly detailed and exactly what I was hoping to learn from and gain in this community.\n\nMy wife and I are both fortunate to have flexibility in our current jobs, lives and schedules.  I know everything has challenges; right now, I am just fighting to mitigate them.\n\nI may take you up on the direct info/consult.  I am going to link my wife to this thread and let her read through to get some background and sense of the community that exists. My son is currently seen at Seattle and they have provided the best care of any hospital we have been to. We move around a lot and have been to Boston Children's; Strong Memorial in Rochester, NY; Shriners Hospital in Erie, PA; Pittsburgh Children's and now Seattle. The biggest complaints I have about the place are the cafeteria food and the surgical waiting room. The doctors are amazing though. \n\nI have not heard of Denver and I do not know anything about Baylor's program but I know the other hospitals are top notch. Ted, my wife and I found out about the same time as when you posted here. We have learned a lot and are preparing for our prenatal surgery in Cincinnati in a little more than a week. Our baby has myelomeningocele starting at L2. I am sure you are past the shock at this point and have already decided how to proceed. Give me a holler if you want to talk. I will tell you my experience with growing up with spina bifida...\n\nIn my case it was an L4/L5 (you will understand what this means once speaking with the doctor its basically a part of the spine.)\n\nI am 27 years old and I have a notable gate when I walk. I sway from side to side like a penguin. I wear braces that go from the knee down and used to when I was younger have them go up to my hips.\n\nI have spotty sensation from the waste down. However I live a fairly normal life... I drive/work go to college hang out with friends.\n\nThe doctors told my Mom that I would not walk ever... this turned out to be false as I was able to walk by the age of 3. This of course was in the early 90's/late 80's so little was still known about spina bifida. \n\nAs far as cincinnati I am not sure I grew up in NW Ohio and they had a pretty good set of doctors there at the mylo clinic. Some of the doctors were very good surgeons and did things to make my life much easier.\n\nCincinnati's children's hospital is one of the best in the country so you will be in good hands however. \n\nMy biggest advice to you would be to never tell your child they cannot do something because of their disability. I played baseball and basketball and backyard foot ball as a kid. Your child will find their limitations of what they can and cannot do. This will help them in life more than you can ever remember. I am for sure glad that when my mom was told I would never walk that she ignored the doctors.\n", "Worried I have retethered Hi, I am a 22 year old female who was born with Spina Bifida Occulta. I developed a tethered cord and had the release surgery done at age 7. Before the surgery I had problems with pretty severe urinary and bowel incontinence and leg weakness. \nLately, I found that after periods of activity (even after leisurely walks) I \"leak\" both urine and feces, not a lot, but enough to scare me a little. I am concerned because I have gone over 10 years without any incontinence problems. Has anyone experienced this? I do not know if this is just to be expected in someone who had tethered cord syndrome before or if this is a sign I have tethered again. Any thoughts are welcome. Thank you.  Hey, I too have Occulta and have had life long issues with leakage, front and back; I am 54. I assumed it was just part of the deformity vs. tethering and take steps to avoid. Exercise works the best for me and frequent trips to the bathroom regardless of \"need\". \nI did have a fatty tumor removed at ~8 but nothing changed with my control issues. I do not actually feel the need to \"go\" and cannot void without extreme abdominal clenching.\nI have never heard that surgery would relieve me of my symptoms, that would be life changing. My daughter has myelomeningocele, so I am curious, did you, up until now have the ability to control bladder and bowel? \n\nWe have to do intermittent catheters and we do a bowel program once a day as well in order to keep her socially continent. I realize this is highly likely to effect her this way for the rest of her life, but if there is a possibility, even a small one, of relieving those issues, I would be happy to look into it farther.", "Love and strength to all my SB peeps .

My wife and I have just started a daily straight cath/Ditropan regimen with our  SB son about 3 months ago and he has gotten a UTI every time he is gone swimming (twice) since we started this. Does anyone have any recommendations for preventing these so he can still go swimming? I want to manage and prevent these as best we can so we do not lose out on this activity he loves so much.  Thanks in advance for any help! If I recall correctly, Ditropan is about regulating pressure so it will not necessarily prevent UTIs. You should talk to your doctor about possibly preventatives - I take one low-strength antibiotic tablet 3x a week as a prophylactic and instances of UTIs has reduced dramatically for me since. \n\nOver the counter, you could also try high-strength cranberry tablets (I also take one of these every day). I think the evidence on their effectiveness can be mixed but I have had multiple urologists swear by them. I eat a hand full of dried cranberries every day and that has worked for me. Pediatric urology nurse here: what makes you say he had a UTI? Did he have a fever? What symptoms did he have? If he just had bacteria in his urine but no symptoms, he might just be colonized, which happens commonly in people who catheterize. How many bacteria grew in the culture? Hello, \n\nI am 27F with Spina Bifida so not exactly or even close to the same, but:\n\nI take Ditropan every day to regulate pressures, yes, but it does help prevent UTIs by keeping the bladder happy.   In addition, I take a very low dose antibiotic once a day to prevent UTIs.  Cranberry juice/pills could possibly help and I take those a decent amount.  \n\nAs a nurse also says, it is entirely possible to have bacteria in your bladder and not be sick or have a \"UTI\". In fact, my urine always shows that I have a UTI (because of an appendicovesicostomy procedure). So I only get treatment if I have symptoms which are uncomfortable.  \n\nI also recommend cathing before and after swimming if possible.  \n\nCheers Swimming has nothing to do with UTIs.  It is purely coincidental.  The biggest culprit behind UTIs in SB people is constipation.  Tell us about his bowel routine.  Typically, if a child needs help peeing, they need help pooping too.  It is super super super important that he poops about 5 inches of poop that is 3-4 consistency on the Bristol stool chart every. single. day.  I cannot stress this enough. I have added some links to help you get started.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso you can try adding d-mannose powder to his drinks.

We have insurance through work and have coverage through BlueCross. Coverage plans vary, we have always had surgeries and wheelchairs covered along with cathing and enema supplies but never diapers or gloves. Your income should not influence his ability to receive medical assistance as a disabled child.  I would honestly seek legal help or find a government watchdog organization to help you.  \n\nBut, you should also be able to purchase insurance through the government. :) I am not sure what state you are in but in Michigan, if your child receives SSI benefits then they automatically qualify for Medicaid coverage. Other than that you may have to go for a waiver program. Sorry. I hope this helps. We are in California. I tried to apply for SSI but we were denied because of our income. I agree, but unfortunately Medi-Cal here in California is based on income.  I tried Covered California but again because of our income they wont help. Thank you. I will look into this. When I say that your income should not effect your child, I do not mean that philosophically. I mean literally unless you are applying for food or housing benefits this should not effect your child's eligibility.  \n\nI am not from California, but from what I can tell, you need to apply for Medicare for your kiddo, but do not apply through Covered California. They are focused on income. Medicare is not exclusively about income. \n\nSpeaking from a lot of experience. You usually have to beat your head bloody against a wall to find the way you should have been covered. This usually includes calling the applicable departments until you want to choose violence, calling state representatives, calling senators, and I have even called a governor once or twice. And often it includes calling disability advocacy groups and state watchdogs to threaten them with. \n\nJust get a simple paragraph of info down: my kid is this old and has this major disability. Our income is too high for these programs. How do I get my child covered by disability insurance? \n\nIf they help, great. If they do not, you have to get aggressive. Calm but aggressive.  \"So you are telling me my child would have better Healthcare if he did not have parents? That seems reasonable and legal to you. Because to me that sounds insane. I would like your supervisor please.\" And you pretty much just keep doing that until you get someone competent. \n\nThe level of incompetence and laziness in this system is the stuff of totalitarian novels.  It is practically built to keep you out.  So you have to yell and yell and then yell some more. If you do not wish to do this, then those watchdog and advocacy groups can help. I never looked at that way. We are at the \u201cbeating our heads bloody\u201d stage and we are thinking the same thing. there is now way my son cannot have insurance because we make more than they think we should. im not asking for freebies. all i want is my son to have proper medical without having us go bankrupt. the system is designed to discourage people from having proper coverage and that sucks so much!  thank you for your insight, and like you say, things have to get nasty to get anything done. this healthcare system. 100% Glad to help.

But I am not sure sometimes if it has cum innit because it is white, but I think is pus and other things cause my bladder was reconstructed with part of my intestines.\n\nDo you guys have problems in cumming too? Personally I do not or at least not constantly! It sometimes happens but it is rare! Do you feel orgasms in general?  From this thread I suppose you do not have erectile dysfunction? I do not have erectile dysfunction. The thing is when I organs it does come out nothing Maybe some one at r/disabledsex could help answer some questions too Ohhh thanks man No problem. Hope u find some answers I added more since it is a sex sub. I appreciate it No problem. Feel free to pm me if u want to talk more I will then Hi! Great questions. Presuming you have myelomeningocele? Which I abbreviate with MMC.\n\nSo to start with, let us be clear that \"cumming\" is a short way of talking about a process that has different parts. Some people use it to mean the feeling of orgasm, and some people use it to mean (for men) the process of ejaculation. The two are usually paired up in the most typical male sexual experience, but they do not have to be! They are two physiologically different experiences.\n\n1. **Orgasm** is not a standard experience; there is no one definition of what it means to have an orgasm. It usually has features like increase in breathing rate, increase in heart rate, increase in blood pressure, as well as squeezing contractions (generally found to be powerful and pleasurable) of the pelvic floor muscles and the rectal sphincter  Different areas of the brain light up during orgasm. All this is associated with elevations of oxytocin and prolactin hormones after the orgasm. This is generally the most \"feel good\" part.\n2. **Ejaculation** has two main parts, emission and expulsion. Overall this is not the most \"feel good\" part of cumming, just the part where stuff comes out in whatever form. \n   1. In **emission** (basically preparing a mix of the fluids that will come out), in a typical male setup, the neck of the bladder closes off so no fluids can spill backwards. The prostate gland emits and mixes some extra protective fluids into the spermatozoa (the living bits of sperm) coming from the vas deferens, and those go into the prostatic urethra (the part of the pee tube that runs through the prostate gland). This is only about 20% of the volume of what will come out. After this mix moves through, then the seminal vesicle fluid is added in, which is the last 80% of the fluid volume--most of it! Most of this is controlled by the pelvic plexus of nerves (a lot of lower sacral nerves) and the hypogastric plexus of nerves (more lower lumbar nerves). It works in part because of stimulation of the genitals, which gives your body an input at the sacral spinal level. But it also works at the level of the brain with physical or visual erotic stimulation. That last part may seem complicated, but it is just a way of saying, if you have a lower lumbar or sacral MMC, you lose the input from below the level of your MMC, but the stuff above it is going to be preserved and at least part of the process should work; and even if they are not preserved because your MMC is higher, parts of getting to feel good from orgasm are from brain stimulation alone, so sexual pleasure is still possible (and encouraged!).\n   2. **Expulsion** on the other hand is a coordinated pushing out of this \u201cemission\u201d fluid. For it to come out well, it needs rhythmic and coordinated pelvic movements. But this can all happen even when there is nothing to \u201cemit\u201d \u2014 men who have \u201cdry\u201d ejaculation because of having their prostate out still have those rhythmic contractions of orgasm. So it is a different part of the whole process, the body making rhythmic squeezing to try to get the fluid out.\n\nSo now that I broke those down, let us talk about what you are telling me.\n\n\\- First of all, in folks with spina bifida with MMC in particular, they lose nerve control for sensation and movement from the spot of their MMC on down. That means some of the sensory input (the feeling of sexual stimulation) is not going in, and some of the muscle control and the automatic body control does not go out/happen, or happens much more weakly.\n\n\\- The upshot is that the body is not coordinating things like it usually would, and it may not be giving as strong of a signal to make things happen. That is, it may not be signaling all the parts of **emission** and **expulsion** to work in a coordinated strong way. It may also mean, since not as many genital sensory nerves are joining in the game, you need more visual and non-genital stimulation to routinely get a stronger, more pleasurable orgasm. \n\n\\- Not as much spermatozoa may be going out. The prostate may not make as much fluid. The seminal vesicles may not add as much fluid. So overall the composition of the sperm may be much thicker and stickier and harder to get out.\n\n\\- In addition, since you do not have a bladder neck, and since you have a pouch made from intestine, you are probably producing mucous from your pouch and then there is no way to close off the bladder neck. That means that some of the fluid spills backwards, and it also means there is more gut mucous that lives in your urethra just regularly. That means that some of your sperm when it comes out may look a little like your regular discharge from your penis. It is mucous, though, not pus! Not harmful to anyone.\n\n\\- The expulsion part tends to be weaker in men with MMC because they do not always have full control of the pelvic muscles, and also since some of it is not conscious, that there is not as strong of an unconscious drive for what muscles that are still around to squeeze super hard. \n\n\\- So that means that a thicker, more mucoid fluid is coming out without a lot of force squeezing it, which may mean a trickly slow ejaculation, or for a weaker orgasm pretty much nothing at all.\n\nDoes this kind of give you an idea of why your ejaculation may be a little slow, trickly, or look different than you expected...? Thanks for the time Dr. May we speak in private, I will add more here if anyone else wants to know more. I have mylomenengocele L3 I can cum but it sort of dribbles out in stead of the usual \u201cshoots out\u201d but other than that I have to make sure my bladder is empty because if it is full then I will dribble out like diluted cum mixed with pee but as long as everything checks out then I am good", "How Many Seniors Are Here?

She wants me to take complete charge and I want feedback from her on how things feel so I can repeat them.

There is tons of national organizations geared towards that stuff, so that he will grow up around people like him, and he might not feel alone in his circumstances.) I am late to the party but I just came across this thread but I just want to put in my two cents. \n\nI am a 23 year old with L3/L4 spina bifida (cannot remember what type). The prenatal surgery was not widely available when I was born, so I did not have it. use a wheelchair 99% percent of my life but I am not completely paralyzed. I do not cath but I have to stay on top of bowel and bladder health to avoid accidents and infections. \n\nI also just started my first week of grad school in the medical field with an end goal to help children with spina bifida. I have already have a bachelors (minor in disability studies (: ). I have won two collegiate national championships and state championships in different adaptive sports. I have gone on trips alone and with friends, to festivals, lived alone, with boyfriends, and done every single thing a typical 23 year old has done, and more. \n\nI am not saying this to brag at all, I just want to get it across to never think that your son will not be able to live a happy life. There will be challenges and things will be hard, but if you give him the resources to succeed he will. You sound like a great mom already and I know it will turn out fine. Here are some specific suggestions:\n\n1. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get involved in adaptive sports. Do NOT really on the public school system for this. They likely will not know/will not help. You can google \u201cadaptive sports in \u201d. For disabled people, sports are so much more than just exercise. Personally I think being involved in sports and activity is even more important than for abled bodied people because A. Staying active and healthy will help prevent complications from spina bifida. B. If your son sticks with it, it will provide him opportunities he would not have otherwise. I got a full ride scholarship thru undergrad from wheelchair basketball. 3. It will get him involved in the disability community. This is the most important point. I did not have adaptive sports until I was in high school and let me tell you - it changed my entire life. Kids that he plays sports with will be disabled like him and will not think of him any differently like able bodied kids might. He will have automatic friends - it really is that simple. You need to get him connected to disability culture and community. \n\n2. Give him mental health resources and keep an open relationship where he does not feel ashamed about his disability or any feelings he has about it. It is ok for him to be bitter sometimes but it needs to be managed. \n\n3. Get a ( when he is old enough \n\nYou will do great :) My advice is to fight and keep fighting... it gets very hard... i pray that he may be as blessed as me.. but even in that blessing there are hardships that he will face in life and he will over come them. Always ask questions and dig deeper if you know there is more that can be done. Pitch ideas for things they give little to no help or insight on. Most of all know that it gets better I am in the UK also, 24 and I have been used for medical journals too! Mines fairly severe though. Sorry, I had to comment cause we sound similar!\nAs for OP I am happy to give any advice too and I can tell you, even for the more severe of us, it is not all bad. Just keep up with physical therapy, do it every day, twice a day. My mum doing this for me is the only reason I can walk. I am 24, from the UK, the surgery was not available when I was born, so do it! I wish I could have had it. My mum was told I would never walk or talk, I can do both but I also need a wheelchair for when I am bad. I have kidney failure - however I stabilised out until a doc misdiagnosed sepsis and now I need a teansplant, I have myleomeningesele SB and also Occulta (please excuse bad spelling, Latin is a ball ache)! I have bowel issues that get worse when stressed. I walked late at 2and a half but I spoke at eight months and could have a full conversation by the time I was a year old. I could hold a full conversation with adults by two. So what I lack physically my brain made up for. I catheterise but PLEASE even though it is hard if this is the case for your baby DO NOT pick the bags. They are more expensive but worth it in the long run if you pick intermittent catheters - this means that you can insert the catheter into the urethra and take it out a few mins later and nothing\u2019s attached to the body permanently. Bags are the worst unless your child cannot function. You can always get a bag installed later down the line but please for their sake, bags smell, kids are evil and will bully over them, doctors jump to them far too quickly because they are way cheaper, so exhaust every other option first. The doctors will not understand but it will effect them when they want to have sex or when they want to wear a swimsuit in front of friends. \n\nMy biggest piece of advice is do not coddle them after the age of five (obvs depends on severity of course) but if they can have some chance of normalcy then give it! It is the best thing my parents did for me, they did not let me use my disability as an excuse. Also, do not push them to date other disabled people. A lot of parents of SEN kids like to keep their kids dating other disabled people but do not force this on them. There is nothing wrong with dating ableds and it will help them way more in the future. As for special schools, I do not advocate for them at all for people with SB, unless there is a severe learning disability that comes with it. I just think mainstream is better and prepares us to integrate better and also educate everyone else. It will be harder but it is worth it. \n\n\nI also have nerve damage. I literally had the worst burns you have ever seen on my foot, so severe it was put into a medical journal because they would never seen another burn like it and yet did not feel a thing! So watch for neurological issues too. I have a lipoma, which comes from the meningesele part of the SB, I was born with it sealed, so I still have mine. I have had plastic surgery three times to reduce it, it was not mandatory surgery, I chose it because I got bullied for it from nursery through primary. A child said I looked like a bunny rabbit and I have had issues with it since, body dysmorphia with my disability because I am so paranoid about it. I would say if this was the case for your child at all, PLEASE WAIT until they are an adult till the surgery is done. The first two almost killed me and they did not reduce the size at all, also when I put weight on this is the first place I put it on and the last place I lose it. So I have developed a bit of an ED because I cannot put weight on because of how severe my body dysmorphia is due to the lipoma. It was pointless having anything done until adulthood when it actually worked and kept the size down by half. \n\nPhysio is key, do it constantly even without the physio therapist, twice a day. I promise you, this will help your child walk if there is no paralysis.\n\nTake everything the doctors say with a pinch of salt because with SB they simply cannot guarantee anything! I have proved every doctor wrong that I have ever had. I do not have learning disabilities and I can walk enough to get by, I also drive stick and clutch so my legs work enough for that. \n\nI do suffer with chronic pain, so watch for painkiller addictions. \n\nI live independently, I have fairly normal relationships and I am in university. I have done it a bit later that most but I am doing it. There is hope and there is hope for grandkids one day and everything. To show you how normal my life is, take a look at this video of me:  \n\n\n\nIf you need anything let me know!\n\nIf you are in the UK there is a charity called Shine, this helps majorly. They have got my driving lessons paid for in full, they got my mum a washing machine and a dryer for free too to help get her started when I was born. So find your SB charity in your country and they will help provide things and support. There are some very active groups for SB on Facebook as well! Best of luck to you. My daughter with SB is now 10 months old and doing really well! Well, I am late to the party, apologies. Congrats! I am 41 and have Lipomyelomeningocele Spina Bifida. There was not any pre-natal surgery in the late 70's. I have been lucky, I am largely mobile (currently on crutches but typically walk with a cane). There have always been challenges but all can be overcome with a little vigilance and information. If you are in the US the Spina Bifida Association is an amazing resource and I recommend it. If you have any questions - DM, happy to talk. I went to Nepal last year and walked to Everest Base Camp - anything is possible with a little perseverance. It is nice to find someone of similar age tbh, I am only from a small northern town and have never met anyone else with the condition in daily life, luckily I only had night splints though and get by wearing an insole within my shoe, ace to read your reply though and I hope you are happy and well. May I ask, is it common for people with SB to need wheel chairs assisted walking later in life after having been able to walk in early life?  New mom trying to learn as much as possible. I am 18 and when I was 13 and under I played football every single day of my life. Now I need a wheelchair for stuff like going to the shops and stuff like that. I guess it is different for everyone.

(do i need a nsfw tag here? tw? cw? something? here it is. tw/cw: sex) hey guys. first post on this subreddit. 33/m/FL... obv spina bifida\n\ncan i get some perspectives on how to deal with sex as a person with SB?  (mainly not... having it.) my main concerns is the incontinence, and, frankly, positions that have worked for you, and what i can do to improve stamina and so forth. and maybe how to achieve a sex life? a couple months ago i got out of an 11 month relationship, and now certain aspects of my life has been affected in ways i did not really expect. one of those aspects being sex. i have never had that active a sex life, and a major reason was the incontinence. my last relationship was with a girl with sb as well, but rarely did we ever even have sex. so that did wonders for my confidence, as you can imagine. my confidence level has always been at the bottom of a humongous, narrow valley, and so much of my lack of a sex life is simply not having pursued it. i assumed people would not want anything to do with a guy who has incontinence issues that a partner has to think about.\n\nopinions and perspectives of dudes and ladies equally valued.\n\nthanks. I wish I had some experience to contribute to this post. I hope some folks can respond with their perspective. \n\nI do not have SB, but my daughter does. What I have in common though is that I had no sex life until my late twenties, and still wrestle with confidence issues regarding sex. Even though I am married, I worry a lot about how I do in bed, since I got such a late start and have comparatively little experience. My wife would rather I stop worrying so much. \n\nI have a lot to offer her besides sex - love, support, all of that crucial stuff that is so easy to overlook when you are preoccupied with this one thing. On the whole, our relationship is very solid, while the sex is okay. So I think working on a well-balanced, healthy relationship first can help mitigate the harm that can come from  confidence issues related to sex. \n\nI think what I love most about my wife is the fact that I can be my real, vunlerable self with her. That trust is really the only reason I can ever get up the courage to flirt with her and initiate things. \n\nI hope this is helpful. I do not have incontinence issues, but my daughter does, and still will when she gets older. I do not relish thinking about that part of my daughter's life, but I hope I can help her to learn how to deal with it, and how to weave it into her \"normal.\" i very much appreciate your comments and thoughts :) 32 year old virgin w/ no prospects of losing it in the forseeable future. Have you ever thought about getting a mitrofanoff and cecostomy surgery? i have never heard of any of those things\n\ni will look that up, though! Yeah, those surgeries changed my life.  Never have to worry about incontinence with a woman anymore.  I was born with low lesion SB. I am married and have 2 kids. Because of the location of my lesion I have little to no feeling in my penis (but can get achieve and maintain and erection) or butt, and bowel and bladder issues as well. I self cath. \nSeems like TMI typing it but I just wanted to give you a little perspective of my situation before I go into your question about intimacy. \nI have had more embarrassing situations due to bowel issues than I can count but it can be especially frustrating when it comes to sex. The way I have managed it is by watching what I eat and training my body to have a BM at the same time every day. Try a fiber supplement. Think of foods that give you a hard time and stay away from them. Do not eat too much sugar. Be careful with caffeine. Drink lots of water. And if you anticipate having an intimate encounter eat light and healthy before hand. Also Imodium can be a friend, it clogs me right up.\nAs far as positions, well first off get a \"sex blanket.\" just something you put on your bed in case you have issues. Does not need to be an ugly towel, blankets are washable. Stay away from squatting positions if you are nervous. Put a pillow under her ass and you can get a better angle with less effort. Have her get in the doggy position on the side of the bed and you stand. She can also be on top. Also if you are good with your tongue you have won half the battle.\nThe just of it is something you already know. We live with this. It takes planning and self care for us to have good days and sometimes no matter what we do \"shit happens.\" Casual sex with SB is not something I suggest. Find a loving partner, someone who cares about you and does not care when embarrassing things happen. Sex should be about a connection, physically and emotionally. It is so much more enjoyable with an understanding partner. \nAny other questions I would be glad to give you my perspective, I hope anything I said helps. Take care. thanks for this, gives me stuff to think about.\n\nthank you. 33/F SB Myelomeningocele\n\nMy sex life has been fairly normal.

My wife and I were recently approved for the fetal surgery at UCSF Benioff and are planning on going this coming weekend. Have any of you done this and if you have, any advice or best practices? Are you going for the eval or the actual procedure?  We did the evaluation a little over 4 years ago but did not end up qualifying so we had the post birth procedure at our local hospital instead. Everybody at UCSF was great, though - we felt really good about going through every evaluation and even though we did not qualify I think we would have regretted not giving it a shot. Either way good luck to you. Our youngest daughter has been a blessing for our family. Of course the evaluation is first, I should have mentioned that, apologies. What was the reason for disqualification? The findings on one or two of the tests were a little too positive. To be honest I cannot even remember the exact parameters because it is been a few years and life was a blur during that time. The way they explained it was they target a specific range within expected outcomes. If a child looks like they will be below the desired range they do not do the surgery because even if the procedure helps it will not help enough to be worth the risk. Or if the child looks like they may be above the range, they do not do the surgery because the benefits are not worth the risk of setbacks that may hamper what looks to be a pretty positive outcome. The hard part is nobody can really tell you with any accuracy what you can expect. Sometimes the findings are pretty negative but the child will actually turn out pretty well, or vise versa.  We have met a ton of kids and adults with spina bifida since our daughter was born and in some cases the impairment is significant and in others you cannot even tell the person is not typical. If you can, maybe go out on a date. Go stargazing, or somewhere you can be together. Whether you want to take time to talk through the medical stuff, or distract each other from it, I think it could be really comforting. My wife was very scared, because she felt pretty committed to going through with the surgery if possible. Either way, finding ways to strengthen your relationship will be great. She will be leaning on you a lot, should the fetal surgery be in your future. And, you may or may not be on the same page. \n\nMy wife and I spent a night staring up at a meteor shower around this time, and I think back on that night a lot. I think it helped us sync up emotionally. \n\nFWIW, I am very thankful we did the surgery. Easy for me to say, as the bystander. It was scary, and the recovery, followed by early baby arrival was pretty hard too. My wife is glad she had the surgery. She did well overall, as did our daughter, who was born at 30 weeks. We have been very happy with all of our experiences at UCSF since then (our girl still visits every 3 - 6 months). \n\nI can definitely imagine it may not be the best choice for everyone though. My wife has had some (manageable) digestive issues ever since the surgery (2.5 years ago). \n\nPractical advice: get a notebook. Or a planner with subject dividers. Set up a section for each specialty (neuro, urology, etc. And just take good straightforward notes about what you learn. There is too much to absorb, and if you sit there trying to take it all in, in the moment, you will probably feel pretty overwhelmed. We started just with a spiral bound book for the review/assessment meetings you are going to, and then got a nice organizer to keep track of our daughter's medical history after she was born. It might seem like one more thing to worry about,  but my wife felt so relieved after she started being able to write stuff down at during the many dr. visits.\n\nYou will be okay. Your baby is already lucky to have you two as parents. Day by day, you will get better at being his or her parents, just like you would with a typical kid. I personally found out that I was much stronger than I thought. If you want to chat privately, please feel free to dm me. Also, while you are busy being supportive of your wife, do not forget to look for someone who can be your 'person' -my brother was mine. Our parents helped a lot with our older daughter too. My husband and I are going to our eval for this possible surgery on Monday and Tuesday. Anything that you would care sharing about your experience? I am finding info about the actual qualifications hard to come by and am very anxious about the upcoming visits. Thank you. The staff is very accommodating and nice. We were unfortunately disqualified due to a prior fetal brain hemorrhage that showed up on the fetal MRI. The neurosurgeon did not want to proceed with the surgery.\n\nI can say that after we were disqualified there was a tiny bit of grief, but all in all it turned out to be a blessing. We now have a clear path forward for our daughter. Just be relaxed (as much as you can be) and trust in the system.", "Neuropathy in my feet after spinal surgery- help Hi, I am new. I have lipomyelomeningocele and I am 24. In 2015 I had a spinal chord untethering and lost the feeling in my feet. I am about to have yet another surgery on my foot and ankle to fuse my big toe and fix 2 ligaments I tore (without knowing it). \n\nI guess my question is- how do you live with this? What keeps you going? I get a small blister and end up on a knee scooter for 6 months. I wear gym shoes that look ugly (I know I could have it much worse), and still get blisters.\n\nI do not want to be a burden to my friends or family with constant medical needs. \n\nSo... Idek... tips? Help? For mental and physical? Sounds like i had a similar surgery to you as I also lost the feeling in my foot after they operated on my spine. That was 20 years ago and I have somehow been managing ok! I do wear a foot orthotic though to help stabilise it when walking. \n\nThe biggest issue is definitely what you pointed out, that you do not notice injuries. I see a podiatrist every 2 months and she does 'maintenence' i guess for lack of a better term. She makes sure my skin is well protected, is not cracking, that any pressure sores are being managed etc.\n\n I was also told to get into the habit of doing a visual check every single evening before bed. Look at the foot, see if something is off, bleeding, bruised, bumpy and if it is, act on it. I recently realised I had a lump on my ankle. Had to get an ultrasound and it turns out I must have twisted it without realising at some point.\n\nShoes wise - keep an eye out for places that sell extra wide, 'triple E' shoes. I do not know where you are but they are difficult to find in Aus. I found it easier when living in the UK personally.\n\nAlso consider hydrotherapy - I actually managed to gain back a little bit of control/muscle through strengthening exercises at the pool. It is no guarantee but I definitely have more feeling now than I did 20 years ago right after the surgery. Honestly, I have had the full nerve damage since I was born and mines been a hinderance and a godsend. You get used to it. Honestly I have walked through almost every injury, you just have to be vigilant. Like for example, I have stepped on glass, not felt a thing and only noticed from the trail of blood following me everywhere. Obviously the wound takes longer to heal because when there is nerve damage there is reduced blood flow, so you have to most importantly keep it elevated when sat, let air get to it as often as possible and make sure your floor is always clean to avoid infection. \n\nWhen I was about ten I fell asleep and put my foot on the radiator for hours without knowing, woke up to the worst burns my doctors had ever seen, so much so I am now in medical books for worst burns on a child. It took eighteen months to heal and it was hell but I did not feel a thing which was good but also bad. \n\nYou need to wear shoes that do not rub or cause friction, I prefer to be bare foot as much as possible to avoid blood blisters and normal blisters. You do not need to get a knee scooter for a blister, it will still heal, at least in my experience and I have lipomyleomeningocele. I am 29 and have a neurogenic bladder and bowels, I also had 6 tethered cord releases until my doctors and I decided they reached the limit of their effectiveness. Since then, I have had increased neuropathy and blisters that have led me to have several foot reconstruction surgeries. Once I was walking on hot sand and, because I walk barefoot so rarely and have thin skin, the heat blistered the bottom of my feet completely and I had no idea! I think I was probably about where you are at your age mentally. I was so frustrated because I had been doing physical therapy for years without any changes and instead, seeing decreased muscle mass. Like others have said, the most important thing is checking regularly. If I see any red spots I will take pictures of the area to be able to keep track. I wear AFOs now and I miss being able to wear cute shoes. I feel like a burden needing help whenever I have surgeries or even just with things around the house. I was living an independent life away from my family but felt so guilty needing to rely on my friends and roommates that I moved back home. I am able to live alone now but it is hard, and now I feel like I have given up my life just to wallow in self-pity lol. I was able to talk with my former roommate about the guilt I was having and they were very sympathetic and helped me to understand that - that is just what people who care about and love each other do. Not to be all \"it is capitalisms fault\" but really, we have lived in a culture for so long where our worth has been based on how much we can produce, with little emphasis on what we deserve to receive in return. But the reality is that your friends and family want to help you because they love you, and that is enough to be able to show them love in return. One thing I tell myself and others often about being \"disabled\" is that we are just experiencing life that everyone will experience at some point. We all get old, all of our bodies will deteriorate. Disabled people just learn that quicker than most. Life's best kept secret, and we are in on it lol. But we all need help and we can all give help. Another way to look at it is - it hurts your friends and family to see you suffer, and helping you is just a way they can help relieve that.\n\nMy body has changed drastically in the last 5 years and it is been a real whirlwind of emotions and realizing I have placed most of my self-worth into how others perceive me when I should be focusing on trying to be the best version of myself that I want to be. That includes having compassion when caring for myself, and surrounding myself with people who can show me the same compassion.\n\nAnyways I hope some of that could resonant with you, and please reach out if you need. This does resonate a lot. I actually just had another surgery yesterday and my entire family has taken time to visit and I am trying to remind myself that I am loved, not a burden. \n\nI miss cute shoes too. I think about \u201cwhat will I wear on my wedding day???\u201d Lol. \n\nThank you so much for tour response. I was feeling so alone and like no one understood. I am so happy to have found this subreddit. \n\nThank you. Hyrdotherapy sounds amazing. I did not know that I could find others to talk about this with. I just had another surgery yesterday.

Does anyone want to share?  I have been offered this procedure not sure its worth going back every 6 months to redo it Just stumbled across this subreddit.\n\nI had it for the first time a few months ago. They also found out that I have an Ectopic Ureter, so it did not help much. (There were some improvements though)\n\nI highly recommend it. You typically have the choice to be put completely under for it, or they can just numb you up and get it done. It is generally painless, they stick a little camera up there with the needle to inject the Botox into your bladder. I woke up from anesthesia and remember thinking \"Weird, I do not feel anything, they must not have gone through with it for some reason.\"\n\nOnly thing that is slightly uncomfortable is that you will pee blood for a day or two, and likely need to use a catheter if you do not already.\n\nIt does have to be redone every 4-6 months, but in my opinion it is worth it. If you do just get the freezing for it, the actual procedure only takes about 10-15 minutes. It takes about an hour after they freeze you up before they start though. Just joined Reddit and seen your post. I see you posted almost 3 months ago but thought I would throw my two cents in just in case you are still debating. I have been getting this procedure done since 2012 and it worked very well for the first few years. I believe I developed scar tissue from a previous spinal cord surgery in 2011 that resulted in it not working as well a couple of years ago. But I would definitely recommend trying it. It may not work for everyone but if it does work then it is only once every 6 months and a lot better than medication and it is side effects.

And the reason is that every case is different and the doctors do not know the outcome.\n\nWhen we had our daughter (now 4) the doctor came out and you could see from her face that something was wrong. She said the baby was fine, but had this small (later measured at 1 inch in diameter) protrusion on her spine. She said it looked like a small Spina Bifida, and that we had to see a neurosurgeon.\n\nAnd so my wife, parents and MIL took our daughter to this neurosurgeon, while I joined them a bit later because of issues at work. When I reached the hospital they were all pale and I could see they had been crying.\nSide note: I read everything available on the internet about SB and I figured she had a mild SB meningocele, so I was not too worried about it.\n\nIt turns out the idiotic doctor told them that our daughter probably has water in her brain and she will probably not be able to walk again or pee or poop like most people.\nThis has left a huge scar on the psyche of my wife, mom, and MIL that they even changed a little after that. My wife's PPD is definitely the result of this idiot's words.\n\nWe then took our daughter and had MRI which confirmed that her brain was ok, and that the SB sack was only filled with spinal fluid, but nerves were intact and within the spine.\nWe sent the MRI photos to several other doctors, most of whom said she was going to be fine and there was no need to worry. There could still be complications but nothing like what that first doctor said.\n\nShe is now 4 and is just an ordinary kid with what I call an antenna on her back, because she can predict when it is going to rain \ud83d\ude04\n\nTl;dr Doctors can be inconsiderate and do not worry too much about what they say, because they are not even entirely sure about the future of a person with Spina Bifida. Everything can turn out a lot better than they say. I think it is a personal perspective thing and anyone can feel however they want about having a sb kid or not having a sb kid. what is with the gatekeeping? I am just trying to cheer people up, so they do not end up being permanently traumatized for life because of some stupid doctor Well my perspective is that it is not always easy to see any difference but there is a school bully difference and that is one of the reasons I would not want to have a kid go through those same experiences having sb I think it also makes sense to want more for your kids than you had rather than the same.\n\nAlso sb is not always physical, it is emotionally draining at time and mentally exhausting at other times. I do hope you see how this can be a perspective thing. I think what they are trying to say is do not assume the doctors know everything or are always right. This particular doctor was wrong when he said their daughter was going to have all these physical issues and she did not. It is tough because on one hand we are relying on doctors to save lives and fix issues but you have to realize they also make mistakes. So you have to have a healthy balance of trust and also not taking everything they say as written in stone. Yes, exactly. Thank you for understanding my message. I honestly have no idea what you are talking about, because I think you just did not understand what I meant to say with the post.\nMaybe my writing is confusing (it often is when I do not reread), or you did not catch my point - does not matter.\nAnother commenter tl;dr'ed it, so you can read their comment and understand my point. Are you sure the first doctor was a neurosurgeon? Neurologists (sound similar, def different) usually give out this doom and gloom prognosis.  Most neurosurgeons are way more familiar with SB than that unless they are brand new or at a teeny tiny rural hospital and hardly ever see children. I cannot say I am 100% sure because it was 4 years ago... It is different for everyone. I started off fine, got to the age of eight and started to have severe back pain, parents ignored it. Also it mentally affected me so much as a child. It was hard for me to relate as much to other children. \n\nNow I am in chronic pain, only 21, and am getting diagnosed with a bunch of things, so I mean.. Thanks for sharing your story. It is true that SB is different for everyone, and I hope you will get better\n\nI am sorry to hear that your parents chose to ignore their child's pain... Our neurosurgeon was a nice old man who was confident in the surgery and diagnosis. We went to CHOC for everything. He told us it is more common than what we think it was. She is 8mo now and the happiest baby in the world. I get what you are saying. I am 52 years old with spina bifida. When i was born, the doctors said if I lived past a week i would most likely be bkind, deaf, and or mentally disabled. They were completely wrong.

I have 2 jobs as a library dirctor (at 2 different libraries). It is not all doom  And gloom. A lot of times it is how you raise your child and attitude is everything. \n\nNot to say i do not get frustrated or tired of it at times but I am used to it taking 2-3 times longer to do certain things and having to problem solve to figure out how to fo something.

If your doctor suspects it then he should order some or send you to a neurologist if you are experiencing symptoms.  That is... odd. I figured Spina Bifida was usually diagnosed before or at birth.\n\nUsually there is a dimple or abnormality. \n\nCould be though. If your doc thinks it is, there is a good chance I guess? Spina Bifida Occulta is a much milder form of the disease and can often go undiagnosed. I knew it was a mild version, I did not know it could go undetected though!

I have kidney stones and because of my bladder surgeries and because I self cath I cannot pass them so it is very complicated for me to have them removed. I went into septic shock from the kidney infection, I was in a coma for 4 days, they had to remove my shunt for fear of infection, and I had a nephrostomy tube in for a month. I was in the hospital for 2 weeks and I am still facing complications and discomfort. I have some things I learned and I hope they are helpful to someone especially parents of children with SB.\n\n1) Advocate for yourself. I told every nurse I had that my skin is extremely sensitive to tape and someone finally started using Allevyn bandages on my skin which are heavenly. Ask for them next time you need a dressing.  \n2) Make sure and tell them if you are anxious, sensitive, anything that is going on that is not \"typical\" so they can help you. It can be embarrassing to admit but they can help you if they know you have anxiety or a sensory processing disorder or anything that is making things worse for you.  \n3) TAKE THE PAIN MEDS. You might want to tough it out but it does not make things easier for you or anyone else. Side note, keep track of what pain meds work for you and tell them. I got stuck with meds on the first couple of days that were making me hallucinate. It was not fun.  \n4) Start moving as soon as you can after surgery. Do the breathing exercises, do whatever you can. When I finally got out of bed after a week or so, I needed a nap after just walking 10 feet down the hall.  \n5) Take care of yourself once you get home, do not be afraid to ask for help.\n\n6) Mental health is sorely overlooked in the medical field. It is okay to need support during and after any issue you are having even if it is not major. If you do not talk to a professional, make sure there are other people in your life who will listen and understand if you are feeling down about things.  \n\n\nI hope this is not all obvious but this was my first major issue as an adult and I learned a lot.", "A personal video about growing up with Spina Bifida ", "CureMedical catheters ", "GofundMe ", "What is something you have always wanted to do but have not because of one reason or another?

I read it is a last resort but even with bladder botox and vesicare, it seems like I have to still go to the bathroom often even with not drinking much water. I hated recovering but it really helps with everything. I have to go every two hours due to other things but still. Recovery sucks but it is worth it if nothing else works Hi rainbow_unicorn_4u. I know recovery from any surgery sucks but what in particular was so challenging with this procedures recovery?  How long did recovery take?  Thanks. I was little-ish. I remember they needed to keep the bladder completely empty so they inserted a tube. I do not know how bad it hurts, but my stitches pulled and made it worse. I  really think the only problem I had with it was the stitches pulled. Let me ask mom if she remembers how long my recovery took and I will let you know I had bladder augmentation surgery about 16 years ago. It allowed me to stop taking meds and totally fixed my urinary incontinance(sp). \n\nI agree with the other comment regarding recovery. It is a major surgery. I spent 9 days in the hospital (losing 20lbs because you cannot eat) and had a super pube catheter for at least 5 weeks after I went home. \n\nI self cath and ended up with 2 bouts of bladder stones requiring removal in the handful of years after due to mucous build up in my bladder. I also had to have 2 incisional hernia repairs. Despite the issues that arose I do not regret it. It has added to the quality of my life. I had this 10 years ago and it changed my life 100% for the better! Recovery was ok, iv had worse recoveries from other surgeries, but those few months of recovery are nothing compared to the positive impact it is had. I used to leek constantly and have to constantly use my catheter  and monitor how much I drank to try and prevent leaking to maintain a normal life and it killed my confidence and social life and romantic life. Having the surgery gave me more control over my life. \nSince then Iv also had to have a metroffanof put in and now use the catheter through my stomach but if I had not had the augmentation before that it would of been harder to manage! Just to add to the recovery side of things, talk to your doctors, nurses about the pain management, there is lots of options and pain can easily be kept at bay, I had a super pubic for 5/6 weeks and it is a bit or a burden but once you learn to manage it properly it is honestly fine and it is only temporary! (If anything it is a real nice break from having to go up and down to the toilet constantly or leaking!!) I had glue type stitches so there was no stitch removal or anything. I was allowed to eat and drink a day or two after surgery (obviously not huge meals but little bits hear and there as I wanted) For me the worst part of the recovery was coming off the morphine as that made me feel sick and weak and lasted a few days but that is somthing you can manage properly if you speak with the doctors beforehand! \nThe benefits of the surgery are wayyyyy more than the falls of the recovery my only regret is putting the surgery of and not doing it sooner Hey she said it took me about a month before I was home Thanks for the info! I have had it! The recovery from it was kind of a pain because you have all sorts of tubes inside you but that only lasts for about two weeks! And now I am very glad I did it because I do not need to empty my bladder like every hour! This surgery absolutely changed my life 21 years ago, even though I had complications in the OR turning it into a 10 hour ordeal.

Not bad, just different. He was very clear that he was insecure and uncomfortable with sex. So we worked with it. We experimented with different things that helped figure out what he felt and what he did not. We worked to make him comfortable in an area that he really was not comfortable with at all. I felt very special that I got to help him learn more about himself in that way. Mishaps happen, and sometimes certain bodily fluids enter some NSFW areas.

My feet are significantly turned to the right. I had a triple arthrodisis(spelling is probably off) and my foot was turned slightly but is still a long ways from being straight. Keeping pace was my go to but now they have gone out of business. I looked on propet, but they all seem to look like it would be hard to try on. I have gotten shoes from my brace place, but the new ones are so ugly that it makes me want to cry. I had to spend well over $100 on them and I hate them. I only had 2 choices to pick from(they both looked the same.)While it may seem silly to cry over a shoe, it is more than that. I have loved fashion since I was little (25F now) and it seems that I can never find shoes that go with every thing. I own one pair of shoes that fits(I still have not gotten the lift out on the ugly shoes lol so I am not wearing them) I have heard of billy footwear, but it does not look durable and that is what I really need. I would LOVE to find boots that work or even slippers. Just everything shoe related would be nice. Also, what socks do you prefer? I have to get knee highs and I go through socks fairly often. Thanks! Following.\nYou are not alone! My dd (12) feels the same. She is in SMOs now and getting AFOs in a couple weeks and she cried.\nShe wears Propet. She likes them and does not have much trouble.  Order from Zappos and if they are too hard send back free of charge.  We have had Billys too and she also likes those very much.  Idk how durable you would need but they lasted her between growth spurts.  \n\nOther than that I do not have advice and will look forward to hearing more suggestions. We used to buy Van's for my son until we discovered Billy's. First up, I have never found cheap options that are durable and work. But the pricey options that I have relied on for 20 years are: Dr Martens (also have knee highs to completely hide the AFOs), Timberlands, Vasque (if you do not mind the hiking look).\n\nDr Ms soles wear out quickly if you have any gait abnormalities. Do not buy the suede or canvas ones because they have zero ankle support. Timberland soles last much longer but are nearly twice the price. Vintage Vasque can be found in solid leather; Modern Vasques are very sporty/outdoorsy looking. Do not buy the \u201cdesert\u201d models though - their soles are very slippery on wet surfaces. \n\nSocks: try a thin liner sock under your outer socks. Always moisturize your skin really well - calluses make the socks wear out faster too and can turn into ulcers/abscesses. Liner socks make outer sock last longer and reduces blisters. \n\nFor the outer sock, Smartwool are really expensive and have to be air dried - but they do knee highs in many colours, keep you fabulously temperature controlled in heat and cold, and woolen socks last ages compared to nylon/acrylic socks.  \n\nGood luck!!! :)", "Just a 17 y/o with spina bifida I have a pretty spina bifida occulta, along with tethered cord syndrome, diastemyelia, and diplomyelia on top of that.

It sounds tough. I will say that I would be suspicious if your docs went in for a detethering and did not see or get rid of the fatty tissue in the same procedure.

I would even reach out to the bigger children's hospitals that deal with SB (Children's of Philadelphia comes to mind) and ask them if they will see you or if they have a referral. I would also ask them or do your own research on stem cell treatments.

Hi, I have a 4yo boy with Myelomeningocele in the L3 area.  He is smart as a whip and fully mobile, aside from some balance/strength challenges that he works on in PT.  He is aware (to a point) that he cannot control his bladder or rectum, which causes him embarrassment, and sitting on the potty almost always causes extreme frustration.  I have a feeling it will not be long before he starts asking questions of us or his friends about differences he notices between himself and other kids. \n\n  \n**TLDR**: When would you say is the right time to have a conversation with a 4yo about SB and how it effects him?  What pointers or resources would you suggest for handling the conversation?  \n\nI am thinking we will want to explain things in fazes versus dumping it all on him at once. I do not want to jump the gun, but I also want him to know he can talk to us about anything (as best as a 4yo can). As any parents, our main goal is for him to have as happy, amazing, and care-free a life as any person could wish for. We greatly appreciate your wisdom! I do not see any issues with starting now in ways he can understand. He loses his balance, just explain that that happens because of a booboo in his back that he was born with. Just explain things the same way you would anything else. I agree you should talk to him now. He may be getting feelings of \"what is wrong with me\" and it would probably help him to know it is not his fault. Our daughter will be six this spring and knows she has spina bifida. It is something we have always talked about with her. She has the typical bladder and bowel issues plus her mobility is somewhat more impacted than your son. We have always been open with her about her condition in an age appropriate way and I would recommend that approach with your son too. As he gets older he will be more aware of how he is different and I think it is important to help him understand it (again, age appropriately). I do not know if you have other kids or not but our SB daughter is the youngest of three so she is always seen \u201ctypical\u201d up close. Four may be too old but there is a Daniel Tiger story and tv episode about a little girl with Spina Bifida that may be helpful. There may also be a local support non-profit in your area. We have found it helpful to expose our daughter to other kids/families with Spina Bifida. It also gives her a chance to see adults with it and have relationships with other SB kids her age. Before he starts school. My parents did this and I think it worked very well! Agree 100%\n\nEdit: u/PeaceFlowerCoffee, I highly suggest you get in touch with your local Children's Hospital and ( if you have not already. They have wonderful programs to help do medical checkups, provide resources, and get in touch with a broader community. My parents took me to get a once a year checkup at my Children's Hospital and it was a great way for me to realize that I had a unique condition.\n\nEdit 2: Also start working on developing a well controlled diet and bathroom schedule. Getting fiber and exercise to combat constipation and other issues is what I most wish I had known and developed the skills to do early. I think that because he is old enough to feel flustered by the obstacles that he is old enough to learn a little more about his body.  \nMake it natural and not so scary, he is just a kid... and because he is a kid, he can normalize it and overcome it.  Give him all of your encouragement.  You can break it down into bite size pieces.  \nLet him know that you know it is hard but that he is doing so good!  \n\nThere might be children\u2019s books on how to introduce this (that way, you can read it to him and he can look at pictures and ask questions or make comments).  I wonder if there is an online resource for kids who have sb? My parents told me waaaaaay too late and I am still hurt about that. I was so confused for years of why I could do things my peers could and why I had that huge scar on my back. So start telling him now, or you will fuck with his self image, mental health etc I always knew something or the other.  My parents constantly worried about me and every other day i was in some hospital. They would always distract me by keeping me happy (which unfortunately is very easy to do. Happiness in small things I guess.) I think I figured exactly what I have at the age of 13, when my parents handed me the medical reports in a hospital as they had to maybe pay the bill/fill an insurance report/get food or something. Was not surprised. Just curious. But I always knew I was different. I was maybe a little jealous about other kids doing other stuff. But my parents would always remove that jealously by making me do other things. So yes. Tell him he is different. But the reason he is different is because the world is bored with the \"mundane same people.\" Best is to cultivate his habits such as staying healthy and positive from an early age. Thank you all very much. This is exactly what we needed.", "Can lack of sensation in the legs/back mean that I have a lack of sensation in my penis? I am 18 and I am starting to realise I do not get pleasure from touching my penis. I think this is because I may not have any sensation in it due to my spina bifida. If any guys could help me out and clear this up it would be great. If everything goes according to plan I will be undergoing surgery in order to get the feeling in my penis restored. \n\nYes, the loss of feeling in the genitals is quite common among people with SB. ( has the potential to create a neural pathway to the brain. In the procedure the nerve endings in the penis are connected to the groin nerve(s). The paper I linked describes a bit more although there is quite a lot of jargon in there. If you have got any additional questions regarding this, feel free to ask me. Basically I just really want to know is this common to have no sensation in the penis? I have just always thought no one could really feel anything. I guess you never stop learning with spina bifida It is common as far as I know, although there are different ways in which people end up being affected by it.\n\nMy apologies for immediately linking to that procedure. I was keen to give you more information regarding it but I am obviously not an expert on the matter. Although, this might be something to discuss with your parents and/or a physician. That is ok! I have searched about it and it says the lower your SB is the more likely you have no sensation mine is very low on my back Mine is also pretty low as well and feeling is nonexistent. This has made me really upset. This explains why I am submissive and enjoy pleasing women more than I enjoy being pleased. My husband has no feeling on the backs of his upper legs and has reduced feelings in his genitals, but not none. It all depends on where the injury is and how complete it is. Wow, I have never heard of this but it aligns with my experience. I have vague sensations but its not zero, for which I am grateful.\n\nDo you have any links to research or info on it? I have mostly no sensation in my genitals although my scrotum still has some kind of sensation in it. My penis is almost completely numb though with quite some pressure I can feel something! Nope this is my point I have only just realised as I thought I was normal but obviously not Would Medicaid cover this procedure? My health insurance covers it. I live in the Netherlands though and I have no idea about how the coverage elsewhere. Well procedure was invented in the Netherlands I think I am talking about in America, probably not insurance here only cares that your alive nothing to say about the quality of that life. I have my Mylomenengocele although I have about 70% feeling in my legs and walk withy braces I still cannot feel down there either I feel like this is a common thing for us. I feel a lot more like I understand why I feel about how it feels I guess I have the exact same thing. My doctor told me I have \"Saddle anesthesia\", i.e. \"anything that your skin would touch sitting in a saddle, you cannot feel.\"  Unfortunately, like you, that includes my penis. I am mind blown. Im 18 and have only just found out I cannot feel it. Yea, it did not dawn on me for a while as a teenager, I think.  Like, I never put 2 and 2 together that I did not masturbate the way everyone else seems to, by rubbing it fast (though applying pressure definitely makes a difference). Exactly! Doing the usual rubbing does not make me feel anything. For me stimulation is a more psychological thing instead of physical Yea, for me, that comes with a mix of advantages and disadvantages.  My erections are essentially tied to my mental state, so I can get them pretty quickly if I am in a good state of mind.  Conversely, it can be easy to lose them during sex.  If my mind wanders or the position is kind of weird, I do not have the auto pilot of sensation to keep things going.  I am also kind of embarrassed when I accidentally come out during sex and do not realize it, and it takes my partner saying \"You are not in me anymore,\" though it does not bother her. This is pretty amazing.  I did not know about this.  I hope it goes well Toofgib, and I look forward to hearing about your experience with it whenever it happens. Well, the surgery was on tuesday and I am currently still recovering. All I can say right now is that the scars were closed pretty neatly. For any other info regarding if it actually worked I would have to come back to that in about 6-8 months as it takes some time for the nerves to grow from the incision towards the glans of the penis. I have had sex a few times and I could not stay in because well I did not know if I was in in the first place. I have learnt so much about my self in the past few weeks. Oh wow, you were undergoing that surgery very soon after you original post!  Yea, glad to hear it healed up well.

Unfortunately, the last time I had it, it did not help with the problems I was having (and made some things worse).    \n\n\nI find that a lot of the effort that I put in to making things better with SB often ends up not being very helpful, so I get tired of trying.  I guess it is hard to have hope.  I am definitely hoping that this procedure helps you though.  Thanks again for sharing this info.

Although, on the other I guess I am making the information regarding the procedures more widely known.\n\nI have been thinking of doing an AMA at some point to make information regarding this more well known although I am afraid it would just make me look like I am seeking attention. I will definitely tell here at least once I start to notice the effects of the surgery. Yea, you are absolutely making info more available, so nothing to feel guilty about.  I do not know what an AMA is, but the more exposure the better imo.  \n\n\nActually, I just today had a chance to read the article you posted.  It sounds great.  When I googled whether the procedure was done in the U.S. (where I am), the first link was for a hospital in Seattle.  I live in Portland, Oregon, which is about a 2.5 hour drive away.

Hello spinabifida reddit folks, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to reach out and ask for advice and thoughts on telling my partner more about my condition. As part of my spina bifida I am reliant on intermittent self-catheterisation. I was diagnosed at 8 years old late and only as a result of multiple life threatening Kidney infections That is despite having wonky buttocks, hairy patches and some other signs you might think would alert Drs. But hey ho... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent a lot of time in hospital between 8-13 years old which was right around the time my body was starting to go through puberty. I, perhaps some of you can relate, felt so violated by that experience. I have flashbacks of a group of trainee Drs being brought in to stare at my backside and fresh surgery  scars that will be with my forever. I could go on. My family found the whole thing very difficult. My paternal grandmother once told me she believed that my extended hospitalisation caused the breakdown of my parents marriage. My mother has repeatedly blamed herself for what is 'wrong' with me. As you might imagine, those experiences were incredibly shaming and embarrassing, enough so that I tried to hide from and avoided my condition for years (mostly but not going to my hospital appointments). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is taken me until my 30s to love myself not in spite of my condition nor because of it but I now (on the good days) love my body for it is strength, resilience AND fragilely. Reaching this point was no easy path. Tbh i did not even think it was possible a few years ago - certainly in the later stages of being a teenager and my early 20s I hated my body to the extent i actively sought to harm it in a number of ways. Being where I am now and feeling able to write this post is huge. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have one step left to take; one fear left to relinquish. I have never told a partner I catheterise. I have hidden it from the people I have dated (and in one case lived with). I appreciate that I had the privilege of sufficient mobility and independence to do this. My mother was keen to help me be discreet as a young woman (we had code names for catheters) and I guess that just cemented this idea that it was something to hide.  I have been seeing the most fantastic person for a year and for the first time I do not want to hide who I am or what my experience of my body is. BUT as much as I think about it I feel fear and find myself holding back or wondering how to make the words come out of my mouth. I am not ashamed now. I used to be. But it is just a part of who I am and if anyone is going to love me then I want to share the parts of me that have been the hardest for me to love about myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would be so grateful for my thoughts or advice from the community.  I would encourage you to be open about it. There is nothing wrong with being a little different from the norm and if your partner loves you it should not be any kind of big deal. As a practical matter I do not think it is something you can hide very well from somebody you live with.  Hey-\nI am so glad I read this post. As a newlywed to a wonderful man with what sounds like the same type of spina bifida as you have...This was such a challenge for us too! I thank gosh for this forum and for all the supportive people on here that helped me through it.\nI had dated my hubby for years and had no idea that he struggled with incontinence really (although I guess I had some suspicions but never really thought about it) until we moved in together in preparation for our wedding which just happened in January of this year.\n\nFor me, I felt like his embarrassment and shame were bigger issues than the incontinence even was and as the person on the other side of the equation I just wanted him to know that I loved him and did not care at all about what type of underwear he may need to wear in whatever situation or about what tube he may stick into his bladder...I wanted to make all of his bad feelings go away because like I said it was almost like his shame and fears about talking about this with me were worse than the actual problem itself.\n\nI hope this provides some insight for you as someone on the other side!\n\nGood luck and know that your SO cares about you and probably will not even care that much. Just do not make it into a big deal when you tell him and all should be on!\n\nAnother thing that helped me and my SO with difficult conversations was actually to text about it ahead of time so that it was not as hard to talk about it...Use the technology as an aide if you need to and keep us posted!\n\nWe are all rooting for you! :) I have a daughter with SB, she is very young right now but I know that this will someday be something she will also likely struggle with. I also recently learned that another woman I know also self-caths, I was saddened to learn that she has avoided dating at all because of this. My advice to her was this; Being together in any kind of real relationship comes with moments of great vulnerability. Try not to focus on your urinary issues as anything other than that. Partners experience menstruation, sex , childbirth and all sorts of potentially weird/embarrassing situations together all the time. Any partner worth their salt will embrace the fact that this is part of who you are. \n\nI am glad to hear you are in a better place mentally, you dont deserve to be hurt, blamed or hated on by anyone, including you. &lt;3 Too relatable, my mom and I called my catheters \u201csupplies\u201d growing up as our code word.  When I first started dating my SO 3 years ago I also hid my catheters because I did not think anyone could want to be with someone with Spina bifida. Now he carries around my catheters in his wallet/pocket just in case I forget one. I would say just give it time, eventually you will get there with the right guy, and it is okay if you do not feel comfortable yet. Our feelings of shame are not always rational but we have to be patient in working through them.  You absolutely should be open and honest with her. If she truly loves you, it will not matter at all, otherwise it is time to move on anyway.  \nIt took me a long time to be open about it too. It was hard the first time I opened up about it to anyone, but now it is not. I tell co-workers, my boss, friends, etc. - No one has given me grief over it.  \nDo not sweat the jitters, you will feel better afterwards. Loosen up a bit if you can but definitely do it.  Hey OP. Congratulations on loving your body! All of our bodies are a little awkward and not perfect. Go self loving!\n\nI have been dating my partner now for just over 4 years. He has the same spinal bifida as you do, by the sounds of it. When we first started dating he did not tell me about it. But one day he just opened up to me, he was vulnerable with me. And I respected him telling me, and honestly I did not and I still do not view him as anything different. I love him for who he is and everything that makes him who he is.\n\nHe was shocked that I did not care, and that it did not worry me at all. I was not fazed. Who is life is perfect anyway? We all have our problems. I like his scares on his back, they are battle scares.\nWe do not worry about his catheters, I carry a few in my bag when we go out always. :) \n\nThis is the guy who I want to spend the rest of my life with and I cannot imagine not loving him.\n\nBest advice is, if he is the right guy for you. Tell him, talk him all through it. Honesty is really the best thing, I know its hard actually telling him. But the hardest part is opening up and telling him. Your not ashamed of your body, and he will see that when you tell him. Like you said it is part of you.\n\nAll the best lovely x Thanks so much - your comments and support mean a lot.  &gt;Being together in any kind of real relationship comes with moments of great vulnerability.\n\nHow true! Thank you for reminding me of that, I hope your daughter is doing well and it sounds like she has someone great to help her navigate this &lt;3  Haha. You are my LIFEGOALS! Thank you so much for sharing this. \n\n&amp;#x200B; Thank you. I am in awe of your approach. It seems to just normalise it a lot. It is just bodies. Some work differently.  This is such a great perspective to hear. It is really helping me get round my head that is it is actually not that much of a big deal. It is scary to be vulnerable but that is how we grow and have loving  compassionate relationships. Thank you.  Exactly! It is not a whole lot different than diabetes; it just is attached to our \"private parts\".\nJust do it as the saying goes.  Wow. I am feeling so heard and supported by you all. Thank you all so much for sharing your experiences - you make me feel strong &lt;3 I tried to hide it all my life.  All that did was give me anxiety.  I am 41 now and I am an open book.

For some reason it is never occurred to me before to look for SB communities on reddit - I found this sub this evening and have read through a few posts, and the sense of relief is almost painful. I have never known anyone else with spina bifida or with the same kinds of experiences I have, and I do not think I fully appreciated just how alienating it is been until seeing some of your posts and realising I am not alone.\n\nI have occulta with various complications, have had two spinal cord resections/detetherings and have been experiencing chronic pain for about 8 years that nobody has really shown any interest in (in fairness, I have not pressed the issue because I have felt like I am making it up). The last neurologist I spoke to about four years ago suggested that a third detethering operation was theoretically a possibility, but the risks probably outweighed the benefits, and basically it may just be that my spinal cord is 'exhausted'.\n\nI just have a lot of thoughts and feelings about all of this which I have not known what to do with - resenting the pain and how unsightly I find my surgical scars/remaining lipoma, guilt that those things are at least somewhat my fault due to significant weight gain in the past five years, worrying that I should just get over myself because in the scheme of things, my spina bifida is fairly mild. But knowing there are a bunch of people out there who might have similar experiences is like a weight has been lifted that I did not even realise I was carrying.\n\nAnyway, I do not want to witter on, just to say that I am really glad this community exists and I look forward to reading and participating more.

By \"lipoma\" i mean that fatty bulging area around the base of your spine.\n\nI had one de-tethering surgey done when i was very little and my parents where told that the lipoma would gradually reduce in size as i got older. Instead the opposite has happened. Im in my mid 20's now and its become basically impossible to hide the thing under my shirt. its so big i can cup both my hands over it and still leaves significant space left. It may or may not be contributing to the neurogenic bladder and lack of sensation in my lower extremities that ive developed over the last few years. \n\nHas anyone had experience with de tethering/ lipoma reduction later in life? Yes, mine was entirely inside though like you would not know it was there unless you saw my mri. My doctor claims to have gutted 90% of it and the rest is structurally a part of my dura mater. My lipoma was removed at birth but I had detethering in 2015. There was a lot of scar tissue causing tethering. It significantly improved my neurogenic bladder (self cath) and  neurogenic bowel. I also do not have much feeling in my lower extremities and as I get older I am slowly losing sensation in my toes. I had a de-tethering done when I was 8.  My bladder issues got worse as I got older, so I decided to have another de-tethering done at 33.  It did not help at all and I lost sensation in my right foot.  The doctor told me the fatty bulging area at the base of my spine was not connected to any nerve damage or restoration, so the surgery did not help with that at all unfortunately. I was always told the bump at the bottom of the spine can easily accumulate fat etc around it, i had key hole surgery where they basically did lipo to make it more even, smaller and less stressful on my back, they took about 350mls out (bearing in mind i was only 53kg and 18 years old at the time..) I was back on my feet 3 days later (however i did have complication post surgery where i started bleeding out which required a hospital stay but eh risks are everywhere) It was the best decision ever and i recommend looking into it, it changed my life: clothing, walking, back pain and confidence has all improved massively! (However be warned you will still have your bump but i mean it will be significantly more aesthetically pleasing for you and a good starting point for more deduction etc) That Is encouraging to hear. Thanks, ill be sure to look into it further.", "student loan forgiveness  Has anyone tried to get STudents Loans forgiven due to disability? How easy or hard was it? I did it. It required a ton of paperwork. Additionally, you have to report income for three years after you apply. In my state (Arizona), I cannot exceed the federal poverty level for a family of 2. Luckily, that is more than I can make in order to still qualify for SSDI. I say go for it!", "Confused about urinary system. Let me start of I am a HUGE hypochondriac but at the same time I am also not great with doing my cath everyday. So a few weeks ago I went in for a urodynamics test and obviously I was EXTREMELY nervous (mostly about kidney disease) and so a week before I was looking online and it said high pressure bladder can cause urine to reflux back into the kidneys naturally I freaked out because there is days that I would not do my carb for days on end. So the results come back and my pressure is really high (30) and I got really concerned but at the same time my urologist said it did not reflux. Now after those test I am questioning 1. How did not it reflux with that pressure? 2. I could have gone longer before telling the urologist I was full during the test so what if they got the wrong results. And finally 3. I have been doing a good job of doing the cath a few times everyday but now I am freaking out over if I already did damage and I have kidney failure/disease and there is nothing I can do about it! You are not guaranteed to have reflux with a high pressure bladder, I have high pressure and it does not back into my kidneys, it just finds the other path out &lt;_&lt; I usually catheterize every 4-6 hours, or more depending if I drink more. Yes you can do damage to your system   it small but over time for some it may take years of not doing right for other it can happen super fast a few months time..  each SBO is a little diffent then the next,.   \n     Look being I have been super lucky, I Cath drink my water, if I know/smell/see signs of a UTI. I get on it. Hard and watch what I am doing..  I so have freinds one so this very second is on the organ donor list waiting on a kidney, that is never going to be placed in him due being on SSI/Medicaid we both know it.. he is just 42 years old and look mild 70's full head of grey hair from all the medical to keep him going. I am a older then him and look younger then him..\n\n\n\nJust do what the Dr. Inst. Drink the water, work out each week etc... \n\nRem Spina bifiida is not a death sentence, like back in the 1950,60,70... We can live passed age 17-19 and have great lives.. So the other way out meaning it comes out as in leakage? Yeah I am trying to get better I so far have cathed twice today I am only 15 but I definitely do not want to need a kidney transplant or problems honestly I would be really depressed if that happens to me so May I ask why you do not cath more regularly?  Are there specific problems you are having with it? No I am just stupid I do not fit in time to cath Yeah Oh that makes sense then! So I got a less likely chance of kidney damage then!", "What is the Most Difficult Spina Bifida Related Topic You have Had to Have with Your Partner? How did you get through it? Whew! What an eventful weekend! I just wanted to give everyone an update on my original post and to vent a little bit about navigating difficult conversations when you are engaged to someone with Spina Bifida. If anyone else can relate? :)\n\nAnyway, first an update: \n\nPraise god because YES, we did finally talk but it took days and days of partial awkward conversations with supplemental texts for things that are still hard to say out loud even now...Does it get easier? Other people who have been through this before? I hope so...\n\nI finally sent him a text in regards to the box of incontinence supplies I ripped open by mistake after consulting with you all here on this site since at that point he had been avoiding me for days (highly unusual behavior for him) but all I said in the text was just I am sorry for ripping open the box like an idiot without checking to see who it was for first. I should have been more careful. He did not reply...and was actually like out doing who knows what...at night..which again is really weird behavior for him. But I had convinced myself that I could not selfishly bring up the topic just to alleviate my own guilty feelings..I thought I should wait for him to come to me or simply just ignore it altogether (but on the other hand, we are engaged and going to be married in January so burying my head in the sand was not going to fix this...).   \n\nSo then I decided to take a risk based on people's personal experiences with this on here (many with SB mentioned that they would really need their partner to jumpstart the conversation and say something supportive. I thought about it FOREVER and even wrote my text down before sending it then finally after multiple \"text drafts\" (if that even a thing?) said:\n\n\"By the way baby, I am sorry if me finding those was embarrassing for you but I have already known for a long time that you need those and it is not your fault and I love you. Please do not ever be embarrassed about anything around me and would you PLEASE come home!?\"\n\n\nWell what ensued after that was totally unexpected for me. He did reply right away to that and came home with flowers for me saying that he was sorry for avoiding me..And then it was like the floodgates opened and he started unexpectedly talking about how he was sorry and he meant to talk to me about it but had not yet BUT then he brought up all of these other issues related to...other private topics related to being a man with SB (I think you all can guess what I mean) and that totally set me for a tails-spin because I was scared too and had no idea how to respond.\n\nWell, luckily, thanks to the amazing support of an anonymous guy with SB that I met on this forum, I was finally able to navigate through these difficult topics with him and I think we are moving in the right direction communication wise. We still have to use supplemental texts a lot and I admit it is painful for me to hear that the man that I love has had all of these issues and fears this whole time and I had no idea...But I guess it can only get easier from here.\n\nThank you all for supporting me. Not sure how I would have been able to survive the past few days without this site. \n\nAnyway, what is the most difficult topic that any of you have had to have with your partner regarding Spina Bifida? What tips and tricks have you learned for navigating difficult topics?   The incontinence issues, and sex. Because I have less feeling than average, we have had to come up with other ways for me to get aroused. Honestly you both just have to be honest and unashamed. It is really hard, I am still working on it and I have known my husband for 20 years. LOL No doubt we need understanding partners, but incontinence is manged well with the right surgical procedures.  Have you guys and gals explored that option?  I hope it is not too late to respond to this, interestingly enough I came down with some health issues a month ago and have not really been posting on reddit as much.  \nI had multiple surgeries as a kid to fix my bladder, so now I self cath, and I have no leakage problems unless I sleep in too late but that does not happen often :P As far as bowels that is less in control but I can usually get to a bathroom in time. I still consider both these things issues because they do not function as you would expect them to.  So you had the bladder augmentation? Do you cath the penis? Or a stoma in the belly button?  Do you have a cecostomy? Or the Mace? I am a female, and I cath through my urethra, and I do not have anything for my bowels, it comes out when it has to lol but I do not poop regularly, I guess you would say. How old are you?  Do you have to wear pads? Or depends or something for your bowels? I am 39. I almost always get to a bathroom in time. Sometimes I wear a pad if I am going to eat a lot or if I do not feel good. (certain foods set me off) I am 41, I had a cecostomy and mitrofinoff done when I was 35.  The confidence these surgeries have given me is priceless.  If your continence problems hold you back from having a fulfilling social life and work life I would look into them.  If you happen to be in Ohio I have a doctor you can see that is unbelievable.    I am doing pretty well, thanks. It would take me a lot to consider optional surgery.", "My urologist has me on a program where I start myself on antibiotics when I get a UTI. Kind Of wondering about the wisdom of that because I am not trained to test for a UTI. I had a urinalysis done one time at a lab testing facility and it detected blood and white blood cells in my urine, so I made an appointment with him. He asked me if I started the antibiotic to which I was thinking \u201cUh... no because I do not know if I have an infection...\u201d I got urinalysis testing strips by Urinox. Maybe he wants you to test at home? It is a dipstick type test with squares that interact with urine, and by timing the tests and comparing the color, you can test many parameters including blood, leukocytes (white blood cells), pH, glucose, specific gravity, etc. There is an app you can track your results in, and it advises you if you could have a UTI. There are similar brands out there that test less or more parameters and can be done at home. I do not have that but my doc trusts me to know, I usually notice a difference in color, scent and cloudiness(I have augmented bladder)  We can usually tell when my fiance gets a uti because the color is way darker and he gets bladder spasms more frequently. Also, he gets more sediment and sometimes his Foley gets plugged because of it. If you get UTIs infrequently and drop off a sample before start taking it, this works fine, however self prescribing is likely to lead to you taking more antibiotics than necessary. \n\nIf you are not taking a urine sample ahead of time to check the organism infecting you, you will not be able to do so once you start antibiotics, because the presence of antibiotics in your system will result in false positives. If you are infected with a bug not covered by your broad spectrum antibiotics, you could become quite sick while they will have trouble figuring out what bug to treat. \n\nAnother downside is that if you made a mistake and it is something else (I get a lot of pain and high nitrite dips when I eat certain foods that irritate my bladder, for example), do you discontinue antibiotics? Taking less than a full course of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance- ie you are taking enough to kill only the weak bacteria, so the result is being colonized with resistant bacteria. This happens anywhere antibiotics live, including the gut. Frequent antibiotic use can lead to antibiotic associated diarrhea, which is not easy to fix, and to C. difficile, a really awful infection of your gut that causes profuse diarrhea and can be quite serious for some. Re understanding your lab results, that is something your doc or a nurse can train you to read. Tests from your lab should have ranges on each indicator tested to tell you what is abnormal. \n\nFor a UA, there are a few main signs of a UTI: \n\nsediment\n\nelevated white blood cells and leukocyte esterases shows your immune system sent cells to fight off an infection in your urine. It is a sign if inflammation.\n\nblood in urine: this is suggestive of infection in someone with symptoms, but can mean other things - cystoscopy and bladder Botox are procedures that can cause blood in urine. \n\nnitrites: this is what causes the bad smell people get during a UTI. It is produced as a byproduct of bacterial growth. \n\nprotein: normal urine has no protein but it can be a byproduct of an infection. \n\nImportant to know you will always have a low background level of nitrites, protein and sediment if you are a catheter user. Current guidelines recommend not to treat a UTI with antibiotics unless there are symptoms of UTI beyond your norm, AND you have confirmation by UA. The reason is, both together strongly indicate an infection, and not your low background level of colonization that comes with catheter use. Most docs treat a patient with severe symptoms right away after giving a sample and will change antibiotics if the results of the UA show that it is resistant to the antibiotics they started you on.\n\nThis article links to a helpful wallet card with useful info on this topic (applies to spina bifida too): ", "Update ", "Congenital cervical fusion of c2-4 with mild spina bifida Hi! New here! I was diagnosed at 16 with congenital fusion of c2-4 and given very little guidance other than \u201cstop doing things that could result in even minor injuries (ie cheerleading) and oh some day you will need surgery eventually, see you eventually good luck\u201d basically which I have been hearing off and on since (I am 32). The pain is so incredibly bad if I am sitting in any position without head and neck support and even then it is not great. But it does not look bad on mri I guess so drs keep telling me to take ibuprofen and stretch. I have always had the pain so I am not in tears constantly but that does not mean it is not there or bad.

Ever since I was young I have had urinary/bladder/kidney issues. They have increasingly become worse over the years and ive experienced frequent UTI\u2019s, kidney stones, and chronic kidney disease. I see an infectious disease specialist, nephrologist, urologist, and many other doctors. None of them can figure out why I keep getting infections and stones. I was hospitalized for 12 days and had emergency surgery due to urosepsis caused by kidney stones. Had a stent put in and removed once I got out of the hospital. Not even a month later a sono showed more stones have accumulated since my sepsis, surgery, stent, and removal of precious stones took place.. I saw the orthopedic doctor and he reconfirmed my already diagnosed spina bifida occulta, scoliosis, spondylosis, degenerative disc disease, etc. this got me thinking and eventually lead me on a research tangent. Does anyone have neurogenic bladder? It is a condition caused by trauma or spinal deformities. Spina bifida (in all forms) being one of those causes of neurogenic bladder. I have all the symptoms, causes line up, and I am almost positive this is what is going on. For the last year I have been hospitalized once a month for UTI/kidney infections that cannot be cured with oral antibiotics bc ive become resistant to all of them. I have been on continuous antibiotics for 3 months now and the doctors still cannot figure out why I am creating kidney stones and getting injections. I think neurogenic bladder may be the cause of all of this. Just wanted to see if anyone else experiences neurogenic bladder and how they have been treated for it and what their symptoms may be.. I read that even though occulta is mild compared to other forms of SB, the urological symptoms can appear the same despite the mobility not being impaired much in occulta. Im 20 years old, female, and my main Dx are Ehlers Danlos, POTS, IBS, &amp; Raynauds along with the chronic kidney disease, stones, and back issues. Please let me know if you or anyone you know have experienced things as I have with spina bifida and neurogenic bladder/urinary trouble!!! Me and my kidneys and bladder pretty much hate each other. My docs have pretty much told me I would always have some sort of UTI due to having to cath every four hours and yes, I have had multiple kidney stones. I cannot tell you the amount of times I have been hospitalized for a brutal UTI that was in danger of going sepsis and I have had multiple procedures done to break up stones so I can safely pass them. It freaking sucks lol. Do you cath? Hi, I am 38 Female, Spina Bifida (myelomeningocele) with neurogenic bladder. I have been self-catherizing since I was 3 years old. I can walk but still have a paralyzed bladder. I have had UTI's my whole life but not near as bad as what you are describing. Also have never had stones. I am having trouble with my kidneys right now as they are swollen and not functioning as well. But I have recently been diagnosed with bladder cancer. My doctors are still determining if the swelling is connected.      Do you fully void when you urinate? I have never had to cath. That is what I am afraid of.. read that cath is not ideal because of infections and that surgery was a better option. What do they do for your recurrent infections? Have you had trouble with resistance to antibiotics? I was on a maintenance medicine for God knows how long until I got moved from a pediatric SB clinic to an adult and they could not figure out why I was still on a maintenance medicine, which has not been recommended in years. Now I just wait until I get a UTI and go to the doc. Nowadays, I am so used to spending a couple days in the hospital getting IV antibiotics I just say screw it and admit myself if they let me. IV antibiotics are faster anyway and I have nothing better to do with my time lol. So sorry to hear about your recent diagnosis.. cancer is brutal in any form. Positive thoughts being sent your way! Based on your description of swollen kidney and not functioning you are probably experiencing hydronephrosis, right? Or vesicoureteral reflux.. I had a cystoscopy and cystourethrogram done when I was in high school so I am probably due for another one soon. The results were normal. Although my bladder wall has shown to be thickening on ultrasounds due to retention and not being able to feel when it is \u201ctime to go.\u201d I am suspecting that I have neurogenic underactive bladder rather than overactive. If I drink lots of water, I will only go a little bit at a time over the course of an hour or so. I can never get all of my urine out at once which is quite frustrating. As far as I know I am emptying my bladder.. although it does not exactly feel that way. I have been doing that exact same thing for over a year now. Wait for infection, take myself to the hospital, get IV treatment or injections, go home. Except now my recurrent infections are getting closer and closer together. I will get treatment, be discharged for a week, and end up back in the hospital because I cant keep the infections away. Every week-two weeks I have an infection in between hospital stays and it is not acceptable for treatment anymore especially since I am resistant to all antibiotics orally and they do not want to continue with IV treatment because I could develop resistance to that and start forming superbugs that cannot be treated at all. I took nitrofurantoin (macrobid) as a prophylactic drug for years and I am completely resistant to it now. Cipro is the only maintenance option left and my time being able to use it to keep infections away is running out. I am hoping there is something we can try before I have to cath myself. I do not see that as a very good treatment long term due to the susceptibility of infections anyway. It is all very time consuming and irritating to me. I feel like if doctors would just communicate we would have came to a Dx and treatment much sooner. Another person with both spina bifida and neurogenic bladder here \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI had surgery on my bladder when I was 5 and have had to catheterise ever since. I was also getting chronic UTIs and eventually my urologist made the decision to also remove one of my kidneys (when I was 12).\n\nWas doing okay after that but my doctors still were not happy with the amount of UTIs I was getting (3-6 a year). Last year (I was 26) they made the decision to try Botox in the bladder and its been a godsend. Its been 18 months and I have only had one minor UTI and even my IBS has improved since I do not need to keep taking antibiotics all the time (those really mess with your stomach). So glad to hear that one person has had decent luck with treatment!! My nephrologist is afraid that if we remove the problematic kidney, the other one will become a problem as well. I am seeing a neurologist to get some testing done and determine whether or not this is neurogenic bladder like I think it is.. honestly I do not know how it could not be that at this point. Knowing there are others like me brings me comfort, this whole process has been a nightmare and going on for years. Over a decade! I am so happy Botox worked for you! Did you have neurogenic overactive bladder? My case seems to be underactive so I am not sure if Botox would be ideal for me. To be honest I do not think my doctors have ever labeled it over or under active - it is just listed as neurogenic in my file.\n\nHave you had an ultrasound done of your kidneys/bladder? One where they test how well your bladder empties and also how your kidneys act when your bladder is both full and empty? Sounds like that could be useful for you to see what is actually happening...\n\nMy urologist also wondered about the kidney situation (removing the bad one leading to the other one going downhill) which is why he put it off for a while. Ultimately though he thought that actually the greater risk was the bad kidney damaging the good one and so went ahead with removal. And he was right - the kidney I have left operates at approx 90-95% (in comparison, it was at 85 when I had both kidneys with the 'bad' kidney only around 25%) I am aware though that I got very lucky with my urologist - he is one of the world leaders in paediatric urology and was a pioneer of a surgery for neurogenic bladders (of which I was one of his Guinea pigs \ud83d\ude02) and travels all over the world performing that surgery.\n\nI really hope that you also manage to find a really good, competent doctor as well. Thank you for your responses! They have been very helpful. I get renal ultrasounds done multiple times a month due to my kidney stones. I had a cystography and cystourethrogram done when I was in high school around the age of 15-16, but those results did not show anything (apparently). I suspect that if I had those tests redone it would show something now that my symptoms are a lot more significant and I have recurring stones. Nephrology had me do a 24 hour urine collect and I am waiting to hear back about those results. I know when I have surgery again to remove the stones I currently have they will do a stone analysis. I suspect that neuro will want an MRI done because of my history with spina bifida occulta &amp; the relation btw that and neurogenic bladder. It is all a big mess.

I have a searing burning pain in the fatty lump where the nerves are frayed and tangled which often gives me leg weakness and numbness. I also have pain in my coccyx from straining to empty my bladder. However the main struggle right now is the tightness and feeling of the cord being pulled. I can feel it when I am standing or sat down. \n\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to get through this pain or what helps them the most? I have tried most drugs (NSAIDS, anti seizure meds, opioids), yoga, Pilates, stretches. The last time I saw my nuerosurgeon he suggested another operation but the percentage of me coming away paralysed was 70%. I do not want to take the risk, but I also just want to live my life.\n\nHope you are all well and safe. \u2764\ufe0f Seriously, this much pain is worth risking surgery for. Have faith in the professionals and allow yourself to live a pain free life Hello, 35 year old lady with a tethered spinal cord and is currently going through that and more.\n\nNothing helps, from my own experience. The only thing that is helping me cope is cannabis. It does not take the pain or sensations away but it makes me not care about it so much. \n\nIf you have the insurance and your doctor thinks you should, get the surgery.  What you are going through right now is your life but you are not living either. You are just existing with the pain. You do not deserve that life. No one does. \n\nI am sorry if this comes off harsh in any way. It is just that I have been going through this pain and neurological effects for the last 3 years and it is only getting worse. I do not have the insurance to get help right now and my tethering is complicated which would make a second surgery almost impossible. So, I am likely to end up experiencing all the worst case scenarios of this situation and I do not want anyone to go through this. \n\nPlease, consider the surgery. Any relief you may get from it will be more than worth it. I agree with you with the cannabis. The cannabis, relaxes me, which relaxes my nerves causes less painful spasms. I have been on it for almost a year and it is the best thing I ever did! \n\nI am 33yo female with lipomeningicle SB with TC. My tethering is from the build up of scar tissue from my surgeries as a baby. I had my cord released in 2015. It was the best decision I made. Unfortunately, my neurosurgeon could not get all the scar tissue out and release the cord completely bc the lasers were too close to my leg function. One thing I wanted to add about opioid pain medication with tethered cord, is that it causes constipation. If you get constipated, the stool can be pressing on your nerves causing more pain. Also, be careful with yoga and stretching. I am not permitted to do any exercises where I lift my legs up. I am not permitted to ride a bicycle, or be put in the lithotomy position bc it can progress/cause re-tethering. Obviously, check with your neurosurgeon, but this is what mine told me. I am sorry you are in pain. I know how you feel and I hope you get some relief soon! Yes!!! My bladder does not empty properly as it is and the medication makes it worse. I have to strain so much I have damaged my coccyx in doing so! Thank you so much, nice to feel like I am not alone \u2764\ufe0f Thank you, and I am sorry to hear you are suffering too. Cannabis did help me immensely when I lived in the states but I moved back to the UK a few years ago now so that option is gone. I had surgery when I was 11 which helped, but the offer of a second surgery I was told \u201cwe do not know of it will help with the pain and the risk of you becoming paralysed is very high\u201d.

I have 3 children as well &amp; not being able to be as active with them as before is probably the worst thing out of this. \n\nI am so sorry that you can no longer smoke though.  It is illegal in my state so I should not be either but I rather risk the ticket than not be able to function.  \n\nMy only other advice is just... have a strong support system.  Idk what your situation is but the stuff I am going to suggest has been the only thing getting me through this. \n\nTalk to your family and friends about possible situations that can arise at any time (I myself have a lot of neurological issues with my tethering in addition to the pain) so they can know what to do to help you. Even just sitting with you while the pain gets beyond bad can really help.  \n\nUnless sex is too painful for you, try to have it when you can. I know this sounds weird and gross, but it does not so much take the pain away but it does help you focus on something else other than the pain and psychological issues that comes with chronic conditions.  I have also noticed that doing this and talking keeps your relationship from suffering. It is also something we tend to forget about when we are hurting but sex (at least for me) is important to your mental health. \n\nLet yourself react to your pain.  Do not try to hold it in as a show of strength. You are already strong and the people close to you know that. They do not need that reassurance.  We are raised in a society that considers reacting to pain as a sign of weakness when it is anything but. You are meant to react to pain. Not only to just alert others to your condition but it is a coping mechanism. It is the one time where you should not feel ashamed for being in pain. Your life and those little ones are a testament to your strength and you have nothing to prove to anyone. \n\nWrite what you are thinking, no matter how bad it may be. If you are like me, you do not want to burden your loved ones with the very real psychological damage chronic conditions causes but you cannot keep those thoughts silent. Writing as though you were writing a blog has been one of the best ways to cope for me. \n\nIf you need to retreat and just not deal with people, do it, especially if you are low on spoons (a way to explain how much energy we can use, I highly suggest reading the spoon theory if you have not). Do not waste what precious energy you have on people that could very well wait a day or two to talk to you. Let them know, of course, so you do not intentionally hurt their feelings. \n\nRest and sleep whenever you are tired or sleepy, regardless of schedules. This one is super hard when you have kids and a job, I know. But not fighting the drowsiness or exhaustion and just letting it make you fall asleep means you are spending less energy on staying awake and coherent which means you will have more energy to use when you wake up. \n\nIt is a tough road.  I am so sorry that you have to go through it. I would not wish this on anyone. I hope that my suggestions will work for you Oh I forgot one thing. If you have a passion, like writing, or say you want to stream video games or make silly vlogs for YouTube, freaking go for it.  You would be amazed at how uplifting it can be. I started writing short horror stories and a YouTube channel around the time that things had gotten pretty bad and it was great to have a creative outlet.  And speaking from personal experience, the horror community on YouTube is one of the most close knit communities I have ever come across. Have they talked to you about self-cathing? It may be something to ask your doctor about. They have! I have bad PTSD from my first operation where doctors held me down and shoved the catheter in, so when I went for some urodynamics tests and they inserted one I blacked out \ud83d\ude1e I think it is going to come down to it now though.

It is hardened and pen tip small. \nShe has not been seeming to have any trouble, she walks, kind of runs, and her bladder/bowel control is up and down. \nJust wondering if anyone has seen anything like this, hoping to have some info before we contact Dr. tomorrow.

Hey!\n\nSo I have tried to do some ~google~ research and have come up empty! My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years and are discussing marriage and children. He has spina bifida and I have some other conditions that are researched to be passed genetically. We know we will need to use IVF to conceive!\n\nMy question is will our future children be more likely to have SB? Our house is accessible and I plan on involving our children in either sports or adaptive sports just curious :)) Do not believe any studies have shown a genetic correlation to the occurrence of spina bifida. Just take tour prenatal vitamins and folic acid. Yes, I think your doctor may prescribe lots of folic acid just given the medical history. I had heard about a recent study that suggested SB may be linked to a condition in which the baby's mother's body does not process folic acid well. I could not find any literature about it, but in the end, I think it would be consided a high risk pregnancy anyway right? So taking all the precautions you can will be good r/usernamechecksout There are thought to be heritable risk factors related to folic acid absorption that affect your likelihood of having a child with SB. I think it would be smart to get genetic counselling - not to say you would not have kids with your bf as a result but it could give you useful information. \n\nAccording to the UK NHS (their national health service) having a first degree relative with SB does make your likelihood of having a baby with a neural tube defect.  Interesting thank you!\n\nI have always been interested in his family genetics as he has a brother with Down syndrome and a sister with no known conditions. Always been interesting to me how his parents have a son with spina bifida and a son with Down syndrome! Those are two different heritable conditions though and there is no particular genetic connection between them. Down syndrome can also arise as a result of a spontaneous mutation (ie not inherited). But it sounds like you and your partner have good reason to seek out genetic counselling. I have pernicious anaemia, so my body does not absorb folic acid or vitamin B very well. I had a course of treatment and then my doctor said I was fine and stopped it. \n\nI was on the contraceptive pill, but it did not work because I discovered I was pregnant when I was 5 months gone. At the 20 week scan I discovered my son had spina bifida. \n\nI am convinced that it was due to me not being able to absorb folic acid properly. (I felt guilty for a long time). \n\nHe is here now and he is the most amazing little boy!! I do worry for when we are ready for another child but I will be pushing for more tests into my condition.\n\nBest of luck to both of you on your journey to becoming parents. Get blood tests for vitamin B and folic acid, and talk to your doctor. Even if it is \"borderline\" I would request a higher strength of folic acid. 400mcg is the prenatal amount. I was on 5mg for a few months. Xx", "Anyone else a hypochondriac? I seem to be a really bad hypochondriac with spina bifida I have L3 Mylomenengocele and I am always concerned about my kidneys like it can get to a point where I have a panic attack.

", "Spina Bifida Occulta - Urinary Incontinence Good evening everyone,  \n\n\nI am looking for some advice regarding some urinary issues I have been experiencing. I (28F) was diagnosed with Spina Bifida Occulta around 2004 after getting an x-ray for Scoliosis. I went to Children's National in Washington D.C. from the age of 12 to 21 once a year and everything was fine and I never experienced any major issues. \n\nFast forward to August 2014 and I got my first kidney infection. I had no symptoms leading up to the kidney infection, which was odd, but I took my abx and got better. In November 2014 I became pregnant with my first child. By the time I was 12 weeks pregnant, I got another kidney infection. Unfortunately, this one put me in the hospital for 3 days and I was told if I would have waited 12 more hours to seek treatment I would have likely lost the baby and went septic.  Since those incidents,  I get about 3-4 kidney infections every year and a UTI at least once a month. \n\nAbout 3 months ago I started to experience urinary incontinence. I will mention I had x2 c-sections in 2015 and 2017 and I am not sure if that affects anything. However, after researching some things online it made me wonder if my urinary issues could be from my Spina Bifida.\n\nI went to the urologist in 2017 to see what could be wrong, but they performed a cystoscopy and found nothing. I am not sure if I mentioned Spina Bifida since it never really affected me, but now that I am thinking about it - I am not sure if they could be connected.  I am just looking for anyone who may have went through something similar or any advice. Thanks! My 8 month old has spina bifida, paralyzed from the waist down, and I can say with absolute confidence that it most likely is a result of the spina bifida. There is a chart on google (search \u201cspina bifida spine chart\u201d) that gives a general symptoms list for the defect level. Thank you for taking the time to comment. I will check that out here in a few minutes. So sorry to hear that about your little one, but thankful we have this little community to hopefully help you and your family navigate this new journey. Some level of urinary incontinence is completely common in Spina Bifida. It could be that your pregnancies simply exacerbated some minor/unnoticeable issues (for example, it could be that everything felt normal but actually you were not able to completely empty your bladder which I believe is a relatively common issue for spina bifida and why quite a few people with it rely on catheters). I had something similar happen as a child - several severe kidney infections in a row. Eventually lost one kidney as a result of it and now catheterise. \n\nHas the urologist you saw suggested anything after the cystoscopy came back normal? When I was getting recurrent UTIs (about 3-4 a year for a good 5 years) we eventually settled on 6-monthly Botox and 3x per week prophylactic (a low level antibiotic you take as a preventative measure). It is helped immensely and I have not had a single UTI in the last 18 months. Definitely should be talking to a urologist. My son has SB and needs catheters to empty otherwise he is does not get it all out. Seems like if you can go naturally you would be emptying but sometimes that level or feel is less noticeable to people with SB. But in our experience all kidney issues were from overfull bladders. I have had incontinence since birth to a degree, but after having my own child it did get a lot worse. Incontinence is definitely a SB thing sadly. You need to see a urologist familiar with spina bifida.  Check with your closet SB children\u2019s clinic in a major metropolitan area and see who they recommend for an adult.  The urologist needs to run a urodynamics test. \n\nFinally, and this is for everyone, constipation is a huge culprit of Incontinence.  people with SB almost always have constipation due to the nerves that control the colon being affected by their SB.  No one likes to talk about poop, but google the Bristol stool chart, and you need to be a 4 or 5. (Note that 6 or 7 can happen when liquid poop moves around hard stool, so you can still be constipated and be 6 or 7.) I have Spina Bifida Occulta and have problems with emptying my bladder all the way. It is become really difficult since I have to stop what I am doing over and over throughout the day. Also, I almost always have a bladder infection. This makes a lot of sense to me, and I am wondering if they are related. Thanks for posting this!", "How do you manage incontinence?

He can walk, has a limp and told me about him having SB when we first met. Problem is he hates discussing it. I do not have too many details related to his particular case. I have taken the time to read as much as I can to learn since he is really no help. \nOk so to the questions... Do all people who have SB suffer from incontinence? Also, does this happen during sex too? We are very sexually active and I have never really seen anything out of the ordinary, but there have been subtle hints...\nOnce he had an erection and when he pulled it out something came out, and he moved it to the side quickly then went to the restroom... I did not ask bc I did not want to embarrass him but He said it was precum, I did not see what it was but I am assuming it was urine. \nAlso, when we are having sex he prefers for me to be on top, I assumed it was preference but I noticed when he is on top or In a more dominant position (like standing) every so often I will see his hand move towards his behind, I am assuming he is checking for leakage? \nLastly, I know he does not wear diapers, but the other day he was messing around and pulled his or is out a little and I noticed (although he quickly covered and moved it) something in his boxers, it looked like a women's pad, after googling I found out there is these things called shields... I am assuming they are for leaks? \n\nAnyway, he is never told me about this, these are all assumptions based on my observations so I would like any insight from anyone who may have more knowledge. Also advice if I should bring it up and if so, how? \nAny other info regarding SB, relationships w someone w SB and anything else would be greatly appreciated! \nSorry about formatting, I am on my phone.  My guess is he is still young, early 20's?  We all suffer with incontinence to some degree.  I tried my best to hide it when I was young and it just caused more stress and depression when things went wrong.\n\nI would just get the mitrofanoff surgery and be done with it.  That is what I did and you can just wear underwear after it.\n\nSexual function is saved, and urine infections are drastically cut down.\n\n", "I have had to catheterize all my life. I am 28 years old. I just randomly regained control of my bladder and emptied it for the first time in my life. I discovered by accident that I can go on my own when I pulled the catheter out.

I am just really shocked and pretty happy right now. I think I heard the botox can do that? IDK, but wow! What was that like? I would be so freaked out. Wow! I have never heard about it.

I am an active person who does not need leg brace to walk, I work out daily to try to reverse the affects it is had on me but it is unchanged for years now . I just wanted to post this to say hi. Please if you have a question or concerns please state them in the description. I am very curious who else shares the same issues and disability. 24 year old female here, also do not need any assistance walking. Hello from California, my back pain says hello too lol Hey! Awesome of you to connect this way. I do not personally have it, but my 2 year old son does. Did you have any club foot or ankle problems when you were younger that did require some sort of brace or AFOs? Can you feel your feet, or is there no sensitivity? (From\nWhat we can tell, my son cannot feel anything below about 3-4 inches above his ankle) 25 female from Cali, same boat. I walk unassisted. I have the occulta form with a fracture around L5, DDD, and scoliosis. What part of CA? If you do not mind me asking. I always wanted to meet someone with SB who was similar in capabilities as me. Similar, but I am 31F. Over time it is gotten harder to walk or stand for long periods of time but I still fight. I go for walks out in the parks, even went hiking in Colorado recently, but not without pain. \n\nThe only advice I would give to my younger self is to enjoy each day to the best of your ability. I thought it would get better over time but in my case it is only gotten worse. I sacrificed a lot as a young adult planning for a future I do not have the energy for any more. \n\nNot saying to take stupid risks, but be prepared for the fact you might not have the physical ability of your abled friends and family in ten or twenty years. That is good advice! What type of spina bifida do you have? Hey, thanks for sharing. Dad to a 4 yo with SB at L4. Just curious if you have any recommendations for me on activities, lifestyle focuses or anything at all to help him with at a young age. Whether it be exercise, social comfort, or mobility and access. Thanks! I have SB Occulta. \n\nI have less feeling and control below the waist, especially my right side. I think if it almost like having a peg leg like a pirate lol, I cannot consciously control my foot on that side which makes me a terrible driver. I have to lift my whole leg instead of just pushing my foot at the ankle. The upside is I do not really feel getting spanked which has made for some fun sexual adventures :P\n\nI have had two detethering surgeries, when I was 12 and last year at 30. The one at 12 got back most of my bladder control but it is slowly gotten worse. I just cannot feel when I need to go until its the last second so I wear leak protection most of the time, which I only needed starting about two years ago.\n\nI guess that last bit is not something a 21 year old wants to think about but hearing other people\u2019s experiences hopefully can give you an idea of the possibilities and normalize talking about our issues and getting help when we need to. Give support, a lot of support. My parents did not tell me anything about this issue , I believe it was  normal till I was 15 . I have had many surgery\u2019s , I have had a catheter implanted as well as a chait tube. The best sport/activities to participate in is anything involving balance especially due to SB having a big issues below the waist. I would suggest soccer due to feet coordination and it also helps develop muscles in the lower legs. As the longer I got the more depression/anxiety I gained due to not feeling socially expected by the community. I hide the body dysmorphia for the longest which also fueled the depression and anxiety . I would highly recommend being honest with your child but let him know no matter what he will always feel loved and I please try to have a connection with your child as he matures. Mentally is it very hard on the person. I remember as a child I was in psychical therapy to learn how to walk \u201c normally \u201c .  But to summarize this conversation, balance is key , and psychological issues will occur but bonding and making them feel welcomed by all people will help extremely. Yes I do have a clubbed right foot but I still feel sensation below the knees . I am grandma to a 3-month-old boy with SB. Would you be willing to share how best to support my daughter, SIL, and their 3-month old? I will ask my wife what she thinks, however I know right off the top of my head one thing that I would have loved (and frankly still would haha) is if we felt like we could entrust the care of our son to someone else, whether it be for an afternoon or for overnight if we were to travel somewhere for a short vacation with just my wife and I.    \nThe main thing that prevents us from doing that is that our son has a couple of extra things we need to do every day that we of course have learned\u2026 but that kind of scares or makes others not want to even try. Things like how he needs to be catheterized 3-4 times a day\u2026 that is daunting if you have not ever done it before, however to me and especially my wife, it takes like 3 seconds to insert, about 30-60 seconds to drain\u2026 and it is done. It is just something that sounds a lot harder than it really is once you try it. And I know that both sets of grandparents do not know how to do it yet. If we were to do a getaway and leave the kids with grandma, they would need to know os how to do that, as well as how to turn on the oxygen Cpap mask that we now have.     \n\nAnyways, just volunteer to help watch the kid and learn the things necessary to do that, and they will feel a lot of relief and help. Thanks so much for all of this, it is helpful. Please know if you or your wife would like to DM with more information, I am happy to learn. \n\nJust this afternoon we learned that the 1st shunt surgery will be at the end of the month; it rather dashed everyone is spirits.

You probably have an IEP. *USE IT!* If you are allowed 5 minutes to get to your next class so you are not caught in traffic? Take advantage of it! Especially if they do not have it in your IEP that you can carry a backpack and you have to go to your locker like everyone else.\n\n3. Be prepared for people to talk shit about you, even if they do not say it to your face. Especially people accusing you of running over toes with your chair. Let us be honest, high schoolers can be turds and being in a wheelchair is going to make you an easy target. There were plenty of times I heard people talking right behind me about hitting them with my chair thinking either I could not hear them or was too stupid to understand. But it is like I have always heard, it are not what they call you, it is what you answer to. Someone has something smart to say that you know is not true? Screw  them. And if you do accidentally run over someone is toes? Apologize immediately. It will likely happen at least once, I know school hallways can get pretty cramped during class changes. Thanks.  I forgot to say I do have myleomeningocele but I can walk,  so the wheelchair problem will not happen with me.  No problem. I am serious about taking advantage of your IEP if you have one. I was too stubborn to take advantage of what they offered me, aside from carrying a backpack so I did not have to use a locker. High school can be tough. Use your IEP. Develop a thick skin. Utilize your counselor services. Do not be afraid to ask for help. \n\nOther kids are going to find ways to ridicule you. That said, do not give them reasons to do so.

I had detethering at 8. In my early 30's, my incontinence got worse, so I underwent another detethering. It did not help and made some things worse.\n\nOf course, when I was consulting the neurosurgeon, he said you cannot actually see tension on a CT scan, so you cannot technically know if it is tethered again or not. Probably was not in my case. Okay, that is super helpful. Thank you! Hello friend,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cannot speak with scientific certainty on this, but my experience was repeated re-tethering. I was born in 1984 and had my first detethering surgery at 3 years old. I have since had to have 8 or 9 detethering operations (cannot remember exactly since i was so young), but the final prognosis is that I am no longer a candidate for surgery because I have THAT much scar tissue there from my surgeries.

I had a urodynamics test and it came back as having high pressure (which of course I looked up) and it said it usually damages the kidneys.... but my urologist said they kidneys looked fine on the I guess little screen they use to fill my bladder up. But now I am kind of freaking out because I feel brushed off like if what you said I have is supposed to cause kidney damage than why are you saying they look fine? Hi. With high bladder pressures there is a possibility that urine can back flush up into your kidneys causing damage. But just because you have high pressures does not automatically mean this is happening and your kidneys have damage. I also have high bladder pressures but my kidneys are absolutely fine. I have a yearly renal ultrasound just to make sure and I have never had an issue. I think the key is to make sure you are emptying your bladder regularly to prevent increased pressures which will in turn limit urine back flushing into your kidneys. Just some thoughts from my own personal experience (I am not a medical professional). Yeah I am a huge hypochondriac to begin with. Besides the point the only real thing she brought up was my bladder was not shaped like a normal bladder it was not as round she put me on Detrol to I guess help with that? I am not sure what Detrol is to be honest I just take it lol and I get a renal ultrasound as well and I have never had a problem either they usually send me for lab work to and I think this whole thing started with my last labs my creatine was .1 higher than last year I went from 0.5 to 0.6 of course nothing wrong i had just built muscle because I started going to the gym Detrol is used to help control the muscle spasms in your bladder (it relaxes the muscles). This may allow your bladder to relax and take on a more normal shape. An unpleasant side effect of this type of medication is dry mouth. HECK YES! I get the most dry mouth on this stuff I am constantly drinking water! There is a line of oral products (mouthwashes, toothpastes etc) found in drugstores that can help with dry mouth called Biotene. It will help mitigate dental issues that can be caused by persistent dry mouth. Nice! I will have to get that! 2 in 1 deal cleans your mouth to! And makes your mouth feel better because it helps put some moisture back in. Yeah I use mouthwash to begin with but I feel like to just drys my mouth out more if it is not drying my mouth out it is not making it better but again it is just usual listerine I personally take Oxybutynin to relax my bladder, (pill form does not leave any bad breath or dry mouth). I was on oxybutynin but the side effects were so bad for me they had to put me on Detrol at a much lower dose just keep up your schedule, should be okay.", "Anyone have kids?

Anyone have kids or anyone who does not want kids for this reason?  \nAlso wondering is it worth the stress of taking the chance the baby would have SB?  \nThose of you with kids, do you find your days too challenging taking care of yourself and the child? Or do they bring joy to your days and give you a feeling of normalcy? I have a kid and I do not have limited mobility but I do have weaker back and leg strength.

My husband does not have SB and he helps a lot. I (39F) have spina bifida (I walk without any aids but I do have muscles weakness). I decided at a very young age that I did not want kids. 1. A little bit of fear of passing it on. And 2. Life is already a struggle and I could not imagine that I would have the mental capacity or physical stamina to have a child. \nI do not regret my decision at all! I am (36M) also leaning against having kids for this reason.  However, the odds of it happening because I have it, which appear to be 4%, are not terrible, so maybe I will change my mind on that.

She is the best mom I ever could have asked for. Her positive attitude and resilience definitely played a part. I know that she took a lot of folic acid when trying to conceive, but my sister and I both have a mild case of SB. Overall, I think it would be a good idea to see a genetic counselor or a reproductive doc to address any specific questions. But I think if you have the proper support and really want to have kids, that you should not let SB hold you back. Is mild SB the occulta form or another type? Hi I have SB occulta and scoleosis, but it does not affect me much (other than fluid headaches when my head is reclined a certain way).\n\nWe are not sure about my twin sister-- She recently had back surgery bc of Spondylosis and a bilateral fracture (so we are not sure if it is related to SB or not).", "New Moderator.

It is a long story but there were multiple mistakes made at my local hospital, then I finally went to Boston (where I should have gone in the first place) and they took care of it. Sounds terrible but happy they took care of it It was a really bad time for me because it was the first time I would been in the hospital for days since I had surgery as a kid (if you do not count when I had my son, which was a happy time, so totally different). I really do not recommend kidney stones. Yeah I had a bladder stone, actually it was more of a rock Mine was large too, 9mm I think. That is one reason it was hard to get out.

Hear me out on this (I could not think of a title for this) So basically I went in for my yearly renal ultrasound a few days ago and everything came back fine but my urologist looked back to 4 years ago when she had sent me for a kidney function test. They tested my creatine and it came back as 0.6 (which should not be high) but anyway she made a big deal out of it and made me see a nephrologist which she said I was fine and I probably had low muscle mass (I would have to agree with her) But now she wants me to get a cystatin C test tomorrow and I am a little worried that the results will come back and she will freak out again and it turns out to be nothing and the last thing I want is to see another doctor. Now I know their doctors but this urologist seems to REALLY play it on the safe side which obviously is their job but she kind of made me freak out when she was concerned about the OG creatinine. Anyway is it just me or are all urologists like this? I admit a lot of what you said terminology-wise sounds like Latin lol but it really sounds like your urologist is walking the thin line between thorough and batty. I agree she scares the crap out of me with these terms and she is got no personality she is so serious all the time I feel like I am going to be told I am dying every time I see her lol I had a neurologist when I was still seen by the pediatric clinic that had a personality like that. The first time my dad met him he asked a nurse afterward if he was always that much of an asshole. We did not get along until right before I transferred out of the ped. clinic to the adult one and had a shunt malfunction that went unnoticed because I was asymptomatic and was only caught on a CT scan. After that I really do not think I can butt heads with a guy that practically saved my life lol. You had no symptoms? I never heard of that luckily I have not had a problem with my shunt in almost 16 years but I had symptoms every time Yeah, it was really weird. Once I got to the adult clinic, I met the neurosurgeon for a formal introduction visit. Part of the conversation basically went\n\nHer: You know you are probably old enough that your brain has probably formed a natural shunt around the tube and you might not need it anymore.\n\nMe: Yeah, let us just keep that a theory, doc.

I agree 100% I used to go to a clinic and at that time I was over 50lbs overweight and so I decided to go keto and long story short they asked how I got the weight off a year later and I told them I did keto and they said I was healthier being obese then being a normal weight. Did not run any test they just flat out assumed and I have eaten low carb/keto now for almost 3 years and I have not been healthier (these were all females) then you have drs telling me a high protein diet will cause my kidneys to fail but I do not eat anywhere near that level of protein what is next lifting weights 4 days a week will cause some organ to fail it is ridiculous congratulations on your weightloss!!! \n\"no. lifting weights will guaranteed damage your spinal cord and bodybuilding is only for dumb brutes and you dont need that.\" \nbecause dem doctors only can envision unaided powerlifting rocks in the woods. they are ignorant of machine aided bodybuilding, theyre unable to understand that one does not lift rocks or cars, and that pumping iron with dumbbell bars can not possibly hurt your spine. \n\nlet them talk and go your own way. you know your body and its limitations best. and i can only salute you for your decisions to improve yourself.

(some details about surgery/IV's in the next couple paragraphs if that bothers you)\n\n\\-I had to deal with surgeries all throughout my childhood, and I was in the clear for about 15 years but I am in my late 30's now and I am hitting some health issues that require surgery again. The worst part for me is getting an IV, I am very hard to stick especially if I have had to fast for surgery. Because of my health issues, even some procedures that should be simple are more difficult and involved for me. I just came home from trying to get a kidney stone out that I have had since the beginning of December. I was in the hospital for 5 days because they did not want to go in through my urethra because of all the reconstruction I have had there, and then a different doctor took out the tube that they put in the kidney so they could get it out through there. So they sent me home with a stent in and set an appointment to come back and try to get it out through my urethra (which they did not want to do in the first place).   \n\n\nFirst of all they tried 5 times to get the IV in, and I told them which spot works best (I was just in the hospital with an IV in early December so I told them where it was) and they refused to try it because \"It is a hard place to put an IV let alone draw blood\". They tried both hands and my other arm and they were talking about trying my feet and neck (I had a neck IV as a kid, not fun) and I was like, can you please try where it worked last time?? They tried it last and wow, it worked. But then the procedure did not work--it was at a local hospital so now I am being scheduled to go into the city hospital to try again.  \n\n\nRecently I have heard that someone who had been through so much as a kid would have ptsd; it totally makes sense but I never thought of it that way. So I was wondering if any of you have dealt with many hospitalizations and ptsd coming from that, and things you do to cope with it. I get very depressed and hopeless when I think about having to deal with this kind of stuff for the rest of my life.\n\nThank you :) I do not know about ptsd but my 12 year old has panic attacks if she knows she is going to the doctor. Once a nurse asked if she wanted stickers and she heard \"stick her\" and freaked. \nGoing through so many surgeries and hospital stays has to take its toll, maybe you should find a therapist and speak with them about it, maybe they could help with some coping strategies. Thank you :) My brother is 47 and most definitely has it. And he feels like every surgery either fails or creates more problems.  Things had been going ok until I became an adult and nobody knew what to do with my childhood modifications. lol That is his issue too. He also is a bit rearranged internally, so doctors, even those specializing in whatever issue he is dealing with, do not know what to do with him. Hey there, \n\nI am so sorry to hear about your hospital experiences. I am sending you good thoughts and well wishes. I have been there and being repeatedly stabbed to get an IVs in is awful. For a while as a kid they had to put them in my foot because they could not get veins in my arms. \n\nFrom personal experience, I can say absolutely to your question about PTSD. I have been diagnosed  with c-PTSD as a result of traumatic hospital experiences as a child. I am in my 30s now and only a few months ago I had a full blown panic attack on the way to the hospital for an annual check up. I also suffer from disassociation the second I step into a hospital and everything starts to feel floaty and distant. For years after I turned 18, I did not attend my check-ups and avoided anything to do with my SP to the bare minimum (i have to ISC so managing that is required even when I was in denial). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat helped? Therapy - specifically for c-ptsd, meditation, also forms of yoga breathing called pranayama. I have tried SSRIs - they do help but the side effects meant they were not a long term solution for me. I do some time use beta blockers for hospital appointments. I did a lot of work on trying to accept my body also. I guess for a long time I saw it as a broken 'object' for drs and the source of so much conflict and pain. Most of all understanding what was happening in my body from feeling depressed to the panic as PTSD was hugely helpful. All the responses my body had were protective coping mechanisms. Crappy ones for sure! But know that feeling the way I did because my body did not want me to go through the trauma again ans was trying to protect me helped me to start to work with those feelings rather than feel extreme levels of anxiety and crashing levels of depression. It is a continual work in progress and some days are better than other but I do feel some change and I hope that you can find the ways that work for you to find that too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would also recommend The Body Keeps the Score - a great book that really helped me understand more about trauma. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Thank you!

Nope, I do not have blood clotting or any problems of that kind.

What can I do for self care, and how can I mediate and/or make things easier for myself pain wise? \n\nThanks in advance. One of the things I find helps me when I have general aches and pains is over the counter ibuprofen. Exercise is pretty key because your core is technically compromised and needs constant stretching and movement. I am more wheelchair bound because I have SB type myelomeningocele so I may not have as much range of motion as you do (I will not assume to know how much you have currently) but if you have more range of motion make sure you are working on keeping that up. As for pain, try over the counter as much as you can until it is time for prescription as weird as that sounds. I find cannabis helps me relax but that may not be an option for you. Thank you so much for your help! I have always had issues with a weak core and well... weak everything and it is tough because I can be lazy, so I definitely need to push myself more to strengthen things. \nI have seen that losing weight can help with it so I am slowly but surely battling myself to get to a healthier weight (5\u20195 208 lbs currently) Otherwise so far it seems like I would have occulta/closed SB but until they call me to schedule the mri and it gets done I do not know what type I have just yet! \n\nThe pain is annoying/can be more severe from time to time and some days I am just used to it but it is definitely hard to know I cannot particularly fix it either. OTC stuff like Tylenol has been helping a little bit and it is also great you mentioned cannabis! I have partaken quite a bit and it helps me feel mellow on and off but I have not used it enough to see how it helps with pain. The kinds I have used lately have made me a bit antsy so I need to research more on it or at least use less of a dose. Edibles are the best though! \n\nThanks so much for your advice, and I do have one last question...\n\nWhat is one thing you wish someone told/taught you about spina bifida that you had to find out on your own? Honestly? How much it can affect your mindset. When you are young, you are not thinking a lot about your situation because you have to learn how to adapt. But as you get older and you realize what it means to be confined to a wheelchair for life and it can weigh on you. If you catch yourself having these thoughts, recognize them, and let them pass. Do not react to them, do not give them any attention. \n\nThank you for this. Had I known the tools to strengthen myself or had the support or treatment I needed I do not know if my symptoms might have lessened or if we couldve stopped it from worsening further. :-) \nI do not know if I will have to be confined to a wheelchair or have to use one quite yet, but to be candid I do not want to have one and it feels like I am just stuck in an emotional one... because of how I look, how my bathroom habits are and how I have had to stop &amp; rest earlier than most due to the fatigue. (And all the other little things) Every day without treatment I feel like it is just getting worse. And now I have to wait weeks on end for an mri to confirm and an ortho 4-6 weeks after that... and I do not know what they would do for surgery if any. But hopefully it does not get to the point of a wheelchair, I want to hold onto as much mobility as I can while I can.  \n\nMy mindset definitely has not been the best lately so that was a really keen reminder. In the moment I can never catch myself having these negative thoughts and just let them go but I have taken these words to heart and I will try my hardest to let them pass. (Am also looking for a therapist to discuss this and other life events as well, because it is been so stressful the past couple of months) \n\nThank you so much again for everything, I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me about this. Wishing you well in your journey, thanks for helping me a bit with mine! :-) \n\n-Mel", "Did any of you all take growth hormone growing up?

Because of how much I get bullied. Because of everytime I went on holiday I had strangers staring at my legs. I have had over 50 operations. Scars everywhere. I used to play football everyday now I struggle to get out of bed some days. I am only 17 the worst is yet to come. I am really struggling. The things I once loved I have lost interest in. There just seems to be no hope anymore People are cruel, and they often only stare because they are simply ignorant and do not understand what they are looking at.  I had no idea what spina bifida was until my daughter was diagnosed with it early in my girlfriends pregnancy.\n\n\nI know it must be hard not to feel sad about everything given you have had so many operations but I promise you that things do get better despite how dark they can be.  \n\n\nIf you ever wanted to reach out or vent to someone that might actually understand some of the things you are going through please feel free to message me directly.  Tomorrow is a new day :) sending positive thoughts and vibes your way! Thankyou :) things get tough and I get emotional from time to time. Word of advice for your situation (I love giving advice) I have found lately I am putting on a brave face but I am actually in a lot of pain just something to watch out for :) You know, it is probably a little sad, but I learned to be indifferent towards most people. I mean, I care deeply for my closest friends, but others can, to put it bluntly, kiss my ..... \n\nI remember that when I was your age, I was depressed about my future and what others thought of me, because I use wheelchair since childhood. Thinking there is nothing for me.  But now, I have a good job (I was bullied in my first workplace, I finally got the courage to quit and now I just love my new job!), several good friends, many hobbies to keep me busy. No partner unfortunately and this aspect of life bugs me, but I have several hobbies that keep me busy so I do not have much time to ponder on this very often. \n\nI know that everybody is saying this to you probably and you feel probably really tired of hearing this, but: Hold on! Things will get better! If you ever need to vent, talk, complain, share experience - I am here for you. I related to almost all of this. I am so scared oft future. Thanks man Always remember - there are people who got it worse then us. Much worse. There will be better and worse times, but almost every human on the planet has got it like this. That is life. It has its ups and downs. I know that people with disability like us maybe have more of the bad days, but what I do and what helps me when I feel lousy is that I remember also the good days, when I succeeded at something or somebody was nice to me. I know that is why I never speak up about my feelings ever to anyone I actually know anyway. I feel dumb when I complain but I cannot help it I am in pain constantly my morphine does not help anymore it is hard Trying to fit in a a teen is harder than being an adult in a lot of ways. All the BS kind of goes by the wayside or that is my experience anyway. My youngest daughter has spina bifida. I do not know you personally but I love my kids all the same which is immensely so there is nothing inherent to your condition that makes you less worthy or important than anybody else. Everybody has their struggles although I totally understand that you have got physical challenges to overcome that most do not. Stick at it. Thankyou :) I hope your daughter has a great life \ud83d\ude4f all the best for you and your family. One thing I will say is although SB is mostly physical the mental side is massive which most people ignore. I am sorry man. You have every right to be upset and disturbed. People can really suck.\n\nI remember being in highschool not too long ago and having to deal with bullies and stigma of disability. I can tell you that those things got much better for me after highschool. I do not understand why or how bullying gets so bad then, but that seems to be the peak. College, jobs, and adulthood in general has its own challenges, but nothing quite a terrible as bullying. Plus focusing on the people who gave me a helping hand, kindness, or love gave me strength to endure.\n\nI do not know what kind of access you might have to counselors or help, but I would strongly suggest that you seek it out. I, personally, had a really hard teenage to young adult time because I had undiagnosed depression. Loss of interest in things I love, should have been a red flag I paid more attention to. Unfortunately, I did not really look into it until I was in my late 20's and inwardly struggling every day to maintain my livelihood and career.\n\nThose of us with Spina Bifida are much more likely to have psychological issues at any point in our lives. So even if you do not need it now, I think it is good to get in the practice of talking about it with medical professionals.  I do not mean to harp on this point, but it is a mistake I made that I do not want others to endure.\n\nAlso another thought that I would like to share. Despite what it may seem like at the moment, most average people do stare at what is visually different from their expectations, but it is not with disgust or really any negative emotion. Most people are just curious by default. I have friends who dress strangely, who behave strangely (ranging from socially awkward to autism to diagnosed ocd ticks), who are transgender, and who are physically disabled and all of them contend with staring on some level. I think most of them have imparted to me that they get used to it because they realize that 99% of those staring do it because our brains (instincts) compel us to look at things that are different and not because people are gawking, judging, or thinking anything shameful. I know that this might not be helpful or satisfying to hear, but it helped me deal with the moments that my disability exposes me to public attention or embarrassment.\n\nI hope you get the support and relief you need to get through these tough circumstances and make it through to somewhere better. Thankyou I am going to ask my college for some mental help. Recently when my parents have gone on \u2018pool\u2019 holidays I have refused because of the staring I get from strangers. I am pretty sure I am depressed but it is really hard to talk to people I know about it. I am going to try. Thankyou Glad to hear it. 1 thing I have learned is I really need help from others. If I try to do everything myself, it is just unsustainable. I have always been that friend that helps people never the other way around I tried once and they did not know what to say so it did not really help Hey bud. I know exactly how you feel. Every time I go out someone stares at my scars. I used to get bullied a lot too. But I made really wonderful friends who stood up for me, and now I feel a lot better! My advice to you; keep going strong! Soon you will find someone just like you and they will stick up for you. You are worth it. You are awesome. And above all else, you are incredibly strong. &lt;3 I really do hope so! Thankyou so much &lt;3 You are welcome! If you ever want to talk, I am pretty good at listening to people.

", "Sister is pregnant with baby diagnosed with spina bifida I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, but during my sister's anatomy scan a few weeks ago she became aware that her baby boy is diagnosed with spina bifida myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus, a club foot, and chiari malformation type II. His spine is effected from L3 to the bottom of the Sacrum. His bowel, bladder, and walking abilities will be limited. This is a very extensive case and she is currently living in a 30 foot trailer, making a combined $20,000 a year income with her partner and on state issued health insurance. The options they were given to either get a neonatal surgery during the pregnancy to try to repair the spina bifida, terminate the pregnancy, or continue through the pregnancy and have the surgeries done post delivery. They have decided to keep the baby and take a shot at trying to provide for him. I am just so worried about the future of this child, and for my sister and her partner. I am worried they will be finacially, emotionally, and physically strained. \n\nI am hoping some of you could offer some support, insight or any other advice that could help me support my sister through these coming times.  If they are near a family resource center they should visit and find out what organizations they can refer to. A lot of them will help cover costs of children with special needs. What city/state are they in, if you do not mind me asking? They can also call 211 for resources, they can find their local number here at the top of the page ( My sister is located in Portland, Oregon. They have Oregon health plan.  Try here  You are awesome for being so concerned but worry is not what they need. \n\nYou have started off on the right foot by posting this question here. My suggestion is they find a group local to them (Facebook is good for this) to get ideas about assistance because each state is different. The group near me once held education sessions as well as equipment swaps. Then they should find a pediatrician and have the pediatrician give them referrals to specialists they will deal with. They can get a tour of the NICU where the baby will stay for a while. Knowledge is the best thing for them and your nephew.  One of the doctors may know of a family near them that has recently gone through all of this.\n\nMy son is 18, a semester away from graduating high school and accepted into college. He has a similar defect, is in a wheelchair full time and plays baseball.  I would bet there is a support group for SB families in Portland. I would recommend starting there. FWIW the specialists in Portland have a good reputation.  I had a baby with spina bifida and my wife did the fetal surgery. The research is sound and fetal surgery offers the best chance for the baby. I highly recommend that course. \n\nThere are many (over ten?) Hospitals in the US that perform the surgery. Where are you located? \n\nI would not worry about the financials. The baby will qualify for many financial offsets simply due to the unfortunate circumstances of the spina bifida. There will be many appointments and whatnot, but who knows, it may be what your sister needs in her life right now. \n\nIf she does go through with it, there is an amazing Facebook group for parents who go through with the spina bifida fetal surgery. There are decades of experience with all sides and facets of spina bifida on that page and they are all so helpful. \n\nIf you have any questions I am here and will do my best to answer them. For now though the next couple weeks will go by quickly if they do the surgery because it needs to be done as soon as possible to offer the most benefit. Good luck and godspeed. \n\nOh also, like the other poster said, just be there. Offer to help by doing research, offering an ear, cleaning, whatever. Just be there and that is enough. Offer to listen to the recap of the meetings with the doctors. There will be many of those and it will likely get very emotional, so just be there and ride the emotional waves with her.  I myself had almost this exact same diagnosis when I was born down to the fact I am also level L3-L4. Was born before they could operate prebirth, my parents were never rich (combined annual income less than 40,000) they struggled, there wasnt alot of money to go around when I was a kid but I never went without something that I needed for my health. They sacrificed a ton for me and because of that Im 25, in law school, able to walk and have more bladder/bowl function than I was told I would have. I guess my point is it will be tough but medical advances are better than they were 25 years ago and continue to improve I have both state insurance and medicare so maybe the child will be eligible for medicare someday with its disability. Its going to be tough but with a little help and a whole lot of love they will make it. Hey, Cupcake\\_11, just a quick heads-up:  \n**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  \nHave a nice day!\n\n^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment. Financially, your nephew should qualify for disability, that will help your sister financially a little bit. He should also qualify for a medical card through the state, if he gets disability he will automatically qualify for medical. If he gets state medical coverage, your sister can be reimbursed for driving to all doctors appointments, here its called NEMT, not sure about your state but worth looking into. If she gets state medical coverage, they may reimburse her for driving to doctors appointments also. If your nephew may qualify for the state IDD waiver program, once he is old enough to determine if he qualifies, he needs to be put on the waiting list as soon as possible. You can be on the waiting list for years before getting a spot, so the younger he is when he gets on the list, the better. \nUltimately, there are programs designed to help, your sister just has to take the time to research and apply for help. It will take years and a lot of patience.\nMedically, I recommend keeping a binder with his important medical information in it, sometimes remembering dates of surgeries or little things that may be important later is hard to do. \nBe there to support her and her husband, it is not going to be easy, it is going to be frustrating and tiring and sometimes they are going to want to give up, but it is worth it. If your willing to help with your nephew, take the time to learn what he needs day to day so that if your sister needs a break (she will), she will be comfortable knowing you can care for him for a day and know what to do if an issue arises. I am going to stress this because you are sister will need a break but she will be reluctant to leave him with anybody especially if they do not know his specific needs. \nLast thing I can think of right now, when he gets old enough to appreciate it, he will qualify for Make A Wish. Anybody can recommend him, but he can only have one wish, so make sure it is at a time when he will remember and can enjoy it and its memories.\n Wow...yes there are reasons why the US birth rate is currently at an all time low. Even people with healthy babies are struggling to provide now. I have a pregnant friend in a similar situation (on medicaid etc.) and have no idea how she plans to pay for her healthy baby after its born.\n\nYou know what she told me though? That at almost 30 years old she does not think she will be making any more money in a few years so she might as well have a baby while she still can... \n\nAnd that is what it is like for many living in my area of the country: still living at home at the age of 30 after graduating from college; working the same minimum wage jobs that used to be reserved for high school students.\n\nIf nothing else know that many with healthy babies are in the same situation now. I hope you can find some comfort in knowing that. Good luck. We are all praying for her. wow, that is what the world needed. a grammar nazi bot. \n\n&amp;#x200B; I am sure your sister has already looked into this but just in case she has not - Shriners Hospitals for Children is amazing. They have one in Portland too! My daughter was born with SB and we had the opportunity to take her to Shriners, they had top notch care and really work with the families if they cannot afford things.

They always did their best to treat me the same way as my siblings. They did not hold me back. They let me figure out what I could and could not do.

Mainly around the weight gain it can cause.\n\nBit of back ground- I have diastomatomyelia (a form of spina bifida), and a tethered cord. My spinal cord is split into two and is constantly being pulled down and the nerves are frayed. I had surgery when I was 11, but the risk is 70% paralysis if I have anymore surgery done.\n\nI have tried gabapentin before for the nerve pain which worked well, but then after a few months it stopped working completely. I gained a few pounds but nothing too bad. My pain doctor suggested Pregablin last year but i was too reluctant because of the weight gain issue.

This may be an odd question and I hope nobody takes offence on it, but hear me out.\n\nI have been learning a lot about 'identity' and let us be honest: we live in a society who loves to label every part of our identity, like race, gender, sexual orientation etc. \n\nOn paper I have a quite severe form of spina bifida but because of some medical wonders, problems are actually almost non-existent. I have one weaker leg and I am clumsy, my bladder is on the smaller side and it is getting worse, I have scoliosis and tethered cord etc, but because I never knew otherwise, these things do not bother me. I feel like my 'disability' is invisible and therefor I find it very hard to relate to the disability community. When I would say I am part of it, people will tell me that I am not because I can function normally, which is true. But I also feel like I am not entirely part of the non-disability community, because of the spina bifida. \n\nAre there people who are in the same position as me? How do you handle this? Do you feel like you are part of one of those communities? I am going through like a mini-identity-crisis right now. Firstly, it is really amazing that you do not feel like you have many limitations, you should really cherish that! Disability comes in all shapes and sizes and absolutely no one has the right to tell you you are not \u201cdisabled enough\u201d. As a person who cannot function normally, I fully welcome and accept you as part of this community, if this is where you would like to be. :) I also have spina bifida, although I walk on crutches and need leg braces to walk. I was raised to be \"normal\". Expected to do basically everything most people do. As a result, i am extrememy independent and do not really think about my disability much, unless it gets in the way, like stairs i cannot get up. \n\nI really do not think of myself as being disabled. I think of it as I get around differently than others. I think not being around other disabled people most of my life has also played a part in this. When I have met other disabled people, they are usually very focused on their disability and how unfair things are, and angry about it, or are like \"poor me, I cannot do anything\" which i absolutely cannot identify with. So, no, i do not really identify with the disabled community. yes and no. i feel the same way as you\u2014 i have never even told anyone i had a disability till recently and nobody can tell either way haha. \n\ni have a very mild form of SB and even my own family does not consider me \u201cdisabled\u201d. so it feels like i am disabled, internally(?!?!) but not externally. i still like to participate in disability awareness &amp; inclusion events I have L3 so I walk with braces! I HATE the term \"special needs\" cant STAND it! I tell people to call me anything but special needs in fact I make my spina bifida a joke and tell people to refer to me as a \"vegetable\" or \"physically retarded\" (obviously not trying to offend other people on this sub reddit with those terms) but I like joking around with other people because I feel like joking around with it makes people feel less sorry for me! I do anything and everything to be as normal as possible if I cant do something physically I WILL figure out how to do it and honeslty I havent had a physical challenge I couldnt figure out! I lift weights 4 days a week and have earned the respect of a bunch of the other guys in the gym! So while I technically am disabled I dont Identify as disabled because I havent had anything stop me physically! &gt;I think not being around other disabled people most of my life has also played a part in this. When I have met other disabled people, they are usually very focused on their disability and how unfair things are, and angry about it, or are like \"poor me, I cannot do anything\" which i absolutely cannot identify with.

I think we are in a much better era of awareness and acceptance. And I think that is the most important outcome of labels and finding identity.\n\nOverall, it is been a yes and no situation. When I was younger I definitely did not feel a part of the community because I could blend in and I did everything I could to because when you are young you are terrified of non-conformity that you do not get to choose.\n\nAs I have gotten older, I really have come to appreciate how much it colored my identity and personality. The habits I developed and the careful approach I took to the world. As well as I am finding it a little harder to cope with some of the complications that can arise. Particularly mental health struggles seem to have become the primary issue as I attempt to continue my career.\n\nSo as I have gotten older, grappled more with it, and become more comfortable with it is true influence I have come to appreciate it is as important and shaping a part of who I am as any other fundamental experience. I have thought about this so many times. Because I do not use a chair, I do not quite feel like I belong to the disability community which has so many more mobility challenges, but I do not also fit in with the able-bodied because of my physical appearance. I have one leg longer than the other, club feet and scoliosis brought on by spina bifida. My wife has CP, and uses a walker, and sometimes her chair, so I understand the difficulties faced by those who need to use a chair.  Friendships are difficult when you do not quite feel like you belong either place. Probably baggage I carry around. I also have Spina Bifida. I wear afo's to walk and sometimes use a wheelchair when I have blisters on my feet. I was raised to be fairly \"normal\", whatever normal is. I am independent. I live on my own, I co own an online business with a friend of mine, and I also own an online business of my own hence my reddit username. Like MobileSatisfaction16, I also do not think of myself as disabled and when I have met other disabled people they have had a poor me I cannot do anything mentality which I do not identify with. So to answer your question even though I have Spina Bifida I do not really identify with the disabled community. I feel like you described me to a T - I always explained myself to others as being on the fence: not in a wheelchair, so not seen as disabled by the disability community and not fully able-bodied so always looked at as not fitting in there. I have chatted with a number of very high functioning people with SB and it is a common scenario where the folks in chairs do not see us as \"fully disabled\" thereby leading to a bit of ostracization from the disability community. Good luck! I feel exactly the same way! I am 42 and although I have had challenges over the years with walking, bladder, AFO's etc, I have never really seen myself as \"disabled\".  I grew up in a normal household, I have a sister and parents who are supportive and I have been fortunate to have had a pretty normal upbringing. \n\nI recently got into a program similar to an SB Clinic, but for adults at a local hospital and since then, they have been running all kinds of tests. I do use a wheelchair for things like shopping or events.  It is pretty apparent by the way that I walk, that I have SB, but I have never really thought about it too much. EARS. It is not bad enough to need a shunt and I do apparently have a tethered cord. \n\nI recently got into a program similar to an SB Clinic, but for adults, at a local hospital and since then, they have been running all kinds of tests.

For this project, we are using pressure mats to measure information about the participant's posture while they are seated on a wheelchair cushion.\n\nEligible participants must be:\n\n1. A current wheelchair user\n2. Aged 18 years or older\n3. Able to transfer on and off their chair independently\n\nParticipating in this study involves a single 30-120 minute visit to our lab at Georgia Tech's campus. We would have the participant transfer off their chair, attach the weight shift sensor underneath their cushion, place a pressure mat on top of the cushion, and have them transfer back to their chair. During the study, the participant may be asked to move in their chair and shift their weight at various times. As a thank-you for participating, we will send every participant a $20 gift card. As an additional part of the study, the sensor mat may be left in the participant's cushion for 1 or 2 days in order to record their normal, everyday movement.\n\nIf you are interested in participating or have any questions about the study, please feel free to contact us!

Just wondering if anybody knows of a spray-on-lubricant I could use for my multi-use catheter so I do not have to manually apply a gel with my hands. Thanks! Not quite sure about spray on lubricants, but have you heard of Coloplast speedicath catheters? They are super compact and come pre-lubricated, virtually no mess. They are extremely convenient, by far the best catheters I have ever used. Oh, absolutely, they kick ass! It is only that they are freaking expensive and bulky if you want to travel for a while. I always use them one planes when things have to go quick and with no mess. I just squeeze the lubricant onto a wipe. Oh, that is quite interesting! Never occurred to me. Cheers, bro! Much appreciated! By the way, what brand are you using? Pro advance In seriousness? \ud83d\ude33 Yeah, the lube comes in squeezable tubes, just DO NOT leave the tube near the toothpaste. Ah, OK. Was actually looking for a spray I do not know of any spray-on lubricants, but if you use alcohol swabs you can put lubricant on that package. I would tear off the edge of the swab package and then pull the two sides of the package away from each other and put lubricant on the foil on the inside, but you could also just put lubricant on the outside Yeah, not a bad idea.

I am currently experiencing an exacerbation of depression (I am being treated), and I am considering that it may in part be due to PTSD due to lifelong medical trauma (we all know what that is like, right?). Has anyone considered this idea or been diagnosed with it by a mental health provider? I am sorry to hear your experiencing an increase of depression, glad you are getting the help you need and I hope things start to feel better for you soon \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI do not have SB, but my daughter does. I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD due to a lot of trauma surrounding her medical condition and it is accompanying issues, including a misdiagnosis that nearly killed her. Does that count as medical PTSD? I would imagine that parents of SB kids could experience very similar trauma to bifers ourselves. Knowing what my own parents have gone through, SB has been as hard or harder on them than it has been on me. In addition to grief, parents probably experience helplessness, isolation and maybe guilt. I have never been diagnosed with PTSD but it is possible. Everyone handles trauma differently, two people can go through the same thing and one person could get ptsd while the other does not. I find it really interesting. If you had a great support system and coping skills during your life for instance, you are less likely to develop ptsd. If you are being treated for depression, do you have a therapist or a psychiatrist? Or both? I recently did an intake appointment with a psychiatrist, who gave me a diagnosis (he did not mention PTSD) and prescribed meds. Soon, I will be having talk therapy appointments with a psychologist or an LCSW (I am not yet sure of his credentials). My thinking about the PTSD is that we have subjectively and objectively terrifying things happen to us from birth and throughoutour lives, especially when we are very young and cannot understand what is happening to us. Sure, things calm down in adulthood, but in spite of the fact that you can have your medical issues locked down, that situation can rapidly fail and shizz can hit the fan. I do not see how, given those situations, we cope. I guess some of us do it better than others. I am not suggesting that the PTSD we may experience is the same as what someone going to war or experiencing abuse does. It is different, and probably needs to be treated differently. Oh definitely. PTSD and trauma effects are different for everyone. Trauma is held in the body and we have trauma we might not even be fully aware of because of everything we have been through. It is complicated and not even completely understood yet how trauma works and why it affects everyone so differently. I have my BA in psych and I have a particular interest in trauma.

Free daily nudes if you register on datekisslover.com and send me screenshot ", "Something that has been on my mind I have been involved in the SB community for two years now. As best I can. I have seen a lot of discussions, arguments, and questions. From adults with SB, parents, and kids. There is one thing I have to say. To the parents out there, stop sheltering your kids. It does not turn out well for anyone. I know you are scared for your child. I know you want to protect them but there is only so much you can protect them from. Let them experience life. The good and the bad. Treat them like every other kid. Do not let this disability stop them from anything. I have come across quite a few who have asked things such as \"how do you have friends when you are in a wheelchair?\" And that was from someone who is also a wheelchair user. Its heartbreaking that these individuals think something like that prevents them from having a social life. Please let these kids see what this world is like. They will fall. They will pick themselves up. They will get rejected. They will be accepted. Take me for example. I have friends. I have a social life. I have a regular life. All because my parents did not hold me back. They treated me just like everyone else. Let your kids find out what they can and cannot do. You will be surprised I promise you. Disclaimer: I have tethered cord syndrome not SB, very similar but I can walk okay with a brace after years of physical therapy as a kiddo, but my parents treated me like everyone else. I spent a good chunk of childhood in a wheelchair because of surgery and my friends loved when I was in it. Mostly because I would let them push me extremely fast and sometimes I would even crash and was constantly doing wheelies, but regardless it does not hold you back as a child. When you are an adult I can see it being harder, because people are not used to it. But usually people do not care that much in my experience, at least if they know you. Wish you the best! I agree a million percent. I have kind of shied away from the SB community because there are SO MANY adults with SB who lack common social skills because their parents sheltered them so much. I hate saying that but it is true. So many do not know how to live or behave normally because of their parents. All kids, disabled or not need to be able to be kids.

My son is 4 Years old and is not able to walk, stand unassisted and is not potty trained. Our Neuro never told us about the recent discovery of spina bifida occulta And I went to a different hospital for a physiatrist opinion and she Recommended Botox with anesthesia. We did two trials And they were unsuccessful I truly do not believe if the doctor knew he had spina bifida but she would have recommended the procedure. Has anyone had Botox with SPO and it was helpful? I am just trying to make sure they did not put him through something that was unnecessary especially under sedation and if I did I want to take legal action for it. (This would be against the neuro team for not addressing the Dx of course not the Physiatrist) Neuro meaning neuroOLOGIST or neuroSURGEON.  A neurologist has no idea about spina bifida and is working wayyyy outside of the their expertise.  A neurosurgeon knows everything about SB and most likely would have never recommended Botox.  (At least, I have a 12 year old and I have never heard that for SB, outside of bladder treatments.). \n\nI would say, forget legal action, and get yourself to a reputable sb clinic in a major metropolitan area ASAP.  You need a good neurosurgeon, a urologist and an orthopedic surgeon at the very least.\n\nEdit: typos Nope I meant neurologist because he ordered a full MRI of his spine.  Our neurosurgeon only looked at his mri of his shunt and does not go over results for exams he does not order. So I am now  confused as to why our neuro knowing the results (with holding them from me) gave me the go ahead to have him have the Botox when I do not see how that would have done any good for him. He is been under 11 times before this and our neurosurgeon told us he does not want him under anesthesia for unnecessary reasons because we do not know the long term effects. That is why I am just so angry and was told by his OT to seek action. But before I even attempted To do that I was hoping maybe I was wrong and perhaps people have had the Botox with success. Does your son have other issues besides SB? i have SPO in L5 too. when i was 4 i have difficulty with potty training/general continence. it took a few years after that for incontinence to get better for me. i would say hold off for the time being and see how his continence improves before undergoing botox treatment", "Staying fit?

I do have tethered cord syndrome too.\n\nI have a question for you who have a similar condition to mine regarding pain. My everyday pain levels are quite mild except some nights where the pain is more noticeable, but all in all, it is pretty manageable. \n\nThere is a particular kind of pain that occurs to me on average one time per year and it is devastating. It happened again some days ago and I am not recovered from it yet. The pain usually appears when I am asleep and I theorize maybe because I would spend a lot of time in the same sleeping position which hurts my spine. \n\nThe pain is so sudden and so intense it wakes me from sleep and the only way to cope with it is to walk. I take painkillers and walk endlessly in my room and apartment until it passes. \n\nThe only way to describe the pain is like being stabbed rhythmically with an electric knife in my spine-there are short stretches of times, maybe a second and a half when the pain diminishes completely to return with its full intensity. This is the most intense pain my body can experience.\n\nI have never read anything about this kind of pain, nor the doctors have given me a definitive answer about it. \n\nHave any of you experienced something like this?

It may take a little more effort, more willingness from both parties to cut the small talk and dive pretty early in deep conversations, but it can happen. Now, I have not come to the end of the race, but I have taken part in a relationship that lasted 3 years, from when I was 20 to when I was 23 (am 24 now), so it is not like there is only hope after your 50s and people are desperate or whatever. Anyway, if you would like to elaborate on the subject, feel free to hit me up in the DMs, I am more than willing to talk to someone about this. I am in the same boat. I am 30, almost 31 and I have never had a girlfriend. At this point I have just accepted that it is probably not going to happen and I am trying not to let it get to me.

I believe you can find love too.\n\nI suggest that you find your passion, get involved with what you love and someone with the same interests will find you. \n\nBut you are 16. Right now just focus on getting good grades and figuring out what you want to do after high school. It is just hard knowing that I we still live In a society that has made people think we should not be given a chance Since you said you have \u201cgiven up\u201d, if you are comfortable sharing that information, how old are you? As for society\u2019s preconceptions: yes, it is going to take some more effort that it does other people to convince your future partner that you will not be a burden, but I can also guarantee you that it is entirely up to you. Up to you meaning that if you are dealing with an intelligent person (which I would hope you would choose anyway for a partner), once you talk things through, and your partner understands  what they are dealing with, it will be all fine. But you cannot expect people to not be at least a little bit worried about something they do not know or understand. You need to be patient and, ironically, give them a chance. I am 41 and I have been married to a man who does not have SB for 17 years (and we dated for like 6 years before that, lol)  \nIt can happen, do not give up hope. To be fair I was a late bloomer. I did not have my first kiss or really date anyone until I was 16 but I met my husband online when I was 18 and at first I was really shy about telling him about SB but of course through necessity, I had to tell him. I have had countless embarrassing things happen and he never blames me or makes me feel gross or anything.  \nYou are still young and have so much time and I think you will find as you get older, older people will be more mature and willing to give you a chance. How are your symptoms? Like are they visible? Use a walker or braces? Etc. I mean if people can tell off the bat that is one one thing, but if your opening to someone new is that you have Spina Bifida, and that becomes your main character trait\u2026 then maybe not. You just have to find someone and ask them out. &gt;To be honest it is terrible and honestly it is not going to be something that I am just going to be ok with\n\nI used to think so too. I do not mean to be that old fart, but you are still very young - you have not even begun to experience all that life has to offer. A lot is going to happen in the next 15-20 years. I think that once you get older and experience more of what life has to offer, you will see that not having a significant other is not so bad in the grand scheme of things. I cannot walk at all I have hydrocephalus and osteoporosis and incontenence issues Not to be rude or anything but you are female Correct... because guys will do everything that they can to get into a girls pants and I am not saying that your husband is like that but most people are like that nowadays Ahh, thanks for helping me learn more about your situation.    \nI do not have Spina Bifida myself, however my almost 2 year old son does, so I am familiar with it from him and his situation.    \nMy first thoughts are that when I, a rather normal-ish guy was 16, I could have said what you said before word for word about myself. I felt like nobody but some of my closest friends liked me, and dating was pretty much something that did not start until I went to college. (Late 17 year old) was always a nerd, homeschooled, super tall\nAnd skinny, etc.   \n\nSomething that helped me was finding something I loved with a group of people who also loved it who I could be myself around, who I was not trying to \u2018secretly impress\u2019 or \u2018try not to act stupid around them because there are girls\u2019 etc.    \nEven though I was homeschooled, I did a class or two each morning after seminary (I am LDS) and for a while it was computers. My SR year though (17 years old) I joined the high school band. I had some experience playing piano and liked drums.    \nThat was like\u2026 the best thing I ever did because it put me in a room with a bunch of others from a bunch of backgrounds who were very non-judgemental. Band has a mixture of jocks, pretty girls, nerds, Normal people, quiet people, etc. it was great to become friends with people. Going into things like dating and relationships, and looking back at it (especially since my youngest brother is 21 and is in the \u2018dating/nobody wants to date me\u2019 stage too) it is all about getting to know people as a friend first. For example, I met my wife on a double date where she was with a friend of mine. Which means I was not going after her at all ha, my friend was dating her. So I became friends with her first, and after some time of being friends, we realized we liked each other.    \nDating is first and foremost about having a fun time and getting to know someone. Enjoy the date, enjoy just sitting with someone and getting to know them and what they like, do not like, etc and be interested in learning about them. Just because you date one person does not mean you have to pursue it either. Just amass friends and it will come, I promise.  And be the most genuine person yourself, and people will like and respect you and grow to be friends with you. 16 is young to be looking for a steady relationship. (From my point of view anyway ha, I am 30) and this age range of people might not be as interested in a steady relationship with others that they might. Jew as well\u2026 someone with disabilities. Ppl are young and might not want to, however as people get older, things like that tend to fade to the back and are replaced with genuine relationships of trust and love.   \n\nAnyways, I hope something in this rambling novel of mine can be of use. If you have any questions, I would love to chat more if you would like. But the problem is i will be a burden because I do not have a job and over 50% of buildings in my  province are inaccessible to people in wheelchair even though it is the law to have wheelchair entrances and exits No problem that is why I am here Ok but he did not have to marry me LOL Again I was not trying to offend you but disabled females probably have a higher chance of getting a boyfriend/girlfriend because most boys  are perverts and only ever want intercourse and a lot of females do not even consider dating someone in a wheelchair it is like females personally avoid dating disabled guys Ok, I just read some of the other comments. Now, with all due respect: you are 16, I promise you you have no idea what life has in store for you. I have roughly 50% more life experience than you, and I am still going through university (here uni and highschool both last five years and I am a year late), and I still have not exactly figured it all out. You have time, and you will find a job, probably not the one you are picturing right now, cause things will be tremendously different from now. Do not think that because someone will cut your opportunities short based on looks or practicality you have none, cause that is absolutely not true. Back to the core problem, I would like to remind you that I myself had to wait until I was 20 to enter a meaningful relationship, which means four years from now, which also mean 25% of your current total life. It is a lot, to say the least. I am not trying to be patronising, again, things will be more difficult than average, but they are nowhere near impossible, and you will radically change idea about what you want in life (about every single aspect) from now to when you will be 20, so think about the fact that you are trying to gain something that will not corrisponde to your desires in a few years. It is really useless mental masturbation, as understandable as it might be. That is an interesting double standard, I had not thought of that. Just curious are you in any support groups for youth with disabilities? My parents sent me to a summer camp with other disabled kids and then when I was a teen I was in a youth group for teens with disabilities, it really helped to be able to talk to other kids my age about stuff like this and at one point they paired us up with an adult with a disability which was great too. Maybe you could even find a discord group or something. I go to probably the same camp but with covid I cannot Seeing that my life expectancy is only 60 it is really not that long Not to try and second guess an expert medical opinion, but from my personal experience doctors tend not be a little more pessimistic than necessary, so that you are not disappointed if the best case scenario does not show up. For instance, my parents were told by a specialist, and by specialist I mean a really freaking good one, the one who came up with third ventriculostomy, which was a major discovery at the time, that I would have never walked on my own. Guess who has been walking since he was 3 and a half years old? Well the thing is is that for the past 5 years nothing in my life has gone right \u201cNothing has gone right\u201d meaning what, exactly? And why would it prevent you to find a girlfriend ever at all? Yeah that is a problem! What camp if you do not mind me asking? Do they do online activities instead? Hello, I (26f) have been with my boyfriend (26m) for around 6 years now. I am able bodied and he lives with Spina Bifida... just wanted to tell you that there is no one in the world who could make me happier or feel more fulfilled than he does. You will absolutely find your person at some point, please do not give up hope. The right person will love you and all that you are, any potential partner who makes you even question that should be promptly shown the door. Everyone I meet makes me question it I am 42, born with myelomeningocele, been married for 14 years but have only ever had 3 serious relationships.    After having gone to therapy for other insecurities I figured out that I was way more insecure about my disability then I thought.  Anytime I heard about a woman who was attracted to me, I never believed it.   I always compared myself to someone who was more physically able.  I would say things like \"why would she be interested in me, it is not like I am captain of the football team.\"\n\nBut there is hope, you just need to find the right person.   I know that all of my friends quickly forget I have a disability and my wife often forgets too.   You are young, I know it is hard but you have got a lot of time.  It took me (52/F) 36 years to find him, but now my (able-bodied) husband &amp; have been happily married for almost 16 years - Do not give up! I have just given up too im only 14 and this is my mindset, too. dont worry im pretty sure w have all worried about this, ive sen quite a few get married, though so there is hope for all of us still!", "Do others have these problems? So I was wondering if others have had these problems and what they have done to make it a little easier. It is hard to share this so please be nice.\n\nFirstly, has anyone had surgery where they now catheterize through the belly button and if so how did you stop the leaking. I have been leaking out of my belly button for years and have had  many surgeries to fix it but it will not stop. I am now spending over 40 dollars a fortnight just for pads to put across my belly button so I do not leak on my clothes. It is really embarassing too because I dont feel sexy or cute because I have got to wear a pad over my belly and not a small one. The big maxi pads for overnight use. \n\nSecondly, women with spina bifida do any of you have little to no feeling in your vagina or bottom and does it make it hard to cum? I do not like having sex anymore because it takes so long for me to finish because I only have the littlest feeling in my area. How have you over come this and what has helped ? I also would like to know if anyone else has had the issue where when they get horny their bowels tend to work and how you fixed that issue and yes I have a mace I use but I still have bowel movement accidents.\n\nLastly, my bladder has been operated on alot and actually burst so alot of my bladder is made up of bowel and I was wondering if others had the issue of getting recurring utis. I get medicated for it but only when it is bad because If I stay on meds long term my body gets used to them and I have only got like three medications that work now for them. I plan to keep getting medicated for it naturally but has anyone got any tips or tricks on helping keep the utis at bay ?\n\nI have asked my doctor's about this heaps but do not get any answers so I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice and I am fully aware you are not a doctor and I should not try something without consulting a doctor first but I would still like some advice. Cheers. Hi I am a male with Spina bifida. I feel I have not to many issues. I am 24/7 in a diaper. I cannot answer your questions all your questions but I can say about the little to no feeling in the genitalia region I have the same there is very little feeling down there. I am still a virgin so I cannot give any insight into sex but how I jack off I do not touch myself because there is no feeling I just imagine having sex and it can let me finish pretty quickly. I do not know if any of that helped you. I have the recurrent UTIs, as I catheterize daily and have also had my bladder augmented with a piece of my small intestine. The only way I have found to avoid them is to rotate prophylactic antibiotics. I take Macrobid for a few months, then switch to Cipro, then switch to Keflex. I am a male, but hopefully you are open to hearing my advice.\n\n1.  I do not have the mitrofanoff, but I had considered at in my early years. From what I understand Ditropan is supposed to help with the leaking b/c it reduces spasms. There are also minor surgical adjustments that can be made as follow-up procedures.\n\n2. Even as a dude I understand this. I have very minor feelings in those areas, so just physical stimulation is not enough unless it is constant over a good period of time. The mind is a powerful thing though and you can essentially train yourself when to cum from different stimuli. Sex is physical AND mental.  I have also found my erogenous zones work wonders. Since you lack feeling it is likely your body has compensated for it, but having a different area be extra sensitive. Get someone to help you find it! The bowel thing is also common. I have to plan out my sex life. I always do my MACE a few hours before sex to be the safest. \n\n3. I have had 7 bladder surgeries including the augmentation where they take part of your intestine to make it larger. I do get UTIs/Kidney infections about every month, but they only last a day or 2 at most. I take cranberry pills, ditropan and I try to drink close to a gallon of water a day. I cath roughly 5-6 times a day and try to go even I i do not feel i need to. Hope some of this helps. Hi, I am also a woman who caths through my belly button and has had bladder augmentation. \nI take Toviaz for bladder spasms that minimizes the leakage for the most part. I do use paper towels as a pad to take care of the smaller leaks. I also cath 9 times per day. \n\nI cannot answer your second question. \n\nAs for UTI\u2019s, I take cranberry tablets, vitamin C and a probiotic every day as per the recommendation by my urologist. I Cath every two hours, I will definitely look into the toviaz, cranberry tablets and vitamin C. Unfortunately my leaks are to big for paper towel. Thanks for the advice though \u263a\ufe0f I have tried no touching but it is quite frustrating for me frankly. But thanks for the advice. Unfortunately I am allergic to Keflex. I also cannot be on a medicine longer than a week due to my body getting used to it because I get UTIs every couple of weeks. But thanks for the advice. Thanks, I will look into it and see how I go. Thanks for the advice. You can also try Toviaz. I was on Ditropan as a kid, but I switched over to Toviaz as a teen. It keeps me relatively dry.", "Has anyone here tried marijuana for pain relief? Hi I take MST which is essentially slow release morphine and i hate it so much. i feel addicted to it and all the other meds i have tried have not been as effective.

You will still feel pain, you just might not care, I take edibles all the time, definitely helps with emotional pain Works wonders. Either you do not care about the pain or you do not feel it It works great. Especially in the evenings i am going to get some cbd gummies today Yes it works better than most things for me. I took my mom to my pain management doctor appointment and the doctor suggested it in front of her so that made it easier. I never used marijuana until I got the medical card. It has been amazing for my pain relief. The best part is not dealing with the side effects of pain meds especially constipation. It has been the best thing for me. I actually lost 40lbs bc I was able to move because my pain was controlled. I went from 10 Prescription meds per day to 3 and no opioid medications. The edibles are the best and I supplement with vaping. I take CBD-dominant hemp for my pain dealing with tethered cord until I can get surgery for it, and it helps to an extent, so I would bet that standard strains of cannabis would definitely help I had that surgery a while ago and god the pain was awful for a few weeks. bare with it it will get better", "Hello!!

My parents never talked to me about it and the only reason I know what the name of it is is because my granny told me what it (the dimple on the base of my spine) was when I was in high school.\n\nFor the most part it has not affected my life (other than the area being sore sometimes and potentially being the cause for having weak/shaky legs &amp; arms spells when I was in middle school- but I guess I will never know because I never told my parents because I thought I was dying and I did not want them to know lol).  But I know for many of you it has and I would love to hear what you know and what you do to maintain your health.\n\nAre there risks that come with work that requires a lot of lifting?\nDoes pregnancy come with precautions/ can it be dangerous for my spine?\nAre some beds better than others?\nAre there certain vitamins to help maintain the health of your spine?\n\nIf there is anything you would like to add that is fine too! Folic acid before and during pregnancy is important to reduce the risk for your children if you have kids. My wife still unfairly beats herself up over that. Our youngest has SB. The only other advice I would give you is to contact a myelo clinic for a consult. I doubt you would need to go in regularly with just occulta but it is a handy way to see all the specialists who are involved in SB care just to be sure there is nothing you are overlooking like kidney health.

In addition to that she has control issues with her bladders and bowel. I need to know if any one with the exact same situation figured out any approach to control the bladders at least. I wish I could help you out. Facebook seems to have groups with more members and support. Maybe try there. Godspeed! Thanks for the response. I tried already on facebook but I have not find something really useful. My daughter had the mitrofanoff and m.a.c.e procedure done. Basically, they created a port in the belly button for her to cath, and a port on the side of her abdomen she uses to flush her bowels. This enables her to wear underwear and stay dry. Thanks for the reply. I hope things went smoothly with your daughter. How old is she? Is she doing very well with the procedures? Could she control her legs and stands? Shes almost 13 now, she was 7 when she had the procedure done. She had some issues (those 1 in 1000 things that sometimes happen) and has to have a revision done so she isnt currently using them as of now. She did great when she had it done. She can control her legs, but she is in a wheelchair and could cath from the chair, she only needed to be on the toilet to flush the bowels. The worst part of the whole thing was bladder spasms after the surgery, they didnt last long though. Did the doctors mention this procedure for your daughter?\n\n Did the doctors mention the Neobladder construction for your daughter?\n\n  They used a part of her small intestine to make her bladder bigger and they put a binder on her bladder opening to control leaks. They took a part of her appendix to make the stoma for the m.a.c.e and mitrofanoff. Here is a better explanation of the procedure. \n\n Thanks for the intel. I meant why do not they choose it as a replacement for the mitrofanoff? Why just they choose the mitrofanoff? Because she cant feel when she needs to go to the bathroom. Hmm, I am confused because my daughter also cannot feel if she needs to go to the bathroom, however the doctor recommended to do the Neobladder surgery. Hmm. Idk, maybe speak to her doctor about it, not all urologists perform every procedure, sometimes they prefer one over the other. This may not be relevant however I also have SB MMC. I am 29 now and have little to no feeling in my right leg below the knee and 100% no feeling in my right foot although I can walk albeit a bit of a hopalong. I appreciate your daughter may have a more severe form of SB so apologies if this does not help.\n\nAs a child I would suffer terrible with the inability to know when I had to go to the toilet however as time went on I could determine slight sensation albeit at the last minute of needing to go immediately! So if this is the case for her just know that with age she will naturally (at least this was my experience) learn to adjust to not having the same sensation everyone else does, I can go from nothing to the \"oh crikey I need to go to the toilet now\" but she will learn things like never pass a toilet and do not use it, do not be afraid to just up and leave a situation and pop to the loo. I know this does not help much now, but in the long run she will hopefully adapt to her situation. If you ever have any other questions feel free to message. Thanks!\n\nI hope that they figure out some magical treatment for people like you and my daughter.\n\nFor now I cannot determine if she could feel the need to go to the toilet or not, according to the Urodynamics Test her bladder contracts after 10-20 ml of urine filling.\n\nMay I know more details about your bladder medical condition and on which age do you start to feel?\n\nYou can message me privately if you wish. I am a lot like your daughter.  I ended up with a bladder augmentation, and a mitrofanoff with a cecostomy for bowels.  Zero, and I mean zero urine leakage, and no bowel accidents at all now.  I am 41 and boy do I wish I had this all done when I was young.  I would be a different man today. Great news It is great to hear such good news from you. I have never had bladder control and very little bowel control due to my spina bifida. I am an older lady and a urostomy/illeal conduit surgery was performed when I was about 12 years old allowing me to wear a small plastic pouch to fit over a stoma that drained urine in a continuous fashion. I am so used to it now and it has worked perfectly for a long long time to address my lack of bladder control. For bowel control I have learned to increase fiber and stool softeners once a month to allow my intestines to move more naturally and in a way I could manage the bowel activity over a few days and then be done with it until the next month. Not sure if any of this helps you but I do hope it does! Go to Bowel Management for Spina Bifida. On Facebook. Loads of info and great details. You will have to join though as it is a closed group.

Mine's 13 and he has a couple of the expensive thick undershirts they gave him but I would like to know if there is anything else that is worth getting. Preferably inexpensive. His brace is asymmetrical and goes up far under one armpit so most undershirts do not work.

I am assuming this has something to do with scoliosis surgery? When I had mine, the hospital gave us a stash of skintight \"wifebeater\" (Jesus H. Christ, I probably need to stop using that phrase) type undershirts. If they did not, that kind of shirt would probably work. And I totally get the back brace thing with him. I hated mine. However, I am regretting not wearing mine like I needed to 15 years later. Tell him he will love himself down the road for wearing it and hate himself if he does not. And do not feel bad about him not listening. You could not tell me anything when I was 13, either.

I actually have no problems whatsoever, I can do everything, but the fact that my body looks a bit off makes that I also do not feel I belong to the community of the 'non-disabled' people, although I identify with them. \nHow do you deal with this? Can you accept your body the way it looks? What helped you? What are other people's reactions to your body? \nThis is really a huge issue for me and I would like to fix it but I am stuck and I do not know how I can fix it. Honestly, no and it sucks. I am barely 5'0 and my torso is short so it looks compacted and no matter what I weigh I will always have a gut. Combine that with skinny legs that are just decoration and other male-related things I do not think I have to get into, I am built like a damn hobbit. I also do not look disabled with clothes on but I have lots of scars and I do have things I need to do due to spina bifida such as self cath and keep up with my kidney health, be aware of shunt malfunctions, etc. I find when I am open about it people are accepting. I have been married for 16 years to a man (I am a woman) and he is accepting of my scars and other things I have dealt with because of SB. I understand it is difficult to decide which community you relate to when you do not feel disabled but you have things that are different from other people like scars or different things going on. I think it is not so important to pick a label but realize there are parts of both the disabled and non-disabled community that you can relate to. IDK how old you are but I am 41 and I am happy to message with you about this but if you feel weird about that it is fine. Just know there are people out there who will support you. I am not saying my body image is perfect, but I have decided I am a decent person and that looks are not everything, its does not matter how much I weigh I will always looks overweight, so there is no point trying to fix that, but I can work on my attitude.\nI give myself compliments, if I wear a shirt that looks good on me, I will mention that. I have put work in and I am pretty happy with myself rn Can I dm you about something that is going on with me that I need some female advice on? 16F for reference I have a huge amount of scars both from surgeries for my spina bifida and from when i was a stupid kid.(Playing and rough housing with boys and my younger brother). So people just see my stiches and scars as another flesh wound healed. So i feel like a veteran who has been in multiple battles and come back alive. \n\nMy dad has told me to always look the best. Wear good looking clothes, have a haircut, trim/shave/shape my beard (Im a guy), smell good, have a pedicure and manicure etc. Yes, I am lazy af. But after doing all of this i feel good for myself. And this feeling gives me confidence. \n\nAlso a lot people assume I am a normal person by the way I talk and dress. Sometimes it backfires. Just last month my bro had got a ticketing fine in front of a police station for parking in a disabled parking spot, while I was in the very same police station getting a previous ticket waived for previously parking in a disabled spot. Smh. I had to do a lot of paperwork. In all worked out in the end.\n\nAnd yes i do get jealous of people. My little bro is 6'1 and works out. He has a body of a model, where as if you look at me from a certain angle, even tho im 6'0, i can vanish from existence(my mother jokes about that often). But one thing i have learnt is that everybody has flaws and perks. Mine are just more apparent. I try my best to stay healthy and look good! I can walk but with braces I can do most things other people can I go to the gym 4 times a week play sled hockey and I ended up losing 50 lbs! As for my scars I am very self conscious and do not usually take my shirt off in front of anyone but family but honestly I never have a reason to take my shirt off to begin with I swim occasionally but I live in a cold state so that is only a few times a year It just takes time. You have to accept it. If I could do something about my back and make it perfect I would. But it is as good as it is ever going to be. It took a long time for me to really accept it. I have literally cried to myself about it many times. One thing that  really does help is to get good at what you do. When your in the zone. Doing what you know how to do. When you are the one with the answers that other people want. It is a great feeling. Every time you do it. It makes your disability feel less and less. Learn to do something that is dangerous. I know this does not have much to do with body image. But when you can feel your own power and ability you will feel better about everything. Sure, I may not have the answer but I will give it a shot! I can relate and have gone through different phases of being uncomfortable with how I look and at other times, feeling like I am unique and different and embracing that. For most of my life I was able-bodied passing except for my scars. Though when I was a kid I thought it was fun to show them off lol. My foot is deformed now and I have had limited mobility for the past few years and it is been like learning to accept myself all over again. I am a 29-year old woman and have dated and surround myself with people who are compassionate and understanding. If you ned to talk with anyone I am here if you want to reach out. I believe you can, but how fast it happens depends on you and your personality and also how bad is it.\n\nFor example j do not have a leg and a limp sometimes when I am tired, with clothes no one thinks I have a 95% incapability.\n\nThe thing is I also cannot control my piss my poop I do not even think I cannot cum(I am having trouble with that, if anyone could enlighten me about it), my dick small and is cutter in half.\n\nEspecially this last part has been hunting me trough adolescence, seeing all the boys talking about their big dicks how they fucked this girl and that, affected my mental health.\n\nThe thing is after about a year ago, I met a girl who made me feel quite good about me, but still cause of insecurities I lost her.\nI noticed at that point that just flooding your partner with insecurities (especially if they are as well) is not going to work out.\n\nNo matter how bad you think you are believe me someone will like you, but before that you must like yourself, CONFIDENCE IN WHAT YOU HAVE IS MANDATORY. You cannot just grow bigger cause you can, you cannot make your nerves work just by clicking a button, you cannot control none of that, WORRY ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL. Worry about your health(workout, eat good) worry about your higiene, worry about your fucking personality.\nWith this long response I want to say I love you all in this sub, I joined today but I feel now that I am not the only one.\nTHANK YOU ALL I despise the way my body looks right now. Ive managed to develop my chest pretty well through excersize over the past few years but i cant seem to get rid of some of my belly fat. This combined with the jutting lipoma on my back gives the effect of me being much fatter in the belly area than i actually am and ruins the \"otter mode\" v-taper that im looking for. I have quite spindly arms and hands as well, combined with a wierd face that gives me a fundamentally \"off\" look. I have no issue with height (Thanks grandad for your 6,4 genetics\" but my face and body proportions are just wrong. Body image is really tricky. You can feel like you are only part of a person. \n\nMy disability is  myelomengocile. ..sp.. right leg amputated .. left leg half the size. shortened trunk section .. scoliosis .. I have found that after the initial shock as people look at you they tend to ignore you. \n\nThis is the only body you will have hear on earth so I say let the onlookers stare then ignore you, they are not worth the time..there are the gems out there that will give you the time of day and get to know the person inside.  \n\nAs far as I am concerned we as disabled deserve the same things as so called normal people. If we want to sun tan on a beach and feel the sun penetrate you with rejuvenating energy.. go swimming or float with an off.. sit outside with your shirt off .. wear shorts.. go barefoot ... do it.  Why should we be deprived of simple pleasures. \n\nIt has been my experience the more confident you come across the faster people accept you. Some of my friends forget I am disabled when making plans to do things. It is a compliment to your character.  We often live in two worlds.. were your abilities shine in the normal realm and the limitations of the physical. \n\nGet the most out of life and live outside your comfort zone.

I was diagnosed when I was 8, had surgery when I was 11. \n\nI suffer from a specific pain at the base of my spine where my fluid bulge is that presses on the frayed nerves. I visit my nuerosurgeon every 6 months, who has suggested surgery again if the pain does not ease up, but it would result in paralysis from the neck down.

I apologize for writing so much about shit you all do not even care about reading about.  I just needed to get shit off my chest. I do not understand what you go through personally but I understand being fed up. I wish I could say it gets better but I do not know I do not see how it can.....my condition is not going to improve, as I age it will only get worse; the medical appointments are not going away, unless I just choose to let my body deteriorate until it kills me, but that is unfortunately more of a \"pipe dream\" in reality. I am a heroin and cocaine addict. Been clean for years at a time but always end up going back. I sometimes wish for a terminal illness so I can relapse without the guilt. Depression is a fucked up condition Indeed it is.  I cannot afford (street) drugs, but I am afraid that one of these days - likely one of the days my parent dies - probably the second one, I will probably overdose on pills. You can afford street drugs if you live near any major city in America. Shit in nyc/northern new jersey heroin is cheaper than cigarettes. do not have a car to get to D.C. (I am in the suburbs) as I cannot drive. Also, I live off of food stamps and money from the state for rent/food - no disposable income. Yeah I do not advise it just cheaper and easier than you would think I have got SB and I understand. I completely get it. It is so hard living and deteriorating. My doctor misdiagnosed sepsis and I wound up needing a transplant and nothing happened to the doctor. \nThe problem is that depression is a big factor in our condition. It makes it bad. \n\nI decided to stop sitting around and I have gone and got myself into uni (I am mid 20s and still need a transplant), I had to give myself a career and a purpose. I could not stay on benefits cause it made me worse. I am not saying that is the right route for you, I am just saying having and feeling like I finally have a purpose has made all the difference.\n\nI have suicidal ideation too, I know how hard it is! Be your best self, we only have this one go of it. Please do not let your SB win, it can get better I promise! Man I do not advise drugs to get through this shit but try getting a job or something that gives you a routine. I cannot say much since I am only 17 but I have seen where drugs can lead you. School and work have helped me a lot with my own experiences with SB just because I have routine.

Oh man... this post hurt my heart. My son has SB and he is a wonderful light in our lives. He is a great big brother. Like you said,you matter to your friends and family. \nWould you be willing to seek therapy for chronic pain and depression? \nWould you be open to volunteering since you have not been able to find employment.

I was especially bitter when I was a young child because of my frequent surgeries and medical appointments. I was convinced that God hated me and felt ashamed of my condition. It took a long time to accept my disability as a part of who I am and identify that it has made me more able to relate to certain types of people as a teacher. About 5 years ago I had another tough time when I had 3 foot surgeries and 2 bladder operations that did not work. What has helped me is having people I can talk to that understand my situation. Counseling (and antidepressants) helped me learn to deal with depression and anxiety in a healthier way. Good luck! thanks.....antidepressants help stop me from being suicidal anymore (most of the time), but counseling never worked for me because - quite simply, i was not willing to put in the effort necessary to change/improve. I can definitely understand not feeling motivated to do counseling. It took a couple different counselors to find one that I felt comfortable with and was actually able to help. Fucking preach brother/sister.", "Probably a dumb question... Is it possible to lose weight without exercising or dieting?  \n\nFrankly, (if I am being 100% honest) I am too damn lazy to get much (if any, let aloe sufficient) exercise, and\n\nI do not want to change/limit my diet because - to put it bluntly, (and hopefully a lot or at least some of you can relate to this:) as stupid as it may sound, I feel like so much of what \"most people\" get to do in life was \"stolen\" from me by my disability (being able to walk normally - let alone run, playing sports, driving a car, having sex, etc.) and simply put I do not want my disability to \"take\" from me the ability to a lot of foods either because their \"unhealthy\" or whatever.  I know this is unreasonable but it is how I feel dammit, lol.\n\nAnd as far as exercising goes, I am quite simply too lazy to do the little bit of exercising my disability will actually allow me to do, and even when I do try to exercise I feel like I am not really burning enough calories to make a legit difference as far as burning fat goes.\n\nI would like to get a \"lap-band\" or \"gastric bypass\" surgery, but I know that unless I put on about 100 more pounds (which I do not want to do) it is probably not realistic, especially if I have to pay for it.\n\nI will end by saying that if you just want to respond by calling me a \"lazy S.O.B.\" who just needs to learn how to learn how to diet or exercise or \"wants to have his cake and eat it to\", please do not bother.  It is not constructive in any way, and I know that is the case, I do not need to be told it.  I am simply here trying to find some \"easy (alternative) way out\" - even though I know it is not going to happen, or at the very least some people who feel the same way I do that can sympathize with me. Losing weight is a very difficult thing. Obviously. But from what I know (and experienced a little) is that you do not need to diet, you just need to change your eating habits. If you do nothing different, then of course you will not lose weight.\n\nWhat do I mean by changing your eating habits? Portion control. I struggle with this, but I know if I do not stuff my face, that will help. My suggestion would be to start small. I have tried losing weight so many times but the problem has always been that I try too much at once and then give up on everything. So, if you like pizza, try eating a half a slice less and see where that takes you.\n\nI, too, am lazy, I hate working out. My wife loves it. I do not have spina bifida by the way, my daughter does. We have her go on a treadmill almost every day. She can walk, but obviously it is difficult for her, so she goes slowly and hangs on when she needs to.\n\nAs far as lap-band or gastric bypass, my understanding is that its not a magic treatment anyway. After, you need to make changes to your eating otherwise you will go back to gaining weight. \n\nI wish there was some easy way to lose weight and to be honest, I do not know why it is so easy to put on but difficult to lose.\n\nI wish you the best of luck and hope you find something that helps. i thought a lap-band and/or gastric bypass made it so you are \"incapable\" of eating as much as you did pre-surgery? It does, but if you do not change whatever was done before to make you gain weight, you will gain the weight back again, thereby making it useless.\n\nI am in no way a doctor, expert, or anything about it, this has just been my understanding. I could be wrong. Look up lazy keto or dirty keto \nDouble your meat especially healthy ones\nHalf your carbs like potatoes bread pasta rice\nDouble any green vegetables that you are willing to eat\nCut your sugars in half\nSimply put there is more to it than this but its a start. Do some research on the subject. On this diet you can eat until you get full but its more about eating smarter than eating less\nReduces inflammation too. I really tried to form a positive advice but i cannot. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, having a disability took less from you than your attitude has. You titled your post \u201cprobably a dumb question\u201d and let me tell you, yes it was. No you will not lose weight if you do not get off your ass (figuratively speaking) and start moving around and eating right. Is it worth taking years off your life because your disability took a few minor things from you? Up out of your house and roll around for an hour a day and cut back on all the crap you eat and you will start seeing a difference. While I hear what you are saying and I get it (I really do), HOW DARE YOU tell me my disability took \"a few MINOR things from (me)\" ?!?!?  1) it is not up to you to decide if they were \"minor\" or not 2) How can you call things like: A) the inability to walk (normally and long distances, especially with ease), B) the ability to drive a car C) the ability to have sex D) the inability to go to the bathroom normally and without fear of \"compications\" (both urinary and fecal - sorry to be so explicit), etc. \"MINOR\" ? ! ? ! ? !  I mean, \n\nI do not mean to get \"off-topic\", but seriously, where do you get off saying such a thing.....? I can do it because I also have spina b\u00edfida myelomeningocele at T10. I am completely paralyzed waist down and am incontinent just like you. I drive, I work, I have had girlfriends in the past. I do 5k races on my wheelchair and have played multiple sports. All the things you \u201ccannot do\u201d are actually quite doable if you just change your mindset and stop feeling sorry for yourself. I would be more than happy to help you with resources on how to accomplish those things, but if you are going to post something like you did, I would not think you are going to even try. Well I have epilepsy preventing me from driving, CLEARLY do not have the self-confidence and whatnot that you have (likely as a result of my clinical depression), and simply have no interest whatsoever in racing in a wheelchair or not.  Too much effort for something that quite frankly does not look/sound remotely fun to me (whether I was handicapped or not).  \n\nYou are probably right about me to some extent (.....I would not think you are even going to try.), but it is not for lack of trying in the past.  I simply cannot and/or \"refuse\" - for lack of a better word (for reasons unknown even to me), to get past the things that I feel Spina Bifida \"took\" from me (despite the fact that I never had them) - that most people get to have in their lives.  And what is more, the \"adapted\" shit that is available to people with disabilities, has never and likely will never appeal to me.  I know that mean's I am limiting MYSELF, but I guess I just do not care in that regard.  I guess I would rather feel like I have a right to be bitter and angry - which admittedly is a fucked up and just flat out \"wrong\" way to be.....no arguments about it. I feel so, SO, bad for you. I will just end the conversation here. Have a great day. If you ever want to make a change in your life and want someone who is gone through what you have been through to help, hit me up. First of all, fuck your sarcasm.\n\nSecond of all, it will likely still be a while before I can get myself to exercise, but if I can get some sort of confirmation that either diet \"works\", I think I just found TWO *potential* diets that I could see turning into a \"lifestyle\". There was no Sarcasm in my last statement at all. Good job going from not wanting to diet In your original post to at least trying one. I hope you can stick to it. Good luck. Again, if you would like help or anything from someone who is been through where you are at; I am here sorry, it is hard to judge sarcasm when just reading text.  I apologize.  I appreciate it and I will keep it in mind..", "Inspirational video, this is my cousin who has spina bifida and a great life. ", "Spinal pain For the past few months I have been dealing with multiple health issues. Like putting out fires all over the place. One of the problems that has arisen is I have been having this strange pain on my lower back in my spine. It is right where I had all the surgeries as a kid. It feels like I am being stabbed plus something feels like it is crunching the bones. Has anyone else had this?", "Dating someone with Spina Bifida Hello! Glad to see that this subreddit exists!\n\nMy girlfriend has spina bifida. First some history...back in 2014 we dated for 6 months. My family was never keen on me dating someone with a disability, I suppose their constant nagging and negativity got to me....so I ended the relationship. \n\nThe next few months were the worst of my life, constantly ashamed that I let my family have such control over me. Through events for which I am eternally grateful, our paths crossed again and I expressed my deep regret for ending things. She forgave me and we have now been going out for nearly a year and a half. \n\nI am not letting my family's opinions affect me this time around. I love my girlfriend so much, and just thinking about what I put her through hurts me... \nI just want my family to like her so much...they are certainly nice in person but express their discontent to me as soon as she leaves. Just when I though things were turning around, my girlfriend had an accident at my place...she was making her way up the stairs and did not notice. But my mother did. She cleaned it up and told me that I need to \"sort this relationship out\". When my gf found out about the incident she was just wrecked...in tears and convinced that I was breaking up with her. \nI told her this affects nothing in my mind and I still love her but she does not want to visit my place anymore...and I am not sure if my mother wants her either.\n\n\nI just do not know what to do...", "I need a female to talk too Any females in this sub?

Same, here if you want to reach out, it is not dumb! It is hard to find people who can relate.", "Quality of life So I just learned that majority of families who are told they have an infant with SB seem to be encouraged to terminate the pregnancy. The most common concern being poor quality of life. I was just wanting to hear a take from someone who actually has SB on this topic. \n\nPersonally I do not have SB but I have many similar complications - severe scoliosis/kyphosis, weakness, muscle atrophy in lower body, and more... \n\nI am pro-choice but I have mixed feelings because quality of life is so subjective. Also it seems like doctors give out the worst case scenario every time We were told my daughter would not walk, would most likely have clubbed feet, and severe developmental problems. She runs jumps skips and plays, has perfectly normal feet, and minor developmental delays. She is a joy and I would not trade her for anything When my son (19) was diagnosed before he was born, a physician was beginning to go down the abortion path and we immediately stopped him. We have had many challenges and he endured many surgeries and therapies, but as far as quality of life... He lives a pretty charmed life. We have taken the many groups that offer special activities for special needs kids up on their generosity and he has done more than any other kid he knows. \n\nAs far as doctors, when he was diagnosed, we spoke to our pediatrician (he has a big sister) and they had just hired a doctor that knew a lot about SB. We met with her and she told us what kind of specialists he would need and we met with all of them. He still sees the pediatrician. He had loads of surgeries and hospital stays - and he loves the hospital. He is a founding member of the children's hospital's teen advisory council. I myself am 26 years old and a male with Spina Bifida L4-L5 Mylomeningcyle.I have went over this stuff with my girlfriend before and for me its hard to say. i find myself being sort of selfish because we had a scare a few months ago and she would mentioned it to me and the first thing i blurted out was abortion. Not exactly what I meant to say or exactly how I ment for it to come out. But I run into alot of problems and I am afraid if I were to have a child with SB they would live the same way... mind you I am so very fortunate  because, yes they do give you the worst case scenario at least in some places or some people.. but to hear that i was never going to be able to walk ,talk ,sit up nor eat basically the doctors told my mom I would be a vegetable. Today I can do everything they said I could not because my mom did not let me give up and now she regrets not keeping me in my chair because the past maybe 10 years my feet have been going through hell and I am the cause but the older I get the more I realize that the chair is a vital part of my life if I want to avoid losing my feet... so I would say that abortion is something I could understand finding out what quality of life your child might have.. but you do not know until you try? I know that when I said abortion I am just not ready for children right now.. but when I do have children I will be the role model I wish i had when I needed it. The idea that people with SB have poor quality of life is sooooooo outdated but they still teach it in med school. Go to babycenter/spinabifidakids and read over there.  We always encourage newly diagnosed parents to not make ANY decisions regarding termination until they talk to a NEUROSURGEON who has a lot of experience with sb.  I am pro choice but I believe decisions like that should come from a place of knowledge and not fear. I am a 51 year old woman who was born with spina bifida myelomeningocele at the cervical spine level. I am also a first generation hydrocephalus survivor ((yeah I am that old!). I am married and have an adult son. I was able to walk unassisted for the first 30 years of my life, too. I use a wheelchair most of the time now, and that is more than okay with me. I am just grateful for what I have had, and what I have currently. I do not know if anyone has told you this yet, but SB is what they sometimes call a \u201csnowflake condition \u201c (because all of us have such different individual outcomes).  I wish you and your family all the best. Journey on. \u270c\ufe0f &gt;snowflake conidition\n\ni figured this would have been because we are a bunch of snowflakes? ;)\n\n(well. it is what *i have* been called, anyway..... typically by... hypermasculine... conservatives.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...oh.) Sorry I do not have the first-person experience you are looking for, but my daughter was born with spina b\u00edfida. My daughter is 5. She is a wheelchair user but she does literally everything else a kid does. She associates her hands as her feet. For example, she will \u201cdance\u201d on all fours and \u201ckick\u201d her hands out. There is nothing wrong with her. Even in her mind. \n\nYou know what is funny? Just the other day we were leaving for errands. When we were making our way to our car from my apartment, she yells \u201cMom let us run!\u201d and beelines for my car in her wheelchair. She zooms in that thing. She was \u201crunning\u201d in her mind. To her, \u201crunning\u201d is just going fast. And she is not upset she cannot use her legs to \u201crun\u201d\n\nMy point is, she does not care about her disability. She actually loves her wheelchair. She has the typical mind of an able 5 year old kid and has a great quality of life &gt;I am pro choice but I believe decisions like that should come from a place of knowledge and not fear. \n\nFreaking so true. Thank you for saying this My mom was not allowed to know anything about me unless she promised not to terminate me.  She was then told I would be a hydrocephalic vegetable, neither of that happened and I was born with spina bifida lipomylomeningocele, that was brushed off as a fatty lump at the base of my spine I did not get an official diagnosis until 16.\n\nShe wanted to know so she could prepare the house for any issues, I had entirely unpredictable issues that make my medical history look like a comedy. I am a 36-year-old female with Myelomeningocele. My parents were not aware I had Spina Bifida before I was born. I have been able to walk with the assistance of knee high leg braces. I have only just recently had to start using a cane, but I am not sure if that is due to my fatness or not. To be completely honest I struggled a LOT when I was a kid due to the social issues that inevitably come with being different. I have hydrocephalus that has given me no problems other than ADD that made elementary and high school very difficult. I think that I would have benefitted from therapy and/or medication for the ADD and psychological distress I have had my entire life. I did find a psychiatrist that finally put me on Wellbutrin and my life did a complete 180\u00b0. The good news is that the clich\u00e9 \u201cthings get better\u201d is mostly true. At 36 I have a supportive circle of friends, a federal job, live independently, and have a dog who adores me. \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc36 Can I ask what you mean about your feet. New mom here trying to learn. Like pressure sores and ulcers... also learned because i cannot feel the bottoms of my feet to always wear shoes outside Thank you for your reply. I am gathering that most with SB have varying degrees of it (snowflake is the term I have heard) and all are different but I am glad to learn all I can. Again thanks for sharing your experience. Very true that there are varying degrees some worse than others I am already born, so I try to make the most of the life I was given, but if personalities were just bubbles in the void waiting to be put into new borns, then I would say I would rather this body have been aborted so that I could have come into this world without struggling to walk, daily pain, inconsistent control of bladder function, tens of thousands of dollars of medical expenses only fractionally covered by American health care, and in general life in a world that considers able bodied to be the norm I was told I would never walk too. Till around 13 I played football everyday! Now I am a bit limited but I am still getting around. Yep my daughter started martial arts last year and she kicks like a mule now lol. People are shocked when they learn she has spina bifida. I still have to tell people I am disabled. That is how able I am and I have the most severe kind. We got to keep fighting as your daughter and you will know best! Yep she had an L5 myelomeningocele and if you did not know you would not have a clue. The technology now is amazing and she was born in 2011. I am sure it is even better now. Some can even be repaired in utero. Terminating sb babies is just a cowardly thing to do. They deserve a chance and when they get it they often exceed all expectations I agree. I wish her the absolute best. It will be a difficult journey but it will be so rewarding for her if she chooses to start a family and can look back on life in a way in which her disability does not overshadow her life, that is my dream. Thank you so much No problem. Got To spread the positivity. Brought tears to my eyes.

Anyone else been told they cant parent because of their disability? I was taken from my mom because she was disabled with Spina Bifida. My husband cannot have biological children, and adoption is off the table for us because he is paraplegic. Never mind that he has a PhD and is completely independent. I have a friend who was barren. Must be difficult maybe instead of adoption you could sponsor a single parent and their child and be like a coparent?\nBut I am more speaking to being told a disabled parent cant be a fit parent. Well that is essentially what the adoption agencies are telling him. He is not fit bc of his sb. Oh I see That is messed up I have Spina Bifida and have a lovely child. I was almost taken from my dad multiple times because people just cant fathom a single parent especially a Male competently taking care of two kids one  being disabled Wtpfpr look it up they can use stories like ours to inform congress about the issues that disabled people face with discrimination being a parent.

I have been sedentary for awhile and now I am at a job where I am moving a lot and unless I am running 800mg of ibuprofen and ice around the clock my ankles fold more and the soles become numb. My local hospital says \u201cevidence of retethering at conus\u201d however I overnighted the mri to my surgeon and eventually just drove to him out of worrying and getting worse, he said he was not sure but did not think I would retethered but could not explain what is going on? With activity I worsen, with rest, ice and ibuprofen I go back to my baseline for the most part but my feet are becoming more and more deformed and I am not sure what to do, nobody has any answers and because of previous opioid addiction they usually write me off for that before I am even in the door. Does anyone have any advice? I literally have no idea what is going on but I am about to go to nursing school and work full time and am just so terrified of becoming paralyzed when I finally got my shit together and have so many opportunities. Thanks Ps: I called it constant retethering cause I have had 5 previous detethering surgeries as a child", "Question about catheterizing with a full bladder. I went to cathe a couple of weeks ago, and I had issues. I had had a full bladder, and I actually decided to cathe about 10 minutes earlier than I usually do because of it. \n\nI inserted the bag catheter, but I had resistance, which is not abnormal, so after a few more tries, I grabbed another. \n\nUnfortunately, I had problems with the next catheter, so I tried another. I tried this with 3 more catheters, and I had issues with each. \n\nIt got to the point where I had to text my parents, who were out shopping, to come home. When they get home, my dad used a straight catheter and got 450 CCs. My question is, is it normal to have trouble catheterizing with a full bladder? i think it may be the bag caths sorry, i have rarely use bag ones but i know there is resistence Yes I sometimes have trouble, even though I use a straight cath. I think it might have to do with the surgery(ies) I had done to try to tighten up my urethra to keep from leaking and something closes or tightens when I am too full. If I back out and try again at a slightly different angle it works better. Can I hijack your thread to ask about some of the surgeries you had to fix your bladder?  Like what age you had these done? \n\n  I have been struggling to stay dry and meeting with Urologist on Friday to discuss surgical options. This was my thought.  Changing catheter types has helped me.  My doctor office was great about providing samples of different types, and updating the supplier.   \n\nI have had to have the wifey help occasionally though when things are a challenge.   I think the 3rd party is willing to use a little more force, and the different angle, makes a difference. when i see resistance i simply push and force myself to pee a little and it helps a lot. mostly after a few drops, the catheter goes in smoothly.  i use a hydrophilic intermittent catheter btw. i am not a professional but i think the reason why we encounter resistance could be the pressure of the full bladder. i experience it a lot when i drink alcohol out and especially if i am trying to cathe myself standing. I had them all before I was a teenager, I believe. I am 42. To be honest with you I am not really sure which one finally worked, I am sorry. I have a new urologist (since I am an adult now) and it was my pediatric urologists who did all the surgeries. Thanks!  The fact that you do not remember what surgeries you had is a positive in my mind.  It means you do not think about it or dealing with complications from them. Exactly. I only remember really vague, general memories of being in the hospital.\nI did have one recent illness two years ago that was a side effect of not being able to pass kidney stones (because of the alterations to my urethra, I do not leak pee but I also apparently cannot pass stones lol) and I had a horrific hospital stay where everything kind of fell apart domino style, so that would be my one reason why I should have visited the urologist more often. So, that is my cautionary tale. But at least it took 40 years to happen! I too suffer bladder issues, you are not alone. Oh gosh! This is my biggest fear with cathing. My mom had tons of kidney stones and ended up getting renal cancer when I was a kid. There is absolutely no way I would be able to pass one. Did you just have pain or how did you know you had a stone? OMG yes, the worst pain of my life. I was on the bathroom floor in agony trying to make it through the night before going in to get checked out. (that did not happen)\nI do not know if it is genetic but if your mother had a problem with it I would probably see a urologist once a year to make sure you are doing okay.

Most of the time, the pain lasts a few minutes, but does anyone else have this issue, if so, do you know what causes it so I can kill it. Thanks I have occulta and i am like this. I assume it is just the lack of bone/protective tissue over the improperly formed vertebrae so the cord is more exposed than in the rest of the spine. I walk (more or less) and one doctor had never known anyone with SBO, so he wanted to see my back... stuck his thumb right into the spot and I immediately hit the floor (and cussed him out).

No one not even myself shall touch that area without me flailing in pain. When a skinny person bends over, you can see the bumps of the spine on their back.... they are called spinal processes. When they have to do spinal surgery, they break each one off in the area they need to operate and those processes arent put back. Its a permanent break and that surgical site fills in with scar tissue. Leaving your spinal cord in that area unprotected.

Half of the cyst has refilled already, and they told me my condition is permanent. I also have Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which was diagnosed a little over a year ago. \n\nI got denied disability twice, and sadly enough, I am hoping the spina bifida diagnosis helps me win my case. Definitely a bittersweet diagnosis. \n\nAnyways, after a whirlwind of symptoms with my back, I am glad to finally know what caused it all. And count this as my introduction! Haha Damn. This sucks and I am sorry you were dealt such a shitty hand.  I am sorry to hear you have become immobile :/ I cannot imagine what that must be like. \n\nDid you became paralyzed after surgery? May I ask are you paralyzed from the hips down? Where was the meningocele located on your spine? Did something happen that made the cyst grow like trauma to the area? Did they give you other bullshit diagnoses before they told you it is Spina Bifida? Or make you feel crazy for hurting?\n\nWhat are your symptoms and what were they before you lost mobility? Do you have any entrapped nerves?\n\nSorry for being so nosey... Today I turned 30. My whole life I have suffered from knee, elbow/ joint pain. When I was a few months from 27 years old I was hit in the tailbone, SUPER long story short I JUST found out last month it is a meningocele. It doubled in size in 6 months... last I knew it was 3.5 CM= MRI on 17JAN19. Surgery keeps getting delayed and I am scared they are going to wait to long. I already pee myself at least a few times a week, and shit myself lol yikes... That is hot am I right?!\n\nPlease only share all you are comfortable with! I am so intrigued by your story. It is hard to find anything on it regarding adults online. \n\n-Fellow Spina Bif Spoonie Damn that sucks. Sending positive vibes your way. I have been immobilized several times by spinal cord injuries before I got rediagnosed with SBO, DDD, and the early stages of osteoporosis. Attitude is everything. I do not have time to answer all your points right now, but feel free to check my post history for details, or PM me. \n\nI just got diagnosed with a sacral meningocele about a year ago. I had surgery on July 17th, 2019.  I had an MRI last Saturday, and it looks like about 5cm of my 12cm cyst has already refilled and returned. Due to the cyst\u2019s massive size, my sacral bones are almost completely eroded. I do not have any metal hardware or treatment for the sacral fragility, the hip and pelvic instability, or anything of the sort. The surgery only treated the cyst. \n\nAlso a year ago, I started using a wheelchair because of nerve pain, paresthesia, hip and thigh weakness and numbness, and mild drop foot. I have gradually eased into the chair more and more over the past year, and am trying to obtain a better wheelchair so I can use it inside my non-adapted house on bad days. For anything more than 5-10 mins of upright on-my-feet time, I have found my wheelchair to be most helpful. \n\nI am also concerned about my cyst\u2019s rapid growth. I had my cyst grow about 1.5cm in 3 months before surgery. My cyst also caused mass effect on my spinal nerves. The cyst 2.0 is also causing some mass effect, and my nerve pain has been worse since surgery, but my bowel, bladder, and sexual function all saw some improvement since surgery, as well as my appetite increased (that is a good thing). \n\nSo, I am not paralyzed, but I have sciatic nerve weakness and numbness bilaterally, I cannot stand or walk longer than 5-10 mins, I have severe back pain and joint instability from L4 down, and nerve pain from the L4 region down as well. \n\nI have been trying to fit in with the spinal cord injury group, and it is been a close fit, but I feel I can really identify with other moderately affected Spina Bifida patients. I am just bewildered that my Spina Bifida went undiagnosed until now! After all I have been through, after back pain since age 2, after 10 years of numbness on my right thigh, etc, etc. \n\nHope that helps answer some questions! Thank you so much for being so open and vulnerable. I am so sorry this has taken so much from you and that it is taken this long to get answers. People including doctors are not educated enough about Spina Bifida, I am guilty. Of course now that I know I have it 30 years later, literally just found out like a month ago that I was born with it.. I know everything the internet has to offer haha. I know it is frustrating and challenging, but I am glad you reached out to the community bc it is hard to find adults with it who were also diagnosed at a later age. I am sorry for your struggles and battles, but know that you are never alone and your story helps others. I for one needed to hear it. I am glad to be of help! There is a local Spina Bifida Christmas party coming up that I plan to attend. Maybe networking IRL with other Spina Bifida suffered could help?\n\nDo you have occulta? I am not certain of my subtype, I was not told. That sounds fun! I definitely want to connect with other adults who found out later in life. I have meningocele. So did you have visible signs of the meningocele from the outside of your back? I have dimples on both sides of my spine and a fatty tailbone right above my butt crack, but other then that no. No signs at all. You? I also have sacral dimples (always thought they were cute, nothing more). And I used to have a strawberry hemangioma when I was a baby, right over my spine, but nobody caught it till now. \n\nIt is interesting that you are typed meningocele because you had no marked visible signs. My doctors are trying to label me occulta for that reason, but I kind of disagree, since occulta is often benign and my Spina Bifida is far from benign. Me too!

As everyone here probably already knows, I am engaged to a wonderful man that happens to have spina bifida. We just moved in together in preparation for our big day in January.\n\nWell, I really screwed up a few days ago and ripped open a big package that came since I assumed it was something I was expecting from amazon and it turned out to be a big case of adult diapers (for my guy)...He turned purple and has been avoiding me ever since which is completely unlike him.\n\nI just wanted to thank everyone that responded to the original post about whether I should or should not say something and give an update...\n\nI decided after carefully reviewing everything everyone said (and thank you so much again) that even though I really do just want to tell him I am sorry, I already knew you needed those anyway, I love you etc. etc. that he really does deserve the autonomy of me not bringing it up unless he does first. I will respond by telling him I love him and it is not big deal if he mentions it but I am not going to mention it first based on his reaction since this is so unlike him and I feel like such as ass...\n\nIt is still hard to believe that he does not know that I already knew though...We were snuggling in bed last night and he turned to turn off the light and I could completely see his whole \"diaper\" just like I have seen it a million times before but I do realize that I need to be sensitive.  \n\nAnyway, with that said, since he is still avoiding me, does everyone think it is ok for me to just say over text (I will not do this in person) that I am sorry that I ripped open your stuff? With no mention of what I found or any of that but just apologizing for violating his privacy? Or...is that still too much?\n\nThanks. I am sorry I am not normally this paranoid. I have just never dealt with anything like this before. We actually never talk about or mention spina bifida at all...So it is like wow what to do... It is great your talking - best of luck! Wow! First of all, it is awesome to hear an SO invested in trying to understand, prepare, and get outside advice. It sounds like you are taking the right steps to being a serious and supportive partner. \n\nAnd really that is all you have to do. Be there for them, listen, and give them confidence that they can share anything and you will have their back.\n\nEverything else I have to say is from my own perspective and probably will not universally apply. So only use it as anecdotes or a framework for conversation to find out how they feel.\n\nPersonally, I am over 30 and have had to deal with urinary and bowel incontinence all my life. Luckily, my SB is as mild as it can get, so unless people get to know me or see me at my worst, I pass for \"normal\". So I cannot help describe much of the other physical challenges usually associated with it. As, of recently (post college), my biggest problems have actually been struggling with the mental/psychological problems of SB, primarily dealing with bipolar disorder.\n\nAll that said, here is the things that 1) I think about it and 2) people do that help me.\n\nFirst of all, the thing I most wish for when I go about my life is to feel like my disability is not going to prevent me from doing what I want to do. So that means that I need to prepare my medical supplies (Caths, lubrication,  diapers, meds, gloves, wet wipes, water bottles, etc.) in order to feel comfortable and prepared.  Bi-Weekly to once a month, I prepare a batch of these kits so that I can just grab them on the go, which really helps bring flexibility and spontaneity back in to my life.\n\nThings my family and SO do that really helps is just chipping in when they can to help me with these extra chores. I cannot explain how happy it made me the first time my SO did my clothes for me, including my underwear (which is often stained with leaks). The fact that they did this without skipping a beat and just accepting that this is the work I have to do to maintain my life, really felt amazing. At the end of the day, most of my fears of rejection growing up centered around people finding out the truth and thinking it is weird, pitiful, or repulsive. So feeling accepted and that it is not a big deal was huge to me. Hey Dave...\nJust wanted to thank you again for all of your throughout and kind comments on this topic. So far literally everything you have said about this situation has been spot on..It is almost as if you are psychic.\nThere are some additional much more personal questions that I have for you that came up but I cannot figure out how to PM in Reddit (I am brand new to this site-just found it because there was not much else about Spina Bifida in terms of other people to talk to on the web). Can I ask you a couple of questions?\nCan you PM me so I can PM you back? Hey thanks for these tips from the inside. I guess I did not realize because my SO is so upbeat and positive how much this condition really can and does impact daily life...\nNow that we are living together, I am really seeing it.\nDo you know how to PM in reddit? I have some questions for the men with Spina Bifida of this world but I cannot figoure it out...I access this site on my phone and do not have the app maybe that is why... You bet...text or call 480-250-7977.  I am in Oregon so Pacific time zone. Let me know if the phone number gets blanked out by the software and I will get more sneaky.  Hey Dave...Thanks so much for being willing to chat with me. You are so kind. I just tried to send you a text. Im not sure if you received it. I am also in pacific time but my work schedule is kind of off because I do in home therapy meaning I work off hours sometimes.\nPlease text me back if you got the message. :)", "Enema not working as well as it used to I was born with L3 and the enema just does not seem to work as well as it did a year ago... I brought it up to my urologist she did not seem to think anything was wrong but it is the most frustrating thing because I feel like I need to do the enema again to feel better How old are you? Have you grown recently? What is your solution in the enema? How often do you do it? What method do you use (mace, gravity, peristeen etc).  Any changes in your peeing? \n\nUsually If an enema is not working it is because you grew, your cord tethered, or you got a little backed up and it compounded over time.  \n\nAre you on Facebook? The group \u201cbowel management for spina bifida\u201d is a phenomenal group. I just turned 15 and yes I have grown A LOT in the last year I went from 5 foot 3 to 5 foot 6 in 8 months but I have also upped the water... it is a cone enema Do you make saline or use straight up water? How much water do you use? Have you ever tried adding glycerine or Castile soap? \n\nAlso have you talked to your neurosurgeon about the change in enema results? They might want to know about that.  Any changes in peeing? Just warm water occasionally saline, no I have not seen a neurosurgeon about the change mainly because I have not seen a neurosurgeon since I was 6 months old due to my shunt and no change in pee either Ok.  I would recommend adding some liquid glycerine to your solution.  10mL per pound of body weight is the rule of thumb.  Maybe start with 50-70mL and go up from there.  \n\nYou do not go to any yearly check ups at a spina bifida clinic? I would recommend making an appt with your neurosurgeon for a check up at the very least.  Tell them about your enema changes. I do go for yearly checkups but I do not see a neurologist", "best time for a disabled worker to have a caregiver come over? I am in school right now to be an elementary school teacher.

I am a 26 year old female with Spina Bifida occulta. I found out about my condition when I was 12 after getting an X-ray for a mild case of scoliosis. I have had no issues up until about 3 years ago when I started getting UTIs that would frequently turn into kidney infections. I have researched about Spina Bifida and UTIs but unsure if the two could be related. Any insight would be helpful. Thanks! If you are starting to pee a little bit when you are out and about this could be leading to the constant UTIs.  If you are waking up with wet bottoms then it is definitely incontinence that is causing these.  I know it does not sound pleasant at all and is a little discomforting but maybe look into a catheter so you can relieve yourself and prevent further UTIs.  Best of luck :) Hey there - Occulta here too, learned about it around 20 as my parents were not well informed. I also developed UTIs in my teen years, and was told at the time that it is unusual for a guy. I did not put it together (SB and UTIs) until the 2nd or 3rd episode. For me, getting a complete void is difficult so I often would not extend the needed energy/time to fully void. This resulted in eventual UTI conditions. The first UTIs were left untreated (I was clueless) which eventually ended with me in the hospital for kidney issues.  \nI still have issues but awareness is the key. Know the signs and alter your behaviors to minimize the frequency and severity. I pay close attention to the frequency, color, and clarity of my urine output and can literally smell an infection coming. When an episode begins, I hit it hard with herbs and fluids. I avoid antibiotics.  \n\n\nFind your personal rhythms and be vigilant! I suggest seeking out an herbal recipe that supports a healthy urinary tract for when an issue starts.\n\nGood luck - you can do it!  \n adding to what others have said, Cranberry is proven to be effective in reducing UTI's. Thank you everyone for taking the time to comment! I truly appreciate it and hope to get some relief soon. Depends upon your individual circumstances - but for me it was an inability to empty my bladder. Add to it some dehydration, you do not leak if you do not drink, and hello UTI.

I made an account just to reach out in this thread. \n\nSo, I am a 26 year old woman born with lipomeningocele, a type of spina bifida (hence I am here), but I have never met anyone in my entire life with my condition. I was fortunate enough to be born in Canada where healthcare is free and I have had two spinal surgeries, one at a few months old (allowed me to walk) and another as a teenager (allowed me to make a heel-to-toe rotation), both were highly successful and I can live my life invisibly. To that is to say, you would not know I had lipomeningocele unless I took my clothes off and turned around. \n\nIt makes \\*other\\* people uncomfortable when they see it. I understand that it can be quite jarring to some able-bodied people to see someone with a tumour the size of baseball on their lumbar spine and a surgery scar over a foot long coupled with scar tissue. While it used to bother me during my formative years, it is a part of my identity and I have grown to embrace my different body. The only thing I do not care for is the lifelong chronic pain, but what could I expect when I have had 8 bones removed from my spine and 4 of which were replaced? Arthritis is just a part of my life. \n\nBut I am kind of... lonely? I have great social connections, family and friends, support and love, but I have never met anyone with my condition. I know it is not as uncommon as one might think, and I am sure there is so many other people with lipomeningocele out there but I have never had the opportunity to talk to anyone about it outside of the medical community who understood. I am just looking to talk to people who have this condition, swap stories and maybe get some advice. \n\nSo, does anybody else have lipomeningocele in this thread? Hi there I am a 27 year old guy with lipomyelomeningocele. I understand how you feel I recently just came here to find people with these exact condition. I hope we can connect and talk and find more people like us.", "Blister issue So I recently got new AFOs like a month ago and because I had not been on my feet for the whole month my legs are now really tight. Because of this, my legs are bent and I am exerting all of my weight between my crutches and the front of my feet. I recently returned to school the other day and after a few days I started noticing a sharp pain on my big toe. I knew what was before I looked at it hours later, a blister, or at least the beginning of one. What did I do about it? Nothing. The next day sucked, any time I had to get us and walk it was agony, and so the entire day I felt mentally and physically like crap and accomplished nothing. So for about 4 days I used the wheelchair and yesterday I noticed that the blister drained and was starting to form a callous. Because of this I thought that I would be able to walk without pain today, how very wrong I was. Since the blister formed I have not been wearing my night brace on that foot because I do not want to aggravate it. Tonight, however, my dad came in and asked why I was not wearing both KAFOS, when I explained that I did not want to aggravate the blister, he said \" go cry me a river\". After I stood my ground, he backed off. But now I am worried if I was in the wrong and I just need to suck it up. What do you guys think? i am sorry your dad was not able to offer you more support, you know the most about what is going on with your body and comments like his do not help you understand it any better Thanks, I will have to try that out", "Question about insurance Hello!\n\nI hope it is alright for me to ask this here-- please let me know if I come across strangely. I am a med student who is been learning about advancement in treatment to spina bifida. Most of the literature I have read focuses on interventions for infants, and the need for interdisciplinary treatment teams to manage different forms of spina bifida. There is a noticable lack of study in adult case management.\n\nHow difficult is it to access care related to your condition in adulthood? Assuming many of your are from the USA, health insurance is a major mess.

Finding care as an adult has been a real challenge. I grew up in the Midwest and for most of my life went to the children's hospital in the nearby city. When I was in high school I was no longer happy with my neurologist and started trying to get second opinions but was not sure where to start. I moved to the Bay Area for a few years and was able to attend the Spina Bifida clinic through Kaiser and they were amazing. Though you would have to have insurance through Kaiser to be able to attend. Since moving back to the Midwest, I am on my own again to research different treatments and different options. The children's hospital here has a Spina Bifida clinic, but I cannot go back there (which, had I never left, I would have been able to continue going into adulthood).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been fortunate enough to not have a lot of insurance issues. I was on Medicaid for a while but the doctor I was seeing at the time accepted it. Mostly it is just having to deal with costs from medical supplies not being covered, and it is never clear just how much I am responsible for paying until the bill arrives in the mail which makes it hard to plan for.", "Freaking out constantly about my kidneys! So I cant stop thinking about my kidney function. As far as I am concerned I have completely fine kidneys but I always have this 'What If\" in my head for example usually in the morning my bladder is very full and I get a kind of stretching/pressure feeling when my bladder is really full. AKA my que to cath but when my bladder gets full I start to freak out \"what if it is refluxing into my kidneys\" or what if my kidneys are damaged! Now I had urodynamics done and my pressure was like 30 at 12 ounces. Now my concern is what happens if I drink a 16 oz water bottle does it reflux then because I heard if the pressure reaches 40 it is going to reflux. As well as my bladder was shaped weirdly so I am on Detrol to help that. But anyway my fear of Kidney damage is so bad id rather not go see my urologist (I go anyway of course) just to avoid knowing if there is something wrong with my kidneys! I am on six month check ups with a urologist (I have spina bifida and a tethered cord) just for safety! I have never had issues but they wanted me to keep in close contact just in case. It is always worth relaying any fears you have to them or even just your GP or something, they might be able to give you some advice to manage the anxiety or do some extra test to give you some peace of mind! &gt;ra\n\nyeah, it is definitely not just that I am paranoid I have full-blown anxiety as well about everything. I have been told by friends and family that I am always very tense and seemed stressed 24/7. I go for my yearly ultrasound on may 17 ill bring up my concerns then Cath on a regular schedule instead of waiting for any feeling.  Typical people pee every four hours.  So try maybe doing it every 3.5? well, the good thing is it is usually every 4 hours or so I did not question anything because it was timed. As far as I can remember id wait for that feeling but i guess you are right its probably not good If you are so concerned about it keep track of how much you have in in a day and make sure it comes out with a measuring cup.\n\nI am fairly new to this and have to do strict I/o and cathing to prevent pyelonephritis and they want me to Cath 6 times a day.\n\nI hope that helps.

Because they have a pretty common symptoms. A spinal cord injury is when someone with a typical spinal cord (which is the biggest nerve in your body that hangs down from the back of the brain) is injured somehow.  Either damaged or completely severed.  Since nerves do not grow back, the persons function is affected from the injury down.  \n\nIn SB, it is a matter of the spinal cord and the nerve roots (which are big nerves that go off from the spinal  cord to your legs, arms etc) being formed incorrectly when a baby was barely more than an egg.  \n\nAfter a human egg is fertilized, it doubles its cells over and over until about day 26, when the mass of cells looks like a flat pancake.  On day 26 the flat pancake rolls up, zips up and turns into a straw.  The inside of the straw becomes your mouth, gut and poop chute.  The outside of the straw becomes your skin, and the middle stuff becomes your bones and everything else.  SB is when there is a mistake in the zipping process and there is a gap left open at the bottom (or in some cases it is partially closed etc).  Which causes the spinal cord and nerves that were supposed to grow in that spot to be messed up.  There could be none, they could be tangled, they could be stronger on one side or the other etc.  This is why SB is a snowflake condition. The nerves are so tiny and lesions so different that there is a million different combinations the nerves could end up in.  \n\nThe higher up on your back where the messed up zipping process happened generally corresponds to how much function a person has lower down. So, the symptom commonality is because both affect the spine and damage to the spine in similar places is going to have similar symptoms.\n\nSpinal cord injuries are just that, injuries that cause damage to the spinal cord. They can come from a variety of causes.\n\nSpina bifida is a birth defect which happens when the spine/spinal cord does not completely form properly.\n\nBoth often lead to nerve damage in the spine, so the symptoms of *that* can be similar. But for both spinal cord injuries and spina bifida, the details of what exact damage is done to the spine are very important when it comes to what symptoms someone has have, so you will see a large variance in symptoms both between and within the two categories.  Plus there are other things spina bifida can cause (e.g. hydrocephalus) that would not generally show up in a spinal cord injury. Spina bifida is from birth, SCI is acquired from an injury.  They can end up with similar results as both end up with a damaged spine. Yeah, understandable! I know that SB it is something you are born with. But I have my suspicions I am misdiagnosed. I might have SCI(Kyphosis) due to birth trauma or SB. \n\nSo, I am interested, they all have a common symptoms: bladder and bowel problems, paralysis, pain and etc. But what is the main difference? Yeah, understandable! I know that SB it is something you are born with. But I have my suspicions I am misdiagnosed. I might have SCI(Kyphosis) due to birth trauma or SB.\n\nSo, I am interested, they all have a common symptoms: bladder and bowel problems, paralysis, pain and etc. But what is the main difference? As a parent of a 12yr old SB kid, that is the best, most concise, description of SB I have seen to date! Thank you! The main difference is physiological, the symptoms are going to overlap. the main difference is a SCI is from an injury and SB is not they can have similar symptoms I see Spina Bifida as being born with a Spinal Cord Injury. We \\*do\\* have many of the same issues, but also different. Many issues that get handled shortly after an accident-related injury may be handled later since the person with the issues is not as effected by those issues. SB well, we are og crips triple og crips lol. Spina bifida is a defect from birth, sci is when an able bodied person was injured in some accident", "Parents of growing tween with SB looking for advice on bathroom practices Our daughter is 10 years old now and was born with SB myelomeningocele. She had the meningocele repair the day she was born (sac ruptured during c-section delivery) and a non-programmable shunt placed a couple weeks later to treat her hydrocephalus. We have been very fortunate that she is never needed a shunt revision. Other than a heal chord release and routine check ups with neurology and urology she has not had a lot of medical treatment required over the years. She is essentially paralyzed from the waist down and has a manual chair.\n\nShe is always had bathroom issues from her neurogenic bowel and bladder. She uses intermittent catheters (which she is been doing on her own for the past 2 years!) for bladder and a cone irrigator every other day for bowel management. She is currently on an antibiotic that is tearing her stomach up pretty badly. Fortunately she will be done with it tomorrow but it is made daily enemas a requirement and made us realize, yet again, that the way we are handling bowel management is unsustainable.\n\nAs far as we can tell, our daughter has no sensation of when she is going to have or has had a BM. Sitting in her custom molded seat pretty much seals all but the worst of #2 accident odors so she does not realize until she is transferred onto the toilet and pulled her pull up down, spreading the mess in the process.\n\nWe help her clean up (as we have always done) with the use of baby wipes and a shower for the bigger messes. It is logistically hard (maybe even impossible) for her to balance on the toilet and clean herself so we continue to do it for her, but she is getting older and we feel like there needs to be a change so that she can be more independent. We have looked into bidets but it seems that most would not be able to handle the job. So far we do not know of a way to have her use the cone irrigator on her own, so we also do this for her while she sits on the toilet.\n\nOften accidents, which have been frequent over the past week from the antibiotic, result in a lot of work, a lot of time wasted that she could have spent being a 10 year old and a lot of frustration for everyone. We have mulled around the possibility of a MACE surgery, but are apprehensive about adding to her medical laundry list.\n\nI would be happy to hear from anyone who has advice on bathroom strategies that have helped, parents of SB kids who are dealing with other/similar bathroom issues, or the MACE surgery.\n\ntl;dr: We have been doing potty time the same way for our 10 year old daughter w/ SB since she was 3 and are trying to find a better way.\n\nEdit: spelling My daughter will be 11 in 2 days, although her paralysis is very low, she does have a neurogenic bowel and bladder. She is no longer in her wheelchair due to having an amputation and getting prosthesis but she had the Mace and mitrofanoff done when she was wheelchair bound. The recovery sucked, she was having painful bladder spasms, and had to wear a urine bag for a few weeks. Once healed, she had timed bathroom visits to empty her bladder, every 2 hours, and she flushed the Mace every other day. The problem with the Mace is if you do not get the whole flush out, then there are going to be leaks. It worked  well for us but she could transfer to the toilet and stuff. Her mace did close up within a year and the mitrofanoff came loose, so she has to have a revision. As far as your daughter not being able to wipe, I do not have any helpful advice, but I hope you find what your looking for. If you have any other ?s or whatever, feel free to pm me. I am sorry I do not have advice. My daughter is 6 with the same diagnosis. She was blessed/fortunate to have a very low defect and is able to walk. \nPotty trouble has been strange because we have no idea if she really knows when she has to go. Sometimes she does great and sometimes not so much. \nI feel your circumstance while reading your post and have been there and still go through it with the accidents and clean ups. \n\nI just really wanted to say you are awesome parents. Thank you for your fight through this because it is so hard to see any hope in those times of piles of laundry and trash bags of baby and disinfectant wipes. \n\nKeep pushing. You are an inspiration. Thank you.  Thank you for taking the time to write this. Knowing there are others out there who understand what we are dealing with speaks volumes. I Hope that we can give equally good advice in return. Thanks for the input I will be sure to pm you soon. I am sure I do not have to explain how crazy \"typical\" day is. Again, thank you. My brother is 21 and had the mace put in a few years ago. I recommend it. It is about 1 hour of toilet time a day but very rarely does he have accidents. We also use an enema via the mace 2-3 times a week, keeps it all in check. PM me if you have any other questions I may be able to help with. My son began independently doing his enemas at 9 with the peristeen enema system, he is 11 now. It takes about an hour and he needs them every night but it is been working well.  I had the same surgery done.  Not the mace, but the cecostomy and the mitrofanoff.\n\nI am 40 now.  There is no need to even wear a diaper now.  It is really an amazing surgery.  The recovery is was hard, and you will have ups and downs learning the right mixture of fluids to flush the bowels, but your child will thank you later.", "I am trying to determine if a diagnosis my father was given was spina bifida My father was drafted to Vietnam, but before he left they found am abnormality in his spine.

", "I am done I have had anxiety all my life. I am now 15 and Ive gotten to a point where I am kind of giving up and feel hopeless. Let me start by saying I have never been independent my mom has had to do my cath all my life even though I can easily do it my own. I have had years and years of doctors telling me to do it myself. Now I feel like I am hitting a breaking point I feel as if no one cares anymore I have given up and so has my mom I have gone over a week without cathing at one point and I know that was not/is not good for me but I just got to a point where I gave up and stopped asking my mom to do it for me or me just trying it myself! As of 3 days ago I have been realizing that if I have to start doing this on my own so that is what I did I have been doing my own cath for 3 days now and feel ok about it! First time in 15 years I have done this. Now I am worrying about the damage that I may have already done (I feel ok physically) but I feel like this constantly not just the spina bifida but just everything health wise. And honestly I do not know what to do anymore I cannot live my life the way I have been living it I just feel like my life is so time oriented I have to do this at this time or this will happen I am just tired of it! I absolutely dread having kidney problems or disease I am terrified of any kind of doctor and my blood pressure goes through the roof every doctor I see! I try to keep myself healthy by going to the gym and eating low carb (keto) I just feel like my life is getting harder and harder to maintain every single day! I feel like me growing up and becoming more independent is taking away a part of my life. I have been using my mom doing everything for me as a coping mechanism because I am terrified of growing up and being on my own.\n\nNow I know other people with SB have it worse than me I can walk and do almost everything everyone else can (L3 mylomengocele) but I feel like I am not doing anything right even when I do what my doctors say I am terrified of dying young there is a lot I want to do with myself and I cannot stand the thought of not being able to do those things. Anyway I know this is a lot to read and I am only 15 but I could just really use some help I am always on here asking questions and I feel like I am driving the people who read my stuff crazy! I obviously do not want to waste anyone\u2019s time but hopefully someone will read this one to! 1)Take a deep breath. \n2)Before you read any advice, just ask yourself 2 questions. Who are you grateful for? And what are you grateful for? Just mull over these two questions everytime you feel overwhelmed. Remember that someone around the world did not wake up the last time they went to sleep.\n3)When I was born my parents were told i had 24 hours to live. Now Im 23. I have a failing right kidney working at 11% of a normal kidney. Yet the doctors are telling me if I take care of myself i can live till 70 +-10 years. I have been self catheterising since the age of 6. Despite having spina bifida (myelomeningocele, sheesh what a pain to type it) plus club foot, I have a bachelor degree from college, can play the harmonium, can sing, tried dancing (boring), can play video games, attempting CA, searching for a job, reading tons of material. Yes this year is a bit overwhelming. I was suppose to get a job. But Im not going to keep worrying about it. Its not going to help me. So chill. You are only 15. Listen to your doctors. Try your best to stay healthy and positive. Kudos for becoming independent. I have much to learn and live for. Again im only 23. But if I dont wake up tomorrow, I know I had so much fun till now.  That sounds great! I want to try to get a job I am perfectly able to get a job but I am from New Jersey and they do not usually hire until 16 so I got like 8 months I am trying to keep myself busy or the anxiety will just completely take me over and I have a melt down like this post although everything I explained has been bothering me for over a year but I am slowly working on myself and hopefully it will get better! I luckily do have high bladder pressure but it does not reflux it just finds the other way out so I do not think there is a huge chance my kidneys are bad but you never know and I will not know until my next urology appointment in June! Have you ever connected with this organization? \n\n\n\nOr how about going to camp? \n\n\n\n(Obvi I know camp is not going on right now ...) I am not really a camp guy to be honest I am more of a do my own thing kind of person so I have never been to a camp. Although I play sled hockey and a lot of kids on my team have SB so I talk to them a lot I kind of get what you are feeling, if you ever need to vent my dms are open. I am 16F if that matters Awesome thanks for the offer! I was you once. At your exact age, exactly. I have a neo-bladder that I had to self cath. I had been pretty independent about it since age 10. Like you, I grew anxious  and depressed. I decided I was going to stop cathing  and go as far as increase  fluid intake. It was incredibly dumb and dangerous but I \"had reached the end of my rope\". I did serious damage to my bladder and solitary kidney.\n\nNow, at 37, I am forced to live with an indwelling nephtosotomy that is painful and a BIGGER risk for infection than the neo bladder. It is  the only thing that is holding my kidney degeneration at Stage III. \n\nI know it sucks growing up like this. We live in a world that is not designed for people like us and those who truly understand our trials and tribulations  are few and far between. But you MUST fight through  it. I know that sounds like an empty platitude, but it it not.\n\nGet some help. Find a way to take control of your anxiety while being responsible  for your own health and care as much as you can. Feel free to PM me to talk. Awesome thanks for the offer!", "Welcome to my Channel! ", "Any relief from premature ejaculation?

", "24yo male with spina bifida Hey everyone, \n\nDid not know the policy so I just decided to create a post and introduce myself. As the title says I am a 24 year old guy with spina bifida/ tethered chord syndrome. I honestly do not know any details about my condition, I guess I always backed away from learning about it. I have a mild case so I have been very fortunate. \n\nI was fine till about age 6 when I started to develop fatty tissue around my nerves in my back which caused severe pain and kept me from moving. I had surgery soon after that to remove the tissue and the surgeon accidently hit one of my nerves which gave me drop foot in both my feet, I also have no to limited sensation till my knees. \n\nI then ended up having spinal fluid leaking, which caused intense headaches and overall pain so I had another surgery to fix that less than a year later. \n\nLearned to walk again at around age 8 with the help of leg braces, and mostly staying in a wheelchair. \n\nI actually had a great experience growing up since my parents are really supportive. I had a good group of friends as well growing up and only had the occasional kid making fun of my walk. \n\nNow comes my sob story I guess...\n\nI have always been lazy and I guess really used spina bifida as an excuse. I STILL wear diapers. Had a couple kids make fun of me for it during school, which motivated me to try catheterization but there used to be blood and I gave it up as a kid l and just kept wearing diapers. \n\nI hate myself for it. I tried just training myself to use the bathroom normally but even if I stay in the bathroom forever i cannot empty completely and if I get up to fast or sneeze, urine will come out. \n\nI have kept gaining weight since my first surgery and reached 295 a couple months back. I lost touch with most of my friends after I moved sophmore year of high school and social anxiety/laziness has kept me from making any new ones even 10 years later. \n\nI completed my Masters this January and moved back to California to my parents and decided to really change my life. I LOVE swimming, it is where I feel the least disadvantaged. I have not been going as much as I want but I am definitely going. I am starting to learn some strength machines and want to start doing the treadmil and bike soon too. \n\nI am currently down to 285, that is from water weight and not eating fast food every day now but I still feel good and think I can get better and lose more weight. \n\nI started catheter again but it is been hard to keep at it. I LOVE not wearing a diaper. Its the best feeling the world for me right now. But I get maybe 3.5 hours of freedom and then I might have a drop or something. Sometimes more. So I have had to wear pull ups. That became an extra problem because there were drops and I had to change the pull ups by taking off my shoes and pants and underwear and then changing my pull up. I have a hard time finding motivation to either use a catheter every 2.5 hours or take off everything regardless as to where I am and change a pull up. \n\nI need to work on That. I also need to make friends, since I have not had a single friend in close to 10 years. That part sucks. My family is very loving but they do not fully understand what I struggle with and I cannot explain it to them. \n\nSorry for the essay and self pity. I actually do appreciate a lot of things about my life. First of all, I have a mild form of spina bifida and I have been able to lead a good life. I really do appreciate all the sacrifices my family has made. I am kind of glad I went through this as I think it is made me a better person and helps me to realize that everyone goes through problems and a lot of people go through a lot. \n\nI have never met anyone personally with spina bifida and never really known someone that has been through similar things. Hopefully I get to hear about some of you.\n\n", "Has anyone ever had a tethered spinal cord and what was done for you? ESPECIALLY in adults.  I do not know anything about tethered cord in adults, but the first place I would go is a respected children's neurosurgeon at Vanderbilt, or Philadelphia, or Cincinnati, and see if they do the surgery on adults. If not, I would ask them for guidance on where to go, etc. Those children's surgeons have more experience than just going to a random neurosurgeon and asking them for help with a tethered cord. Hi. I was diagnosed with tethered cord at the age of 37. I had surgery to de-tether it in 2011 by a neurosurgeon. I am only a teenager, but last may i had to get the surgery, and i now have a fear of spines all of a sudden and flashback/imagine what itd be like if i saw the process I had tethered cord four times. It was when I was younger, so they did not have minimally invasive surgery/microsurgery yet. I had a laminectomy each time and did not have any complications. The worst part was lying flat on my back for 48 hours after each one to prevent cerebrospinal fluid leakage. I was diagnosed with tethered Cord at 25, had surgery at 27. I went to a local specialist neurosurgeon who used to do these surgeries at the children's hospital in my state. He referred me to our university hospital and they all made it seem like it was no big deal. It really was not as difficult as I thought it would be, but I have always been ambulatory and only started showing nerve damage in my 20s when I could not empty my bladder.\n\nI had to lay flat on my stomach for 24 hours after and I found it easier and more comfortable to put a pillow under my hips for support. I was walking again after that 24 hour period and only needed pain meds the first 4 days. I lost quite a bit of muscle stamina in my core, but I am in and out of physical therapy to help keep that built up.", "Raising baby with sb I have a question. While I was pregnant with my son the drs did the quad screening, results came back with very elevated AFP levels which detects spina bifida. I had ultrasounds every 4 weeks to check on Elijah but the dr said he never really saw anything. Recently Eli\u2019s pediatrician brought up his back and said he seems to have a sacral dimple and she refered us to a neurosurgeon. We met with them yesterday and he is ordering an ultrasound on Eli\u2019s back. He thinks it could be a teathered spinal cord or spina Bifida occulta, dr also said if he has a teathered spinal cord he will receive an MRI and then Eli will have to have surgery to release his cord. Has anyone else raised a baby with spina bifida/spinal cord issues? Any advice? I am kind of biased but I think my mother did a pretty good job raising me and getting me to almost 30 lol. She is not a Redditor but I can relay any questions you may have lol. My son is 6 months old now with Spina Bifida. Doctors immediately took him at birth for surgery. After recovering at the nicu for 10 days he finally came home with us. He was required to stay off his back till he healed and cleared by the specialists so we needed a special baby car seat for him to stay on his stomach and he had to sleep on his stomach.\n\nMost important advice I got was to keep the healing wounds clean. Hard to do with a baby. So we ended up going thru diapers a lot faster and also learned how to change bandages. \n\nIt will be a difficult couple of weeks, but just remember its all so temporary! Hard to believe our happiest sweetest baby boy went thru all that looking back now! For us its just a waiting game now to see how affected he is by SB. As of right now he is just like any other 6 month old hard to tell anything till he has more development.\n\nAlso there are a lot of facebook SB groups that might help if you need someone to talk to about it! Our baby, who turns 13 next week, was born at 28 wks and he developed a hematoma on his back in the nicu. They thought it was either a birthmark or bedsore. It was not there when he was born, just kind of showed gradually over time. Got the ultrasound at around 7-8wks old and showed tethered cord. Planned a surgery at 6mos as he was barely 5 pounds when we got out of the nicu at around that 2mo mark. We were changing diapers and thought things were going well before our surgery. After surgery he started retaining urine. And while diapers were \u2018wet\u2019 they were not as full as they should have been and with ivs going in, he began to swell up in the hospital. We almost lost him there! We do feel like for the 4mos before surgery while in our care he was normal baby, after surgery he needed catheters and has used ever since. We have gone to camps and met other families with SB kids and there is a wide range of issues from bowel/bladder to leg shortness or turning in. Some kids are impossible to tell even have it, some are in wheelchairs. Some kids end up with multiple surgeries, some growth spurts cause additional issues and repeated surgeries. You take it one day at a time. Depending on the age of your son, and the severity of it, you can push back against surgery. It is ultimately your choice. It can be helpful, but if there are no issues yet, it is a hard decision to make. It is a long road. No one surgery will fix it forever at least not at this age. Sometimes there is additional scar tissue and they need go back in. I feel sometimes when babies are so small it is hard not to cause other damage to some of the nerves in the same areas. Just a hard choice to make.   Our baby, who turns 13 next week, was born at 28 wks and he developed a hematoma on his back in the nicu. They thought it was either a birthmark or bedsore.

Just a hard choice to make. Now's the time to detether your son's cord. The longer it is tethered, the higher the chance of irreversible nerve damage. Is your son's dimple shallow or does it track back to his cord? My 12 year old has lipomyelomeningocele.  Which is basically SB occulta with an added lump of fat.  We did not get a diagnosis until she was four and had the TC surgery one month after it was finally figured out.  She has some neurological impairments including bladder and bowel and her feet. But if you were to meet her and look at her you probably would not notice much difference from a typical kid.  \n\nTwo pieces of advice.  If you are not, get yourself to a large metropolitan area with a highly rated children\u2019s hospital.  Then make an appointment for a second opinion with their SB clinic.  If you want to tell\nMe your general location I can point you in the right direction.  You want a neuroSURGEON who does this sort of thing several times a week, not several times a year.  Also, ultrasound are only good for the first couple of months until the bones harden.  MRI is the definitive test for SB/TC.  Keep that in mind.  \n\nSecondly, look up Spina Bifida Kids message board on babycenter.com.  They are fantastic for newly diagnosed parents.  Read thru and feel free to make an account and post.  They will take good care of you and alleviate a lot of your anxiety.  \n\nAlso Feel free to reach out to me and I will answer any questions you have to the best of my ability.  Or point you to someone who can. I also forgot to say, your baby is wonderful and perfect just as he is.  He may have some challenges in life, but do not we all? Cannot upvote this enough. Every child is different. Get a second opinion. Wow you described me to the t. I also have lipomyelomeningocele. I had my surgery when I was 2 or 3 and had it corrected. My left side was more affected than my right so as a result I have a club foot (wide foot with high arch) and also a lot more weakness in my left leg. I do not have any bowel issues, however I did as a child and experienced accidents, I also self catheterize .Now as a 22 year old I am able to know when to go and properly control everything.im honestly just your average kid, people only really know I have a disability if I tell then.  Wish I could upvote this multiple times \ud83d\ude0a\n\nL3/L4 MMC, fetal repair, now a precocious 4 yo who will one day conquer the world. Have experienced other lesion-related surgeries over the past couple years. They bounce back quick when they are young. The logistically hardest parts are definitely temporary. All the challenges that do stick around eventually just become part of our \u201cnormal\u201d. Emotionally\u2026 it is a rollercoaster. But honestly (speaking as a parent of several kids) so is typical parenting\u2026 the highs and lows are just as fleeting, only they reach a bit further. I cannot speak for anyone beyond my family, but becoming an SB parent has provided the biggest challenges and the biggest blessings in life and family thus far.\n\nOur first de-tethering is coming up. It is a pretty common complication for SB kids. In consultation with neuro, we have waited for early signs of decreased function before intervening, but we have known it was on the horizon. We are also acutely aware that while long-term outcomes are extremely likely to be net-positive, there is (being neurosurgery) possibility that the intervention might also result in neutral or negative changes to function.\n\nTethering in kids is pretty much guaranteed to cause issues over time \u2014 the spinal cord is meant to float free but, when tethered, instead pulls/stretches/moves in ways it should not as they grow. This eventually results in nerve damage, decreased function, increased discomfort.\n\nIn our experience, pretty much everything about raising an SB kid boils down to weighing a large number of developmental uncertainties and intervention pro/cons in an effort to achieve the best long-term outcomes we can with the information and resources available to us. Some decisions are more clear-cut than others.\n\nSB\u2019s an interesting and varied community, given how widely outcomes differ by type and level, access to expertise and care vary by location, and how dramatically care standards have evolved over the past few decades. But there are plenty in the community who are willing to share their experiences in solidarity and hope that it might inspire and uplift :-) Regardless of the diagnosis, you have got this! I do not have a baby that was raised like that but I was the baby raised like that. I was born with spina bidida then shortly after had surgery for it &amp; tethered spinal cord. It seems shallow, he literally looks like he has 2 buttcracks lol. I guess it is also called a y gluteal cleft. This would be the 2nd dr to notice issues with his spine. His pediatrician sent us to another hospital with amazing specialist. Hopefully we get an answer as we have the ultrasound on the 16th of this month. See I feel like Eli pees way too much, I will change him and 5 mins later the diaper is super full. Me and my boyfriend have to change his clothes 2/3 times a night depending if he pees through his diaper. I am an 1985 kid. I was born with spina bifida.. lump in the bottom of my back and a tethered cord.. currently 36 soon and doing just fine.. although I wish I could remove this fat at the bottom of my back and wear a bikini! \ud83d\ude1e but hey ho.. least I am not in a wheel chair. I also have a right wasted calve \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f also yey not! Which gives me crippling self esteem issues and I also somehow have gained a fat lump on the outer right thigh to which my doc said is all sb related \ud83e\udd28 but I am fortunate but not fortunate \ud83d\ude1e You need to take him to a urologist as soon as you can because many of us with Spina Bifida either cannot (like me) or have limited abilities to urinate or poop on our own which can cause infection or other issues. Sounds a lot like my kid he is young and we are not sure if he does. We will find out soon and take care of him best we can I (male, 44) had no clue about the AFP test. Thanks for the education.", "Spina Bifida Awareness, overshadowed by Breast Cancer Awareness? First, I am not here to bash Breast Cancer Awareness at all. I support Breast Cancer awareness and everything it stands for.\nHowever, being a parent of a child who was born with Spina Bifida, I have the urge to get Spina Bifida awareness out there. Spina Bifida month being in October I feel is overshadowed by Breast Cancer awareness. You see it everywhere you turn, MLB, NFL, NHL, parades, everywhere, and I am super happy for them. \n\nAs a community of Spina bifida supporters what can we do to spread the word, and maybe overcome this shadow and share the spotlight? I understand Breast Cancer affects a much larger base of people, but that does not make Spina bifida less important.\n\n\nIdeas- I have tried to think of many but one just keeps coming back.

Have spoken to a few parents with children that have SB who have had positive and optimistic experiences to share about managing this conditions. Is there anything that any adults can share with me about the good, bad and ugly of living with this condition? Thanks very much. I am 28 with SB but suck at sharing my experiences and talking about myself. Do you have specific questions? I am a 34 f with SB. The best advice I can give you is to learn your child\u2019s limitations as the child grows. My parents were told that I would not walk. I walked since I was a year old. They said I would need braces and crutches; I never did. Every case is of SB is different. My lesion is L5-S1. I have to self-cath to urinate and have significant constipation but I try to manage that with diet. \n\nIf you have any questions, you can PM anytime. Congratulations. I am a 33 year old guy living with SB. life has its challenges, but I am living independently and have a great job, so I would say I am doing pretty well 30 year old guy here. What specifically do you want to know? Summarizing a lifetime of experiences is not easy.\n\nI will echo everyone else in this post so far and say that I was able to gain full independence, get a job and live on my own, but there are still challenges. I am 41f with SB and if you have any particular questions let me know. Congratulations! Not sure how spiritual you are but pray pray pray!! The Drs told my mom I wouldnt be able to walk and here I am walking! Im 24 and I now have my own baby boy. I however did not have hydrocephalus so I can only speak about having SB without the HC. Growing up my mom used to cath me every few hours. I wore diapers for a long time. She helped me irrigate my bowl movements everyday! So now as a mom I know its not easy raising a baby and it will be even more challenging with a baby who has more needs. I hope you do not have a job you need to go back to so soon and I hope you will have help bc everyones SB is different. It may take some time to learn what works for your baby so be patient. Join Fb SB groups there are many parents that share what did and didnt work for their baby. Many parents like you post on there about their baby being diagnosed with SB and get advice as well. I recommend checking it out so you can see and connect with other parents that had similar experiences. You will need support! \nAdvice for when the baby grows up, dont treat your baby any different than other kids. My parents never let me play sports didnt even bother putting me in Ballet. I so desperately wanted to experience and learn things and meet other kids, but I was deprived of that bc they were scared I would hurt my back. Join Bowel management for Spina Bifida. United by Spina Bifida. Hopefully because your baby has it on the lower spine, they may not be too affected by it. I was able to live a normal life only mainly had incontinence issues. I definitely had my own ups and downs of trying to figure out what worked for me and how to live with it. It definitely shaped my childhood, but I am who I am bc of it. So go in with an open mind. It will definitely be a learning experience and you will need lots of support bc you can not just google anything about SB and find answers. You can ask me anything as well. I also want to add that I hope you have good insurance bc catheters were not cheap my parents paid a monthly fee for those and they paid a deductible for my 2nd back surgery when I was in elementary school. Be prepared to possibly spend on multiple surgeries spend on enemas, more diapers for a long time, possibly caths, and lots of cleaning supplies. Sending prayers your way. 22F here, I have meningocele at my lower vertebras. I did get surgery as a baby and I am living a completely normal life. I can walk, pee... like a normal person. Only thing is that my one leg was a little bit underdeveloped (is 2 cm shorter than my other leg), which does not bother me because I can run marathons and walk more than 100 km with it.\nThe real 'ugly' were my peers growing up because I have a huge scar on myback and my peers tried to mock me for that. 2 cm is 0.79 inches I am 27 with SB and the doctors said nearly the same about me and I have lived a relatively normal life I have done most things  the same as anyone. I am 27 with SB and the same as you my 1 leg is also a bit shorter than the other 24 years old guy with spina bifida here. Giving specific advice for spina bifida is kind of difficult, because as you might have understood, every case is different, but I will try my best. From my experience, what I later realised to be helpful was the fact that people around me, my parents firstly, tried not to treat me differently because of my disability, and by doing so taught me how to recognise people with the same mindset. People that do not judge you before meeting you and on the other side of the spectrum hold you accountable for your shortcomings, whatever they may be. This is probably the most important thing, in my opinion: teach your child to identify kindness, teach him to never doubt himself because of his struggles, and teach him to not make excuses for himself or herself when they are not needed, and not to live in self pity. As for the practical struggles, with this kind of environment they will become only inconveniences, for the most part, even though there will be very tough and bad days. Try to make him/her know you are there, trying at the same time not to shelter him/her too much. You have got a tough journey ahead, but it does not have to be a bad or negative one. My best wishes to all of you. Life with sb.. I hate it. Random control of bladder/bm. Pain in my leg like my ankle was slammed in a cat door from the moment I wake up until, after tossing and turning in bed for hours, I fall asleep at night. Thousands of dollars of medical debt, endless doctors and having to go through all the embarrassing problems over and over and over. Most surgeries only to keep things from getting worse, no doctors will say they can make things better. Random strangers asking if I am hurt because of my limp. Being too disabled to choose the job I want but not disabled enough to get any help. I refuse to have children because I would never put someone else through this but if I did somehow get pregnant I would be kind enough to abort. Second comment because it occurs to me I was pretty harsh, there are a lot of people who have disabilities that cherish the gift of life. I am already here so I make the most of it, I have family and friends I love and dog who thinks it is Christmas morning every day I come home. I am not advocating for others to choose not to have children, even if at risk for birth defects, that is a choice everyone needs to make themself. But in all honesty I would give anything to have been born in a healthy body. Hopefully for your child their case will be less severe 34 year old male with myelomeningocele at L5. I am ambulatory but walking long distances is difficult. When I was young, I was very ashamed and angry about my disability, which cause a lot of depression and anxiety. Over time, I grew to accept it as a part of who I am and realized that it helps me to relate to certain people more. \n\nMy family has always encouraged me to be as independent as possible. I live by myself and work full time as a science teacher. Being fully incontinent, I have had to deal with a variety of issues (recurrent UTIs mostly), but things are fairly stable right now. I have also had issues with ulcers on my heels and had to have several surgeries a few years ago. I now wear custom shoes that help a lot. \n\nI am lucky that I have not needed my shunt to be revised and have never had tethered cord. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I am pretty comfortable answering anything. I am 58 years old born with myelomeningocele.  The best advice given to my parents all those years ago was to \"treat her like a normal kid\".  They did.  My parents preached high expectations and backed it up with hard work and discipline.  I graduated college, went to work, and then earned my master's.  What I learned from my parents is  this...spina bifida is a condition,  not an excuse.", "In relation to my other post, are you into something sexual because it helps since you are disabled or are you into it because it is your kink/fetish?

It is just a tool that helps everyone get off and a great investment I would say", "What would you want your new support worker / care assistant to know? Hey, nursing student here preparing for meeting some clients with spina bifida who I will be working with / for!

I guess I am just nervous and trying to prepare for my new role as best as I can so I am as helpful as possible haha See the person, not the disability This is what I want any support worker to know:\n\nCommon sense. Also a little awareness of what spina bifida actually is would be helpful too. Use your experience to your advantage and welcome to caring professionally as well! Are you working in a care home or not? \n\nThere are different lesion levels. L1 is not the highest lesion either, I think it is mid spine really. The spine is divided up, there is a c- spine, a t- spine, and so on. Most spina bifida lesions occur on the t or l spine. In other words, many people with the most severe kind of spina bifida can still walk even if it is only a few steps at home with long braces on their legs for support. \n\nThis leads to my next point- spina bifida is truly a snowflake impairment. There is no telling what the adult with spina bifida can and cannot do at first, let them show you what they can do. Avoid feeding them rice, it causes constipation in those with spina bifida. And do not judge them either. \n\nListen to them. Thank you so much! I will be out in the community wherever people need an extra hand, including their private residences but also care/ group homes :) I find that so many kids of mine (pediatric PT here) get home nursing care and the nurses say \u201cI cannot lift more than x amount of weight\u201d.

Kinky. I do not really think there is any correlation to kink per se, but I do think there are things that people try if they are limited in certain ways. I will use myself as an example. I have been flogged before because I have very limited feeling below my waist so I knew it would not really hurt that much. Some people use swings if they are not able to prop themselves up. Some may use toys and stuff if they have issues with blood flow that prevents erections. I think some people are just naturally curious and are prone to try more things because of the way they are wired, but there are those that may try things out of necessity too. Kink is a very umbrella term so it is hard to say people with being kinkier, because they have a disability, but I would not scoff at anyone that gave that as a reason. Exactly! I was curious about that and get different viewpoints to see how many do it out of curiosity and how many do certain things because of mobility/limitations/sensations and so on", "New video is up.

I have been creeping on this sub for awhile and thought I would introduce myself. I am 40-something year old woman in the USA and have lipomeningocele (L4/L5). I did not have my surgery until 4 yrs old, and apparently some neurosurgeons waited until impairments became problematic before intervention. I did have a club foot that was fixed as a baby. I obviously do not remember much other than what my awesome parents have told me and the tiny cast my parents kept. I did crawl, walk and run \"on time\" but was getting kidney infections and had the lipoma removed. It took 2 8-hour surgeries to get it all the 'fatty tissue' out. Bless my parents who were able sign those forms and wait. I do have some memory clips of being in the hospital as a young child and remember a lot more as I got older. I only had those 2 back surgeries but a ton of foot and leg surgeries (some unrelated to SB), last one was when I was 21. After the back surgeries I needed to wear AFO's to walk better and wore them everywhere but inside the house. I went to public school and left home to attend college at 17 yrs old and have lived on my own ever since and financially independent. Coming from a low income family I knew I was going to do whatever I could to be financially stable with health insurance. \n\nIn my 30's I moved the farthest from my family at the time. I ended up taking a fall, and like many other on here I could take a fall better than most. I shrugged it off and went about my day. The next day my knee was very swollen and a bit painful. I iced and took ibuprofen thinking it would subside but did not and needed to find a new ortho in a brand new city. After several appts and a MRI it showed that I had meniscus buckle tear that needed to be repaired. It was a risk as it was on the leg that I walked with extreme valgus. The tear was fixed and was healing okay but basically my MCL had too much mileage. It was the hardest and most painful time in my life. It was the first time I truly felt disabled. It was hard to go through physically and emotionally but got through it (several years) and now wear a KAFO and AFO and use a cane and have a wheelchair for long distances. \n\nI have a pretty successful career, drive, cycle, have my own place and have been able to do and see a lot. But like everyone else it has not been easy and have had my share of bad days. I am blessed with great parents and siblings. I would say I was lucky to have a tough, popular older brother in school. While I did not have any friends until middle/high school I did not really get bullied because of my brother. Of course that did not stop comments here and there but that is life. It is not fair at times and people can be mean but over time I knew I could not give them the satisfaction of making me feel bad about myself. And honestly I am glad to grow up in a time without social media. \n\nSorry I tried to keep it short and definitely have more SB related issues but too personal for me to share here. Happy to answer any questions here or in a private message. Best of luck to everyone!", "Where do you live and do you get good care for SB? Hi all, I am really lucky to live near Boston, where I got excellent care as a child but I am having a hard time finding doctors for adults who know anything about spina bifida.

So two months are with kids then the third is the same type of specialists but not pediatric.  Our SB daughter is just three so I do not have first hand experience with the adult docs yet.

I am sure most of you do. Maybe some are happy being single, that is fine too. For those who are single and cannot seem to find someone what do you think the problem is? \"Oh its everyone else. I am fine. I am a catch. Anyone would be lucky to have me.\" Is that what you are thinking? Well that is a little foolish. No one is perfect. Now there is nothing wrong with being confident. What I am saying is there is a problem when you cannot see your own flaws. For example I can be too talkative at times. I can take over a conversation. No one likes that. The conversation has to go back and forth. I can also be too blunt at times. I have to think how others will feel. Those are things I am working on. Can you be honest with yourself about what you need to work on? Now maybe some of you are completely lacking confidence. \"I do not have anything to offer. I need a lot of care. Who would want that?\" Well maybe you are a good listener. Maybe you are good at giving advice. Those are good qualities. That is something you can offer. Think of little things like that. You may have experienced rejection several times. Everytime you ask someone out they tell you no so now you have a feeling that its because of your disability. If it was, those are shallow people.

Each one of us are pretty different tho and it is rare that anyone will have the exact same problems and the exact same treatments,  but we are awesome at giving advice and support! \n\nFirst think I would say is, it is rly great you have a diagnosis, this means your can now see the proper doctors have have the proper treatments and take the proper medication if it is needed! \nBladder and bowel incontinence is very common with sp! It is important that your see a urologist if you have issues with your bladder and there are so many things they can do for it! \nA physical therapist may be helpful with the back pain but the tingling in the leg/foot you may need to see a neurologist! \nI would make a list of any issues or worries you have and speak with your Gp if you can and set out a plan to get you to the right people! I would also look and see if there is any spina Bifida charities or support groups close by as they can lead you to the right ppl in your area! \nMostly tho I would say just do not freak out, Iv have sp, bladder bowel back and leg issues  but Iv also went to uni, traveled the world and have a happy and health relationship so having sp will not stop you doing or achieving anything! Now you know you have it you can start sorting any issues you do have! \n\nI hope some of this is useful to you, I understand it must be very overwhelming!

Welcome to the spina bifida world! I was born with spina bifida  \n(myelomeningocele- just a fancy word for another type of it), so having spina  \nbifida is all I have ever known. I would say u/bbcat88 gave you some really good  \nsuggestions. Unfortunately they are hard to find, but depending on where you  \nlive you might be able to find an adult spina bifida clinic in your area. Adult  \nones are less common than pediatric ones but I think there are still a few in  \nthe US.   \nI would definitely recommend seeing a urologist to get help with  \nbladder/bowel incontinence. Either a physical therapist or an orthopedic  \nsurgeon should be able to help with the back pain. If you go to one of those  \nI am sure they can refer you to someone else if you need to see someone  \ndifferent. Also as u/bbcat88 said, finding a spina bifida charity near you can  \nbe helpful. The Spina Bifida Association ( is  \nthe national charity, but they mostly support families of children with spina  \nbifida so you are probably better off finding a charity in your state or region.  \nSome states have their own charities, but there are some parts of the US where  \nthere is a regional one that covers several states. If you are on Facebook,  \nthere is a group called United by Spina Bifida that you could join. It is a very  \nsupportive group of people with spina bifida. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any other questions,  \nplease do not hesitate to post again on this subreddit, or inbox me directly.

Thank you thank you thank you!!!! You are very welcome! Happy to help! I too have Spina Bifida Occulta, but did not find out about ten years ago (I am in my 40s). After years of just \u201cputting up with back pain\u201d as I had been taught all my life, I was talked into going to a chiropractor. After I met with him, I had an X-ray done and found out about the two incomplete lower vertebrae (and a fusion in my neck). After ten years of being adjusted, I no longer go to a chiropractor (for different reasons), but I live in some sort of pain everyday. I am not vocal, like my wife is with her pain, because of how I was raised and that has been a huge undertaking on my part to listen to my body instead of ignoring it. I do not live in a mmj friendly state, but I have found CBD and D8 has helped, but not as much as full spectrum THC. But, if you have access to medical cannabis, do look into it. I just hope you find the right treatment for what you need. Getting a diagnosis for anything can always be hard but I honestly promise you that this will make such a positive change for you! It may take time but you will get there and just having a name for something can lead to so many answers and opportunities for help! Life can be so tough but this is not something you need to add to your worry list !

Man I am grateful I am not in a wheelchair but ffs the things that come with sb are just shit.. for instance the back aches, I also have a wasted calve on my right leg that just looks like a pirates stick leg \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and now I have a lump on my outer right thigh.. basically everything on my right side is abnormal to me.. but still I am grateful", "Percutaneous lengthening I am 13 years old and I am currently facing an impossible decision. 2 years ago, I was tighter than I would ever been, and after much deliberation, I finally accepted surgical treatment. At the start of the pandemic, a fire was lit underneath me and I started exercising more than ever with all my free time. Once school started, I started growing a lot. School started taking up a lot of my time. In November, I pulled a muscle and I had to stay off my feet for 2 weeks. Then, my school went virtual and the weather made it too cold to go outside. So I was stuck inside for a good 3 months. Once the weather started getting better, we discovered that my AFO's no longer fit me. I got new ones before we went back in person. All that time off my feet made me very tight to the point where my knees started pivoting and buckling inwards. This twisting caused a large blister on my toe and for a month I was going between my wheelchair, thinking that the blister had healed and going back to the wheelchair. Once I realized the problem, I switched back to my wheelchair full time, only walking to do Lokomat therapy. Eventually after all kinds of shoe mods, the blisters stopped coming, but all the pivoting was really hurting, so I stayed in the wheelchair until more adjustments could be made. On April 29, I learned that no adjustments could alleviate the pain, and instead of walking on my crutches, I should swing on them. If I did not get out of my chair and walk, eventually I would be too tight to walk. No more wheelchair after that. After about a week now, I am still swinging for the most part, but taking normal steps sometimes and I have been stretching like there is no tomorrow. I think I am starting to improve. We saw an orthopedic surgeon to discuss further treatment options, and surgery was concluded to be the best way forward, and I am scheduled for a lengthening in eight days. I do not know if I want that. I feel like I can improve on my own and that it is my fault that I am so tight because for about a year prior to my growth spurt, I developed an E.D and once I started recovering, all that delayed growth finally caught up to me. My dad says if I am truly dead set on it, we can reschedule, but I am not sure if I am physically or mentally equipped to handle all that self improvement.

I have separated it into paragraphs for you!\n\n\n\n_Send a private message with title **'opt out'** to prevent this bot from seeing your posts in the future._\n\nr/spinabifida has contributed 0.01% of all walls of text analyzed so far! Hey man the way I see it is it cannot hurt to try. It is going to be a really tough journey but if you want to try i would say that seems a way better idea than surgery if you can do it naturally.\n\nThat being said, I am not a Doctor, just some random guy on the internet who also happens to have sb. I would say you should reschedule just to ask more questions to your doctor and maybe a second opinion.", "Questions  When my daughter was around two years old, people would always say \"Wow, shes so good in that chair!\" My response was always \"Yes she is, and you are very good at using your legs.\"  Since she is a little older now she gets questions from kids but that is because they are curious, she answers and then they go off and play. ", "SBO, agent orange and incontinence Hi there.  I am new to this subreddit and I was wondering if anyone on here has Spina Bifida Occulta, and/or either of your parents were exposed to Agent Orange during Vietnam and if you were a lifelong bedwetter which ended up leading to full incontinence.  The reason why I ask is because I have all those except for an actual SBO diagnosis, but I have several of the tell tail signs. Hello! No, my parents never had agents orange or the like, but I do have SBO. I had all of the signs since birth, I had really bad UTIs until I was 5 before having surgery. My ureters were too small, pretty much. Believe this or not, despite showing all of the symptoms (except my brain and physical functions were good, which is common in SBO) I was not diagnosed until age 14 and it was completely by accident! I am not saying that it IS SBO, that is up to your doc, but despite the tell tail signs and surgery/ imaging they caught it later in life, so it is a possibility. It is been a long time, so maybe you have already gotten your answers, but if not it would not hurt to bring this up with your doc. My symptom that took the cake was debilitating spinal pain. Unfortunately I am not well educated on my SBO because I found out in a really bad time in my life and could not get a hold of my scans.\n\nI wish you luck in finding answers, if you have not found them already!", "When I get angry and bitter about the physical things I have had to deal with from spina bifida, I think I have come this far and overcome so much. I cannot just sit down and let this defeat me, you know? :/  My symptoms came on suddenly at 25 after I would been married for just over a month. I have spent the last 5 years so bitter and angry about what has happened to me and what might happen to me as I age. It is taken a while to feel better about it, and Istill work everyday to not be pissed off at the universe."]
