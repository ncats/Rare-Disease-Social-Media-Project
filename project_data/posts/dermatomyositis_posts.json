Anyways I'll just throw my story out here in case anyone stumbles across it and hopefully it helps. Pretty much jut going to give a biography of what my treatments have consisted of and where I am now. \n\nSo as the title says I started getting the symptoms of DM around 18 fresh out of high school. It sucked as I was very active, surfed every day, basketball, football, baseball etc. Anyways went to the docs for almost a year and half bouncing around trying to figure out what was wrong with me. Only symptoms I had at the time were swelling and my cpk levels were off the charts! So it was very hard to narrow down. Anyways finally after doing tons of tests and biopsies I was finally diagnosed and was right around 20 yrs old. \n\nAfter that my doc prescribed 60 mg of prednisone, after awhile on that he also added cellcept (mycophenolate). \n\nSlowly my prednisone was tapered down and I am currently on 9mg of prednisone and have stayed on the same amount of cellcept. My CPK numbers tended to stay in the 6-800 range. \n\nThen about a year ago I was put on a new treatment plan to coincide with the current one. This consisted of immunoglobulin infusions. Of all the treatments I had tried this one brought my CPK numbers well within normal range. After one treatment my numbers dropped to the 2-300 range. Later they fell to around 150. The drawback was my insurance covered 80 percent which left me with a 2500 dollar bill. The good news was this is all I had to pay for the year so if I scheduled them at the beginning of the year then I would get charged 2500 and every treatment after that would be free for me. These treatments happened once a month for 2 consecutive days. I eventually stopped doing them because it was just so expensive for me. The treatments without insurance are around 30k so 2500 was a steal but it was still a lot to do. Secondly these infusions lasted all day long 8hrs. If you need immediate help I would have to say I recommend these infusions since they do help drastically. Also another note about these infusions is they are pumping so much water into your system you are constantly peeing. This causes you to lose a lot of electrolytes. This caused me to receive pretty bad headaches afterwards. So I started drinking coconut waters while I was doing my infusions to help replenish my electrolytes. This definitely helped with the headaches so keep that in mind if you do this treatment. \n\nLastly regarding immunoglobulin infusions. In case you are wondering, immunoglobulin is naturally occurring in our bodies. Basically it's your immune system. That's about the best way I can describe it. It's how the mom gives here immune system to her baby when pregnant with immunoglobulin. So again basically they are infusing you with a healthy immune system. I could be wrong and I'm no doctor but from all the reading I did that's what I got from it.\n\nThroughout all these years I have lost pretty much all upper body strength to the point where it's hard to even do normal things like wash the dishes or raise my hand. \n\nI finally had enough and recently have gone to see a doctor in San Diego who did a complete blood workup and when I say complete I mean COMPLETE! He found I have a mycoplasma infection. He is on a very prestigious board of doctors specializing in rheumatology and arthritis. He also prescribed many supplements I was missing and needed to stay healthy while suffering from DM. \n\nHe stated that the work he's done and testing that has occurred regarding DM has shown that in rats and mice whenever DM is present a mycoplasma infection is also present. The thing with mycoplasma is it has no cell wall and can pass wherever it chooses and cause whatever problems it wants. Because of this doctors are finding that if they can eliminate the mycoplasma infection DM usually goes away. So he put me on an antibiotic along with another supplement to drive the mycoplasma out of wherever it's hiding so the the antibiotics can kill it. I'm not sure if this will work but this is where I am at in my life so far. I go to see him in January again and see how things are coming along and will update this post.\n\nAlso some other things I looked into regarding DM that may also help. Water fasting may help. They are finding when someone does a 7 day water fast your body actually goes into a self healing mode. Many people have also cured themselves of DM by water fasting however you will most likely need to do a doctor supervised water fast due to the dangers involved. Secondly after the water fast a complete diet change is required. Basically a paleo diet is needed. \n\nRegarding a paleo diet, if you can afford it, it's actually a very good diet to be on when suffering from DM. A paleo diet along with a workout regimen can really help you stay healthier with DM. I unfortunately could not stick with it because of the costs involved in eating all organic foods, gym membership and other bills. However I am hoping to be able to get back to that schedule soon. \n\nLastly before I close this post out, I feel it's important to whoever comes across this to understand that when they are offered treatments from doctor always try the most natural ones/least harmful first if you can. For instance I too was given the option to take methotrexate and some other drugs which were for cancer patients but I rejected those and instead stayed with prednisone and cellcept along with the immunoglobulin. While prednisone is not great and cellcept too, they have been less harmful to me in the long run vs the other options. Immunoglobulin especially is very good since it's something our bodies already make. So if you can please consider natural options or at least the less harmful ones first and you will do yourself a favor in the long run. \n\nBest wishes to all on here, again I'm new here and I hope this post is helpful in some way to any of you.

Yesterday was an interesting day.  I got to experience something called an EMG test. This is where they put electrodes on your fingertips and then put a plastic piece with two Skittle sized metal pieces on it on your forearm and shoot ELECTRICITY through your ARM!  ZzZzzZZZap!  Three to four times.  Then the move the Skittles up a little higher and ZzZaaap!  And again. And again. Thank you sir may I have another. So about 7 of those, they then moved to my leg, attaching the wires to my toes. After about 20 of these x 3...\n\nI thought I was done.  Here comes the actual doctor to have some fun.  \u201cSo I\u2019m going to take this long needle and jam it into your muscles in your forearm and send electricity into it.  Ouch, I know riiight? Oh, you also have to FLEX.\u201d\n\nForearm, to the biceps, to the triceps...then down to the calf, thigh, behind the knee, quadriceps, and ankle. \nOh I forgot...both procedures were done on my upper and lower back. \n\nWell, I survived and it wasn\u2019t that bad (brave face).  And it led to some very good news. the Myositis (muscle weakness/deterioration) is VERY mild!  Which means I\u2019m getting even better.  Strength is returning.   She also suggested that the muscle biopsy is UNNECESSARY!  So happy to dodge that excruciating procedure.    \n\nAlso, turns out this Dr. is on a 20 person national board that specializes in Dermatomyositis!  She was thrilled with my progress, telling me most people suffer from this disease for 2 or so years before finally getting treatment. I could NOT even IMAGINE that. I wouldn\u2019t make it 6 months it\u2019s so awful.  I attacked it fast, and that meant less damage to my body which also meant faster healing. So a huge thank you to Sheri &lt;3 for not letting me wallow in misery and making me get off my butt and to the doctor. Doctors. Multiple Dr.s, offices, and hospitals.    \n\nAlso, the Dr. was completely fascinated with my Gottron\u2019s Papules on my hands, taking photos from various angles...as I made love to the camera. It\u2019s come true. I am a disease model. Holy crap.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m still slogging away with this awful diet--because I know it is truly helping. I still get bad days now and then (probably ever 8 to 10 days), but I\u2019ve got energy and I\u2019m kind of back to my normal self, especially when I\u2019m working. Joints are stronger, no more pain, just a little stiffness when I try to breakdance. (JUST KIDDING--when I try to kneel down) . I\u2019m 80% to 85% there--if not 90% to 95% on really good days (like today!).  The worst thing are my hands.  The skin on my hands hurt a few times a day still. I\u2019m ready for that to go away.\n\nI\u2019m working on The Cool Kids tonight with my buddy Allan Murray for their season finale, so watch the show on FOX! It\u2019s dang funny. \n\n3/21/2019 UPDATE\n\nCT Scan + MRI = No Whammys! Just here to make sure my symptoms aren't caused by something else.\nWell, dang it. Looks like I got One Whammy. It's called a pulmonary embolisms.\n\nI know, WHAT!?!?  P.E\u2019s can kill you instantly. So I got my CT scan and was waiting in my car for 90 minutes to get my MRI when my Rheumatologist called and said, \u201cYou need to go to the EMERGENCY ROOM RIGHT NOW!\u201d\n\nI said, \u201c...okay.  Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CT showed two pulmonary embolisms in your lungs!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no! Um. What are those?\u201d\n\n\u201cBlood clots that could break loose and go to your heart or brain. Very dangerous.  You need to get on blood thinners and will be admitted to the hospital for a few days to a week.\u201d\n\nNOW, I was finally scared.\n\nDr.:\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI feel fine. Normal.\u201d \n\nSo I should have had shortness of breath, pain in my chest, etc. but I really had no symptoms. \n After 7 HOURS of testing, they did conclude that I have two blood clots in my lungs, not good. The good news: I had no other bad symptoms and was functioning normally.  They caught it early enough that I can be put on blood thinners for a while and NOT get admitted to the hospital. Whew, I was THIS close to going away for a few days. That would have SUCKED.\n\nAnyway, No other issues on my CT scan or my MRI--so far. \n\nOh, I also have scarring on my lungs (stupid dermatomyositis). Plus, a large clot in my left leg (with no deep vein thrombosis symptoms...again, weird!!!). \n\nI'm gonna get better y'all...And huge thanks for the prayers. Love to ALL of you!!!\u263a\ufe0f\n\n4/2/2019 UPDATE\n\nMet with Dr. Goya regarding the possibility I have malignancies causing the symptoms, including my blood clots.  First off, she says I\u2019m probably free of the blood clots by now (YAY!) because I\u2019ve been on blood thinners for over a week. I have to stay on them for 6 to 9 months though, to completely make sure that those pesky clots do not return.  \n\nShe also thoroughly went though my scans, charts, blood tests, etc. and stated she sees NO SIGNS of any kind of cancer! Hallelujah.  She wants me to do the colonoscopy when I drop off the blood thinners and a prostate exam. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be an \u201cass\u201d over all of this, \u201cbutt\u201d I\u2019m not looking forward to it. If I were to \u201canal\u201dyze the situation, I should be happy Dr. Goya gave me good news, I\u2019m her biggest \u201cfanny\u201d now. I\u2019m far from the \u201dbottom\u201d of my health scares now &amp; I still need to \u201cbum\u201d around &amp; rest when symptoms \u201crear\u201d their ugly heads.  Okay, enough.  (Wish I got \u201ctushie\u201din there somehow...)\n\n I am close to 95% better people. Just weak from the debilitating muscle stuff and some finger tingles and pain. Again, thank you for the prayers, well wishes, words of support, and more. &lt;3 \n\n5/9/2019 UPDATE\n\nA quick update with the drugs. I've dropped my Prednisone down to 40mg and I am doing 2000 mg of Cellcept (Mycophenolic acid) per day. I'm hoping to totally eliminate the Prednisone!  \n\nSymptoms are still the same with a little less tingling of the hands, papules are starting to fade.  I'm more weak, muscle-wise, though.  Not sure why.  Am I just LAZY now!?!?  \n\nAlso, I'm dealing with a chest cold while on immuno-suppressants.  This cough is lasting FOR.EV.ER. \n\nDiet-wise, I've started adding gluten-free grains back in with no issues.  A little dairy (cheese) here and there.  Still avoiding sugar (besides dark chocolate). \n\nI hope all of you are doing well!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dermatomyositis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tcta", "subreddit_subscribers": 127, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "UPDATE FROM PREVIOUS POST BELOW: \"2nd week of Dec. the rash &amp; painful skin on my hands started...\"", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557651847, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dermatomyositis/comments/bmqw0f/update_from_previous_post_below_2nd_week_of_dec/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "DearYouu", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gkul6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1556841925, "domain": "self.dermatomyositis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dermatomyositis/comments/bk20u9/how_many_of_you_have_had_root_canals/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bk20u9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/dermatomyositis/comments/bk20u9/how_many_of_you_have_had_root_canals/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1556841927, "score": 2, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dermatomyositis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tcta", "subreddit_subscribers": 127, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How many of you have had root canals?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557457060, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dermatomyositis/comments/bk20u9/how_many_of_you_have_had_root_canals/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "DearYouu", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gkul6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1556388098, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dermatomyositis/comments/bi1qr6/just_diagnosed_all_over_left_arm_and_neck_not/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bi1qr6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/dermatomyositis/comments/bi1qr6/just_diagnosed_all_over_left_arm_and_neck_not/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1556388099, "score": 5, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dermatomyositis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tcta", "subreddit_subscribers": 126, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "image", "title": "Just diagnosed.

Felt like posting today.  My memory is shaky about the details so I apologize. I\u2019m still in shock. \n\nMy mother died 12/27/17. She was 63, healthy all her life, never smoked or anything, fit, larger than life. \n\nAround September 2017 she developed a cough. After a ton of tests, they said she had Dermatomyositis. She also had stage 3 lung cancer. They said the two diseases usually appear in conjunction with each other. They said they didn\u2019t know if one causes the other but that they usually appear together. She said the Dermatomyositis also caused a rash early on. Shortly after that was Thanksgiving and it was the last family function she was at. \n\nA few weeks went by with tons of hospital visits. Eventually she couldn\u2019t breathe and was rushed to the hospital (at Yale). We were all there with her. They told us she had stage 4 lung cancer and had 12-16 months to live but that the Dermatomyositis was doing the most damage. They said it was causing her lungs to turn into a material that looked shiny like glass or something and that\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t breathe. They said it\u2019s a super rare disease and not a lot of medical literature about how to treat it. They said they don\u2019t think it\u2019s hereditary at all and that women get it more than men. They talked about getting info from Japan on it at one point. \n\nAnyway they put her under a couple days later and did tons of things to treat her. The most radical thing was something where a machine extracted all her blood and then did something with it (maybe antibodies or something.) then put it back in her. Then we waited to see if anything changed. \n\nEventually the doctors said no change and because she can\u2019t breathe on her own we had to respect her wishes and take the breathing tube out and let her die. They said if not for the Dermatomyositis she would have lived at least a year until the cancer got her. \n\nIt all happened so fast, her extended family didn\u2019t know how bad her condition was. We told them on Xmas and they had a meltdown. We were going to let her die the next day but she woke up albeit with a breathing tube in. She couldn\u2019t talk but obviously knew we were there. We talked and cried all day until she fell asleep again. They pumped her up with more sedatives and morphine, and we watched her die the next day. 18 days after we were told she had 12-16 months to live. And a little over two months after I first heard the word Dermatomyositis.

I wanted to share my story and experiences with juvenile dermatomyositis and how I put the disease into remission. :) \n\nI want to give hope to those who are struggling and suffering from DM. Hopefully my method works for you too!\n\nI fell ill at the age of 6 and got diagnosed with JDM two years later. I developed a rash on my arms and legs, lost a lot of weight, had very limited energy and lost mucle mass and strength. \n\nThroughout my adolescence doctors put me on several meds. A high dosage of prednisone (hello moonface!), methotrexate and eventually IVIG treatments. At 11 years old the JDM was relatively manageable thanks to the IVIG treatments though unfortunately, I relapsed at age 20. \n\nFor reasons unknown, my leg started to ache badly. It got so bad, I got to a point where I couldn't walk properly anymore. The rash on my arms returned, I looked pale, my whole body hurt and I was bedridden too for 3 years.\n\nMy doctor increased the dosage of methotrexate to 20 mg. I had to inject it weekly. They also gave me a treatment of rituximab. None of it worked. \n\nFinally, at 24, they put me on IVIG treatments and I felt amazing again. My new found happiness was shortlived as I had to receive the IVIG treatment every 6 months and every time I relapsed, it hit me hard. I also still used 20 mg of methotrexate weekly and I was starting to get sick of being nauseous (pun not intended.)\n\nThis went on for another two years until finally I did something that still works for me up until this very day. I know it sounds ridiculous but by changing my diet, I put the disease into full remission. I'm still skeptical but I never thought I would hear my doctor say to me that it looked as if I had grown past the JDM. \n\nHere's what I did. I stopped using methotrexate altogether, I don't recommend to stop using your meds but I did because I always thought it didn't really work for me. \n\nMy diet is both super easy and restricting. I only eat meat and drink water, sparkling water, tea and coffee. \n\nI mostly eat beef, chicken and sometimes fish (prawns and tilapia.) I've been on the carnivore diet for 8+ months now. I don't cheat with my meals, I'm off all my meds and feeling better than ever. \n\nYou can also read my story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb/comments/9ncnf0/7_months_update/). If you want to know more about the carnivore diet, visit meatheals.com, https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb/ or follow Shawn Baker on Twitter/YouTube and https://justmeat.co/ just to name a few. \n\nAgain, I know how weird it sounds and I don't know if I will ever reintroduce vegetables or fruit but for now, eating nothing but meat is my safe bet. \n\nThank you for reading my story. I hope this will work for you too and I wish you all well.

By the time I was finally brought to the emergency room I had a fairly severe case and was put on an intense dose of prednisone, plaquenil, folic acid, and methotrexate. I was too weak to bathe myself, my rash was covering almost my entire body and was just awful. Even eating was difficult, and I was stuck in a wheelchair for a while too. \n\nEventually, after a few weeks in the hospital I got to go home and gradually saw small improvements. After about 3 months I could walk around fairly well, another few months and I could bathe myself and eat just fine. Stairs were still a bit of a no go and everything tired me out, but I could at least function somewhat.\n\nEventually I had a small relapse though, after about a year, and then my doctor put me on a 9 month IVIG treatment. It was very expensive but saw the most improvement in the shortest amount of time, and I felt absolutely amazing. I was able to completely get off the prednisone and methotrexate finally before I was in high school and it was a very good feeling. \n\nI relapsed again a few years later when I was in my junior year. I never stopped taking the plaquenil and the folic acid, which had over time given me serious headache issues but was still very needed, and I later found out long term folic acid also contributes to depression. I was back on IVIG treatments, and instead of methotrexate I was prescribed Ciclosporin, which performed much better and I was fully functional again in record time. \n\nI was in remission then for almost 6 years now and am relapsing again. I can remember my doctor telling me this can happen. I think one of the awful things about this disease is that a lot of symptoms very from person to person. I never had joint pain and the rash never spread to my face very much, and I've spoken to some people who never had a rash at all. It varies depending on what age you are, and just random chance. Add on the general rarity of it and the lack of solid information and its just terrible to go through. There's a decent chance I'm going to be relapsing repeatedly over the years for my entire life. I hope that, even if none of the medicinces I mentioned help you with your doctor, that at least it helps to know you aren't alone.

I'll start by saying that I know ultimately I need to see a doctor.  But I'm hoping for some reassurance from this community that I'm not dealing with DM. I really appreciate it! \n\nThis all started after a particularly stressful couple of months, and a relatively minor surgical procedure.  I would say in mid-December. My ears, eyelids and elbows started itching, and my elbows got red and bumpy. The itching was pretty intense. Especially on my eyes and ears.  My ears started peeling, and my eyelids got rough, like they were getting ready to peel. Maybe some slight peeling.  Then the areas around my eyes, forehead and cheeks started to have a burning feeling too.   But they didn't get red/purple.  Neither did my ears.  Just itchy and rough and burning.  My neck, though, is red and splotchy without itch and without burning.  Pic:  [https://i.imgur.com/aH74elj.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/aH74elj.jpg) \n\nWent to dermo in early February.  He said the neck is sun damage (so poikiloderma).  He said the itching around my eyes and forehead and redness/itchiness on my elbows is likely seborrehic dermatitis.  Gave me some good lotions and a cortisone anti-itch.  Seems to help. \n\nShortly after the appointment, my knuckles closest to my writs started to itch.  Then got red.  It's pretty subtle though.  They itch much more than they are red (if that makes sense).  Very itchy, only slightly red. Pics:  [https://i.imgur.com/eWxpoG3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/eWxpoG3.jpg)  ;[https://i.imgur.com/cT5MLkK.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/cT5MLkK.jpg)  A couple of small bumps involved too.  Also, my knees feel slightly burning, but no rash. And my skin overall feels extra-sensitive.  Kind of like a healing sunburn.  And I feel like my nose is redder than it should be.  \n\nNo muscle weakness that I can discern.   \n\nLooking for some comfort that this doesn't seem like DM. I know it's very unlikely.   Admittedly, I have a huge history of health anxiety. If you think it's something else, please just keep that to yourself.  I need to deal with one thing at a time. :)  \n\nThanks so much for your help!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dermatomyositis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tcta", "subreddit_subscribers": 230, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for Reassurance", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dermatomyositis/comments/fxa6o2/looking_for_reassurance/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MrCookies96", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_251d0q18", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1585797192, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dermatomyositis/comments/fteu7c/hello_a_23yearold_fella_here_i_developed_these/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fteu7c", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/dermatomyositis/comments/fteu7c/hello_a_23yearold_fella_here_i_developed_these/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "BUekKd-ZBL0V5vhBQm1FHhqoI1RHwC6kheCYAzlXhi0", "resolutions": [{"height": 192, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/p2n5fkvmnbq41.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=306bdc9f81059cf57a33f68986f7865ef444dc06", "width": 108}, {"height": 384, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/p2n5fkvmnbq41.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d1849e3a854c9431b87e689ec6a649ddf6a1a4c", "width": 216}, {"height": 568, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/p2n5fkvmnbq41.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddd141fca15be1b0fdc8cfc64c7de540d1d3d263", "width": 320}, {"height": 1137, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/p2n5fkvmnbq41.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=239d8dde3e0f28c8c90e8135821095539eb4d900", "width": 640}, {"height": 1706, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/p2n5fkvmnbq41.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b1c1e030202974ffe6928ff46ffd26fce15132", "width": 960}, {"height": 1920, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/p2n5fkvmnbq41.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87fb4a1eb47b4dcb3961792ef59609836776f446", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 4032, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/p2n5fkvmnbq41.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0a0b7ed08fbf26627a15fcbb9a11839ead2a4495", "width": 2268}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1585797198, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dermatomyositis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tcta", "subreddit_subscribers": 228, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "image", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Hello, a 23-year-old fella here.

I posted a while back on here to share my story and thank you all for the wonderful comments and the support! Knowing that there are other out there that can understand what I\u2019m going through really helped me a lot :) \n\nAfter my last post I continued to see my rheumatologist and my skin was getting progressively worse within every appointment that I had made with her. Eventually I started up to 5+ medications to try to get my skin rash under control(autoimmune suppressants and others). I found myself not taking my medicine very well and feeling really ill throughout the week even though I tried to take my \u2018bad\u2019 medicine during the weekend to be able to feel good enough to go to school and work during the week. I then decided to take time off from school because I was doing poorly and most of the time couldn\u2019t wake up in time to make it to class. I continued to work part-time but then noticed it was even hard for me to make it to work on time some days. I would work a shift at 1:30pm and sometimes sleep in to 2:00pm, I almost lost my job. I recently went on a trip with my friend and would be getting so sick every time I ate so I was so sick of feeling so ill all the time that I decided to go off my medicine during the trip so that I could enjoy my time there. This unfortunately continued after I got back home, I\u2019ve had a pattern of going off my medicine in the past. However, I noticed a very big change in my skin rash but also my fatigue and general mental health. I was finally starting to wake up earlier on my own and my skin was clearing up and not blistering. I recently saw my rheumatologist again and told her about my experience on the medicine and that I had not taken it for a while and explained the changes I saw. \n\nI am just kind of frustrated because she basically told me to start over with the first autoimmune suppressant that I took a couple months after I was diagnosed. I guess that I was hoping to look at different treatment options that I could try, that would maybe be easier for me to take while still trying to function with my job. I also noticed some joint pain in my hands and a little bit of weakness too. I understand that is probably my fault for going off my medicine however I just could not take it anymore. I was so depressed and tired and had so much brain fog I felt like I wasn\u2019t myself anymore. \n\nI would love to hear the treatments that you all have tried and what has worked for you all the best in skin rashes or muscle/joint pain and muscle weakness. I feel like there is more options I could try but I am very limited to doctors I can see since I live in the middle of nowhere Wyoming \ud83d\ude1e Thank you all again, this thread is fantastic and so much help!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dermatomyositis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tcta", "subreddit_subscribers": 220, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Treatment experiences/options?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dermatomyositis/comments/fgt7u2/treatment_experiencesoptions/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PintSizedHerzl", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_oxio1bp", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1583102719, "domain": "self.dermatomyositis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dermatomyositis/comments/fc242l/how_do_you_treat_your_rashes_when_theyre_painful/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fc242l", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/dermatomyositis/comments/fc242l/how_do_you_treat_your_rashes_when_theyre_painful/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1583102726, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi, \n\nI have been reading about dermatomyositis and came to the conclusion I've been dealing with it since I was a kid. We thought it was just excessive allergies. In January, I developed a rash on my right hand, along the knuckles. Then it spread throughout my whole hand. And then onto my other hand -- same way. Knuckles, fingers, wrist. It's slowly going down my wrists. \n\nMy doctor gave me a cream without seeing me, because we assumed this was contact dermatitis (I am somewhat allergic to dogs, and adopted a dog the first week of January). It doesn't do anything (which, I assume now, is because this is not contact dermatitis -- the best way I can describe it is that it looks like a medication reaction rash, but its not, because I'm not on any new medications). \n\nIt gets extremely painful and is downright excruciating. I've almost gone to the ER a few times this weekend. I assume it is going to take a few days for a doctor to take me seriously and start actually considering it (because I'm sure they're skeptical of anyone who diagnoses themselves on the internet, as they rightfully should be).\n\nI've been using aquaphor on it, which it does more than the cream, but like, not by much. On the bad days, it burns too.  Is there anything you guys have done over-the-counter that has helped? \n\n(If your skeptical, I read the symptom list and just cried a lot. There's no way this isn't it. My current rash looks like the girl who posted here a few weeks ago about being diagnosed. I've always had the heliographs on my eyelids that come and go. I have dysphonia. The red splotchy rashes and fevers as a kid -- everyone wrote it off as rosacea but they were flat and hot to the touch -- never bumpy. I remember one episode in my teens where I was in so much pain moving my arms and shoulders that I rather wake up at the crack of dawn with my mom, who would do my hair for me. I was waking up at 4am for a long period of time. There was a period where a doctor was monitoring me for arthritis. My whole childhood I was written off as lazy... this is honestly more upsetting to find out I was sick and no one bothered to look into it.)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dermatomyositis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tcta", "subreddit_subscribers": 219, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do you treat your rashes when they're painful?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dermatomyositis/comments/fc242l/how_do_you_treat_your_rashes_when_theyre_painful/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "killerwhale11", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_14zrg8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582983231, "domain": "self.dermatomyositis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dermatomyositis/comments/fbckai/does_dermatomyositis_actually_go_away/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fbckai", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/dermatomyositis/comments/fbckai/does_dermatomyositis_actually_go_away/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1582983233, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m 24 years old and was diagnosed with dermatomyositis when I was 4 and after a few years of treatment, I was told that I had been cured of the disease.

I do have weakness in my thighs (struggle with stairs) and I struggle with holding arms above my head, especially when drying my hair - but I thought this was related to my hypermobility.\n\nWhat do you think, worth getting checked or just eczema?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t2ppzm6u8qa41.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=369a821a146172abc676b045fa04982e5b7c108b", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dermatomyositis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tcta", "subreddit_subscribers": 198, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Does this look like DM?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dermatomyositis/comments/eojwxd/does_this_look_like_dm/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "call-it-dreaming", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_53gum0m3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578649522, "domain": "self.dermatomyositis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dermatomyositis/comments/emos7d/opinionexperience_request_post_does_this_sound/", "gildings": {}, "id": "emos7d", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/dermatomyositis/comments/emos7d/opinionexperience_request_post_does_this_sound/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578649523, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey everyone, another one of those posts looking for opinions. I know ultimately I just need to wait for the specialist, but I\u2019ve been sitting here in pain for months now (rheumatology appointment in April) and want to educate myself as much as possible. I have access to research papers through my university library so I try to find most of my info through that, but research unfortunately doesn\u2019t adequately describe the nuance of lived experience! Thanks in advance for your thoughts and I apologize for this being an absolute essay. Just wanted to give detail. I\u2019ve been really ill since May and I\u2019m just sitting here feeling like my body is progressively failing/I\u2019m going to die most days, so I'm trying to figure out whatever the heck my body is freaking out about! \n\n**Tests**: The only abnormal bloodwork I\u2019ve had thus far is elevated antinuclear antibodies: 1:80 at the beginning of all this, re-tested twice at 1:320, homogenous all times. My white blood cell count has pretty consistently dropped since I first has it tested in January from the top of normal down to the bottom, but all within what\u2019s considered normal. Other tests that have been done and are within normal range are: Complement 3/4, RF, CRP a very unremarkable 0.5 (normal &lt;4.8)  dsDNA, ENA\u2019s negative. Cardiolipin Ab IgG/IgM normal, Creatinine, GFR within good range. Vitamin B12/D normal, electrolytes, hemoglobin, ferritin normal (but actually kind of high for someone who basically wasn\u2019t eating/is a vegetarian and I know ferritin can act as an inflammation marker). TSH has been tested in the past on a couple occasions, was 2.7/2.4 (lab range around &lt;5 though I\u2019ve heard about the controversy on this), other hormones have been tested in the past and apparently unremarkable, though I\u2019m still skeptical because I have mild hirsutism and inexplicable weight fluctuation.\n\n**History**: I\u2019m 28/F, not on any meds. I had been experiencing right sided neck pain for the past three years and it kept getting more frequent, but I went back to school and figured it was all the computer work. I also had spells of itchiness all over my body. Then my vision started to go kind of blurry, like my eyes had difficulty focusing. In February I noticed particularly bad fatigue. I\u2019m always tired but this was impacting my ability to cognitively function. I should mention during all this time I was steadily gaining weight (or at least swelling..I don't weigh myself but my clothes weren't fitting and my face looked swollen) despite vigorously exercising for at least an hour a day and not overeating (I never eat out and eat very healthy too). \n\nThen in May, I had a two week long cold and a few days later the left side of my body went tingly and weak. I think overall I was weak but I had these specific spots in my bicep and my thigh that hurt alongside the weakness so I noticed the left more. Went to the ER, cleared stroke and for MS, referred to a neurologist and declared fine. Had a CT angiogram with iodine contrast dye, and a few hours later the muscles all over my body (like everywhere, random small muscles on the head, back, arms, legs, feet) started twitching, but the neurologist unfortunately didn\u2019t see this symptom because it started later. Also had an MRI which came back fine. The weakness seemed to progress for the next couple of months and kind of stabilized, and overall now I just feel symmetrically weak but I still get those weird specific pains in my bicep and thigh if I use them. Though the muscle twitching is everywhere, some of it seems to be evoked by using the muscle. \n\n**Symptoms I\u2019ve noticed since:** Lost about 20 pounds since the angiogram even though I stopped exercising, lost my appetite though. Facial redness/rash (maybe heliotrope because my eyelids look lightly red/purple compared to the rest of my face colour, but all my rashes except the chest one are pretty faint tbh), rash on my chest in v neck area, mild redness/dryness on my elbows and ankles, redness on my knuckles that comes and goes, migratory mild joint pain and nail pitting, joint clicking (basically a million things start cracking when I move), hair thinning, incredible neck pain which physio deemed weakness. Increasing fatigue, a random swelling muscle on the top of the left side of my foot, tingling mostly in my feet and arms when I lie down at night, I\u2019m a singer so I\u2019m pretty hyper aware of my throat area, but my voice definitely fatigues a lot easier than it did. I\u2019ve realized recently that I\u2019m pretty sure weakness/symptoms are induced by UV rays. Even a moment without sunscreen even on a cloudy day, or under fluorescent lighting seems to make my muscles start to hurt and feel weak. It's become more symmetric now and I notice both arms and legs are weak. Though I could be wrong and it could just be exertion or whatever. \n\nI didn\u2019t recognize it at first but the more symptoms that appear, the more I remember that I had many of these as a child. Hair loss, mild joint pain and nail pitting, stomach aches, days where it felt difficult to go up the stairs and I had trouble breathing (sensation of \u201ccan\u2019t get enough air\u201d), and an overall feeling of weakness that stayed with me up until now but nothing bad enough to bother me too much, except the breathing thing. I\u2019ve always wondered why it feels as though my muscles don\u2019t work, like they won\u2019t engage or something, despite the dance/yoga/rowing/whatever other sport I tried and gave up on because I couldn\u2019t improve. \n\n**What makes me suspicious of JDM** is that I had some symptoms/attacks as a kid and most of the symptoms seem based around muscles, my persistent weakness (been tested for anemia so many times), and the v rash seems to be pretty specific. Also, I had a white spot appear under the surface of my bottom lip, reminding me of calcifications, and I had white spots show up when I was a kid on the pads of a couple of my fingers. They went away though. \n\n**My questions** to the community are I suppose if this even sounds at all like DM or JDM? Do your symptoms of weakness seem to get worse with UV/fluorescent exposure or wax and wane in nature? I know that the weakness with DM is supposed to be progressive and debilitating, but I have heard that there are experiences with milder muscle weakness? I mean, I hardly made it home from the bus stop the other day I felt so weak and when I did I was shaking, but again, I didn't feel the same the next day. The only other thing that I know is photosensitive is lupus, so either way I think I\u2019m in for not a great diagnosis unless I\u2019m imagining the photosensitivity. Any tests you think I should request from my GP until I can see the specialist?  \n\n\nAny other thoughts are welcome, and thanks very deeply for taking the time to read this. I've been so amazed in my lurking through the autoimmunity subreddits at the generosity from folks who are dealing with so much who find the energy to read through the panicked and lost posts made by those of us wading in the murky waters of non-diagnosis land.

Thank you. Back in 2017, I suddenly broke out with a rash on my eyelids. My skin was completely raw and extremely painful. With time it healed and over about a year I started having worsening joint issues. My mom, who has RA (auto immune issues run in my family) brought me to her rhumotologist who got bloodwork done. He noticed one of the inflammation levels were 20x what it was supposed to be, but everything else was normal. The doctor believed I may have DM, but it wasn\u2019t active yet. So, he prescribed some meds and I saw him every 4 months with blood work. My last appointment was last week, and it came back that my muscle enzymes were 10x what they are meant to be. I\u2019ve developed what my doctor is calling lesions on my knuckles, muscle weakness has progressed and very mild chest pains. My doctor thinks that the DM is active, so I got prescribed steroids, more bloodwork, a chest X-ray (DM is associated with ILD) and I need to document my hands. Since the appointment I\u2019ve done a lot of research, but the outcomes are never good. Cancer, lung issues, muscle weakness, skin flare ups. I don\u2019t know what to do with this.

I like this thread because it helps me not feel so alone in what I\u2019m experiencing. So my name is Kayana and I am 18 years old and was diagnosed with DM (kind of, long story) in April of 2018  right before getting my wisdom teeth out. However, it really all started near the end of December of 2017. For the first few days I had a high fever and stayed home from school because of just feeling useless and having chills and aches from the fever. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with fifths disease because I had flushed red cheeks and I was working at a daycare at the time.The next day I woke up very very nauseous and began to vomit non stop which continued for the next six hours. I went back to my pediatrician at the time who then said that I did not have fifths disease and mentioned lupus because of my butterfly rash but we never explored that idea. I was hospitalized to give me an IV for liquids because I could not keep anything down. While I was in the hospital my face rash got even worse like a flare up and looked like it was popping out on my face. I was tested for influenza and scanned for many things but they could not figure out what I was sick with and just told me I had a nasty bug. After the hospital I had blood vessels popped in my eye, an ear infection, and a pallet infection. \n\nBetween the months of December to April I had a rash show up on my forearm to which my friends and family told me to just put more lotion on and it\u2019d go away. One day during my biology class I noticed these bumps that showed up on my fingers and sent a picture to my mom. My mom wanted to take me to see my doctor and the lupus was brought up again. We were not sure so I went to go get bloodwork done and it came back positive for lupus. \n\nSo for a while I believed that I had lupus but just with my skin? I went to go see my dermatologist for my skin rashes which was the first time that Dermatomyositis was brought up. My dermatologist gave me skin creams, a short term steroid, and Hydroxychloroquine. I then went to go see a rheumatologist about two hours from where I live because I live in a very small town and continued to find out more about what I have and look for treatments. \n\nWhat I know now is that my DM is only in my skin and not shown to be in my muscles or my lungs. I feel very very lucky to have it like this because I have read and heard about how much worse it could be and what other people have gone through. I have experience some muscle soreness and also stiffness here and there however. My skin is the worst it has ever been and has been hard for me to accept and adjust to. My fatigue has been HORRIBLE recently as well which I also think could be a factor of my depression. I have been trying to find a treatment that works or ANYTHING that works. The rashes on my legs and arms have broken open and have started to blister which has become extremely painful to wear clothing on it and even put my creams on it. The medicine I\u2019m currently taking makes me very nauseous and most of the time I puke after taking it. I have become so disgusted and embarrassed of my skin and my body. Many people make comments about my skin and how I have burns and I try to educate them however it does truly hurt me every time. I know that it is probably because I am not used to this disease but it has become so hard for me to go through my everyday life and I just wish I could lay in bed all day. My doctors tell me not to stress but I simply can\u2019t do that when I\u2019m a full time college student and also working part time. However, next semester I am taking a break from school to rest and hopefully get better from where I am right now. I am still going to work part time just to make sure that I get out of the house and won\u2019t get more depressed. \n\nI wanted to post this to let my story out and to see what you guys think. If anyone has ANY advice or just support I would appreciate it so so much.

sunburn. Main symptoms are kidney-area pain, headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, butterfly shaped facial rash (malar or heliotrope?), fatigue, weakness, generally feeling like shit. High CRP and CK, but negative ANA and specific antibodies. **List of questions at the bottom.**\n\n**Long story (sorry it's so much info... I even left some stuff out!):**\n\nHey all! I'm still undiagnosed and I'm hoping to get some opinions. My first rheumatology appointment is coming up on Friday, so I know I should be able to get some answers to my health woes soon. That said, I'd love opinions on what might be causing my issues. I'm 35, female, and have been relatively healthy up to this point in my life.\n\nEverything started back in early July. At the very end of June, I went camping and got a pretty bad sunburn. Then, for 4th of July I went to the lake for five days and stayed on a houseboat. I didn't get burnt, but I did spend a lot of time in the sun. When I left, before I even got 10 minutes away, I started having a deep aching pain in my left kidney area. My hands were swollen so that I couldn't get my rings off. I was also really drained and fatigued, but I chalked that and the swelling up to too much sun and alcohol. \n\nThe kidney-area pain happened pretty much every day for a month, and I thought maybe I was going to pass a kidney stone or something. I never did, to my knowledge. I also started having terrible headaches - every single day for two months straight. Sometimes the headaches were the tension/pressure kind and sometimes they were migraines with aura. I had bouts of tinnitis and dizziness and nausea with and without the headaches. I also started having lots of muscle aches, almost like they were in knots. My thighs were the most sore, along with my shoulders and behind my shoulder blades. I was very stiff. \n\nThen came the joint pain. My left knee, which has been creaky since high school but has never given me pain before, started getting very stiff and achy. If I have to sit still for too long, it starts to ache and I have to move it to ease the pain. I chalked this up to getting older for a while. Then my left shoulder started acting up. My lower back was in terrible pain every day, sometimes feeling like it was compressed and other times like the muscles were seized up. \n\nI started getting a really obvious butterfly-type rash on my face and I'm wondering if it's possibly malar rash from lupus or heliotrope rash from dermatomyositis. The rash comes and goes, and it's typically worse when I'm feeling my worst. My eyelids do get puffy and red, sometimes even more obviously than the butterfly rash. And I've noticed that when the rash is really bad my ears turn bright red.\n\nThroughout this time, I was overwhelmingly fatigued. Despite getting 8-10 hours of sleep every night, I was so exhausted that I could barely get through my work day. It was like my body was simply too heavy to hold up. When I sat at my desk at work, I leaned heavily on my forearms because sitting up just took so much energy. \n\nI've also noticed that there's a gland on the back of my neck that is almost always swollen. I massaged the back of my neck when I had a tension-type headache and that's when I noticed it. It's not always sore, but it's almost always swollen. It's more sore when I have a headache.\n\nOne Sunday, I decided to install a medallion on the chandelier in my kitchen. I'd just installed the light a few weeks before, and the cap didn't completely cover the whole in the ceiling, so I'd gotten the medallion to cover it up. I was barely able to unscrew the light fixture on my own in order to unwire it and install the medallion. My arms felt so weak and I could barely hold them over my head, much less hold the weight of the chandelier. I had no problem doing all of this myself just a few weeks before, so I was extremely confused by it. I'd also felt completely fine that morning, so I wasn't sure why I all of a sudden felt miserably weak. My girlfriend helped me finish putting the light back up, and I immediately laid down. Within minutes I had a terrible migraine. I was freezing cold, couldn't get warm. I just laid there and cried because I felt so horrible.\n\nThe very next day, I started feeling better. I had energy and wasn't nearly as achy and I didn't get a headache all day long.  My first doctor's appointment was scheduled for the following day, now the middle of September. I went in and explained that I was feeling better but still concerned about my symptoms. My doctor is an internist and I LOVE her. She immediately ran bloodwork and urinalysis, then scheduled an MRI. The urinalysis bloodwork came back mostly normal, except for elevated creatine kinase and c-reactive protein. Because this showed inflammation, she ran more bloodwork for autoimmune diseases. My ANA was negative (the result was .4 and since that's not how most people's are reported I can only go with the qualitative value they gave me), and I didn't have high enough numbers in any of the specific tests to mean anything. \n\nFor the next month, I felt mostly normal. I did notice that my fingers were sometimes red and swollen and stiff, but it typically didn't last long. I also got very itchy around one or two knuckles (often the pointer and middle finger knuckles on my right hand, but it did happen on other knuckles and finger joints, too). Other than this, the symptoms were gone. I had almost no lower back pain (which I'd had since well before things got bad... as early as March), I only had one mild headache, the rash on my face cleared up, and I had energy. It felt SO GOOD to feel normal! I said multiple times that it felt almost euphoric to just live like a normal person again. I hoped that maybe I'd gotten a really bad virus or something and it was all in the past.\n\nDuring that time, I went back to my internist. She said that despite the tests being negative, she wanted me to see a rheumatologist. She said that some people have autoimmune diseases without positive bloodwork, and my symptoms still made sense with a few autoimmune diseases, especially lupus. Since I have Raynaud's and I have a family history of autoimmune diseases, she thought a rheumatologist was the best next step. Plus a sleep study. She also prescribed Effexor, since it's used to treat migraines and muscle pain, as well as fibromyalgia and depression. I started taking it and continued feeling like a normal human being.\n\nIn mid-October, I started feeling bad again. It was like getting the flu, but without the snot and sore throat. My body ached, I was exhausted, and I noticed I was getting scaly patches of skin on my knees and elbows. The ones on my knees would sting and burn when I did knee push ups during my workouts. They were bright red, not covered in plaques like you expect psoriasis to be. My joints started getting stiff and achy again. The headaches came back, but only the tension-type ones and not the migraines. I'm also having muscle aches, but they aren't nearly as bad as they were during the first flare period.

I've had a pretty severe hand rash since the beginning of this year, that I'm concerned is DM, or something autoimmune. It doesn't hurt or itch in the slightest, and is kinda just there. They start as little lesions, and eventually settle out to flat red patches. No other rashes elsewhere, and the only other symptom I have is slight joint pain in my left thumb, and some persistent brain fog (which could just be from me stressing about this). I've been seeing a dermatologist for the past couple months, and we've tried anti fungals + topical steroids with no success, so we went ahead and did a biopsy (the results are in my imgur link). Basically, my derm told me I had \"lichen simplex chronicus\" and that it was nothing to worry about, and I should just let it be. I'd be happy with that answer, except for the fact I was discussing the issue with a family friend whose a rheumatologist who raised some red flags, and said that possibly the biopsy was performed in an incorrect site, and I should go in to get blood work performed. Unfortunately, he lives a couple states away, and the wait list to get an appointment with a rheum in my area is quite long.\n\n\nI know this subreddit is generally a help group for others that suffer from DM, but I figured I would get the best advice if I came to the source.
