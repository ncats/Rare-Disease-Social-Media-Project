There's not that much out there about what to expect!\n\nFirstly, it was borderline miraculous that this issue was found. While my gf knew about her ToF and a surgery at 3 years old, she was not given much information about what to expect in adulthood (she's 35 now). We knew that she might need a heart surgery at some point, but not exactly why. It turns out pulmonary valve issues are common for ToF patients - something I think most know now, but for whatever reason she wasn't told and so no one was on the lookout for it. She happened to get a new cardiologist who wanted to run some routine tests and they discovered some irregularities. One thing led to another and they found that she had 80+% pulmonary regurgitation - time for a new valve. The strange thing is she had essentially no symptoms whatsoever. Thank goodness for the new cardio or she might have encountered a sudden heart failure. If you have ToF and aren't getting regular checkups - do it.\n\nProbably the worst part of the experience was dealing with insurance - GF had an HMO which we realized far too late is very bad for anyone who needs to see a lot of specialists. We're in the US, and dealing with insurance was even more of a nightmare than we could have imagined. She was on the phone 10-20 hours a week just trying to get routine CT scans approved. They would send us to a good doctor for a consult and then deny everything that doctor wanted to do - the doc usually wanted someone from his team to perform the tests in-house but they would try rerouting to some cheaper place. It's an incredibly long story but the main takeaway for us was that you NEED to get your doctor to call the insurance company if there is any significant snag. Despite the massive amount of time and effort put in, we made absolutely NO headway whatsoever. The only time insurance would budge on anything is when the doctor or hospital would use their influence. Would have saved us a lot of time if we had known this.\n\nThe surgery itself went incredibly well. While she was originally hoping for a transcatheter replacement, it was determined that her valve was too big to confidently perform it that way - and because she was still young, she could handle surgery well and so that was ideal. So it was open heart in the end. They told us that whenever this one is due for a replacement (\\~15 years), it will definitely be transcatheter at that time. We kept asking for details about the surgery, but essentially there weren't much to give - they said it was \"unremarkable\" aka it was a boring old valve replacement with no curveballs. So, good news. Based on our incredible surgeon (at USC in Los Angeles) and research I've done, this surgery is about as low risk as it comes. You can worry about the recovery, but you don't really need to worry about worst case scenarios - the chances are basically nil.\n\nShe stayed in the hospital for 4 or 5 days and while it certainly wasn't a good time, it's actually a little easier than the first few days back at home. My gf often says she misses the hospital. Immediately after, she looked like she had been hit by a bus - lots of bruises from IVs, central lines, sticky stuff all over her from various bits of tape - orange antiseptic, looked pretty pale. But by the next morning she was totally awake and interacting normally. She was walking within 2 or 3 days. The turnaround was shockingly fast!\n\nWe're 3 weeks into recovery and it's going pretty well. We were told that it wasn't necessarily pain that's a big issue - it's exhaustion, and that seems to be mostly true. My girlfriend was a bit annoyed that her biggest trouble isn't emphasized a lot - the chest tubes that they put in/take out are the most painful and uncomfortable wounds for her. The incision itself is basically painless and looks incredibly good already. As the \"caretaker,\" it's been a lot of work guiding her through the recovery and handling all the chores, and it's definitely a bit of a roller coaster as far as good days and bad days, especially mentally. Sleep has been a real problem with her waking up frequently out of discomfort. I wish I could say recovery is no big deal, but it can definitely be tricky. However, it's certainly manageable, and it's nice that the really hard stuff comes first!\n\nIt's been a whirlwind and I probably have a lot more that I'm forgetting, but I wanted to get this down while I had a few moments. Happy to answer any questions!

And admittedly I haven't done as much homework about ToF as I maybe should have over the last few months. We've been in hospitals since he was born, he had a stent put in to allow blood to flow better which allowed him to come home. But I admit I have struggled with retaining information about ToF and feel like I don't know my son was well as I should. I am on the autism spectrum so the stays in hospital were difficult to process and all the information being thrown our way was very difficult to take in, lots of it went over my head due to being quite overwhelmed by the experiences we were going through. And I feel some frustration over this. I feel like I'm failing as his father because I'm not as clued up as his mother is. I feel like I'm not prepared for things that may go wrong. I just need advice/info/things to read about this please.\nAlso what does the future hold after a full repair? Will he be on medication for the rest of his life? Will he be able to play with friends? Can he play sports? Can he live a normal life? These are all things I worry about as I had expectations of all these things and being able to play with him and support him and cheer him on at school sports days and those types of things.

I am 9 days post op and feeling really good for the most part. I am able to sleep through the night and during the day I am up and walking laps from my kitchen to my bathroom about 6 or 7 times a day. I can get myself food and drinks without help most often.  I still need help in the shower and opening bottles that are yet to opened such as the milk jug or a bottle of water. And during the day I am only taking Ibuprofen for pain. I stolped needing narcotics during the day at around day 6. I have been able to raise my arms above my head since day 3 without any pain. \n\nI do have some questions though about some things. \nFirst I have been deeling with some odd emotions that I cant explain and dont know how to handle. I have been doing everything my doctor has said regarding recovery such as protecting my sternum by holding a small pillow to my chest while I walk around and when I bend over to grab something. The issue is I dont feel as if I just had a major operation. So I have been feeling almost anxious and as if my brain is confused, if that makes sense. My brain says your fine do what you want but at the same time, you just had major surgery dont be stupid. Has anyone else experienced this? I dont know how to handle it. It makes me restless and anxious and Im really struggling with that.\n\nMy second question is, during the day I feel great as I said. I only take Ibuprofen once a day and thats all I need all day. I make sure to rest often and dont push myself.  At night is a different story. I will sit and rest for the night stating at around 5:30 when I start my IV meds. About 6:30-7, my pain goes from a 1 or 2 to an 8-9 within minutes and out of nowhere.  I have to take an oxy and a muscle relaxer together to get any relief.  Has anyone experienced this? I dont know what to do.  I want to be fully off pain meds by post op day 14. Is there anything I can do? Im really frustrated because I only need them at night but I have to take both or it doesnt help the pain and nothing else helps. I have tried heat, a warm/hot shower, Ibuprofen, Tylenol, changing the way I am sitting/laying, propping my arms on pillows with a pillow behind my back.

The doctor told me to drop wrestling and martial arts and to stick to light jogging/ non contact sports.\n\nI'm 34 now and over the years I went to the gym to do cardio and I would do light weights. I was always confused as to how far/much I should do? It also doesn't help that I have PTSD from that event. So for example, I could be jogging and I'll see my heart rate is 120 and I slow down. If I don't see my rate drop after a minute, I freak out. \n\nOver time I've tried to over come that fear and I'm doing better. Since the pandemic I've been jogging. I started doing 2k and that was enough. But now I can do 5k and the length and time I can go continues to increase, but I don't know my limit. I don't feel tired, or experience anything bad. The only thing that I fear is when is enough, enough? Also the PTSD doesn't help at times.\n\nRecently I started thinking about martial arts. Like, I wouldn't be sparring. I would be kicking and punching the air or a bag. I guess being told to light jog was kinda vague? \n\nI've been looking for exercise for people with TOF but can't find anything really. What's everyone's routine when it comes to working out? Any knowledge on the condition in relation to working out?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Tetralogy_of_Fallot", "subreddit_id": "t5_352u3", "subreddit_subscribers": 177, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Exercise, bay-bee", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Tetralogy_of_Fallot/comments/m4g5rc/exercise_baybee/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Known_Panic6074", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3x7rtlcf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1615601067, "domain": "self.Tetralogy_of_Fallot", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Tetralogy_of_Fallot/comments/m3wqrn/tattoos/", "gildings": {}, "id": "m3wqrn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Tetralogy_of_Fallot/comments/m3wqrn/tattoos/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1615601079, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi!

Unfortunately it got worse so this past Tuesday they did one more very extensive ultrasound to see what the valve was doing. Unfortunately it was more bad news. Not only is it contuing to get worse but they had to add another medicine to my list to help with fluid build up. They had me on 80mg of lasix but it wasnt working fully and they couldnt keep upping the dose because it was depleting my potassium so they put me down to 40mg and added 25mg of spironolactone. I was told I need to keep my fluid intake as close to 64oz as possible but I am finding it hard to drink enough. I had blood work this morning to make sure I dont have endocarditis and to check a bunch of other levels and things I cant remember the name of. I have an MRI on the 4th to look for any abnormalities that could be the problem. They said that if that comes back normal they will may end up going in via catheter to look for blood clots but they dont think that is the issue. They told me that if everything comes back normally then that means that my heart doesnt like the new valve and the only option is to wait until my body and heart cant take it anymore and do open heart surgery. I am so angry and scared. Im angry because I thought the new valve was going to fix things and it seems to be worse than before.  Im scared because I dont want open heart surgery.

For some reason we didn't take any action then and the issue continued to worsen.\n\nFast forward a couple of years and I was around 15 and needed a second surgery. Again it well. This time however, I became more self-conscious of my poor posture. I could not stand the sight of my rounded shoulders, hunched back, forward-drooping head and protruding and misshapen spine. I started going for biokinetics to try and resolve it. Each meeting with my biokineticist basically consisted of a workout that they tailored specifically for my issues. Most of the exercises focused around strengthening certain back muscles and stretching some chest muscles. This worked great! I was able to see pretty significant results over a relatively short period of time. Now it wasn't completely perfect or anything, but it was a definite improvement. \n\nSadly, due to some major complications that happened last year (infective endocarditis) I required a third surgery waaay sooner than we had expected. I just returned from that about a week ago and so far the recovery is going well, however I have seen my disgusting posture return. It seems almost all the progress I made at the biokineticist was reversed.  \n\nI am 17 at the moment and wonder if I have missed the opportunity to rectify my posture and am just doomed to the implications of it for the rest of my life or is there still hope for change once I recover?

I have tetralogy of fallot and recently found out my condition has worsened to where I\u2019ve developed ventricular tachycardia. \n\nI have sort of a weird/interesting question and was curious if there's anyone in the group who has an answer or some experience. \n\nBack in January, I got hired for my first job right out of college; shortly after starting the position, I had to take time off because I was in the hospital. The morning I returned to work, I was called into a meeting with the company's HR and my manager during which I was told that I was seen \"as a liability to the office and needed to leave immediately after the meeting was over.\" I was devastated after this happened because I was so proud of myself for finding a highly professional and well-paying job directly after graduating-- I felt like a failure and like my health was holding me back from living a normal life. After taking time to focus on my physical and mental health, I realised I should still be proud of myself and I WILL accomplish everything I set my mind to. \n\nSince then, I've had to take time off indefinitely from getting a job because I've been very sick on and off. During this time, I've been looking for potential remote positions for when I'm able to start working again, but lately, I've been yearning to find a position where I'm helping people and making a positive change in their lives.  \n\nHere's where my question comes in: has anyone had any experience in working for Congenital Heart Disease foundations or as a Congenital Heart Disease speaker? My dream is to be able to work with younger kids who are going through the early stages of learning to live with a CHD and encourage them to find ways to live beautiful and fulfilling lives; however, I would love to be apart of sharing my words and experience with any audience I can. I want my voice to matter in this community, but I'm not sure where to start. \n\nI appreciate if you've read this far, thank you for making my words important!

I have to have my pulmonary valve replaced. A little back story, I was diagnosed 29 years ago and 2 years after I was born and I had open heart surgery to repair the hole in my heart. In 2013 I had 2 stents placed, 1 in each of my pulmonary valves. At the appointment where it was discovered I needed the stents they also explained that I would also need my pulmonary valve replaced at some point. Fast forward to the end of this past August I had my yearly appointment and I did great. I was jogging on the treadmill and I all my numbers were great. At the end of September I started getting super fatigued half way through the day and could stay awake. I woke up one morning and my pants were 2 sizes too small. I wasn\u2019t able to walk very far without getting winded and chest tightness. I called and got an emergency appointment with my cardiologist. They put me on 60mg of Lasix and ordered all kinds of tests. One of which was another stress test. I didn\u2019t make it 5 minutes before I got bad chest pain and couldn\u2019t breath. My heart rate spiked to over 160 and my blood pressure jumped to 170/98. I was only walking. I can\u2019t walk up stairs without fighting for air and getting severe chest pain. I literally feel like my body is failing me.  I have an MRI/MRA on Friday and that will tell them if it can be done trans catheter or if it has to be open heart. I\u2019m really scared. I keep telling everyone that I\u2019m not worried but I am. I am getting progressively worse and it scares me.

A dude in his twenties (I know they aren't called orderlies anymore, but you know the type) talked to his buddy about their plans for the evening while rolling me along as I half-listened and stared into oblivion.\n\nA few hallways and an elevator later, we were outside X-ray waiting my turn. At this point I noticed something interesting. One of the lines on my heart monitor appeared to match my breathing. Time for an experiment.\n\n*deep breath in and hold*\nThe line sharply inclines and then starts a wobbly plateau. Not a perfect plateau; evidently I am not holding my breath as well as I would like.\n\n*breathe out in short spurts*\n*puff puff puff*\nMy wobbly plateau turns into a jagged ravine. \n\nBefore I can think of more interesting ways to breathe, I suddenly remember that my heart monitor is being watched remotely. I didn't want them to think that something was wrong, and scare my parents before I had a chance to explain my boredom. So I quit playing with the respiratory waves. Sometimes I wish I could get hooked up again and finish fooling around.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Tetralogy_of_Fallot", "subreddit_id": "t5_352u3", "subreddit_subscribers": 18, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "TOFer story time", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Tetralogy_of_Fallot/comments/9uzkr9/tofer_story_time/"}]
