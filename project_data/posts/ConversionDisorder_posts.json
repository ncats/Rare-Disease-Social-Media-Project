My ears constantly ring and/or pop, my eyes frequently twitch, and I'm almost always dizzy and clumsy. Now that the vertigo and migraine attacks have become more frequent, I fight to stand up or walk (most of the time, I use my grandmother's walker to get to places in my house and a wheelchair to go for long distances), I sometimes blackout and wake up on the floor or against a wall and can't remember how I got there, I can't focus on anything, I feel extremely weak, everything is blurry, literally anything with motion makes me sick, certain body parts are tingling and/or becoming numb (feet, legs, arms, hands), I have slurred speech or I repeat words/statements constantly without meaning to do so, and I'm having trouble holding on to things due to regressing fine motor skills (I constantly drop cups, plates, and feeding utensils that I'm holding, and I can't write very well.). I've been to the ENT because I've always had constant problems with my ears, and I've been to 2 different hospitals in 2 weeks and have had a CT scan, an EKG, and 2 MRIs, and everything came clear. I had a myringotomy done to drain out fluid in my ears, and after getting a hearing test, my ears are fine. The ENT expedited me an appointment with the neurologist for further tests due to concerns with my immobility and regressing fine motor skills, stagnant eye movement, and body numbness. The neurologist says that there is no connection between my symptoms and what was found with the pictures of my brain in the CT scan and MRIs. Then, he talked about conversion disorder, explaining what it was and some of its symptoms (almost every symptom that I have correlates with the disorder). It makes sense, because I've been through some shit that would traumatize me like this, and I haven't exactly dealt with these events like I needed to. I feel like I'm crazy because it's a psychological disorder and I feel like it's all in my head, but I can't control what happens to my body, especially not now. Anxiety has been a major problem in my life due to emotional abuse from family members and both emotional and physical abuse from ex-boyfriends, plus having a stressful work environment and feeling like I'm not good enough to do what I love due to bad experiences with my student internship at college. Depression has really sunk in due to going from running around with 3-5 year-old kids to hardly being able to do anything. What are your symptoms? What did you do for treatment? Did you have other tests to rule out other causes? How long does it take to cure or contain symptoms from this disorder? Can any of you that are diagnosed with this disorder live a normal life?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ConversionDisorder", "subreddit_id": "t5_3151j", "subreddit_subscribers": 55, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hi.

On the other hand my psychologist thinks it's too complicated to be explained by a conversion disorder. As you can see nobody really knows what's been going on, so I would first like to tell you my story, before explaining more about any questions I have:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(The following is a edited version of my post in /neuropathy)\n\n\"I am a 20 year old male, who currently has to deal with a scala of vague symptoms.\n\nIn March I got a mild lung infection (I got better within a week). However, since then I have these symptoms that make me think something is wrong with my nerves. It started with a pressure feeling around my ankle and knee for a while, but some time later weird sensations began spreading to my face, feet, hands, forearms, top of the penis and tongue. On one side these sensations either include subtle loss of pressure, pain, warm and cold sensation (but almost total pressure loss at the top of my penis, and weirdly enough I think I also have lost the sense of taste on the front part of my tongue). On the other side they entail warm/cold/tingling/light pain sensations at these places (for example: random warm flashes om cheek). I also have these muscle twitches every few minutes all over my body when I am not moving. I don't know if it could be related but I also have gotten tinnitus and ear irrigation hasn't helped.\n\nThe symptoms aren't so serious that they could interfere with my daily life yet and, but they are slowly progressing and therefore quite depressing. In addition to that I have also been deaing with concentration/memory problems for a year now, because of which I temporarily quit college. It could be that these symptoms could be related to the other symptoms despite being seperated in time.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past month I have been seeing a psychologist to deal with the apathy/emotional overload that's probably because of the past and present symptoms and their effect on my social life. However, he thinks my symptoms are quite atypical, and thinks there's probably a medical explanation.\n\nLast week I visitied a neurologist and she thinks it's a conversion disorder, because of the assymetrical/patchy pattern of the places that are affected.\n\nAnd I myself am actually clueless despite having read numerous possible causes:\n\n* If it has a medical cause it's probably some form of neuropathy (possibly small-fiber), which could for example be caused by...\n   * An autoimmune reaction to the infection: which could be the case since it started after an lung infection\n   * An infectious disease (hepatitis C, lyme): but why would symptoms appear just after an lung infection? However, an argument in favor of this cause is that I had taken antibiotics during the second week after getting sick, which could have delayed the disease from damaging my nerves and therefore my ankle and knees were the only places affected.\n   * Genetic (Marie-Tooth disease): I would expect the symptoms to be far worse.\n* If it has a psychological cause (conversion disorder) it could be caused by emotional overload. Which happened before the infection because of the effect of the memory problems on my study/social life; and (especially right) after the infection because I was worried sick and afraid about what was wrong with me (I was also having insomnia at the time  and weird body sensations like trembling, warm/cold places all over etc., which mostly resolved after becoming apathetic. And only sometime later the symptoms I explained earlier started to appear). However, the symptoms don't get worse in response to emotional stress, but seem to follow their own course and appear to be quite complicated at times, like it's behaving like a physicial disease. Which is why I think a conversion disorder is less likely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think could be the cause and why?\n\nIs anyone here with a illness (either conversion/physically) with similar symptoms?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR: Having weird neurological symptoms that appear to be neuropathy, but my neurologist thinks it's a conversion disorder.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ConversionDisorder", "subreddit_id": "t5_3151j", "subreddit_subscribers": 176, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Neurological or conversion?

Immediately after I felt some weakness in my legs, but didn\u2019t think too much of it. For the next few days my legs and arms felt like they were vibrating constantly and very tight. Eventually it went away, until few weeks later when I read some information about traumatic incidents, and suddenly felt this strange feeling set in my limbs. Like I could feel it slowly take over my legs and arms. I realized it was the same feeling I had during the incident, but now stronger. I looked at my legs/arms and wanted to move them but I couldn\u2019t. I had to move my neck to get my body moving and then they would move. Since then I\u2019ve had this same sensation occur every 3-4 weeks, and there is always some kind of \u201ctrigger\u201d e.g. someone being angry towards me and displaying aggressive behaviour.\n\nI also feel like my legs are always stiff and sore, and just varying degrees of it depending on if I get startled or stressed again. The worst it gets is when they feel like concrete has been poured in them and I have trouble walking - basically I have to waddle very very slowly, and going up and down stairs I have to lift myself by grabbing on to the railings. Once I sit down or lie down my legs won\u2019t move until I really try and move them, again I have to move other parts of my body to \u201cbring them along\u201d.\n\nBecause this was at work, I had work safety insurance set me up with counselling treatment, but the allotted treatment is up. I am worried they will just stop providing support with me. I didn\u2019t see my physician yet because it\u2019s really difficult to get an appointment with him. But I have one in a couple of weeks.

I am really confused and am wondering if you guys have had similar experiences.\n\nI still don't know whether I have conversion disorder for certain. My last psychiatrist called my episodes \"conversion reactions,\" but I am not sure if that qualifies as conversion disorder. My current psychiatrist hides his opinion but is asking that I go to see my family doctor. I had an emergency room visit in 2016 and another one recently, and both times they told me to talk to my psychiatrist.\n\nI've been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, social anxiety, and OCD. My first conversion reaction was at school. I was paralyzed neck down. I had to shout at a stranger walking past to retrieve my phone from my pocket to call my dad, because my arms and legs wouldn't move an inch despite my efforts. Then it got better, but it still happened all the time where I would fall over and be unable to move my body or speak. But for a while, it actually improved and I managed to get a Bachelor's in philosophy and gained acceptance to graduate school, but I had to leave grad school for obvious reasons. It was at this point that I decided to get a new psychiatrist, because my OCD symptoms, anxiety, etc. never got better.\n\nRight now, I have these altogether new symptoms. When I get anxious or scared my body starts twitching, my face twitches, and afterwards I can't move. Today my left arm twisted so hard in one direction that it actually hurt. Then my eyeballs were twitching too so my vision got squiggly. The symptoms only occur for me when I am overcome by strong emotions. Last week, the emergency room doctor did a blood test and told me to speak with my psychiatrist. \n\nDoes anyone have symptoms similar to these? What has your guys's treatment been like? Have you seen improvement? \n\nI would appreciate seeing your experiences.

The symptoms didn't fit any particular known etiology, but given it started in my legs and I have a number of issues with my spine causing weakness &amp; pain in my legs I assumed it was related to that for a good while. Given I'm now experiencing it in my entire body except for above my chin (so far), did some research, called my GP, crossed my fingers for some easy-to-fix vitamin deficiencies or whatever. But just got all my lab results back today and everything is normal; he had agreed with me that the symptoms didn't fit any known neuropsych issue and that if the labs came back normal it was likely \"stress.\" Which is basically GP talk for \"your mind is messing up your brain right now\"/conversion disorder.\n\nAnyway. I see him later this month and I'm sure we'll touch on this and next steps; I'm expecting since CD is as I recall a DSM-listed condition (now listed under FNS disorder I think?) he'll probably send me to my psych provider for further evaluation or official diagnosis, but it seems to be pretty clear this is what I'm experiencing. \n\nFeeling pretty down about it for a number of reasons, especially since I will absolutely get the \"GO TO THERAPY PLEASE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET YOU TO DO THIS FOR 3 YEARS\" talk I always get only this time it looks like I don't actually have an excuse anymore, if I want to keep some control over my movements. \n\nI'm wondering if folks have any recommendations on how to move forward, what to do, how to handle this, I guess? I recently trialed Topamax (anti-convulsant) for mood stabilization &amp; it did nothing for my mood but was really helpful for reducing the myoclonus. Off that and on Trileptal now and it's finally fixed my mania but doing next to nothing for the myoclonus, which sucks. I guess I'm just feeling pretty lost and depressed with all this. Called my mum to tell her my lab results came back okay and it's likely CD and she was extremely happy and I feel like it's weird to be extremely upset. But this just means instead of needing to up my calcium or magnesium intake, I've likely got yet another medical diagnosis that most people don't recognize as real, think is some form of malingering if not just lying for attention, is poorly understood scientifically, and has a complex treatment protocol that has an extremely variable success rate.
