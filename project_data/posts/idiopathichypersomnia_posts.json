I hope that's OK!*\n\n\n\n&gt;PROVIGIL (modafinil) is a wakefulness-promoting agent for oral administration. Modafinil is a racemic compound. The chemical name for modafinil is 2-[(diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl]acetamide. The molecular formula is C15H15NO2S and the molecular weight is 273.35.\n\n\nI have a diagnosis of Idiopathic Hypersomnia unless my symptoms get worse or my insurance approves the spinal tap to look for a hypocretin deficiency. Reasons for my desire for more tests include the fact that along with the hypersomnia I have: cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations when falling (or fighting) sleep and or waking up, excessive daytime sleepiness, night terrors &amp; sleep paralysis. I also have musical hallucinations when fighting sleep sometimes. And what's the worst for me, I regularly sleep 18-23 hours straight. \n\n(Symptoms began in 2nd grade or younger &amp; it got worse after a woman *ironically* fell asleep while driving and hit my car with her truck, head-on.)\n\nMy Sleep Test showed 86 limb(s) movements per *minute* and a typical sleep pattern, my MSLT showed me going into R.E.M in 11 minutes for the naps. The reason why I think these results aren't an accurate representation of my actual disorder is that sleeping is a trigger for me as I was abused in my sleep as a child. Sooooooo falling asleep with a male technician for the MSLT and having there be a \"sometimes violent\" (per mother and aunt - overhead) male patient during my overnight..... I could tell that I wasn't actually fully relaxed. I kept jerking whilst trying to fall asleep. Also I have zero memory of the last three hours of MSLT. \n\nAnywho. I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY want this medicine to work. I had to stop the Mirapex for the Periodic Limb Movement Disorder because it caused compulsions. It sucks because Mirapex let me sleep still and now that I know what it's like, I feel like I'm more aware that I don't stop wiggling causing calf cramps. \n\nPlease send me positive thoughts, prayers, good vibes, Care Bear stares, fingers crossed.

Much of this post is duplicated from a comment I wrote to them elsewhere.  I don't know what I'm looking for exactly, I think I'm just happy to have found this sub and people who truly understand how I have felt for so many years now. I was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia about 5-6 years ago after having a sleep study, but the doctor told me that IH is not even a real diagnosis--that it's just a catchall that means \"we don't know why, but you're extra sleepy during the day.\" He prescribed Nuvigil and told me there was nothing more to test or treat.\nSo for a couple of years I managed, not great, but well enough to finish grad school and work full time, thanks to Nuvigil. It helped me tremendously for 8 hours a day. But during this time, I seemed to get worse, and get additional symptoms such as worsening of allergies, food intolerances, etc. My health insurance changed and I could no longer get Nuvigil. So a psychiatrist started me on Adderall. I saw a rhumatologist who said it was chronic fatigue syndrome, said there was nothing I could do, that I should nap during my lunch hour, and accept it.\nThis last year I went back and saw her again, because I was getting worse still. She said it was now fibromyalgia, and that this too I needed to accept and that there was nothing to be done.\nI don't know what to do now, but my quality of life is shitty.  Adderall is a band-aid that comes with it's own set of problems.  I feel like I need a group of doctors who will work together to figure out what's really wrong with me.  \n\nWhat has your journey has been like? Have you found doctor(s) that takes it seriously? Any tests that you are aware of that I should be asking for? Anything that you've learned that you think might help me?\nThanks for reading and for any info you can share.

Don't know where else to ask at this point. I had my PSG and MSLT done 3 months ago and just got my results back.

The next day I fell asleep in all 5 of my naps and had a sleep latency of around 9.4 minutes but no SOREM, which I know isn't that awful but it still indicates borderline hypersomnia according to the results. \n\nSo the doctor called me today and said everything came out completely normal. No excessive daytime sleepiness indicated or anything else abnormal. She then called back to tell me that after further looking at my sleep study, she realized that I was in very deep sleep from about 8PM to 11AM. Which, for one, I did not fall asleep at 8. I was doing work up until 9-10. So she then told me that what it was was sleep deprivation. Uh....\n\nSo, I really don't know where to go from here. I know I am not sleep deprived. I get ~8 - 8.5 hours of sleep every day and I take naps every day and am still tired. I never wake up refreshed and I went in complaining that I sleep TOO much and never feel refreshed.\n\nFor those who were diagnosed with hypersomnia, what did it take? Did doctors listen?

It was incredible.\n\nHowever... it only works for me for about a month.  At which point if we increase the dosage, it starts working again.

I get so frustrated with sleep that despite being exhausted I can't fall asleep at bedtime (although any other time of the day is fair game).

We've been together for almost 4 years. Lived together for 3. As soon as we moved in together, I noticed how tired she was and always sleeping. We were both pretty young and didnt know how to handle everything.\nShe would complain a lot, but never actually did anything to help remedy the situation. I finally took charge and reached out to her doctor requesting various tests. She is anemic but refused to take her Iron pills. We had her thyroid checked and it was normal but I pushed the doctor to prescribe her medication to see if it would help. I was going through a very similar situation where I was tired all the time and did not know what was wrong.\nFinally, the thyroid meds helped slightly but still nothing great. I continued to reach out to the doctor on her behalf and the doctor mentioned having a sleep study done. This opened an entire new avenue of what could be wrong. We finally got her sleep study done. She did fine on the overnight study. They kept her during the day and the results were idiopathic hypersomnia.\nFirst course of treatment was to try Adderall 10 xr once a day. This semi works but not really. She was still very tired, mind in a fog, etc. Her doctor said after 10 days, move onto 20mg once a day. Same deal, did not work to well. Doctor came back and said move to 15 xr twice daily. Insurance did not cover it. I had to push my gf to get it filled without insurance and give it a try (price was not as bad as we thought). She continues to complain it does not work and is always falling asleep when we get home. She just wants to stay in bed and wont even hang out anywhere else in the house with me and dogs.\nIn order to help her, I refill her pill box every Sunday for the upcoming week. She does not follow through with her medication. She has a few other things she takes, but her box is always full, or one or two days she takes 1 thing and not the other. I keep trying to get her to follow through and take her medication as she should. Her complaints are shes too tired or too busy at work.....\nAnother thing too, I keep trying to explain that its a life style change as well. She complains a lot about headaches and stomach hurting, etc. Yet, she only eats 1 meal a day which is normally a hot pocket or something. I do not keep track of her water intake but I know she does not drink much water.\nAlso, I keep telling her if her meds are not working, she needs to reach out to the doctor about changing to a different brand, trying provigil or something a like.\nI know she is depressed, I dont know if this is all self inflicted or why she isnt following through with her meds. I have to literally force her to take them at times. Our relationship is suffering. We both have given up a lot and cut ties with family to be together. I know I show my frustration with her and when we fight, the topic always goes to breaking up. I care about her too much to just walk a way, but when I see her not \"trying\" with her meds, or life style change, what do I do?\nI don't know what else I can do or how to help her.\nThe hard part too is I cannot complain about being tired around her. I take care of all the house hold responsibilities. I cook, clean, take care of the dogs, wash her clothes, starting cooking food, I even work a second job to help support and pay off bills. (she works and goes to school as well). I've though about doing the sleep study as well since I have the same symptoms as her but finding time and money is hard. I was prescribed vyanse by my doctor for unrelated issue and that been semi helping me as well.\nHelp.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "GF was recently diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia.

I was diagnosed with IH in May of 2016. Prior to that in december 2015 i had my first sleep consult and sleep study, and misdiagnosed with sleep apnea. I struggled allll of 2015 with sleepiness, my primary dr and i worked with my meds to take off all sleep promoting meds to see of that helped and we switched antidepressants. None of that worked and i got my sleep consult. During tue sleep study i had a few RERAs, and some snoring but no true apneas/hypopneas and they did not introduce a cpap during the study. Yet, the dr still gave me a sleep apnea diagnosis and i had to be co diagnosed with my depression for ins to cover. I refused the cpap for months, i knew it was bullshit. The only way to get another sleep consult was so show a failed cpap trial. So i got one, and used it faithfully for a month, and sure enough it captured nothing significant and i still fell terrible. I got another sleep study and MSLT, and got the IH diagnosis. \n\nSo here we are. I tried modafinil and it didn't help much, i switched to adderall and it had been life changing, until 40mg IR daily wasnt cutting it anymore. My dr wont raise my dose, so he switched me to 20mg ritalin daily. It doesnt help. Maybe it would at higher doses but it doesnt so far. Im so frustrated and tired of being tired and feeling like a zombie. It feels hopeless, like nothing is going to work and im forever doomed. Doesn't help that i have depression, and am struggling to stay on my antidepressant. Anyone else go through this too with IH?

That long post contains my entire \"story\" though if anyone is interested in reading the entire thing. It is very long though just as a warning.\n\nAfter 4-5 years of being told there is nothing wrong and being misdiagnosed, I finally have a diagnosis of IH and it feels so good (In a strange way) to finally have answers and a treatment that already seems to be working a little.\n\nSymptoms began at 13 or 14 and I'm now 18 so its been a lot of my teenage life, causing a lot of frustration not only on my behalf but with my parents believing I was just lazy and saying \"Im tired as well\" or my mums favourite quote of \"we are sitting here doing nothing, of course you are tired, I could have a nap now if I wanted to\". My mum just didn't understand that I am tired **all** the time and not just when I'm tired and sitting around doing nothing, I'm sitting around doing nothing because I haven't got the energy to go anywhere. \n\nI live in Aus and modafinil is ridiculously expensive, approx $500 a month ($16+ a day) which is very out of reach for me since I'm only 18 and working limited hours because of IH. Realistically, I don't think $500 a month is really an option for many people, my sleep specialist told me that not many people reach for that option here in Aus but she legally needs to give us the option anyway.\n\nI got the diagnosis yesterday and managed to get home in time from my appointment (its an hour away) to get my prescription filled so I was able to begin treatment today! Im on 5mg dexamphetamine tablets 3 times a day and I have already noticed an improvement. I have done my first day and I (and my mum) noticed that I seemed to be more \"awake\" instead of walking around like a zombie all day. That being said, I could still have gone to bed, I still felt sleepy but I wasn't \"fighting\" sleep like I usually am. I didn't feel like I needed to hold my eyes open constantly. I also felt less brain fog than usual, I am usually really bad but today I felt like I was thinking a lot clearer, still a little foggy but nowhere near as bad as I usually am. I think I was more expecting a more \"severe\" reaction since people use dex recreationally but I guess they are taking larger doses. Im glad I wasn't bouncing off the walls but that was what I was expecting. \n\nOne question, will it get any better? For people on dex, will the results get better than they are now? I can already notice a massive difference but I'm wondering if I should expect anymore improvement? I have tried reading about cases of IH being treated by dex but I haven't found much information and I was looking for personal experiences for people here using dex as their stimulant to keep them awake. I want to know what I should be expecting! My parents want me to learn to drive but I wouldn't feel comfortable driving even with being medicated if its the same as I was today.

They said \"she looks fine she is probably faking it.\" Yet if they looked closely they would have seen that my face was almost always puffy. The circles under my eyes was dark. I could barely pay attention in class I was so tired. Anyway I've gotten much better since graduating high school. While my diagnosis is still IH on the Disabled Students Programs and Services files. My doctor doesn't really think I have it 100% anymore. I can now go to sleep at 10pm-1am and wake up from 8am-12pm. I'm still tired for the most part but the struggle of getting to sleep and waking up isn't as hard. The 8am-9am range is rare but it happens.

Diagnosis took a while because of comorbidities; bipolar disorder made me alternately manic and severely depressed, and an eating disorder was also briefly thought to be responsible.

After 5 years of sleeping 18-20 hours a day, I thought my problems would be solved! The second half of senior year, I got A's and B's for the first time in 4 years because I began taking Concerta and I was no longer sleeping in ever class. I came off the depression and anxiety medications that made my tiredness and anger worse and quickly began losing the 60 pounds they had managed to pack on my body. As I worked more with my neurologist and gathered information online and from forums about IH, it became apparent that this will be with me forever. Within 3 years, I cycled through the highest dosage of Concerta and tried Provigil, nuvigil and adderall. The latter three make me severely ill. In order to avoid having to give up all fun things in life and start xyrem (literal ghb) my doctor had my start on 50mg of vyvanse, which up until recently has been wonderful. I have 20mg left before I hit max on this drug. I can't take any stimulants besides concerta and vyvanse. I feel so finite, its not even funny. When will I start dozing off while driving again? When will I miss an entire day of work because I accidentally slept for 15 hours? When will I fall down the stairs or completely destroy a relationship again due to sleep drunkeness? Why does my body hurt so badly every day? My stomach problems have been unexplained besides 2 exploratory surgeries and countless lab tests. My joint problems go unexplained because my blood work doesn't register inflammation. RA and Lupus run in my family and I'm just counting the days until something else goes bad. I never eat until 9pm every day because I no longer feel hunger. In the past 3 years I have lost 65 pounds (not a bad thing imo). My hands turn red and white and sear with pain in the cold and I live in Pennsylvania so this winter has been real fun so far. Medications and talk therapy never helped my depression and anxiety before, in fact they worsened it by making my exhaustion worse and being hospitalized was so traumatic I rarely speak or think about it. I just want to die so I don't spend the rest of my life living in perpetual tiredness with accompanying pain and agony. Its been 9 years of fucking hell and I'm so ready to quit. I cant't go to school because I am too tired. I can no longer work retail that involves physcial labor because it exasperates my stomach pain. I have no reproductive issues but I never want children because how the fuck can someone so tired take care of a child? It would be cruel with my genetic makeup to reproduce. Vyvanse has killed my sex drive, my appetite, my desire to spend time with other people besides when things are so hard that I consider or attempt suicide. This is never going to get easier with the minimal research being done. How can I even attempt to get disability when no one even knows this disease exists? Every attempt I make at bettering my life and myself is thwarted by my fucking health. I feel like the right to end my life when I run out of treatment options is just and right. I hate having good day's and bad day's. I just want average days, every day, as far as tiredness goes. The Reynauds is getting worse, my left arm has a twitch, my blood pressure has been way too high for a 5 foot woman who weighs 115 pounds, and everything goes numb from time to time. This i can attribute to vyvanse. Is staying awake and functional worth the other hardships I have to go through? No not really. I have lived a thousand lives in 21 years and I am tired. Nothing makes this life worth living, waiting for the next thing to go wrong. I woke up this morning and had a cyst under my eyelid which is very painful. I am so sick of being in pain. I am so sick of medication. I am so sick of putting on a brave face so that the people around me don't have to worry about my problems. I've been on this ride for wayyyyyy too long and I am so ready to get off. Coping is bullshit, because its always going to be this way. There is no magic neurologist who will wave his wand and fix whatever is wrong with my cerebral spinal fluid. I'm 21 years old trying to start a business because I cant work jobs that don't require degrees, and the PA gov say's I'm too well off with 42 dollars in my bank account. This is a rant, but maybe people here will actually understand the absolute horror that is every waking and sleeping moment of every day for me.

For the past 2 years I've had sleep problems. It started when I went to rehab for drug addiction, the rehab ended up being essentially a cult, and the major issue there was caffeine intake combined with sleeping. You were essentially required to stay up until at least 4, normally 6-8AM, and sleep until anywhere from 11am-3pm. I left back in novemberish of 2015, and the sleep problems persisted, and started getting worse. \n\nI cut caffeine back heavy, nothing. I couldn't fall asleep until 3-4 at the earliest, even if I was just laying in bed doing nothing, taking melatonin early, not using computers or phones, etc. \n\nNext came the two crippling symptoms. \n\nI couldn't wake up to alarms, and if I was woken up by a person, I had an episode that I guess would be considered a confusional arousal. I live with my girlfriend, and when I started sleeping through 5+ alarms, I told her she could wake me up using any method needed if she was up before me. It worked for a week, and then I started not responding to being shaken. She tried yelling, music, room lights, and flashlights in my eyes. Again, those worked for a few days and stopped. I was blessed by fairly frequent oral sex alarms before this, and she began using those daily, which worked for all of 3 days, and then I wouldn't even become aroused. She graduated to threatening pouring cold water on me, and if needed squirting me with water or pouring a few drops on me. I didn't take well to that, and the confusional arousals became violent and still are. I've broken furniture and items, at one point I threw a glass of water out of a second story window because she told me if I didn't open my eyes she would put it on me. I'm very violent upon waking, I'll scream at her, my body language will be threatening, and thankfully I haven't hit her yet, but it's a matter of time. I am not in control of myself during these episodes, and I generally have little-no recollection of them after sleeping again. \n\nI can sleep through anything, literally. I produce music and therefore have a very nice audio system in our apartment, and my \"booth\"/\"studio\" so to say is right next to our bed. She can play ANYTHING, including music I like, music I don't like, sirens, gunshots, and screaming over my system at full volume, and I won't even move. \n\nI started to seek diagnosis about 3 months ago, before my symptoms hit this level of awful, and was diagnosed with DSPD by a sleep specialist and ADD by my PCP, who sent me to the sleep specialist. \n\nI was put on melatonin and light box, I used them for a little while to no effect, still do but don't have any luck. \n\nI lost my job over this in December and just got hired elsewhere. My current employer is much more understanding, but I don't get many hours as a result. I have to start paying rent sooner or later, and I can't do that if I'm getting 4 hours a week. \n\nThe last few days it's reached a new point. It's 3:18 AM while I write this. I've been up since 9:43PM, I woke up at 3:40 to ask my job if they needed me to come in, they didn't, and I remember sitting down next to my girl and then I woke up. I went to bed around 7:45AM yesterday. I took 15mg of adderall before I went to sleep, and set alarms so I would wake up after an hour, when the adderall was working. I woke up for 5 minutes and fell asleep again. \n\nThis has reached a point where I'm really at a loss for what to do. I can't keep sleeping this much, but I have no control over being able to wake up. \n\nAdderall helped in the beginning, but now I can't even wake up to take the pill. After 10 hours of sleep my girlfriend will wake me up, set an alarm for an hour and a half later, and make me take a 30mg XR , and I will wake up 6 hours after my alarm was set, with no recollection of her waking me up, and I'll think for a second and realize I don't feel like I'm on, or crashing, from 30mg. I then normally find the pill in my sheets. Apparently I take the pill in my hand, smush it against my lips, Palm it, sip water, and then go back to sleep so I don't have to wake up. \n\nMy adderall use is slowly turning into abuse. I'm down 6 pills for this month, I'm currently on doubled dosage. My sleep schedule has been morphing into \"binge on adderall and caffeine for 36 hours, sleep for 16, and then repeat the process\". I've gone into amphetamine psychosis 2 times from lack of sleep, I didn't even go over my prescribed dosage, and I would rather believe everyone is following me with the intention of killing me and my family, but be awake, than sleep for 10-16 hours. I feel like I'm wasting my entire life being asleep. \n\nDoes anyone have any ideas for what I can do to wake up? I've looked into 8 hour time release caffeine pills, modafinil, breaking up my sleep schedule into several naps, etc. I would be fine if I could just wake up in the morning to take an adderall or something, but no matter what happens, I don't. I'll be in physical pain, being pinched and slapped, and I'll stay asleep. \n\nSomeone who's been through this and can either give advice, support, or help, please please please contact me, you can reach me by messaging me on here, commenting on this post, or more easily; you can email me at chilliamyoung@gmail.com (put \"idiopathic hypersomnia\" in the subject), snapchat me @chilliamyoung, text me at (720) 345-9708, Facebook me at Facebook.com/bzbzbzbz, or type \"bzbzbzbz\" into Facebook messenger, my profile picture is currently a white kid with platinum hair smoking a cigarette with a blonde girl next to him. \n\nThank you so much, guys.

I have always been tired for as LONG as I can remember. In middle school and high school, my mom would wake me up for school and I wouldn't jump out of bed until she said \"let's go!\" and I would RUSH to get ready for school. I would fall asleep in classes, fall asleep during lunch, and fall asleep in study hall. As a young teen, i was naive and I never knew that sleep disorders existed and I thought what I was experiencing was normal. I thought EVERYONE went through this. I tried explaining the extent of my sleepiness to my mom, and I asked my mom to take me to the doctor to discuss ADD. I had friends with ADD and I could see similarities with them and my issues. \n\nMy primary doctor was on medical leave, so I had seen a different doctor. He did not believe me at all. Honestly, I think he thought I just wanted to get adderall to sell. The physician agreed to do the test and it came back that I didn't have ADD. I asked why I was so tired all of the time, and he replied with, \"you're a teenager. Teens are always tired.\" So, I was led to believe that. \n\nIt got worse and worse. I would sleep 15 hours straight. I couldn't get myself to \"wake up\" even after sleeping for so long. Growing up, mental health was kind of a stigma in my household. (Later on in life I was diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder/depression). So, at the time, doctors ruled out depression and ADD. I was a bit overweight growing up, and I would always hear \"eat better and exercise, you won't be so sleepy!\" I was in cheerleading all throughout school, so I was definitely getting exercise. I ate pretty well, I just had an issue with over eating. So, eating well/exercise was ruled out. I was told to stop drinking caffeinated beverages. \"Your body will naturally wake up!\" So, I stopped. I felt even MORE tired after about 2 months without coffee/soda. I feel a little more awake when I drink coffee, but I could EASILY drink a full pot of coffee and go to sleep. \n\nI can easily sleep for 20 hours straight, without waking up to use the bathroom or anything. My boyfriend has known me for a long time (since before we started dating) and he mentioned it to me. He basically said its not normal for someone to be so sleepy all of the time. I work full time, and I would be late to work almost every single day because I can't wake up to my alarm. If there isn't someone there to wake me up, I will sleep through my alarms, phone calls, etc. There was a two day period where I was late to work by an hour and a half, both days. \nThe only feeling I truly feel is exhaustion, all of the time. \n\nI spoke to my doctor about this, and I basically had a meltdown in his office about it. He thought for sure I had narcolepsy. I do experience sleep paralysis/hallucinations/dreaming while falling asleep all of the time. I always thought that was normal, too! \n\nAnyway, it wasn't until recently that i was finally diagnosed with IH. I had my sleep study/MSLT done. I was told my 8 hour sleep was \"perfect\". The tech even said, \"I wish everyone slept like you!\" The results from my MSLT were completely different. I fell asleep for each of my naps in under 3 minutes. Not only that, I fell asleep for each nap into stage 2 sleep. The tech told me that it was \"incredible.\" She told me the diagnosis and I was stunned.\n\nWent to discuss my results with my primary doctor, and I was prescribed Modafinil. I was excited to get this under control. Well, my insurance didn't want to cover it, and it took 1 month for them to finally deny it. I didn't know what to do, so my doctor (I've had him since I was about 8 years old) \"diagnosed\" me with ADD so I could get Vyvanse to help it. He basically told me, \"you will never get any medication for this if the insurance company knows you have IH. I feel bad for telling these lies but I know you need this.\"\nOur \"end goal\" is for me to get a modafinil prescription, but we have to try vyvanse/adderall first. It's a long, exhausting process. \n\nI love when I confide in people about my condition, and they respond with, \"wow, that sounds like I have that.\" When I explain the EXTENT of how bad my sleepiness is, I hear \"you should sleep less\" or \"have you tried drinking coffee?\" So irritating! \n\nANYWAY...if you read all of that, I am sorry.

Obviously the depression part of bipolar plays a huge role as well. I've actually been doing much better recently, but these are still considerations.\n\nMy struggle to stay awake, especially when I'm trying to work (write/research), is unforgiving. I used to take up to six long naps a day, but lately I've been able to reduce those to one or two short naps (none if I up my caffeine intake a lot). I'm trying to cut out napping completely as it messes with my bipolar/anxiety. I've tried Xyrem, Adderal, Welbutrin, and Provigil, but they all had serious side effects and my doctors and I pretty much opted to abandon the medication route. Does anyone have any advice for how to push through and stay awake instead of giving in to sleep every time it tempts you? I'd really appreciate any advice on staying awake through the day like a normal human adult.\n\nRecently, I've been drinking a Monster energy drink a day to get work done and while it definitely keeps me awake and alert while writing, it obviously is not a good thing to rely on for extended periods (specifically because of my bipolar disorder).

I also have ADD and ADHD. I'm currently 23 and have moved to a western European country where getting any kind of treatment Ritalin/modafinil/nuvigil/you-name-it is fucking hell. I gave them all of the test results for the sleep studies that I did in the states and my diagnosis for ADD/ADHD. Instead of giving me the treatment that I need to live a somewhat normal life they have denied me any such treatment until i do ANOTHER sleep study. i'm in grad school here and looking for a full time job to pay my bills/survive while dealing with heavy depression (yeah, i cry every day) / long story short my life is pretty much crumbling in front of me as i wait for this sleep study. they scheduled my sleep study for JUNE 2016. So...I'm desperate. I go to see a psychiatrist and tell him what i'm going through. he says that despite being the #1 rated psychiatrist in the city (okay he didn't say that, but YELP reviews told me so) with a medical degree and all the years of med school you'd expect he does not have the authority to prescribe such medications (Bienvenue en France). huge joke right??? but he's serious. \n\nso he prescribes me Venlafaxine. I'm pretty good with pharmacology/knowledge of the generic names of meds i've tried. this one doesn't ring a bell so I'm like cool, I'll try it...i'll try anything to improve my quality of life at this point. thanks to google I found out that Venlafaxine = Effexor. I had never tried it before, but knowing it's a SNRI i thought it would promote wakefulness/give me energy. WRONG it made me sleepier than I have ever been in my life, gave me RLS during the night/early morning and insomnia when I was actually trying to sleep. it was awful. I stopped taking it. \n\nhere's the good news. someone canceled their sleep study appointment on the 22nd of March, so they offered me the spot. I'm taking it. the problem is I'm still experiencing weird Effexor insomnia during the night but sleepiness during the day + my level of anxiety (panic attacks, butterflies in my stomach, you name it) is so high that it literally impedes my ability to sleep. I'm so fucking anxious and have so many problems (of all sorts) that it makes it hard for me to fall asleep. I'm scared out of my mind that I will finally go to my sleep study and panic, not be able to sleep (because of my anxiety) that they will write me off as not having IH. \n\nI have spent the last 4+ months without my medication and it is awful...if you have IH then you know what I mean. \n\nThe medication for IH/ADD/ADHD here is SO controlled that IMHO the doctors are looking for any reason not to prescribe them to me and I can not let that happen.\n\nSo...what if I stay up all night the night before and I show up at the hospital for my appointment at 4 pm without having slept for at least 24 hrs. How will that change my sleep test? will they know? \n\n\n\nUPDATE:\nI did (attempt) to deprive myself of sleep for a solid 24hrs. As I am sure you may have guessed...I...did not...succeed. Afterall, I do have a sleeping disorder lol. I, however, did do pretty well. I got through until about midnight - 2am (I don't remember) at which point I permitted myself a 4-5 hour nap (again, I don't remember...does IH affect memory...my memory SUCKS). I woke up in the morning took a shower and then went to the hospital for my sleep study as scheduled at 4pm. Fucking early IMO, but hey, they're French. They were horribly organized. And my room sucked. In the U.S. I had a NICE bedroom that looked more like a hotel room than a room in a clinic and it was just a generally nice relaxing experience. \n\nThis was different. I came prepared. Suitcase packed. And a USB stick in hand with my digital medical chart on it from the U.S. ready to give to the doctor so they would have ADDITIONAL proof of my IH, ADD, ADHD, depression, anxiety and just a general SINCERE need for their help. ~~They didn't give two fucks.~~ No fucks were given. NONE. I asked the first guy who showed me my room (that smelled like pee), his response was \"no...sorry I don't deal with that...ummm you gotta wait for the doctor...idk when she'll be here.\" I made it a point to offer this USB stick to every doctor/medical person that I came in contact with and no one gave any fucks about it. It was so disappointing.\n\n1st disappointment: They didn't seem to fucking know what they were doing. And I'd like to mention here that this is one of the 2 or 3 National Reference Centers for Rare Sleep Conditions (Narcolepsy / IH / Klein-Levin). Why did they have me come so early? They just had me sit in my room, bored out of my mind for two hours, with no free wifi. yes, the wifi cost money. luckily i called the 1800 number (so to speak) and the guy was super nice, showed mercy on me and gave me a free pass for my hospital stay. when they finally called me out to connect me to all the wires/nodes i again attempted to give the USB to them...Nope. Okay cool. Whatever. During the wire/node installing they put a scrunchie/sleeve of basically fishnet stockings around my neck...i'm like wtf is that about. **They pull it up over my head and tear holes through it for my eyes, mouth, nose, and ears.** I'm serious.\n\n2nd disappointment: Waiting in my room. Wires attached to my head, chin, whatever, everywhere and feeling like a mummy with this thing around my head. Lady nurse comes in and asks me what time I want to go to bed at. I just kind of looked at her for a second trying to figure out her angle...was this a test? why is she asking me when i want to go to bed? don't they already have this shit figured out? she's serious. my reponse: \"i'm actually pretty tired already so i'm ready when you are.\" her: \"yeah...the guy in the other room already said he wants to go to bed so you'll have to wait your turn...\" -Idk...i've been living in france for a while now and will soon be a citizen, but goddamn they know how to be rude and make you feel like a little piece of nothing.- i waited and waited and it was finally my turn.\n\n3rd disappointment: after a not so quality night of sleep i am woken up at 7am. little did i know i was about to have one of the worst days in recent memory. i'm hungry. i'm big on breakfast...so i wait. dude comes in my room. obvi med student/not a real doctor. instead of bringing me breakfast he rolls in a cart with a shitty laptop and a machine. he has me lie completely flat on my back, elevates my arms from the elbow up at like 45 degrees. puts a blood pressure sleeve around my right arm and tiny blood pressure cone things around my index fingers (never seen those before). he inflates the blood pressure thing and inflates the finger blood pressure things. i realize this is taking a while and i start to loose feeling in my right arm. so i ask him if that's normal. his response: \"yeah, that's totally normal. what we're doing is cutting off circulation to that part of your body. we're going to leave you like that for five minutes. and then we'll deflate everything and see how your heart reacts...that'll give us an idea of how strong your heart is.\" In my mind:that's nice of you to care about the heart of my health, but i'm hungry...and this hurts. he continues with his stuff. then he leaves. i'm waiting for my brekky. i'm thinking croissant and some cheese minimum...idk i'm pretty desperate so i'll take whatever. another person comes into my room. NOT bringing me my food. and hands my a huge pad (2cm thick). It's a questionnaire covering like every topic: sleeping habits, sex habits, add symptoms, eating habits. EVERYTHING. Apparently I need to complete this before I leave at the end of the day. Coool...Where's my food? they finally bring my food in. **so disappointing** my breakfast consists of a rock hard dinner roll a knife, a thing of butter and a thing of apricot jam. no juice? no cheese? just bread (wouldn't really call this bread...certainly not on french standards). *mais ils sont serieux? rien a boire? franchement c'est n'importe quoi.* fuck. so i'm sitting there and...\n\n4th disappointment: I've barely had the time to enjoy my shitty hard dinner roll as mean guy from the night before rolls in and is like \"breakfast time is done, you're late for your first nap!\" WHAT? I'm hungry. I haven't finished my \"breakfast\" and I'm still digesting it. and if i'm late it's your fault/the fault of those people you let come in my room and bother me while i could have been eating. i begrudgingly let go of my dinner roll...thirsty and defeated he hooks me up by literally attaching my wires to a port in the wall...i've got less than 12 inches of wiggle room here. like a dog on a very tight leash. he closes the shutters. [like these, except they make the room 100% black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D59J4kacDQw) perhaps the one redeeming quality of this place. and then shuts both the doors to my room. i'm uncomfortable. sleepy. anxious. *and then it starts* i hear the shutters in the other room going up. then down. then the hospital bed starts going too. i can hear the people walking in the hallway. there's so much noise. idk how long it took me to fall asleep. because they still haven't given me the results. but that's another disappointment i'll talk about later.\n\n5th disappointment: they wake me up and it's like deja vu. more people filter into my room to ask me questions and make me do tests. the first question is always my height and weight (in meters and in kg). I don't know my height and weight in meters and kg...i've got a rough idea but my mind works in inches/feet and pounds. **BUT** they measured both before they put the wires on me...this place has no line of communication because i am asked these same two questions at least 5 times that day.\n\n6th disappointment: the bothering me between naps and people asking me the same questions continue throughout the day and they also rob me of my lunch time as well. skip to my last nap: the lady closes the shutters and then leaves the room. but she forgets to close one of the two doors. so that noise problem that I've been experiencing is twice as annoying. the guy in the other room must be waking up from his nap because i hear his shutters and his bed...fuck.\n\n7th disappointment: today is April 7th. 16 days after my exam. i still have not received the a copy of my results. however i get a voicemail from the doctor saying they had a \"meeting\" about me and they decided that they would like to propose me a treatment that i've never tried before and has virutally no side effects. that sounds weird. how does she know i've never tried it before? and all things have side effects. (let me mention here that when i met her in person she said to me \"i looked over your chart and you've tried a lot of different medications for your IH. I see that you noted that Dexedrine was the most effective....but have you every tried GHB??\" I know GHB is sometimes used for narcolepsy but that's not what i have. So as i'm relistening to her vmail i'm telling myself that this lady is going to put me on GHB, instead of the medication that works best for me. GHB is also contraindicated for benzodiazepines (for example the Klonopin that I take for anxiety) and the combination of the two may very well lead to death. so this lady is probably also going to prevent me from getting any more Klonopin. I really start to dislike this lady. I should also mention here that I had my doctor from the U.S. who has been my doctor since I was ten, email the hospital explaining who she was and her extensive understanding of my medical file, that i'm diagnosed with these things, and that i've tried these treatments. at the end of the letter she very politely says \"it is my medical opinion that the most effective treatment would be 40mg Dexedrine per day and 1- 2 mg Klonopin per day, as needed, and that (my name) continues to see a doctor regularly.\n\n 8th disappointment: \nTurns out i'm not even getting GHB. NOT EVEN. I'm getting this new medication called \"Pitolisant.\" It's a newly approved treatment not yet available for prescription by regular doctors, you have to have it prescribed by a hospital. It is a histamine (H3) inverse agonist/antagonist. Basically...you know how Benedryl/Dramamine makes you sleepy? This is supposed to do the opposite by creating extra histamine in your brain. I'm yet again disappointed. The internet provides very little information about this medication and I'm just not really looking forward to trying a new medication when i already spent most of my life doing that and finally found the one for me.\n\n 9th disappointment:\nSo this medication i'm supposed to be getting isn't just available in a pharmacy. the hospital has to file paperwork and mail it to someplace....and wait for it to get approved. and then if/when it gets approved they'll call me and then give me a further time frame in which i can expect to get this medication. soo...like 3 weeks from now maybe? *maybe*. as i'm on the phone with the lady doctor, she tells me, pretty much exactly what i was waiting for \"so...i see here on your chart that you take Klonopin...benzodiazepines can increase sleepiness so you're going to have to stop taking that...yeah...and since we don't want any interactions or anything, i contacted your psychiatrist and told him not to prescribe you anything at all either\" i'm pretty upset, but i saw this coming. so i very calmly reply to her \"yes, i understand that benzodiazepines may increase sleepiness...many doctors have told me so. that is why i, of my own accord, decided not to take any leading up to my sleep test so as not to screw up the results. also, my previous sleep doctor expressed his concerns about the potential increase in sleepiness that could cause so he had me stop taking it for over a month...that didn't help, i just had a lot more anxiety and a much lower quality of life. i know we spoke about this already, but I do suffer from ADD and ADHD which are very problematic right now since I'm enrolled in grad school and i have my exams pretty soon...i can't concentrate in school or anything for that matter. so that's part of the reason i was hoping to get dexedrine.

WHAT? they can't be serious. but they are. \n\nSo i'm waiting for this miracle drug. i'll give it a fair shot...of maybe a week or two..depending on the efficacity and side effects. if it really does make my life better and work better then Dexedrine, then cool. if not i'm asking for dexedrine. \n\nAlso, I can't help feeling like a lab rat.

I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia about a year ago at 24yo. I was sleeping 12-20h every day and barely functioning for what little of the day I was awake. I was forced to quit my job, because of how I felt, but not before I tried quitting all my hobbies and self-care routines and got a shit-ton worse first.\n\nI tried a bunch of meds: dexedrine is good, Vyvanse is better, modafinil made me feel awake but slow, Wellbutrin resulted in me fainting 8 times in one week, clarithromycin gave me intense abdominal pain and nausea, flumazenil isn't available to me, abilify and lamotrigine had no clear benefits, trazadone made me sleep but left me feeling super weird all the time...\n\nWith IH basically heading towards SUCKS TO SUCK, I wrote down everything I could think of about myself that could potentially be a symptom and handed the three-page list to my GP. (I had primarily been working with my psychiatrist chasing down a sleep disorder.) She took her time reading it all and then said, \"That's a lot of symptoms. Have you considered fibromyalgia?\" I honestly hadn't, because even working in medical research, the only information I had about fibromyalgia was my brain going, \"Isn't that fake?\" (Oh, hi, ingrained sexism and ableism.)\n\nThe more I looked into it, the more it seemed to fit. Neuropathic pain is weird shit: crawly, itchy, tingly, burning, achy, stiff, with every muscle feeling super tight, even though my physiotherapist assures me that there isn't a single muscle on my body that could be considered tight. The drunk/hungover/high/out of it/floaty/depersonalized/weird weird feeling I have a lot of the time is actually dizziness. Fibro basically involves feeling like you have the flu, but like all the time. My doctor put me on duloxetine/cymbalta, and it quickly cut my sleep down to 10h/night, but I actually feel awake during the day.\n\nEven with the vast array of symptoms included in fibromyalgia, though, I still have symptoms it doesn't necessarily account for. I recently saw a sleep specialist (for my referral about a year ago), who suggested that it's dysautonomia and that I look into Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS).\n\nDysautonomia is a huge umbrella term that means the autonomic nervous system isn't functioning properly; fibromyalgia and POTS both fall under this umbrella. Since the autonomic nervous system is in charge of everything you don't have to think about (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, digestion, reproductive functions, hunger/satiation, sleep/wake, etc), there's an infinite number of manifestations. It's a messy area diagnostically, and I think right now, diagnosis plays a role in validating the conditions and grouping people with similar symptom presentations together as these conditions become better characterized.\n\nPOTS is the most clear-cut condition for diagnosis: You lay down on a table that is able to tilt from 180 degrees to 90. If your heart rate increases by more than 30 bpm when the table is tilted, then it's POTS. I've seen it kind of used as an add-on, where some people attribute all their symptoms to POTS, but others consider themselves to have fibro with POTS. Since I have so many symptoms, I consider myself to have dysautonomia with POTS being a big part of that.\n\nSince this diagnosis, I got myself a chest strap heart-rate monitor (the Polar H10; it even works while swimming!) and have been using it with my physiotherapist. It has been so incredibly validating to see that my heart is legitimately working hard af during activities that drain me. Finally, this is something my health-care providers don't have to just take my word on. It also opens the door to biofeedback training, where I can work directly on protecting and caring for my heart. \n\nI'm still exhausted a lot of the time. Sometimes I'm still too tired to leave my apartment for a week or more. The best treatment for dysautonomia/fibro/POTS is exercise, but the key is to work out enough to work harder next week, but not so much that I'm tired at all. The heart rate monitor and keeping to activities where I can keep my heart rate around 100 bpm or lower helps a lot when I manage to stick to it. Overall, my quality of life has much improved, and I have faith that it will continue to do so at least to a point. \n\nTL;DR because that got rambly: If you've been diagnosed with IH, also check into dysautonomia, fibromyalgia, and/or POTS syndrome for alternative diagnoses and treatment options.

Took my first 200mg yesterday. I'm not super sleepy and am able to focus more. It's a much more subtle effect than I was expecting but in a really good way. Crashed a bit in the afternoon and had a mild headache, but it was still an insane improvement over a normal day. 10/10 would take again. I'm not looking forward to building a tolerance, but eh. \n\nOne of the side effects my doctor warned me of was irritability. This made my ears perk up because I am naturally a little anxious at times and definitely irritable (I hate it). Anyway, I took the Modafinil this morning and about an hour later I could feel myself being a little more flustered at normal work shit. (Emails were pissing me off more than they should) So I took my Prozac and an hour or later I wasn't as pissy. Seems like a win.\n\nMy question is this: **Does anyone here have experience taking both Modafinil and Prozac at the same time and are there any adverse effects that I should be aware of?** I've been bitten in the ass before by the \"this is a well-tolerated drug\" schpeal. (Case in point, Amitriptyline made me gain 20lbs in 6 months and it was a bitch to lose. No doctors warned me about that and it was not on most side effect lists).\n\nHere's some more background info to help with any advice:\n\nI'm on some other meds for a few autoimmune disorders (I hit the genetic lottery, yay) that I'm not worried about interactions with (hydroxychloroquine, cevimeline, naproxen as needed).\n\nI was taking Fluoxetine (Prozac) for a while but had to taper off and stop to complete the sleep studies. I was originally prescribed Prozac to help with my excessive daytime fatigue, and while it ultimately did not help much with that, I found that it did improve my mood a lot. I was much more depressive/irritable/anxious before I was on it, and I'm sure the sleepiness exacerbated it.\n\nBoth doctors (sleep and rheumatologist) only ordered me to stop Prozac for the sleep studies and I still have my prescription so I think I'm to continue. I really would like to, because of the mood-enhancing effects. Just want to be aware of possible issues.\n\n**Tl;dr: Modafinil &amp; Prozac, yay or nay?**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 473, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Modafinil &amp; Prozac, yay or nay?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/8ih1c6/modafinil_prozac_yay_or_nay/"}, {"author": "chrisdamon900", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525731465, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/8hrjkb/service_dog/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8hrjkb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/8hrjkb/service_dog/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1525731466, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 4, "selftext": "Anyone here use a service dog?

I'm new here and looking for a bit of advice. I was diagnosed by a sleep specialist with IH about a year ago, but because of my history of PTSD/Panic Attacks my shrink should try her hand at medicating the IH since amphetamine based stimulants are 100&amp;#37; off the table. \\(I used to take those for ADHD, and they turned me into a neurotic mess.\\) Well... insurance told me I can't have Provigil because I'm not narcoleptic and they only give it to narcoleptics... because they suck. So my doc started me on Welbutrin instead. For the past, like 9 months that's been helping a LOT, but over the past 3 or 4 weeks it's stopped working so well... so I went to the doc. She says I'm on as much Welbutrin as she's willing to give me, so she wants to cut my Citalopram by 25&amp;#37; because that can make people sleepy and so that's the most likely cause. \n\nThing is... I don't think that's it. Part of why I was diagnosed with IH without taking me off the SSRI to test is that I've had these symptoms since BEFORE I was on the SSRI. I'm sure what's going to happen is that I'm going to stay intolerably sleepy, and risk the return of panic symptoms. I understand why she wants to try this experiment and that she's not going to try anything else until this proves that it's not the freakin SSRI, since yeah, they do make people sleepy as hell... but I don't know that I can afford the fallout when/if cutting the SSRI brings back the panic attacks.\n\nSo that leaves me with lifestyle changes or something, but I'm not sure if there even ARE any for IH, besides sleep hygiene, which I have pretty much buttoned up... except for the whole... falling asleep places other than my bed when I don't mean to thing. But I always go to bed at a reasonable time and get up at a regular time for work. Always. \n\nI mean at this point I'm willing to try Yoga if that's actually going to do anything.\n\nHalp?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 467, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "IH and SSRIs", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/8glamw/ih_and_ssris/"}, {"author": "Flask000", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525076121, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/8fxxec/new_drug_in_development/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8fxxec", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/8fxxec/new_drug_in_development/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1525076121, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 15, "selftext": "Many of us may be familiar with the GABA-receptor related research in which patients with IH improved while using flumazenil. \n\nThere's now a new drug in development, which is actually in early clinical trials for IH and hepatic encephalopathy, called GR3027. https://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800049924\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=GR3027\n\nFor those of us who are struggling, there is hope!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 461, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New drug in development", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/8fxxec/new_drug_in_development/"}, {"author": "JonPickett", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1524967308, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/8fog54/new_ihnarcolepsy_discord_server/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8fog54", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/8fog54/new_ihnarcolepsy_discord_server/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "gLv1hXC5H-dOZA2ETOOv1wDrTJS5cy2707t3DYxxt1U", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=b7478eb15ca7ed4f57ec4d7093739857", "width": 108}, {"height": 113, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=1eb15d59ec7967b25edf802403b0dea7", "width": 216}, {"height": 168, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=4372f65541a8f53c9a4118d3d0511dc4", "width": 320}, {"height": 336, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=38d22196d27e237736d3721ea60086f1", "width": 640}, {"height": 504, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=19165d61d0ca08a2ca287dbb414dbdd5", "width": 960}, {"height": 567, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=d4fa3e8c582513f7fb024ecd5ce9661b", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 630, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/c3S7qEINI4k1VcLmEgu9UCZkbOCH--V1YCM-Qh3AKBg.jpg?s=03715738a25019fd1f89cc5cc06eff52", "width": 1200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1524970914, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 5, "selftext": "Greetings people of the IH and Narcolepsy community!

Im really struggling day-to-day and its at the point where I NEED something else. I don't think I can possibly get my dosage any higher (I have 6 x 5mg pills before a 5 hour shift, if I'm working 6-8 hours I will have another 6 pills halfway through. My specialist does't know this, she only knows about the previous dosage of 4 pills when needed). \n\nI was originally prescribed dex because of the price. I was 18 when I started and I will be turning 20 on Saturday so I'm on the younger end compared to a lot of patients that I have come across therefore I don't have as much income (especially because I'm single) and there is no chance of financial help from my parents. In Australia medications on a private prescription aren't cheap and I don't qualify for PBS/Concession pricing because my average sleep latency isn't low enough. My sleep specialist was really interested in me trying Nuvigil (she was going to give me a sample pack for free but I would have lost my dexamphetamine prescription since they are both Schedule 8/Controlled substances and it was too much of a risk if it didn't work and I didn't have the dex to fall back on).\n\nDexamphetamine 5mg x 100 tablets = $11.80\nNuvigil/Armodafinil 250mg x 30 tablets = $261 \nModafinil 100mg x 60 tablets = $149.40\n\nNow from my research, I have found that Nuvigil and Modafinil both decrease the effectiveness of birth control. I have endometriosis (not surgically diagnosed but my endo specialist is pretty certain) and use birth control to control the symptoms. I recently went off birth control for a while (the brand I had really wasn't working and I sort of gave up) and the pain was sometimes that severe that I can barely stand. I have recently been moved to a different pill (microgynon 50) and it seems to be working *ok* (still not perfect). I have cramps for the 3 weeks when I don't have my period but they are manageable and my actual period is a lot lighter. Basically, I NEED this birth control to be working properly. I have been on 5+ different birth control pills and even more altered dosages since I was 12 to try control the pain, and I have finally found something that helps and I really don't need it to stop now therefore both Nuvigil/Modafinil aren't really an option. At this point, as dramatic as it sounds I would rather be tired than have my endo pain back.\n\nI was looking at Adderall but I'm presuming since I have already built a tolerance to amphetamine sulphate it probably won't do much since it contains amphetamine sulphate. I don't know if thats the way things work but I'm presuming it is. Also I can't seem to find any pricing information about Adderall in Australia even though I'm sure we have it.\n\nThat leaves Ritalin but that also happens to be a Schedule 8/Controlled substance here in Australia meaning that if I go that route, I lose my dexamphetamine prescription and I have nothing to fall back on. I have heard mixed opinions on Ritalin, some love it but some hate it. Has anyone got any experiences with Ritalin? Does it work as well as dexamphetamine? \n\nAre there any other options at this point medication wise? I'm just struggling so much with my tiredness levels but I'm struggling even more with finding something that doesn't effect my birth control. Im planning on making an appointment with my specialist but I want to be prepared with as much knowledge as possible medication wise (mainly so I can work out prices so she isn't prescribing me something that isn't in my price range). \n\nSorry if this is long and doesn't make sense. Basically as a TL;DR is that I have built a tolerance to dexamphetamine and I need something else. My specialist said Nuvigil is very promising but both Nuvigil and Modafinil both stop birth control from being effective and I am currently treating my (sometimes debilitating) endometriosis with birth control. I have finally found one that works after 7-8 years and a lot of different doses/brands. Considering Ritalin but I would lose my dexamphetamine prescription and I have heard very mixed opinions on Ritalin, especially people who have already built tolerance to dex.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 449, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Medication options that don't interfere with birth control?

He (finally!) has an appointment with a sleep doctor scheduled, but it's not until three months from now. (He plans to call every few days to see if an earlier spot opens up). But his symptoms reflect idiopathic hypersomnia or an otherwise similar condition. Maybe narcolepsy w/o cataplexy? We're still not sure what the particular difference is. (Do they have similar biological causes? Are they treated with the same meds?)\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nFeel free to skip this. I wrote it out since some of you might be interested, find it useful for context, and/or maybe even have insight since he hasn't been formally diagnosed yet.\n\nWe're both college students, and have been together for over two years. As our relationship progressed, we had our ups and downs (and mostly resolved them) but one trend still blatantly remains: He has gotten progressively more and more tired since we've first been dating. \n\nHe says his first sleep disorder symptoms began in high school (at the time, he did not suspect a sleep disorder). Early in our relationship he occasionally had days where he'd feel \"off\" and at the time he assumed it was possibly some sort of minor adrenal gland disorder, and he'd sometimes take vitamin supplements for it. He always had a relatively early bedtime for a college student, like 10-11:30 pm. (I didn't even realize how unusual this was until my mother commented on it, I brought it up so casually and she said that someone so young shouldn't feel the need to go to bed before 12 every night. On the other hand, he typically wakes up around 7, and when I needed to wake up around then I found myself falling asleep most nights by like 11 despite typically being a night owl myself.) Each semester he gradually became more and more tired. He'd have more \"off\" days (or at least parts of days here and there). He would plan less activities and/or plan things that took less energy to pull off. Recently, he's even been \"sleeping in\" for the first time since I met him. He often ends up waking up around 8 or 9 now (unless he has a specific need to wake up earlier) despite still wanting to wake up around 7. Luckily he still manages to make it to classes and work most of the time, but he's had to take some days off due to being overwhelmed with exhaustion.\n\nIn the year before I met him, he did some road trips to places 6+ hours away with little issue. Now he complains at anything over an hour each way. In this past semester he's napped at least once a day almost every day. Etc. In short, he's gotten progressively worse. As this has been happening he's seen numerous doctors and ruled out cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, and endocrine (especially thryoid) issues. He also was tested (I believe twice) for sleep apnea and had that ruled out. Between that, and a lot of Google searches, we deduced that he may be narcoleptic.\n\nHe took the Epworth scale online and scored like a 21/24.\n\nHe's not on medications yet, but we hope that he'll be prescribed something once he's seen by the sleep doctor and further tested.\n\n**ACTUAL POST**\n\nIt's difficult being the girlfriend of someone with a sleep disorder. I try to be as supportive as possible, and I also have my own life outside of the relationship (friends, schoolwork, etc.) but recently our relationship has felt increasingly less fulfilling. It's an issue that virtually no one I know understands, not that I open up to many about it to begin with. But I don't personally know of anyone going through the same thing. The closest I know of are classmates with depression, I guess, because in a way dating someone with a sleep disorder is probably logistically similar to dating someone with depression. (In the sense that both would find it hard to get out of bed, go out and do things, and fully express emotion the way a \"typical\" person would.)\n\nWe try to bond with low-key activities, like playing video games, watching Netflix, card games (like Magic the Gathering), and reading books. On his worst days, I'm lucky if he has the energy for Netflix but he'll be too tired to even play a video game together, even if it's something that's slower paced. He almost always is able to schedule time to cook something, even if it's relatively simple (like pasta with some veggies) and he enjoys experimenting in the kitchen; other times I'm treating him to baked goods, breakfast, etc. But we could really use more ideas of things to do together! Especially given that he seems to be getting progressively worse right now. Obviously, we can't do anything when he's asleep, which is also taking up more of his time as he's been taking more/longer naps.\n\nI've told him numerous times that I've felt less connected to him recently. Over the past few months I've found myself telling him \"I miss you\" even though I see him every day, and eventually I realized it's because even though he's there, it doesn't always feel like he's *there* anymore. Some nights I'm left crying on his couch because he's too tired to do literally anything but sleep and I feel absolutely helpless. It pains me watching him go through this, simply because it sucks watching someone you love suffer so badly. It pains me even more on top of that, though, because it's causing us to feel less connected to each other. \n\nI'm a big talker (if you can't tell by the length of this post!) and he's had less energy to share his ideas with me. Sometimes he's too tired to even listen to me. Often he'll get so bad that he can't listen to *anyone* and he just tunes out the world with YouTube videos while he wraps up whatever he needs to get done. Yeah, I have friends I can talk to. But I want to talk *with my boyfriend* and be connected with *my boyfriend* and no one else can fulfill that desire *except for my boyfriend.*\n\nI'm big on words of appreciation (both giving and receiving). I often tell him things that I appreciate about him, and thank him for everything he does. (For those familiar with the 5 Love Languages, he's big on \"acts of service\" and often takes me along on his grocery runs, cooks us dinner, gives me rides if I need to run an errand, etc.) Historically he's tried his best to reciprocate this but increasingly found it difficult. It's only recently that we realized it's mostly due to him not having enough energy to think of thoughtful responses and write them out. This is especially clear when I think back through text messages he's sent me throughout our relationship and how they've gradually gotten shorter and shorter. Today I asked him if he had noticed something I surprised him with in his apartment like a week ago, because he never said anything about it. He was like, \"Oh I saw them and they were super cute, I appreciated them a lot\" and when I asked why he hadn't commented on it until now, he said \"it never came up.\" I told him that he could've *brought it up himself* and that it'd only take a minute of his time to do so. In response, he cited studies that suggest \"deviation from an activity costs you an addition 17 minutes of getting refocused.\"\n\nIn other words, he's so tired now that sometimes he can't even afford to let me know he appreciates the things I do for him.\n\nHow can I feel more connected with him again? Aside from doing things for him, which even though on some level they help me feel connected because I'm helping him out, it doesn't usually do much to spark romance. Especially when he finds it increasingly more difficult to show appreciation in the ways that most hit the nail on the head for me (words of affirmation and quality time).\n\nI try to do whatever I can for him. It's tricky, because I don't have a car and can't drive his (long story short, his family doesn't want *anyone* touching that wheel except for himself and his brother). But I wash his dishes whenever I can, I clean up around his apartment, I try to cook things (even though my skills aren't on his level yet; his specialty is \"real food\" and mine is \"anything with sugar and carbs in it\"). I don't know what else I can really do. I'm pretty sure I've asked before but if I did, he didn't really have any ideas, either. I'd offer to do his laundry, except I've usually been busy at the times he usually does his laundry (he usually does it once a week, and there's no real benefit to him doing it twice a week). I help him edit his papers, but it's not like I can actually do his homework for him. I can't go to work for him. I can't go to class for him. And as much as I wish I could, I can't wave a magic wand and cure all his problems. So, what more can I do?\n\nI'm *so sure* that we're spiritually connected to each other. When he had enough energy to actually run around and do things, and we always had so much fun together. When he has enough energy to actually talk, we can throw around such great ideas and our discussions can get pretty deep. When I first met him, we had once talked for over six hours straight almost until the sun came up and I've been dying to do that again. For what it's worth, I'd give anything to talk for even an hour straight at this point. I'm nearly crying writing this out because I miss him so much. I really, really do. I've been left with nearly an empty shell most of the time, but I know that the boy I knew and loved is still somewhere in there, and the day he comes back out again will be the best day I've had in the longest time.\n\n**Tl;dr:** I just want ideas of ways we can bond more, and ways that I can be more supportive of him as he goes through all of this. Also, advice for self-care, and for finding people who can understand what I'm/we're going through and give practical ideas (aside from this subreddit of course!).

It has become a joke between me and my work friends because I'm frequently asking them to repeat themselves and I ask them to just yell at me now so I know what they are saying. The other night at work I overheard 2 older co-workers teasing me about it and it made me sort of uncomfortable. I was counting the float and they raised their voice and said \"wow she really is going deaf, she needs to invest in hearing aids\" and I literally had no idea they were talking about me until they said that and it was only because they raised their voice, they were only 5 feet or so away from me and I didn't even realise. I know they were joking around so I didn't take it too seriously, but it just scared me that I literally had no idea they were even standing there let alone talking about me.\n\nI can hear noises ok, I'm actually pretty great with noises like the beeping of registers when I'm scanning things or the bell ringing at the back door at work for a delivery. I can hear my mum's car pulling up as she is arriving home, but voices and conversations is another story entirely. \n\nCould this be IH related? Has anyone else had an experience like this? I only ask because deafness/hearing problems don't run in my family (literally no one aside from my grandparents have problems and only since they have gotten older) so I'm trying to work out why this is happening. Im not really bothered my it, I wear glasses so hearing aids wouldn't be a problem for me but I guess I'm more curious to hear if others have had similar experiences and if IH could be behind it.\n\n(Im obviously planning on getting a hearing test but I haven't got an appointment to see my specialist so I won't be able to see her for a few months at least to ask her about it)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 443, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can IH cause hearing problems?

Work attendance reliably on time seems to get in way with my sales career with my IH symptoms of EDS &amp; Sleep Inertia and also the IH med side effects. I have a BA in Communications and have been in b2b sales the past decade. However sales doesn\u2019t seem to be a sustainable career path for me. I\u2019ve lost jobs and sales due to poor work attendance. I hate to make excuses for myself as some of it was just me not being as talented as others in sales. But some of it\u2019s due to my IH symptoms. I intend to change career paths. I quit my sales job a few months ago while getting pushed out due to poor work attendance. Since then I had my sleep studies and official IH diagnosis. I need to develop a new career path and am doing research over the next month or so to figure out what I can do sustainably for work. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t monster.com haha.

Everyday around 5pm I get very tired and a lot of pain on the back of my neck. Funny thing is, if I take a short nap (10-15 mins), my neck pain will be better and I won't be as tired - I used to have to take naps in my car at lunch to get through. I also toss and turn a lot at night and wake up feeling groggy, so I don't think I sleep well anyway. Maybe just napping is the solution? Hard to do with work and the rest of life.\n\nAnyway, I don't know what do to, and I just want to live without being tired all the time. Any advice or encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

I've read a lot about both of them, and I fit most of the symptoms, but I'm still not sure since I differ a bit. (I was tested for everything else: sleep apnea, thyroid, testosterone, iron deficiency, heart issues, narcolepsy, etc.)\n\nNon-24 is a circadian rhythm disorder that causes you to not be able to differentiate between night and day. Similar to IH, it's diagnosis of exclusion. Non-24 refers to the fact that your body's sleep/wake clock is longer than 24 hours, so if you live on your own body clock, your sleep/awake times will shift forward perpetually. So, you can fall asleep at 9pm one day, and 2 weeks later or so, you can be naturally falling asleep at 9am, and it will continue move forward until you've gone around the whole clock.\n\nMy problem is that my 24+ hour clock is caused by my need for more sleep. Circadian rhythm disorder sufferers still usually get an average amount of sleep each night. I'm a long sleeper though.\n\nOn average, I usually sleep anywhere between 11-14 hours each night. When I'm sleep deprived, I will sleep for longer. When I was in college and needed to conform to the 5-6 hours of sleep each night, I ended up sleeping 20+, 30+, and even 40+ hours after a few days of forcing myself onto that schedule. (I ended up missing most of my classes and failed a few classes after sleeping through exams).\n\nMy dilemma is that when I do get my needed sleep, I actually do feel refreshed - which is different than what I've read for other people with IH. For me, my IH symptom is that I need significantly more sleep than average. My excessive daytime sleepiness is only apparent when I do not get my needed sleep.\n\nIn order to work, go to school, or be in anyway a fully functional member of society though, I'm not allowed to get the sleep I need. Instead, I have to live off being sleep deprived, which obviously causes my day-to-day to resemble the excessive daytime sleepiness apparent in IH patients.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with these 2 disorders, my doctor originally prescribed 2 drugs: Ritalin and a sleep aid. Or as he liked to call them, uppers and downers.\n\nI tried them for a week, but I absolutely hated every second of it. I was not thinking clearly at all when I was on them and my body felt like it was crumbling from the inside. I felt like a completely different person cognitively...and not in a good way. My skin broke out, I was excreting tons of body oil, I had gastrointestinal issues, and I ended up developing a chest infection (which I attribute to my body's lowered immune system from sleep deprivation). Needless to say, I refused to take any more of them. My doctor got upset that I refused the \"treatment\" and said there was not much else he could do.\n\nI ended up self-treating myself with melatonin soon after. I took 0.3 mg (10x less than your standard 3 mg tablet you'll find in drug stores). This was not designed to treat the IH, but instead, it was designed to help me regulate my sleep/wake schedule for the non-24. \n\nIn some ways, it was successful. Instead of waiting for my body to naturally fall asleep, I could pop this pill and fall asleep within 2 hours more or less. It created some level of consistency to my sleep/wake schedule which I desperately craved.\n\nHowever, another problem arose. I sleep even longer when I take melatonin. Whereas before, I could get away with sleeping for 10 hours occasionally, on melatonin, I'm out cold every time for at least 12-14 hours. Even on my extremely small dosage of melatonin, it's enough to feel like I've been shot with a horse tranquilizer and the only way out is to sleep it off. I've read that IH patients are more sensitive to stimulants, depressants, sleep aids, and sedatives...which definitley fits my experience.\n\nSo nevertheless, despite melatonin helping somewhat.

This has been the case for years, but it\u2019s recently gotten much worse with at least one or two naps that consist of about one to three hours a day. And when I\u2019m awake, I\u2019m miserable.

Most ?\u2019s are less about how I am, how it\u2019s impacted me, how I cope, and more about what I could be doing wrong with my life to make me so exhausted. Needless to say, I\u2019m often at a loss of what to say because I only have my personal experiences to go on with my body.

I just want to understand and to be understood better by people who are just hearing about IH.\n\nSo I\u2019m asking\n\nIs it due to factors beyond my control or is it my own fault (diet, exercise, stress) or both?\n\nHave you been told to try holistic medicine instead of medication you believe works? (I\u2019m on modafinil and have found it to be a goddam godsend but have had to defend to multiple people)\n\nDo naps make it worse?

The exhaustion hasn't gone away\n\nI've been to two sleep doctors: The first one was horrible and not thorough enough. The second one I saw was more thorough: They found I had no sleep apnea (AHI = 6.2), no narcolepsy (normal REM and Non-REM sleep)\n\nHowever they found I had bradycardia and arrythmia while asleep (average pulse being 50 BPM, max pulse was 104 BPM) so I'm going to have to see a cardiologist and be examined with a 24-hour ECG\n\nMy average blood pressure when measured in the morning and in the evening is 120/50 and HR is 50 BPM\n\nI've already seen one cardiologist though, he did an ECG on me and he found nothing abnormal. However he didn't do a 24-hour ECG (Holter-ECG) on me so I'm going to have to be examined with that as well\n\nThis sleep doctor was also a psychiatrist so she had me take several neuropsychiatric tests. She found that according to the tests I had: anxiety, depression and this is the weirdest part: psychosis?! I told her that can't be since I know what's real and what's not, like, I'm not schizophrenic and stuff\n\nI've also had a brain MRI which came back completely clear\n\n\nWhat I have concluded is that she thinks the exhaustion is all in my head and that's why I'm in psychosis?! This is ridiculous. The depression and anxiety I can see and understand and agree on, however the psychosis component is just bullshit, sorry. Anyway even if I did have it (I am 100% convinced I don't), any antipsychotics would make my unbeliavable tiredness already worse and cause even more cognitive issues than what I already suffer from sadly so they're out out of questions. Also again I'm 100% convinced I've never-ever been in psychosis\n\nI've tried a lot of stimulants and what's weird is they don't work. Like, I can take 20 mg Ritalin ER for example and experience the arrythmia / palpitations, however I wouldn't experience any energy or the alleviation of brain fog. Every stimulant I'Ve tried so far has been like that: anxiety, arrythmia but no effects so no energy or motivation\n\nStimulants I've tried: up to 80 mg Vyvanse;  up to 40 mg Ritalin ER;  up to 400 mg theacrine;  up to 400 mg phenylpiracetam;  up to 400 mg modafinil;  up to 400 mg armodafinil\n\nMy sleep is 100% non-restorative. Naps are non-refreshing, nighttime sleep is long and non-refreshing as well. Severe brain fog. No motivation. I sleep more than 10 hours a day and still experience unbelievable tiredness and brainfog\n\nEven though on paper my sleep is just fine, but you see, I've never felt energy for the past 8 years, I feel as if I'm merely dragging through life and my university \"career\" is a failure as well.

When I take my adderall, I feel awesome (for the 4ish hours until it wears off). However, I still sometimes think that there HAS to be some underlying cause/reason. \n\nAnyone else in my boat?

I was just diagnosed with IH a few weeks ago after getting a night time sleep test and an MSLT earlier this year. It's been the reason for me being late to many events, work, and classes (which I got in trouble for a few times this past year, hence the recent testing). My excessive sleeping/terrible sleep inertia was always written off as just laziness, and the general grogginess I always blamed on lack of sleep. Though, in hind-sight having to prescribe myself with anywhere from 200-400mg of caffeine every day isn't really normal, and I've had suspicions about sleep disorders in the past because I knew my inability to wake up wasn't my fault.

This is something that I have spent years training for and it's the only career that I've known. I'm trying to convince to doctors that it's just due to lack of sleep and can be solved with some lifestyle adjustments, though I'm realizing more and more that it's not that simple and something much bigger than that.

I have a sleep onset of 5.5 minutes, and am a long sleeper (12+ hours/day).  Daytime sleepiness is pretty well under control.  Far and away, my biggest struggle is combating sleep inertia.  I am on 20mg Adderall XR and 20mg Adderall IR which I take in the morning before I even wake up via roommate shoving it down my throat.  I've also tried Ritalin and combinations of Ritalin and Adderrall, and the next step is clarithromycin and then Xyrem.  I've tried light therapy, all the alarm clocks (Sonic Bomb, Clocky, etc.), and my roommate spends probably at least an hour trying to wake me up each morning.  \n\n\u00a0\n\nEven with all of this, it's still so hard for me to wake up that I'm always late to my internship.  The urge to go back to sleep is so strong that I become very behaviorally difficult - I will try to refuse meds, convince roommate I don't have to go in, etc.  He is hip to all of this but sometimes gets exhausted (who wouldn't?) and lets me sleep a little longer.  When I become fully awake and realize I'm running late, I feel frustrated and mystified by my earlier behavior because it completely contradicts my #1 goal of being successful at (or at least not getting kicked out of) grad school.  But, this is not primarily a behavioral problem; first and foremost I have a sleep disorder, with behavioral issues stemming from that.  Even as I am being behaviorally difficult, I will be unable to keep my eyes open or speak coherently.  This is not an issue of me being unhappy with or trying to avoid work.  Work - this work, in particular - is extremely important to me, and pretty much my greatest and arguably my only source of meaning and purpose in life.  So if it turns out I can't do this, honestly I don't know what will become of me.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnyway, all of this has come to a head: despite my best efforts and their attempts to offer 'reasonable accommodations,' I am being forced to leave my internship.  I wasn't fired, exactly, but I was given an ultimatum: either commit to being on time all the time, or move onto another placement.  Obviously, I couldn't commit to that; if I did, I'd be setting myself up for failure because I'm already doing my best.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen I worked full-time prior to grad school and prior to diagnosis and treatment, I had these same problems but was able to go under the radar of my supervisor as most/all my work was outside the office.  I also took naps in my car.  But I felt really gross about it and knew it'd catch up with me eventually.  That was actually one of the main reasons I decided to go to grad school - I thought I'd have more flexibility and be able to schedule things later in the day.  And for the most part that's been true, except in the case of the unpaid field work I am required to do to graduate, for which no formal disability protections or accommodations are available.  The 'accommodation' I was offered at my last placement was a 10am (vs. 9am) start-time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTL;DR: Idiopathic hypersomnia is ruining my life and seriously making me question whether I'm going to be able to work, but I'm not ready to give up yet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI guess I'm just looking for support from people who know the struggle, especially re: sleep inertia.  I'd be interested to hear others' stories of failure and success, and what has helped you overcome or learn to cope with your limitations.  Is there a medication regimen you've seen success with in a way that's sustainable?  In the very beginning, Adderall IR worked wonders for me even in small (5-10mg) doses.  Now, only a year later, I feel it does very little even at higher doses.  What kind of accommodations have you worked out with your employer?  Are there certain shifts that work better for you?  Have you been forced to change careers since being diagnosed?  I can work independently and set my own hours once I get licensed in my field, but to do that I need to hold it down at a full-time job for another two years.

I was/am lucky enough to be working with an amazing sleep doctor who is truly an angel: she uses an online portal that allows me to be in contact with her pretty much 24/7, she explains everything - meds, symptoms, side effects - in great detail and always makes sure I'm comfortable with what we're doing and what our plans are. Even my GP is a godsend and immediately referred me to my sleep doc when I described my symptoms without making me fight for a referral or jump through hoops. My boyfriend has also been incredibly supportive, helping me remember my medications, helping me get to bed on time and wake up in the mornings. Since December I've been figuring out my long-term treatment plan with these people, little by little, and have come to accept that this condition is a part of me, like it or not. But I'm starting to get really tired of being medicated and being 'sick'.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm currently taking 20mg of Adderall in the mornings and 10mg four and eight hours later to get through the day. I also take 25mg Zoloft to treat the anxiety I get when I come down off the Adderall. At night I take 1mg of Clonazepam which only sort of works. This system is fine I guess, but as I mentioned above, I'm just starting to get really tired of being medicated and taking so many pills every day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI started with Nuvigil but that immediately made me sick, so we switched to Ritalin ER, which didn't work, and then regular Ritalin, which also made me sick, until we landed on the Adderall. For nighttime, we started with Ambien, and then 0.5mg Clonazepam, and then adding 1mg Melatonin to that, and then taking the Melatonin away, and now we're up to 1mg Clonazepam, and I'm still not done with this obnoxious \"guinea pig phase,\" as my sleep doc puts it. Over 4 months after diagnosis I am still not on a long-term treatment plan, and I'm about ready to throw in the towel. I'm ready to quit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI can't be the only one who's sick of being medicated and seeing a doctor every month and being a guinea pig. The Adderall and Clonazepam don't make me ill, but they don't make me feel good either; since I don't have ADHD, the Addy actually makes it harder for me to focus, and it's killed my appetite (I've lost 20 pounds since my diagnosis and am losing an average of 1.5 pounds/week). The Clonazepam wears off before I wake up and leaves the last 2-3 hours of sleep I get pretty garbage.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOverall I just feel... medicated, I feel like a robot, and it sucks to know that I'm only awake because of some drug in my system. I'm tired of fighting my body and forcing myself to be like everyone else when I'm just not. I don't like the way it feels to be on all these medications, and I hate the idea of being on them for the next 30 years... I don't know what to do. I can't function as an adult without all these medicines (like most of you, I could never hold down a 9-5 job when I can't stay awake for more than 2 hours), but I don't want to live the rest of my life fighting with my own body.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI didn't mean for the post to ramble, but anyone out there have any advice about keeping your head up when treatment gets hard? Anyone give up meds completely and want to share their experience? Anyone else just need to rant to someone to gets it?

This is my first post on this sub so bear with me.\n\nI (21F) was diagnosed with IH in June after years of exhaustion. My brother was diagnosed with narcolepsy a few years ago and I know genetics can play a role so for the longest time, I was convinced that was what I had. Getting a diagnosis was great because I don't have to fight with my insurance as much on medications but there's still a part of me that thinks I may be misdiagnosed and I just wanted to hear other experiences. So my questions:\n\n1. Do you struggle with sleeping at night? Whether that be falling asleep, staying asleep, feeling like you're getting deep sleep, etc.\n2. Have you had success in getting Xyrem (or Xywav, I know that one is new) covered by insurance for IH? If so, did you have to try a bunch of stimulants beforehand?\n\nI ask because for as long as I can remember, I have woken up every hour or two all night long. I also frequently had nights where I felt like I was stuck in very light sleep or REM sleep all night because I was dreaming but at the same time, it felt like I was never *really* asleep. From what I have heard from others with IH, staying asleep/getting deep sleep wasn't as much of an issue and this aligned more with narcolepsy. I also have hypnagogic hallucinations multiple times per week when not medicated.\n\nI'm currently taking 6.25 Zolpidem CR at night to sleep and then 200 Modafinil twice a day. I also have Adderall that I can take up to 20 twice a day but I rarely do because of the heart palpitations and anxiety. Plus, it gives me really bad insomnia if I take it after around 1 pm. The Zolpidem (Ambien) definitely helps me get deeper sleep and less hallucinations but I don't think it's doing a whole lot to help with the sleep attacks during the day.\n\nI apologize if these questions have been asked before.

I\u2019ve had dreams about someone eating socks and they got entwined in his intestines, and shredded his intestines apart and the socks and intestines were sewn together, and they came out a hole in his arm and someone pulled on them and he was in excruciating pain. I dreamed about a person in a horrible accident who broke her jaw and there was a big hole in her cheek and you could see inside to all her teeth. I dreamed that I put stitches in the whites of my own eyeball, and I had to go to a doctor and plead with them to help me get the stitches out. \n\nDoes anyone else experience this or have any advice?

Background: I\u2019m 22F living in Australia and was diagnosed in 2017. Have been on dexamphetamine the entire time, tried Nuvigil with no results and definitely not enough to justify the cost. \n\nI\u2019m very open about my sleep disorder if it comes up in conversation. I like to try educate people a bit about a sleep disorder they have most likely never heard of. I work retail (supermarket) and occasionally customers will bring little things up and it leads to my sleep disorder. Most of the time it\u2019s the fact I don\u2019t drive or don\u2019t go out on weekends due to my sleep disorder.\n\nI\u2019m used to unsolicited advice. Everything from cutting out gluten/dairy/meat ect to \u201chave you tried exercising?\u201d or \u201cmaybe losing weight would help?\u201d. I an overweight but it doesn\u2019t effect me much and I\u2019m generally fitter than my mum who weighs a lot less than me. I have no problems with walking long distances and being on my feet all day. I used to exercise 4-5 nights a week with a coworker. We would walk together every night but I had to stop because it was making me worse. \n\nThe breaking point happened recently from 2 situations that happened close together. A coworker went on duramine for weight loss. She turned around and said \u201cremember how you have that sleep disorder?\u201d (of course I remember?) and then proceeded to tell me that duromine was practically legal speed and I need to try it, I wouldn\u2019t be tired anymore. I explained I\u2019m on dexamphetamine which as the name suggests, is a kind of amphetamine. She said that duromine is stronger and that I really need to try it. That frustrated me because she knows I have a specialist and have been seeing a specialist for 3 years. She suggested that my specialist probably hasn\u2019t even thought of it. It was an eye roll but it stuck with me because of how pushy she was about it. \n\nThe second situation was also with a coworker. It was actually my supervisor. She does the rosters and is great, knows I can\u2019t work early mornings and knows any more than 30 hours usually leads to me sobbing in the break room about how tired I am. She is very supportive. I got into work one day as she was finishing and it had been busy so she was a bit over it. She asked how I was and I mentioned I was tired. She turned around and said \u201cmaybe if you didn\u2019t think about how tired you were all the time you wouldn\u2019t feel tired, it\u2019s mind over matter\u201d. This really upset me and I\u2019m still thinking about it months later. I know what she meant (like when you are hungry, if you stop thinking about how excited you are to eat you can usually forget about being hungry for a while). \n\nI\u2019m at this point now where I wouldn\u2019t call it paranoia but I\u2019m constantly questioning myself and despite having a diagnosis I still constantly tell myself \u201cyou just aren\u2019t doing enough, you don\u2019t have a sleep disorder you are just lazy\u201d and other thoughts similar to that. It\u2019s exaggerated when people try give me medical advice (cut out gluten and you will be cured) because I can\u2019t realistically try every single thing they are suggesting so my brain keeps telling me I\u2019m not doing enough and bringing this upon myself.\n\nI know I have a sleep disorder, I take 30-45mg dexamphetamine a day and can still sleep. I KNOW there is something wrong with me but it\u2019s like an angel and devil on my shoulders. I know there is something wrong but the other half of my brain is telling me I\u2019m just lazy and I\u2019m bringing this on myself and its embarrassing I\u2019m trying to pretend to have this condition because I make other people with the disorder look bad. Then my brain goes back to \u201cyou have a diagnosis and have a sleep specialist who agrees there is something wrong\u201d. Then I flip back into negative thoughts of \u201cyour specialist thinks your lying as well\u201d (my sleep latency wasn\u2019t under 8 minutes either MSLT). \n\nI want to see a therapist but I\u2019m scared to ask my therapist. I\u2019m afraid if I bring up my irrational thought (that I\u2019m just pretending and there isn\u2019t anything wrong with me and I\u2019m just lazy) that he will agree with me and take me off all my medications or something. \n\nHas anyone had thoughts like this?

I tried to suck it up and somehow made it through college and am working now. During those years I had some traumatic experiences happening to me and I guess \u201cdepressed\u201d as well. I never went to the doctor or seek professional help since it was seen as \u201call in my head\u201d, excuses, or my personal stress and pain doesn\u2019t surmount to what my parents go through to \u201craise\u201d me. Some of the childhood traumas carried over to my adulthood years and I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and finally went to the doctor for help and diagnosis. I really wanted a validation to see if it\u2019s all in my head or if something is really wrong with me. I got diagnosed with depression and possible adhd. However I was still sleepy with stimulant medications so the doctor conducted a sleep study. The doctor noted the irregularities in my day time sleep/nap study and diagnosed me with idiopathic hypersomnia. My nighttime sleep was normal but my daytime sleep was abnormal. I was able to fall asleep fast and did not have any REM sleep during the day.  \n\nNow the problem:\n\nI never got diagnosed or went to the doctor because I was told that I am overthinking or that I am just being \u201clazy\u201d. But I was able to survive all my education (with some hiccups along the way). Now that I got help with actual studies done on me and with diagnosis from medical doctors, my family still thinks that there\u2019s something wrong with the health care system. It\u2019s kind of hard since some of them are in the healthcare field.. and do not like how the system works at all (some doctors, nurses, dentists, and etc. but some practices overseas so there could be differences). And they don\u2019t like the \u201cnew\u201d or the younger generation of doctor prescribing every and any kind of medications to try and the over use of antibiotics (that\u2019s another story). Also the rising culture of  excessively using your \u201cdiagnosis\u201d as an excuse.\n\nThis kind of hurts because the testing and medical diagnosis finally liberated myself from thinking that I\u2019m really not lazy but one of the family member asked \u201cdo you deny that you could be lazy with or without the medication? If you are somewhat lazy, maybe if you improve on that, you wouldn\u2019t have to depend on medications to be not lazy\u201d. \n\nI tried to tell my friend about it and said \u201cjust try to get more sleep or manage my sleep better\u201d but my sleep study shows that I get good restful sleep during the night.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 2165, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do you deal with being called \u201clazy\u201d and unmotivated?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/iut0n0/how_do_you_deal_with_being_called_lazy_and/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "wheatosm", "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "56de33b2-a13b-11e8-86fb-0ec44c28c910", "author_flair_text": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6zeutpjc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1600363587, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/iuo3o3/i_am_struggling/", "gildings": {}, "id": "iuo3o3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b0a7e18a-a17d-11e8-88ac-0e14fa46b726", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/iuo3o3/i_am_struggling/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1600363598, "score": 1, "selftext": "Lately with school and work all coming together again and my new few month old diagnosis, everything just seems so much harder than it was before and i just feel like giving up all the time or i\u2019m extremely irritable and feel foggy at work/around people. \n\nWhat do you guys do to help manage a schedule/adjust to a new one?

Even if I sleep a solid 8 or 9 hours I still feel absolutely dead tired. I barely feel better than that on 10-11 hours. I know that sleep is one of the three most important pillars of strength gain, the other two being proper exercises and proper diet. Sleep is where your muscles actually repair themselves from the tears induced by exercise and enables it to grow.  I'm not sure of the potential effects that hypersomnia could have on that. \n\nI'm confident that I'm following good programs and putting in enough effort when it comes to the exercises, although my diet definitely needs working on. \n\nIt's a constant struggle because I have always had a very limited appetite, and in order to gain muscle you need to get enough protein and eat an excess of calories so you can even gain weight in the first place. I've been really working on eating a lot and getting good healthy foods but no matter what I do it seems like I lack much headway when it comes to progression in the gym. \n\nSo I was just wondering if anyone else had any thoughts to share on living with sleeping issues while trying to gain a lot of muscle.

Newish to reddit, postin on mobile... \n\nI've been struggling with (undiagnosed) IH for several years, I suspected I had it but didn't want to jump to conclusions. One of the symptoms I struggled with, and seemed to throw off my doctors too, was my circulation and temperature regulation. One of the biggest roadblocks I have for staying awake is being at the right temperature. If its too cold, I get sleepy- it can be a slippery slope where I may crawl into bed and loose hours of my day. If it's too hot, I just get sluggish and don't want to do anything because it's hot lol. The signs of an oncoming \"cold attack\" are usually that my fingers/toes/hands/feet will start to tingle and get very cold. The only way I've found as a temporary solution is to jump in a hot shower before its too late. Has anyone else had experience with this? I don't like to wear lots of layers / clothes because my temperature (and my house's) is constantly changing.\n\nStats:\nIH, Mild chronic depression, anxiety, undiagnosed attention disorder (very

It was a relief to have some answers, but I once again feel like there\u2019s something not quite right. For the record, I\u2019ve been diagnosed with occipital neuralgia (treated, not an issue currently), vestibular migraines, and now IH. That all makes sense to me, the IH exacerbates the migraines and Vice versa. The IH explains the memory loss, loss of concentration, etc. Migraines I guess explain the vertigo, other balance and issues with visual disturbances. But I\u2019m also dealing with some stuff I\u2019m in the dark about. I\u2019m dealing with confusion (where I am, who I\u2019m with, what I\u2019m supposed to be doing), disorientation, joint pain/skin pain, speech issues, and some issues with grip where I\u2019m constantly dropping things.  \n\nIt feels like a lot of my issues have been kinda put under the umbrella of migraines (especially the balance, visual movement, visual disturbances, spatial disorientation portion of it) and that\u2019s not really sitting right with me, especially since I rarely even have a headache. \n\nI guess I\u2019m kind of asking if any of these symptoms fall under IH so I can stop feeling like I\u2019m still missing something. Or if it makes sense that it\u2019s probably just those two disorders exacerbating each other to a point where it\u2019s causing me a slight amount of distress. \n\nI have to follow up with a neurologist later in the year anyways so I\u2019ll be passing on some of my concerns just to cover all my bases. I\u2019m just hopeful that some of you may have some insight.\n\nThanks for any feedback", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia",

I recall this starting shortly after my mom died suddenly and unexpectedly. This was very emotionally traumatic for me and I believe the symptoms started around then.\n\nOver the last ten or so years, I've spoken to a few PCPs about this, my psychologist, and even went to a holistic medicine quack in my neighborhood. I've bought books on fatigue. I've had blood and allergy tests. They've recommended various supplements, better sleep habits, working out more, etc. One doctor offered me antidepressants after my first appointment, which I declined. I've tried all of this and felt no change so I basically just deal with the fact that I feel like I need to take a nap all the time and fall asleep right away while reading, watching TV/movies, or just sitting on the couch even though I get 8+ hours of sleep/night.\n\nThe fatigue isn't to the point that I'll fall asleep while sitting and working but I do have an overwhelming desire to take a nap very often and will fall asleep right away if I'm doing something that doesn't require much input (reading, TV, etc.).\n\nI recently took an Epworth Sleepiness Scale screener and scored a 17, which \"suggests a high level of excessive daytime sleepiness\" and recommends seeing a sleep specialist.\n\nWhere do I even start? Should I go to a sleep specialist? Integrative medicine?\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 2106, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is this IH?

My MSLT showed that my average sleep latency, going into REM was exactly 15 minutes which is right on the border of a confirmed narcolepsy diagnosis. Some of my naps resulted in 5 minute REM onset. \n\nI don\u2019t have cataplexy, and was diagnosed as \u201csuspected narcolepsy type II\u201d, although other doctors would diagnose IH with the same sleep study results.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019ve been through nearly every pharmaceutical med, natural remedies, electromagnetic devices, etc etc. Of course I haven\u2019t tried every single thing out there, but I\u2019ve tried a vast majority of remedies. At one point I was on 70mg Vyvanse 2x daily, and still slept 12-16 hours a day and was exhausted each and every day.\n\nWE CANNOT GIVE UP HOPE, AND IM NOT DONE TRYING UNTIL IM GONE!\n\nSo here\u2019s my newest attempted \u201ccure\u201d\n\nI purchased an 8 hour sleep cycle binaural beats audio from Jody Hatton on YouTube (go check him out, excellent binaurals).\n\nI got myself a $25 Bluetooth speaker headband off of Amazon for sleeping (works well for side sleepers).\n\nSo far I\u2019m on day 4 of trying to \u201cretrain\u201d my brain into a correct sleep cycle. In theory, if I\u2019m able to sleep the entire 8 hours through the sleep cycle binaural and continually do this for 30-180 days, my brain should start to resonate and adapt with the binaural, eventually leading to a new habitual sleep pattern. \n\nFindings:\n\nSo far, I have not noticed any benefit or detriment of this method. One very weird anomaly that I have discovered is that each of the 4 nights I have woken up at nearly the EXACT same time of the 8 hour track...2hrs:30mins. \n\n2:30 of the soundtrack is a completion of the first 90 minute sleep cycle, followed by a half completed 2nd sleep cycle.\n\nAt exactly 2:30, the track is in the exact middle point of the DELTA - REM cycle.\n\nI don\u2019t know why this happening, but it seems very interesting that I always wake up at that exact time (give or take 1-2mins).\n\nI see my psychiatrist soon and hope to be prescribed Ambien to try and combat this. I have no issues sleeping, but can\u2019t seam to get through the 8hour track without waking up. So in theory, if Ambien is able to knock me out enough to sleep through the entire 8 hours, my brain should be able to resonate with and create new neural pathways that follow correct sleep architecture.\n\nI think I\u2019m really on to something here, but maybe I\u2019m totally off my rocker. Haha, I\u2019ll plan to update this post in the coming weeks with any new findings and results!\n\nWhat do you think of this method?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false,

The only thing I can guess is happening is I\u2019m triggering adrenaline by accident. \n\nI also have CFS/ME, so it might not be IH. I was reminded of this experience last night when exhaustion hit me really hard, but I still had so much I wanted to do before bed. I try not to ignore sleepiness, but I was on a cleaning streak and kept thinking I\u2019d do just one more thing. I finally got into bed around 1 am. I was so tired but thought it would help calm my mind to read for a few minutes. Oops, no. I was in the last few chapters (I didn\u2019t realize because the book had a few chapters of the sequel on the end), so I got hooked and had to finish. \n\nAfter that my brain was totally salad. Jumbled and alert and tired. I tossed and turned, literally. \n\nWhen I finally fell asleep, I kept waking up with hallucinations and/or coughing. I tested for a minimal level of obstructive slept apnea; not anywhere near treating, but occasionally coughing is an indication I\u2019m struggling on a particular night. \n\nTo no one\u2019s surprise, I woke up at 7:30 feeling completely awful. \n\nThis is a sign I need to reprioritize my sleep hygiene. I need to not make excuses to stay up past my threshold. \n\nI guess I\u2019m just curious if anyone else experiences this type of insomnia. My specialist gave me trazadone for insomnia, but I really like to avoid using it. Additionally, if I do want to take it I have to know when I go to bed because I have to skip another bed due to interactions. Usually, by the time I wish I had a sleep aid I\u2019ve long since taken my normal prescriptions. Plus, I\u2019ve heard that trazadone may get you to sleep, but potentially prevent/reduce refreshing sleep. \n\nI\u2019m concerned I\u2019ll have to nap today and continue my poor cycle.

Please share your commonalities.\n\nI have anxiety and depression.\n\nI have had many syncopal episodes under various circumstances. Some seem to be related to panic attacks, some because of pain medications, and some when I am sick (like cold/flu). \n\nMy vision goes black/narrow when I stand up too quickly.\n\nI have unexplained digestive issues. A colonoscopy showed nothing. I experience extreme pain and gas after some meals. I've been vegan for around seven years, and I've tried cutting out gluten with no luck. Sometimes I feel an urgent need to poop and all that comes out is gas and mucus. I suspect candida overgrowth but don't really know what to do with that information. It seems like my digestive system works really quickly, and I wonder if I'm absorbing the nutrients.\n\nWhen I was younger, I went to the doctor a lot for what we thought were UTIs, but they rarely were. I still have these episodes frequently. I'll have a day where the urge to pee is uncontrollable and when I go, almost nothing comes out and it burns. I chug water and it's usually gone by the next day.\n\nI have joints that overextend.

Recently, I discovered that the only thing that makes it better is 400 mg of magnesium (sourced from magnesium glycinate, which I estimate I\u2019m consuming about 4 grams of). I use doctor\u2019s best brand. This allows me to get quality sleep, as in deep wave sleep. I cannot stress how much this improved my life. I ran out and only took 300 mg last and my EDS is lightly out today.\n\n[Conversely, low-dose glycine at a dose of 3\u2009g/day before bedtime subjectively improves sleep quality and reduces sleepiness and fatigue during the day in individuals with insomniac tendencies or restricted sleep time (Bannai et al, 2012; Inagawa et al, 2006). A polysomnographic study also revealed that the same dose of glycine stabilizes sleep state and shortens the latency to slow-wave sleep, with no alterations in sleep architecture (Yamadera et al, 2007). A recent study reported that the intraperitoneal injection of glycine inhibits the activity of orexin neurons, which are critical for arousal, energy homeostasis, and reward-seeking (Sakurai et al, 2010) and induces non-REM (NREM) sleep with fragmented vigilance states in mice (Hondo et al, 2011). ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4397399/)\n\n[In conclusion, dietary magnesium consumption was inversely associated with falling asleep during the day in women but not in men. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6212970/)\n\n\n[As compared to the placebo group, in the experimental group, dietary magnesium supplementation brought about statistically significant increases in sleep time (P = 0.002), sleep efficiency (P = 0.03), concentration of serum renin (P &lt; 0.001), and melatonin (P = 0.007), and also resulted in significant decrease of ISI score (P = 0.006), sleep onset latency (P = 0.02) and serum cortisol concentration (P = 0.008). Supplementation also resulted in marginally between-group significant reduction in early morning awakening (P = 0.08) and serum magnesium concentration (P = 0.06).

Unremarkable MSLT the next day, albeit sleepier than 'normal'. Slept in 2/4 naps, didn't dream. Average sleep latency was 12mins\n\n2nd study: Complete cannabis abstinence for 30 days: Sleep somewhat normal with more awakenings and REM. Sleep felt less restful. On MSLT, slept 4/5 naps, with \"questionable\"  REM in 4 of them. Average Sleep latency was 6mins.\n\nResults Consultation: Cannabis proved to provide benefit in my case of too much REM and feeling 'restored by sleep'. Compared \"questionable\" REM from MSLT to previous night's polysomnograph obvious REM. The patterns match he said. I had narcolepsy. My treatment was determined to be 75mg of venlafaxine (Effexor) and 100mg modafinil (Provigil). \n\nI continue on this treatment and it has been life changing. No sleeping 11-12 hours a night. Shorter, reduced daytime naps. No 'melting' feeling and sleep paralysis and hallucinations when waking and falling asleep.\n\nFollow-up Consultation 1 year later: Dr is not changing my treatment plan but now asserts it is not narcolepsy and has referred me back to a neuro-psych. \n\nMy \"questionable\" REM puts me in a position of borderline narcolepsy criteria and it truly could only be confirmed as such by performing a third sleep study. I WANT a third sleep study to get some solid results and true diagnosis. Even though it means going off the meds that help me for an agent-free sleep study.\n\nThe thing is, I am in Canada. I am eternally grateful these dr visits and sleep studies are covered by my province. I will never know how lucky I am, try as I might in all my gratitude!\n\nSince this is a public system, the sleep neuro said he cannot justify a third sleep study to investigate further. That is fair. But it also leaves me in the dark. \n\nThere are no private options here where I could pay for that very helpful third sleep study.\n\nIs my sleep neurologist being weird?

I've had sleep issues since I was in 10. I saw my first of 5 sleep doctors at this age. I had no answers and was told to have \"clean\" sleep hygeine. No phones before bed, no excersize an hour before. All that. \n\nWell it didn't help. I was forever falling asleep while in class. Getting more than 8 hours of sleep at night. Taking naps when I got home. By the time I turned 14 the doctor's took me seriously only with my mother present to argue with them that I had a problem. I had two sleep studys within the year. My second doctor diagnosed me with narcolepsy as it runs in the family and I had a lot of the symptoms. Well I tried for a follow up appointment for treatment and the office never made that happen. It took 6 months of calling weekly and them saying they'd make an appointment when the doctor was in before we left for a different doctor. Turns out this office is super unorganized and I'm not the only one who had issues. \n\nI went to my third and fourth doctors the following year. I was 15. They were in the same office as each other so they could share my details. The third doctor wanted another sleep study as they couldn't contact the second doctors office for my files. They tried. The fourth doctor called me back and said they couldn't provide the sleep study as they didn't think I needed one. Not what the third doctor thought. It was weird and confusing and led no where. I was just a teenager oversleeping in their eyes. They said I needs better sleep hygeine (which at that point I had been following for years!). They didn't believe me and thought I just needed to wake up and stay awake. \n\nFifth doctor was by far the best, but still ultimately ended nowhere. He immediately took me seriously and had a sleep study followed by a sleep latency test the next day. I am 16 by this point. During the study the guy who gave the test wasn't allowed to share any details as he wasn't the doctor, but he made a comment that I had extremely interesting brain spindles. Not sure what that means as my doctor never followed up to explain that bit. However during the latency test I was able to fall asleep within a few minutes each time and stay asleep. I was given a questineer each time asking if I thought I slept and how fast I think I did. The room was completely blacked out and I wasn't really sure. I said I did a few times but apparently it was each time. \n\nThe follow up with doctor 5 said I didn't have narcolepsy (contrary to what the second doctors said. Also I would wake up in weird places after school like the kitchen floor and not remember falling asleep). He said I had mild sleep apnea. I stopped breathing 8 times per hour in my sleep. This is literally the bare minimum to be diagnosed, but he put all of that as the reason I could sleep upwards of 15 hours a day if I was able to. He said he was going to start treatment for the sleep apnea and if it didn't work I'd be diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia, but that it has no cure or help. He said I was too young to possibly try drugs for it so he wouldn't even consider doing anything. \n\nWell my CPAP came in and I used it for 2 weeks and then a follow up. Then he said I needed to give it more of a try so it was 2 months and a follow up. Then it was 6 months. By this point I was literally more tired than before. I tried 6 different masks with no positive results. I found it incredibley hard to breathe, and I would wake up multiple times per night because it would push so much sir in. I tried lowering the pressure and no results. It just didn't work and with my mild case I didn't see how that was possibly making my sleep so crazy. his final verdict after that was that I should \"just have hope\" that things will be better. That's actually a direct quote. To have hope. Well it didn't work.\n\nI have a hard time waking up. I've used app alarm clocks to measure my cycles and wake me up at the best times and I still don't hear them. I either wait out the alarm until it gives up, or I silence it while still asleep. It's highly inconvent as I can't wake myself up affectively. I suffer from nightmares now from some other mental issues which weren't a problem before and I wake up multiple times per night. When it's not a nightmare its very vivid dreams. I can remember 5plus separate dreams a night when I wake up. I'm more tired when I dream but I can't stop it.

I never got any empathy from others. Either they assumed I was up all-night gaming, irresponsible, just a tired person, etc.\u2026 since the signs out outward or obvious people assume probably, I am lazy and uninterested in doing things.  In many ways it affected me greatly throughout life and I have missed out on a lot of experiences growing up and still miss out on. It has made me reclusive, isolated, unhappy, but still I remain optimistic. I have never been on a \u201creal date\u201d with a girl, it\u2019s confused me sexually since I\u2019ve never been sexually active with anyone I sometimes wonder, \u201cam I gay?\u201d. I am turning 38 tomorrow and never so much as had a single intimate moment with a woman. I have never been motivated to go to regular things teeners did as kids growing up such as hanging out doing whatever with friends, going to concerts, etc.\u2026 I just stayed home. Anyways this all went on I ended up graduating high school with average grades and tried my hand at community college. I never got any help from my parents and they never seemed concerned or interested in me growing up unlike my sister who was lauded on all the attention. I was just the sleepy boring guy who just played around on his computer all the time after school playing Everquest. \n\nThis is where part of the problems with hypersomnia, I believe manifest. I always had help getting up going to school from my parents. But when I started working part-time, I had to manage a schedule and I could barely function early in morning, so I usually ended up with closing shifts. I would wake up at 10 or 11am usually and oftentimes it was not my intention to wake up that late. I often missed classes because of this waking up late problem. Am I lazy? I thought\u2026. what is wrong with me I thought? I even got in the practice of setting an alarm across the room on a shelf, two alarms spread across the room, three arms (two across room, one with a bed shaker).  Every time I\u2019d wake up late, confused, and went \u201cHow did I manage to turn off all my alarms, go back to bed, and sleep for another 4 hours with no recollection I ever turned off the alarms?\u201d IT WAS MADDENING! This went on for years. The isolation, the lack of social interaction, the oversleeping, the failure to concentrate on anything., the zero empathy or concern for others even those closest to me. I was just some loser who played video games on his computer and people assumed I was \u201caddicted\u201d. I was trying hard though, but I was just so tired all the time. \n\nAnyways I am not 23 years old, always tired, lonely, depressed, just sick of everything in life. I end up walking into a military recruiter and signing up for the Air Force because nothing is working out for me. I ship out around 4 months later-or-so to Lackland AFB. I arrive late because I missed a connecting flight to San Antonio (at no fault of my own\u2026 we arrived late to O\u2019Hare and could not make the flight). So out on my own for the 1st time I am not sur what to do. I call the number the recruiter gave me, and they book me a hotel nearby. I grab a hotel taxi and check into my hotel room for the night. It is where I run into around a half dozen other people in my same situation. We hang out, eat pizza, and play cards. First time I have ever done that I thought. Anyways I turn in early because I am tired, and I know I got be at basic training the next day. I do not want to go through everything here, but I am trying to get to a point!\n\nIn basic training you are forced to adhere to a sleep schedule. There is no way you are sleeping through this alarm. I would start my day with reveille playing over a loud PA system around 5 AM, then it was off to do morning PT, eat chow, and physical fitness). To be honest I struggled at first and nearly found myself kicked out of basic training for \u201cfailure to adapt\u201d. But my first TI was crazy and sadistic. I got assigned to a different flight after almost getting kicked out but then expressing interest to go back into the fray. The military needed troops at the time because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan so they did not want to get rid of me yet.\n\nFast forward to my first official duty station after BMT and like magic all my sleep issues have drastically diminished. I still have headaches, and tiredness, and I am still isolated from others. But it is at my first duty station I make efforts to go out with people I work with and on several occasions, we go on trips, camping, etc.\u2026 it is great. I think what helped me sleep here was having a tough discipline system if I did not show up for work and having a routine.\nHoly shit this is lasting forever\u2026 let me FAST FORWARD SOME MORE! \n\nSo, it is 2014 and I have separated from the military after 7 glorious years. Now I am back on my own but now I am determined to not become a failure. I end up enrolling in college at 32 years old and start taking classes working towards an engineering degree. I no longer play games as much as I used to, but I still play them when I have time.\n\nI end up going through the VA process to get disability payments. Part of this is a sleep study where I had to go to sleep lab. I did this because I had the suspicion something was wrong, but I did not know what. I think I told them difficulty sleeping. For years I had suffered with tiredness, sleepiness, headaches, etc.\u2026 Well the Sleep Lab was a disaster (in my view) \u2026 but apparently I fell asleep quickly\u2026so quickly that the Dr. wrote \u201cSleep onset was instantaneous at lights out. This indicates pathologic levels of hypersomnia.\u201d My general practitioner never brought this up and I only found out years later as I investigate a possible sleep apnea claim because I am still feeling like shit. I do not have issues oversleeping my alarm because I am learned a routine at this time. I used two alarms generally. although now I use one alarm, placed across the room. It is one of those Philips Wakeup Lamps with a build in alarm clock. Get one of those if you have trouble waking. It is bright as hell and lights up the room\n\nFast forward again to 2019 I have a 2nd sleep study and this one pops for mild sleep apnea. I am assigned a ResMed AirSense 10 by the nearby VA hospital and it has been a tremendous help in leveling me out. I could not breath while asleep. The tech said there were occasions where I would have an apnea of almost 90 seconds long where I was not breathing. Anyways I have been using the CPAP for around 1.5 years now\u2026 I\u2019m now in the process of trying to see if I can increase my disability rating due to Hypersomnia (remember that Dr\u2019s note about \u201cpathologic levels of hypersomnia\u201d) and Sleep Apnea with secondary connections to my anxiety and weight gain. I still have yet to start the paperwork because honestly it\u2019s a lot of work\u2026and I\u2019m trying to make sure I got my \u201cducks in a row\u201d (I have a signed sworn statement from my parents in 2014 about difficulty sleeping; and a signed nexus letter I just got in April from my doctor)\u2026 but lets move on from this.\nOne thing I\u2019m learning about myself is that (1) I am frequently tired and (2) this frequent tiredness leaves me unmotivated to exercise and subsequent weight gain (3) I can seemingly nap on queue if I want to\u2026 but oftentimes I force myself not to nap because if I do I\u2019m out for at least 1 to 2 hours and (4) If I want to sleep I can be lights out seemingly instantly. There is apparently a normal time for falling asleep but people with hypersomnia can go to sleep instantly upon closing eyes and relaxing. This sounds great but its not\u2026 it indicates a problem\u2026 which is why I think my Dr. brushing me off saying \u201cOh you just need to get more sleep you\u2019re probably just tired\u201d. \nBlah blah blah\u2026 anyways the one outlet I got pleasure from was video gaming but that is diminished because honestly, I do not have anyone else to play with anymore. I have a job new working for a government contractor in an extremely sensitive program, so I need to be mentally alert (CPAP has helped). My eyesight has worsened so I am trying not to use the computer as much these days, but I cannot help it\u2026 I just do not game as much. Plus, I am depressed of being alone all the time and having no real friends. My parents visit me at my home and that is great but still. Perhaps I should get a dog or a cat?\n\nAnyways I am rambling\u2026 I hope one day to have a \u201cnormal life\u201d but I feel like I am getting to old to find that special someone and I will never make the steps necessary to pursue someone either. When you go your whole life without developing social skills trying to do it in your late 30s seems impossible.\n\nI genuinely believe I have been suffering from hypersomnia my whole life and it is made my life hell.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 2013, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hi all, thought I'd share my story.

I\u2019ve been diagnosed with sleep apnea since 21 but only found successful treatment recently (turns out I need a bilevel with backup rate to combat my treatment-emergent central apnea). What never made sense, though, is the fact that waking up is always so uncomfortable and I\u2019m in fog for hours after waking up. I finally found a sleep doctor that knows what he\u2019s doing and after my last study he said IH is definitely the diagnosis for me (I fell asleep every time within 4 minutes but didn\u2019t enter REM so that ruled out narcolepsy).\n\nI\u2019m actually pretty happy about this because it makes complete sense, looking at the symptoms. Although I don\u2019t suddenly fall asleep I fit the description quite well. I was also convinced that the cocktails of medications I was on as a teenager for depression caused some chemical screw up in my brain, causing these symptoms. It turns out I don\u2019t need those medications and haven\u2019t been on them for 14 years, so doctors have always brushed them off when I asked if they could be the cause. I thought I was unique in a bad way!\n\nWith that said, I\u2019m pretty functional throughout the day despite being tired. I\u2019ve learned to deal with it. But sometimes I get nasty brain fog, and there are 1-2 week periods where I\u2019m too tired to do anything. My doctor said I should look into modafinil or sunsosi for those periods of time, but I\u2019m not a fan of medication after my experiences as a teenager. Does anyone have positive or negative experiences with them?\n\nAny other pieces of information you\u2019ve learned on your searches that you might share with me? I\u2019d love to learn from people who have found ways to combat the constant exhaustion and brain fog.\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1212, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New IH diagnosis and it makes complete sense", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567132017, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/cwuqxm/new_ih_diagnosis_and_it_makes_complete_sense/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "camigyrl16", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ffn1bk2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566499966, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/cu1tj3/med_regimen_making_me_feel_worse/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cu1tj3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1dc256e2-a17e-11e8-9e9a-0e976fd50694", "link_flair_text": "Medication", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/cu1tj3/med_regimen_making_me_feel_worse/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566499968, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI was diagnosed with IH in 2017, and I've been taking 1000 mg of Clari and 30 mg of Vyvanse every morning since then. I also have depression, so I take an SSRI at night. This regimen has worked wonders for me for the past 2 years, but reently I've noticed a change.\n\nFor the past few months, I have been feeling super sleepy, fatigued and grumpy. I have the typical can't-keep-my-eyes open symptoms, but I also just generally feel like I ran 5 miles when I have done absolutely nothing. It's super hard to separate IH symptoms out from my depression, so that is something I'm trying to investigate. But here's the weird part: on the days when I happen to forget to take my Clari and Vyvanse, I feel A LOT better. Clear headed, cheerful, and attentive. Not like a normal energetic person by any means, but a least more normal. And then I'll take my meds the next day, and will go back to feeling like crap.\n\nI haven't done a good amount of AB testing to know if there's a consistent difference, but it's definitely something that's gotten my attention.

Just this year, an [abstract published in a supplement to the journal *Neurology*](https://n.neurology.org/content/92/15_Supplement/P3.6-037)  found that more than half of people with narcolepsy experience one or  more wrong diagnoses initially, most commonly depression (31.3%),  anxiety disorder (16.3%), and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder  (16.2%).1 This is a known problem that delays the  diagnosis\u2014and treatment\u2014of narcolepsy while the person bounces around  through different healthcare disciplines.\n\nBut once the person lands in the sleep physician\u2019s office, a less  recognized disservice can begin: the treatment of narcolepsy without  evaluation for potential comorbid psychiatric disorders.\n\nSome narcolepsy comorbidities are present at the time of initial  diagnosis and others may develop over time. So screening for psychiatric  conditions is an undervalued but important step for sleep professionals  to take at regular intervals with their patients with narcolepsy.\n\nAn [Olmsted County, Minn, community-based study](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389-9457(17)31558-7)  that analyzed longitudinal data from the years 2000 to 2014 found  depression to be highly comorbid with narcolepsy, affecting 39.7% of  narcolepsy patients at diagnosis, with an increase to 50% at the end of  the study. By contrast, 14.7% of healthy controls were affected by  depression at the study onset and 21.7% at the study\u2019s end\u2014a  significantly elevated odds ratio for people with narcolepsy of 4.88 at  start and 3.79 at last observation. Psychiatric disorders in general  also had a significantly elevated odds ratio both at diagnosis and after  the observation period. Anxiety disorder was only significantly  elevated at the time of diagnosis; it become non-significant after  observation due to increasing incidence in the control cohort. Still,  anxiety disorder was identified in 20.6% of people with narcolepsy at  diagnosis and in 25.0% of people with narcolepsy later.2\n\nOffering screening and referrals to patients of both sexes is  important. \u201cPatterns of higher psychiatric frequencies were similar for  males and females,\u201d said Chad Ruoff, MD, a sleep physician at Kaiser  Permanente in Woodland Hills, Calif, at 2019 Los Angeles Narcolepsy  Education Day, an event hosted by Wake Up Narcolepsy. Ruoff is first  author of a recent [study that evaluates psychiatric comorbidity](http://www.psychiatrist.com/JCP/article/Pages/2017/v78n02/v78n0207.aspx)  patterns in patients with a narcolepsy diagnosis in the United States.  All mental illness categories were significantly more prevalent in  patients with narcolepsy versus controls, with the highest excess  prevalence for mood, depressive, and anxiety disorders. Also of note,  the highest excess prevalence for anxiety and mood disorders was  identified in the younger age groups.3 Be methodical, Ruoff  advised. \u201cYou may create a different problem by escalating stimulants.  Work on the diagnosis and just be careful,\u201d he said.\n\nWith this information, it\u2019s clear that some people with narcolepsy  who receive a psychiatric diagnosis before their narcolepsy diagnosis do  have diagnosable and treatable mental health conditions\u2014but that solo  diagnosis too is not enough.\n\nA [2015-2016 study](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165-1781(18)30268-3)  of an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Singapore screened patients with  mood disorder, anxiety disorder, and schizophrenia for sleep disorder  symptoms. The prevalence for symptoms of narcolepsy was 12.5%.4\n\nThat\u2019s a compelling case for sleep physicians to create bidirectional  referral relationships with mental health professionals in their  geographic area. As the authors say, \u201cIdentifying and addressing sleep  disorders in early stages may have a positive impact on the prognosis  and quality of life of a psychiatric patient.\n\n[http://www.sleepreviewmag.com/2019/05/narcolepsy-psychiatric-comorbidities/](http://www.sleepreviewmag.com/2019/05/narcolepsy-psychiatric-comorbidities/)", "send_replies": true,

And disclaimer, I am not encouraging anyone to start vaping themselves.\n\nSo I vape using juice with .3mg of nicotine. The way I view it is as a coping skill for IH. It gives me a way to multitask and keep my mind stimulated. You experience the flavor, you see the clouds, and it's just a simple action you can do while doing something else. Something to do with your hands, too. This is most helpful for me when driving, but it also helps when you need to keep focus on something like a movie (at home!).\n\nAs for the nicotine, that's honestly a bonus. Nicotine by itself is just a mild stimulant like caffeine. It just gives me a little bit of a boost when I need it, like waking up in the morning or driving as I said before. It's a stimulant and I need all the stimulants I can get! There have been clinical trials that show that nicotine can promote mental alertness, and I believe it even helps decrease GABA levels. I was in a sleep therapy study recently, and the doctor I spoke with said that it has been proven to help, just not as much as a stimulant medication would.\n\nIt is an expensive habit to get into, but at least not as expensive as cigarettes. I've never experienced addiction from it that I can tell, it's more of a \"this could help so I'll keep doing it\" type situation.\n\nDoes anyone else vape, or even smoke? Do you think it helps a little? Do you do it all the time or just when you need it? As I said, I don't think I've seen many posts discussing it, so I felt compelled to!

I'm new.\n\nI was diagnosed with IH about a year ago. There are many crappy things about having IH, but I think one of the most frustrating things is not being able to get people to understand what I mean when I say \"I'm tired.\"\n\nEven friends who understand my condition still suggest that perhaps I didn't get enough sleep the night before, or suggest things that are entirely inappropriate - because they hear \"I'm tired\" and not \"I have a neurological condition and my symptoms are kicking in.\" \n\nSo I was thinking that maybe I should find a new phrase instead of \"I'm tired\" - but I don't know what. The above statement is a bit long winded and I'm worried about coming off as an attention seeker if I keep going on about my condition.

But, I thought I\u2019d reach out here to ask about my situation.\n\nI\u2019ve had IH for more than a decade, and sleep apnea, too. IH is my primary issue as my apnea is relatively mild. I\u2019ve been taking 100-200mg of Modafinil per day for a long time. It has helped in the past, but seemed to stop working about 6 months ago. I tried taking a break from it, but when I returned it still seems to be ineffective. So, I talked to my doctor and I tried Ritalin, 10mg per day. It did not improve my situation either. I could still easily fall asleep if I sat on a couch in a quiet room within just a few minutes. So, talked to my doctor again and now I\u2019m trying Adderall, 30mg per day (plus still taking 100-200mg of Modafinil) and I am still sleepy and will easily fall asleep if sitting in a quiet room. For example, I\u2019ve almost fell asleep several times while writing this message.\n\nI\u2019m looking for any thoughts on my situation. Are you having success for IH with Provigil, Ritalin, or Adderall? What dosages are you taking?

Its 5 years after symptoms first presented and school was so so hard. Christmas 2018 the head of the 6th form who had been the head there for at least 7 years had retired and the easter just came we got a new head, let's call him Mr X. \nThe story:\nOn Tuesdays I would get an early leave because I don't have lessons after 12 (i ofc took every opportunity to get home early and sleep), the rule is that if you leave during lesson time you have to get a slip with a signature from a teacher so the students aren't able to just walk out and ditch. The teacher that usually wrote me my slip was busy, so I asked Mr X to write me a slip. He started to write it, asked my name and confirmed that I didn't have any lessons, then he asked what I would be doing. I said \"going home\" not wanting to talk to him because I didn't really know him and didn't want to talk, but he further questioned. I couldn't be bothered to make up bull about how I was gonna study BC I knew I was just gonna be sleeping (i had lessons until 4pm the previous day so was more tired than normal due to the extra lessons). So I straight up said I was gonna sleep. He started joking to another teacher that was in the room about teenagers not sleeping properly, meanwhile in my head I'm like \"very original\" but i don't say anything as I'm not a very vocal person. He gives me the slip and sends me on my way. As I'm about to go around the corner he shouts down the hall in a joking way \" make sure you sleep more at night\" at that i stopped, looked at him and said \"actually I have a sleeping disorder\" in a very matter of fact way as I was a little annoyed. I made eye contact and waited to see what he would say. He just paused and went \"..oh\" and I could see him just put his foot in his mouth regretting that entire bunch of jokes he made. I silently walked away and for some reason i just found it hilarious. He didn't know so I don't hold it against him, now I like to think that hes learnt that teenagers can be tired for reasons other than staying up all night on their phones and could actually be struggling with issues you never thought of.

Was diagnosed recently when I realized that falling asleep and being sleepy all the time wasn't super normal, and found this subreddit today.\n\n- Its incredibly frustrating that people just don't BELIEVE you -- they think you should just sleep more, or that you're depressed, etc. Some of the symptoms are hard to explain too because I think normal people also experience being tired and sleepy and groggy. Some days I feel like I'm crazy and dramatizing my issues, but I've had an overnight sleep study done and my MLST mean latency was less than 5mins and the later naps were ~1 or 2 mins.\n\n- I still get scared that I'm like this. I've started on medication which has helped a bit with the falling asleep all the time, but I'm still tired all the time and all I ever think about is sleeping. I'm in my early twenties and I feel like I'm just missing out on so many fun opportunities or adventures because I need to sleep instead of going out and I don't have the energy to go on long trips or keep up with my friends. I just want to be... normal.\n\n- Waking up. Why is waking up so goddamn hard? Even when I set multiple alarms I end up waking up and turning them off and going back to sleep without even realizing I've done that. I've woken up hours after my alarms with the snooze screen still going off on my screen. I missed some mandatory meetings at school because of this, and was sent to conduct for \"failure to comply.\" It's just so so hard to get up and force myself to wake up in the morning when I know it'll feel so sweet to just close my eyes and go right back to sleep.\n\n- NAPS!! I feel like I take naps whenever I can, and sometimes I don't feel like I have any other choice because I can barely function if I don't, but I never wake up feeling well rested. So I'm napping all the time out of necessity, but it doesn't even feel like it's helping me. And then I'm just sleeping my life away. And the long naps (more than a couple hours). Every time I wake up from a long nap I feel like someone has dragged me out of the depths of sleep. I'm so delirious and nothing feels real. It's such an intense and strange feeling.\n\n- Knowing I'm about to fall asleep. I'm not sure if you guys can relate, but there's such a distinctive feeling before I'm about to randomly fall asleep. It's not the same as just pure exhaustion, but it's this specific feeling, and I know I'm about to fall asleep, and it feels like it takes every bit of willpower in my body to fight it, and I feel like I'm fighting it, but then I realize I'm just hopping in and out of consciousness. And I keep forcing my eyes open but they keep closing. And then I know that the only thing I want in the world is to close my eyes and as terrible as the trying to stay awake part is, finally giving into that sleepiness is the most amazing feeling. Idk. I've typed this all out and I feel crazy again.\n\n- The CONSTANT sleepiness. I think I've only felt actually awake a few times in the past few years. And only usually on some kind of medication. But it just sucks, feeling sleepy all the time. I feel like I'm getting stupider. Like my cognitive function is just slowly fading away. I just can't... process things anymore, or as quickly as I used to be able to.\n\nNot sure what I was trying to accomplish with this long ass list. I just love how supportive this community is. Thank you for not making me feel like I'm making this all up.

I experience hypnopompic hallucinations, sleepwalking, and sleeptalking. I was hoping to get advice or medication to help with quality of sleep, moreso than staying awake during the day. I have daytime sleepiness too, but it's not unmanageable (though I realize maybe I've just gotten used to functioning through the sleepiness). I am a little reluctant to start taking the Adderall because I've gotten by so far without it. No falling asleep while driving, I've developed ways to stay awake during meetings, etc. I mostly doze off while I'm a passenger in a car or watching a movie, but those tendencies aren't hurting my ability to participate in activities. \n\nIs my doctor correct that there is no medication to take for the nighttime side of IH?

I'm not depressed or anything but the dead tired, the sleep drunkness, the kognitive issues...they kinda get to me. \n\nToday walking outside I realized that I don't really go out much if I can avoid it. Maybe 2 times a week (I work once a week and do weekly food shopping by foot). Today I figured out why.\n\nIt is because I have been stopped by cops to check am I high or drunk (I am absolutist), checked by stangers when I have fallen asleep in places, and given dirty looks when I suddenly side step from exhaustion while walking...so pretty much, I am embarrassed and hate those memories.\n\nI know I am medicated now and beside not wearing make-up every day I go out, I look pretty normal. Fat, but normal. :P \n\nThe thought and fear of the exhaustion hitting in public makes me feel like I don't want to go outside so much. I don't like to do long trips either because then I know I fall asleep in some point. (Car rides, day on a beach would be a nightmare-almost literally...) \n\nSo yeah. I am stressed about falling asleep public ever again or having bad kognitive issues in a shop.\n\nI know it is dumb and I am lucky to have a supportive partner who shops with me and pretty much goes everywhere with me, but...you know.\n\nI feel like some of you can relate.\n\nI wont become hikikomori tho. :P I still love outside world, walking, seeing water, and would want to run a marathon one day! (Yes me, designated human donut)  Just felt the anxiety today and wanted to share. \n\nThank's for reading. &lt;3 \n\nI hope you have visited the outside world this week and got to enjoy it.

I've been unwell for a while (probably began around 2006, peaked in 2010 and I've been unable to work or continue with school since then). Prior to my sleep studies I was given a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and I fulfill the criteria. I also went down the Lyme route and after 5 years of treatment I had little improvement. I've had 5 sleep studies (2 with MSLTs) and my sleep specialist diagnosed me with Idiopathic Hypersomnia. On average my score was around 4 minutes. The first one I slept for all 5 naps, the most recent I slept for 4 (someone texted me right as I was falling asleep otherwise it would have been 5). During the most recent study I had 1 episode of REM (and a dream). My night time sleep seems to be getting worse as time goes on-- I had an altered but generally normal sleep architecture during my first sleep study back in 2010, the second last study showed very little REM, and the last study showed 0 (just the short episode during the nap).   \n\n\nI do have pain, as well as POTS, and brain fog, and other neurological symptoms, so I wouldn't discount the CFS diagnosis. But CFS patients typically have normal MSLTs, and I've had two very abnormal ones. I wouldn't discount the IH diagnosis, but the thing is, I don't really consider myself to feel \"sleepy\"-- I just feel tired, and my sleep is unrefreshing, so I don't bother to nap. (Though I can nap if I try, apparently.) I just live in this chronic state of exhaustion. My question, I guess, is do people who have been diagnosed with IH have other symptoms such as pain? Has anyone else had reduced REM? And can you have IH but not feel sleepy? Every time I read about IH it seems like everyone is so sleepy, constantly napping, falling asleep, sleeping for very long periods, and I don't seem to fit the bill. \n\nSome other possibly relevant information: I currently take 20 mg of Adderall, which helps a bit. In the past I've taken modafinil, ritalin, and modafinil + ritalin, and gone long periods unmedicated as I have trouble with stimulants due to the POTS.

Since then, I have been taking Nuvigil. It works OK-ish. It's certainly way better than being completely un-medicated. So recently I told my Doctor that I need to switch medications. Nuvigil takes away the sleepiness and brain fog but does nothing for the fatigue. So he was going to try and get me on Xyrem. Insurance denied it saying they wanted me to try dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate first. So a few days ago I was proscribed 30mg of Adderall. It actually works pretty well. Took care of all my symptoms with only minor side effects. But I've heard Adderall can be dangerous long term. It can be addictive and it's really easy to build a tolerance to it. But I wouldn't wanna go lower than 30mg because it was effective but not super effective. Also, I tend to crash off of it at around 3:30 in the afternoon which is unfortunate.

It seemed to start with mono and then just never end. I honestly didn't know anything about IH and after all of the sleep tests and blood work the doctor didn't really say anything other than \"You have Idiopathic Hypersomnia\" and then he prescribed me Nuvigil. I lived a few hours from my doctor and had no social or medical support during this time, so when the first couple weeks of medicine made me feel like my heart would explode, I just stopped taking it. I was having a better period when I tried Nuvigil, so when I quit taking it I just decided to struggle on.\n\nI've known for a long time now that this was the wrong choice and I need proper medication. I'm in a very intense masters program and can't sit through a single class or homework session without falling asleep. I'm going to go visit the school doctor and hope they will work off of my prior diagnosis. I'm nervous because I think not taking the medicine for so long may sort of invalidate the original diagnosis. I'm also unsure of how to proceed with medication. I know having a proper sleep regimen can be a big help, but that's truly impossible here. I work 2 jobs and spend a minimum of 12 hours at school everyday. I didn't have a great experience with Nuvigil and am looking to hear from others. What stimulant do you take? How long did it take for your body to adjust? Any advice when talking to a doctor about an old diagnosis of IH? \n\nThanks very much!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1015, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hoping for Medication Input - 24 (f) IH Diagnosed", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557548067, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/blcb4z/hoping_for_medication_input_24_f_ih_diagnosed/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "montycat420", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2j7a3hew", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1556850249, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/bk3bra/had_my_mslt_today/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bk3bra", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/bk3bra/had_my_mslt_today/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1556850250, "score": 7, "selftext": "Wow so I have a nap for the last 20 years.

Endocrinologist says my thyroid numbers are fine. GP says I'm not anemic. Sleep doc was baffled by the thirst symptom, which is why he referred me to the endo in the first place. My sodium is usually slightly low, but not enough that my army of doctors has ever said anything about it (this is apparently common with bupropion).\n\nI thought it might be adrenal related, but Endo checked my cortisol and said there's no problem there. They did an MRI of my pituitary and hypothalamus before my sleep test, and it was all clear.\n\nI really feel like I'm losing my mind. Endo suggested that maybe \"it's all in my head\", and I thought, well no, because then I wouldn't be having physiological symptoms like thirst... but it turns out there is also a thing where your psyche tricks you into thinking you've got something stuck in your throat.\n\nBut it was the psychiatrist who referred me for the sleep study, so I feel like I'm just going in circles.\n\nOh, and to further complicate matters, these days you can't even Google whether symptoms of horny and thirsty are related because \"thirsty\" has taken on a new meaning and 90% of results are porn. -head desk-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVirtual hugs and any advice appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1007, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Some other weird symptoms and I don't know what's related to what anymore :-(", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1556641727, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/birhm2/some_other_weird_symptoms_and_i_dont_know_whats/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "rixue", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_n1kpi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1556432927, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/bi8fsq/hypersomnia_foundation_educational_meeting_2019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bi8fsq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/bi8fsq/hypersomnia_foundation_educational_meeting_2019/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1556432928, "score": 3, "selftext": "Not sure if everyone is aware, but the Hypersomnia Foundation is hosting an educational meeting in Seattle on June 29th.

Reading really has helped me feeling less like the laziest of folks around. Thought I was just \"lazy\" or missing something or whatever, I mean, you know the drill, everyone thinks that. I can't work properly because of this bs, I was even denied a job after an internship despite the good work output. They promptly encouraged me to get a hold of the \"handicap\" label-thingy in my country so the companies don't get hurt financially while I'm compensated, which I totally get, otherwise I'm considered a normal employee and get punished for my massively unreliable presence. I didn't know I was THIS sick before the internship, though to be perfectly honest, I've been struggling most of my life, lol...\n\nI had my suspicions and had to change sleep doctors when one of them prescribed me anti-anxiety meds and not believing me... Insane. I just went to the hospital and kinda forced my way in. Finally got a doctor that didn't question how good or bad I felt, just ran their own Q&amp;A, got a polysomnography and the results came in : freakin' IH. Invited to take further exams to rule out whatever might cause it, if there is a cause. Prescribed Modafinil in the meantime.\n\nWell, shoot ! The pills work wonderfully !! Maybe a little too well !?\nStarted with the basic dose of 100mg. First day on it felt amazing. I couldn't sleep at night and it kinda fudged my carefully maintained schedule... After about a week of in and out, I started to feel some side effects, like massive headaches, feeling like I'm between two worlds (would rather be either sleepy or wakeful, tbh, not both !), excessive dryness, exhacerbated skin inflammation (works \"wonders\" with acne...), mild tacchycardia, and absence of hunger. Well... I figured I'd take 200mg for the day to feel more awake than half-dead, right ?\nIt worked.\nIn fact, it works better now that I'm on 200mg. Less to no side effects, take plently of water too. It's been around 4 weeks for this dosage. I take med vacations on weekends, let myself sleep as much as I want/need- \nHOWEVER. \nI have a teeeeerrible time stabilizing my schedule... Despite taking the med at around 8am, I sometimes get insane \"insomnias\" during the week, staying up until 4-5am if I'm not careful, til I just drop dead... I've tried to train to sleep through the Modafinil at night. It works sometimes, but still, there are moments where I focus so much, my brain ruminates for hours on end, and complete depletion of the effects is what makes it all stop. It seems to last for most of the day for me. Naturally, if I get forced to wake up and take the meds at 8am as usual, I turn into a freaking sleep deprived zombie. It's awful. I can function, at least, I just have to put my mind into it and don't notice too much how sleep deprived I am, but the body can't lie and needs the damn sleep, so eventually, I start to get neat symptoms like vertigo and brain fog. It knows, and I know, that the wakefulness is artificial.\nSince the med lasts that long, I tried to take it before sleep for a while, plus I sleep before it kicks in, but I started waking up feeling like some chemical was \"fighting\" the Modafinil or vice versa, and felt like I had a \"screen of sleepiness\" throughout the day despite the med. It's not like feeling both states at once, it felt more like, I was supposed to be sleepy, but I wasn't ? It was off-putting, so I reverted to the old morning med. I also thought about taking it at around 5-6am instead, and go back to sleep, but the above feeling just tells me it probably won't work and fudge me up another way.\n\nThe first 2 days of the week on Modafinil feel okay, but the rest feels progressively like hell, because of sleep deprivation or something. And when I'm off it on weekends, I realize just how sleepy I really am (like before treatment, but without being used to it) and can't even think/work then. It also reminds me how I still need my daily 12h of sleep, despite the wakefulness... I sleep around 8 hours a day in the week. Any less and I'm dead, which happens because of the med !\nThat, and I still don't know what would happen in real condition in a job... Last time I worked, all my IH symptoms got a thousand times worse and forced me to get diagnosed, so idk.\n\nAny tips on how to deal with Modafinil and its hyperinstinct/hyperfocus abilities VS need for 12h of sleep regardless ? Especially the long lasting profiles ? I have a quick metabolism, but this one stays forever, it's mind-boggling.\n\nHow do you even take Modafinil ? Is there a better way to take it other than in the morning, without it disturbing sleep schedules so much ?\nI've been contemplating sleeping pills to level it out. I also have hypotension, so it's always been crazy easy for me to sleep on anything/feel relaxed, even on energizing stuff.\n\nThanks in advance...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 994, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Recently diagnosed, prescribed Modafinil, but struggling with schedule...", "updated_utc": 1556184332, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/bgsiak/recently_diagnosed_prescribed_modafinil_but/"}, {"author": "Frodis_Caper", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11g53o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1556043934, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/bgjtom/mom_of_teen_with_ih_maybe/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "bgjtom", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/bgjtom/mom_of_teen_with_ih_maybe/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1556043935, "score": 7, "selftext": "Hi everyone. This has been a 2 1/2 year battle so I will try to sum things up.   \n\n\n2 1/2 years ago, my now 15 year old daughter had something like mono. Not sure what. She was a straight A student, athlete, etc. But then we could not get her up in the morning for school. She cried when I would take her to lacrosse practice because she was so tired. We did all the tests - sleep, Lyme, thyroid, blah, blah, blah. We FINALLY got to see a specialist in Chronic Fatigue last month. Yeah, he said it's not CFS, but IH and maybe some  Ehlers-Danlos symptoms. He put her on Ritalin which made her sick to her stomach, but it seemed to help some. She does not have depression - she has been checked for that multiple times.   \n\n\nWe followed up with a sleep doctor who told us it was NOT IH and to stop the Ritalin. He has us doing this one month reset of her sleep cycle with waking up and going to bed at consistent times, using light therapy, and exercise. It has been about three weeks and she is exhausted. The brain fog never seems to go away and her grades are suffering because she cannot concentrate. She is doing only three classes - one is just communicating with the teacher and the other two are homebound.  \n\n\nI can't help but think the sleep doctor is wrong. But I thought maybe CFS was the culprit earlier because nothing else made sense. But I am afraid to say it's IH because every time we think we have an answer, we turn out to be wrong.   \n\n\nI guess I am looking for advice or if this sounds like IH to you guys or your stories or something. We do have a followup in a month with sleep doctor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been hounding her about schoolwork because she is a freshman in high school and she wants to be either a doctor or work in psych research. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you read this far, thanks.

I have epilepsy, panic attacks, sleep apnea, RLS and IH....I'm sure I'm forgetting something. That's enough of the pitty party though.

It was enough to keep me from falling asleep at random times throughout the day, but I was still tired. I've recently been put on Ritalin LA 20 mg. It works great for the first half of the day, but at about 1:00 every day I feel the crash coming and by 4:00 I'm completely exhausted and fighting sleep....and mean and irritable, fortunately my husband is understanding. So, I just wanted to see if any of you guys have taken Ritalin and what your experience was with it. Also, any tips/advice about this disorder is very much welcomed and appreciated.

Drowsy day in, day out every day for the last 4 years. Not having the mental energy to do anything beyond the minimum. I used to pride myself on my intelligence. Brain fog and the all the symptoms of sleep deprivation have put an end to that. I can't think straight, concentrate on anything for longer than a few minutes, forget what people tell me minutes after being told. It's so bad I get bored and frustrated at my own internal dialogue and do anything I can to distract myself from my own dull, groggy thoughts. I've lost friendships over this disease because I can struggle to maintain even a simple conversation with any semblance of charm. \n\nI planned on going to medical school when I was younger. Back then I thought I was hot shit and wouldn't have an issue getting in. I got near perfect SAT score and into a good school and thought I was all set with the rest of my life to look forward to. I had ambition and pride. Now I just slog through my engineering courses, knowing there's no way I could manage the dedication and long hours it takes to become a doctor. Even if I somehow slipped through the cracks of admission I'd probably kill countless patients because of how my mental deterioration affected my judgement. \n\nCan't even get my own parents to acknowledge my own disease and had to learn most of what I know online because even my doctor seems clueless about this illness. Sometimes it makes me wonder if I'm just imagining everything, like I've really always been this tired and stupid. How in the hell does something like this still happen with millions of years of evolution? It just seems like some cruel, implausible joke.

I was feeling pretty down about my situation and was trying to push myself to work even when I would normally call in.\n\nSo not this past week but the week before, I had missed Tuesday and Wednesday at work. Went in Thursday and was okay, but woke up Friday pretty tired. I had one adderall left (I normally take 3 a day), so I took it and showered and went to work. We had a party planned for after work and I really wanted to go, plus I can\u2019t afford missing three days in a week.\n\nI was okay the first couple hours, but my adderall wore off and my work was very monotonous, and I could feel the sleep coming over me. I took a walk, used the restroom and fell asleep on the toilet (woke up with my head almost touching the floor), got an energy drink and a candy bar I quickly ate, but nothing was working. My coworkers were picking up my slack as I could barely keep my eyes open, and I was trying to hold out for break. I figured going out into the cold and smoking a cig could help.\n\nI go on break, walk out to the road, stumbling the whole way there, and suddenly two if my coworkers, who don\u2019t smoke, were behind me. They said I looked bad, and told me to come back in so I could go home. They helped me back into the building, where a few more of them were waiting, and one said she had already spoke to my boss and told her I needed to go sleep. All of them were concerned, asking what I needed, telling me it\u2019s okay to leave and they understood. I tried calling my boyfriend to pick me up, since there\u2019s no way I could drive, but he didn\u2019t answer. My boss offered to take me home right away. She told me on the way that no one is mad, they understand that I can\u2019t help it, and they\u2019re just concerned for me and want me safe. They also said that if I felt better that afternoon I am still welcome to go to the party (which was at a bar across the street from my house).\n\nMost of them have seen me have sleep attacks, when I first started a couple years ago I didn\u2019t have medication, but my boss and some others had never seen how bad I get. They were all so compassionate and caring and didn\u2019t make me feel like it was my fault (like I just stayed up all night it was drunk or on something). My boss had to keep waking me up during the five minute drive because she didn\u2019t know the area, so she just kept talking and talking. I seriously cried when I got home over how nice they all were, and even though I wasn\u2019t feeling up to going to the party, I texted them and let them know I was available if anyone was too tipsy to drive. \n\nSorry this was so long, but i don\u2019t have many people in my life, and having so many people show me support meant a lot to me. I wanted to share something positive also, as I know it\u2019s hard to see the good with IH, but there are good people out there we can lean on.\n\nTLDR: Had a bad sleep attack at work. All my coworkers were super compassionate and supportive, and my boss even drove me home. As much as they joke about my IH, they do it out of love.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f",

Trying to keep them open is almost impossible because my vision goes blurryish as my eyes feel like they're going in separate directions and I have to muster enough strength for a really strong blink to try and reorient myself.\n\nIt seems to be in correlation with the heat.

I was diagnosed in November and honestly just feel hopeless at this point. I work 40hrs/wk and I feel like I sleep 90% of the remaining time. I haven't done laundry in months apart from a load or two at a time. I bag up trash in my apartment only for it to sit there because the walk downstairs seems so exhausting. I'm no longer anything even approaching a good pet owner and it kills me--I can love them to death and make sure they're fed (cats once a day and frogs I can manage to do once every week or so) but beyond that I can't figure out a way to make it work. I try to take shortcuts and spread myself evenly so that even if nothing ever gets fully done most things get a little bit of attention. I usually can get myself to shower once a week these days and even on days I manage that I've had to, on occasion, bring a chair into the shower with me just because standing that long makes me want to cry. I can't afford to cut down from full time at work (I'd lose my health insurance and ability to pay my bills).\n\nI've tried increasing adderall dosages and drinking caffeine but while that makes me physically awake it usually makes me feel so ill that nothing comes of it anyways. I don't feel depressed in terms of mood but I've tried 4 different antidepressants over the years anyways just in case - no effect. I've tried other stimulants. I've tried eating less, eating more, eating healthier, staying hydrated - nothing. I've tried limiting my sleep to anywhere from 6-10 hours in different instances (mostly unsuccessfully) and giving in to sleep thinking maybe if I catch up enough it'll make a difference (that usually leads to periods of sleeping 16+ hours at a time). I've tried taking it easy physically and I've tried exerting myself. At this point I don't know what else to try but I know that I don't feel like I'm really living under these conditions, and I don't know how other people make it work. I just push and push myself but at the end of the day I get nothing from it to show in my home life. I get 6-8 good hours per day if I'm lucky, and from that time I've built a stellar work reputation, but as soon as I come home I crash. I've quit my job twice in the past 6 months from exhaustion and stress over not physically being able to handle a work and home life but each time I rescind my two week notice before it's up because I realize it's not going to get better if I remove healthcare and money from the equation. I don't even dislike my job--I just can't handle having a job AND being a person but I don't see any way to have one without the other.\n\nI'm sorry if this is sad or pathetic or gross or desperate--but at this point I'm all of these things, and I really, really don't want to be.

This alone was incredibly uncomfortable to endure and it still hasn't completely worn off as of writing this post.\n\nParts of my brain seemed to become completely inaccessible to me. I could not feel anything except complete emptiness and ennui. I could not visualize images in my head anymore without expending tremendous mental effort. I frequently lost my train of thought completely. Memories that are normally easily accessible for me took a long time to conjure up or did not come to me at all. I forgot names and places and details dozens of times daily. It did not help with the depression at all and arguably made it even worse - I contemplated suicide on more than one occasion while under the effects of this medication, and could not stop dwelling on all of the things that I feel are wrong in my life.

We're trying to learn what we can while also starting her on the mondanafil.\n\nI have a few questions. My daughter is pretty upset and feels like the floor just gave out - understandably, it's a big diagnosis, so I'm wanting to make sure she gets the very best care and that we're on the right track here.\n\n1) What kind of doctor do you see for this? We went to a sleep specialist for the diagnosis, but I'm noting that some of you use a neurologist, is there a benefit? Any guidance to finding a knowledgeable neurologist? We are in the US if that is helpful. She sees a psychiatrist already and she worked through medication coordination.\n\n2) Has anyone previously been diagnosed with ADHD as a child and grown up to develop IH? I am not finding much literature on it (lots about ADHD and other sleep issues/disorders but not IH specifically). I'm curious what others' experiences were with this. I'm kicking myself because I viewed this sleepiness as part of the ADHD and it took entirely too long to realize that this was well beyond her normal ADHD symptoms. I don't doubt the ADHD diagnosis - she was the hyperest of hyper kids, there is a propensity for girls to not get noticed... but not her, lol. All sunshine and rainbows all day long as a young kid. \n\n3) Anything else we need to know or resources? This subreddit is amazing, she sent me a link a few days ago. &lt;3  Going through these resources as well: [https://www.hypersomniafoundation.org/newly-diagnosed/](https://www.hypersomniafoundation.org/newly-diagnosed/)\n\n4) Anything specific for parents/caregivers? It's so important to her to be independent, the dependence on me for waking and such is waring on our relationship.\n\nThank you - I appreciate how valuable your time is and willingness to provide input. &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3602, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Insights welcome :) ADHD?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/sc6358/insights_welcome_adhd/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "godotnyc", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_nv3wa", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1643073329, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/sc14d1/adderall_issues_help/", "gildings": {}, "id": "sc14d1", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1dc256e2-a17e-11e8-9e9a-0e976fd50694", "link_flair_text": "Medication", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/sc14d1/adderall_issues_help/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1643073340, "score": 1, "selftext": "Saw mt neurologist for the first time in over a year after various pandemic- and work-related issues kept me away and unmedicated. While he's not thrilled by the idea of Xywav he has promised to keep all possibilities on the table if I continue to be nonresponsive to stumulants and wakefulness drugs, and he agreed to prescribe me Sunosi since insurance will not approve Xywav without proof of failure. He also prescribed Adderall to me for the second time. The pharmacy filled the Adderall with no.problem but was \"out of Sunosi\" so I have to wait until Wednesday or Thursday to start my trial.\n\nMeanwhile, I've started back in Adderall. Last time I tried it I was on extended release. I didnt think it made a huge difference in my life but it helped worked a bit better than Vyvanse and much better than Nuvigil/Provigil (which did nothing at all)--it also had no side effects.\n\nSince I didn't experience much improvement on the XR he prescribed me standard generic amphetamine salts (10 mg) this time and told me to take 1-3 per day as needed. I'm having issues figuiring out the best routine and can use some advice.\n\n Yesterday I took one at 3 PM (right after getting the prescription) and another at 7. When I was ready for bed at 11 I started to get the shakes and to feel anxious and fluttery. I HAD to get to bed for work so I did something I NEVER do and took a spare lorazepam (1 mg) which is indicated for anxiety and is a mild sedative--I was prescribed this a couple years ago but it was too much for my mild issues and I'm now on a very low dose of amitriptyline most evenings before bed (I skipped it last night for obvious reasons). I fell asleeo shortly afterward.\n\nWhen I woke up at 8 I felt \"fine\" in the sense that I felt like I always do, tired, but no tachycardia or other issues. I reasoned that I took the Adderall too late and too close together and that I would be better on a normal schedule. So I took one at 8. I definitely felt more focused/slightly \"wired\" but no less fatigued. By 2 even the focus was gone so I figured it was time for dose 2 which I reasoned would get me to 8 PM.\n\nIt's 8 PM, and I'm experiencing the same thing as last night. Clearly I am \"coming down\" from this but considering they give this to children I don't understand why I would be feeling effects like I'm an addict chasing a high after only four doses in two days. I would take pill 3 but it's too late.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea of a good schedule for this? Tomorrow I figure I'll take dose 2 earlier before I \"need\" it so I can still have time for dose 3 if this happens again, but if I do that am I going to wake up in the middle of the night once it starts clearing my system? Do I just need to acclimate better ot am I going to deal with withdrawal every day I take this?\n\nAny advice/experience will help.\n\nAlso, to summarize--this was prescribed my my doctor and I have been diagnosed with IH for years.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3600, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Adderall issues, help!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/sc14d1/adderall_issues_help/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "rosakatzenpfoten", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ixw47iqh", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1643061162, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/sbxlys/do_any_of_you_suffer_from_dysthymic_disorder/", "gildings": {}, "id": "sbxlys", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "f5245e5c-0509-11e9-8cf7-0e8975bb3ebe", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/sbxlys/do_any_of_you_suffer_from_dysthymic_disorder/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "removed_by_category": "reddit", "retrieved_on": 1643061173, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3600, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do any of you suffer from Dysthymic Disorder?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/sbxlys/do_any_of_you_suffer_from_dysthymic_disorder/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dolphiniu", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8pmmca89", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1643009325, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/sbgfhg/goofy_side_effect_of_ritalin_and_lexapro/", "gildings": {}, "id": "sbgfhg", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7421e76e-050b-11e9-bd15-0e26af73d9e8", "link_flair_text": "Humor", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/sbgfhg/goofy_side_effect_of_ritalin_and_lexapro/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1643009335, "score": 1, "selftext": "Been on all the medication since September and I got diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia this january after two sleep tests (first one failed).\n\nOk but what i wanted to talk about is BRUH my heart rate exactly 30mins after taking (10mg)ritalin SKYROCKETS and I feel like I will do a backflip any moment but after another 30mins im back to normal but less sleepy and without such heavy eyelids.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3596, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Goofy side effect of Ritalin and Lexapro.

This was in 7th grade.\n\nHowever, the real trouble started at the beginning of my freshman year of high school.\n\nI would be extremely tired, and unable to get out of bed as before, even after sleeping for 7 -8 hours.\n\nI would get music looping in my head, driving me crazy. These were popular songs which I enjoyed.\n\nOver the period of this year, a severe \"brain fog\" began to develop, and I began to struggle in classes.\n\nMy anxiety skyrocketed to levels never seen before, talking to even my friends became impossible, my face would turn beet red when called on in class, even in subjects which I enjoyed.\n\nMy gaze and awareness were also affected, I would not be able to look normally at peoples faces as I was able to before. My eyes would abnormally fixate on their eyes, and I could see how weird it made them feel, they would avoid eye contact with me.\n\nI guess this would be considered \"hyperawareness.\"\n\nI should have told my parents right then and gotten a sleep study, but I didn't, and my struggles continued throughout all of high school.\n\nI stayed home and took online classes my first year of college, as my parents did not trust me to succeed alone at college. Here, I was able to sleep in for the first time in my life.\n\nDuring this year, I was getting around 10 -12 hours of sleep everyday.\n\nSlowly, the brain fog began to fade, and the anxiety began to lessen, as did the looping music, and my grades became straight A's, as opposed to the C's in high school.\n\nThe next year, (2019), I went to live on my own in college, and took in person classes.\n\nThis resulted in my averaging about 7-8 hours of sleep per night, and behold, the symptoms all came back. My grades dipped, and I am at home as I type this.\n\nAdditionally, over the past year, I have developed a blinking tic, and when I become tired, my left eye will shrink.\n\nAlso, after orgasm, I feel even more fatigued then usual, and the brain fog and anxiety, already horrible, gets worse.\n\nI also seem to have a gluten sensitivity- my stomach becomes very bloated and anxiety seems to get worse.\n\nI have gotten some blood tests done, seem to be normal, however, my liver is severely damaged, judging by the high level of liver enzymes.\n\nWe eat extremely heathy, minimal sugar/junk, I lift weights/run every other day, however my capacity to do this has also been severely affected.\n\nMy sleep seems to be normal to my knowledge, I am very skinny, and lightly snore, so don't meet the sleep apnea stereotype. I have also used an o2 smartwatch, which did not show any significant o2 desaturation.\n\nCould it be UARS?\n\nI know there is also a rare condition known as secondary narcolepsy, in which patients require 10+ hours of sleep. Could anyone provide any info on this?\n\nThis is all so weird, and I have not found anyone on the net with these kinds of symptoms or their level of extremity,\n\nFor the past 6 - 7 I have lost out on my life, and no idea what it is to live a normal life.\n\nCan someone please give me some ideas or steer me in the right direction??\n\nCould this all be solely attributed to uars, or is it only part of the picture?\n\nAny help would really be appreciated.\n\nThank you all so much.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3579, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Please help!

After trying a bunch of meds &amp; treatments, some of which were straight-up awful, and advocating for myself a ton, I managed to get an appointment with a sleep specialist at a top hospital in my city. She prescribed me Ritalin, and even at a low dose it was life-changing. \n\n\nSo that's great, but it's really hard to get information on Ritalin tolerance in hypersomnias &amp; whether tolerance breaks are necessary. My psychiatrist (I'm also managing depression which is in some sort of remission right now, and the sleep specialist wants to have the psychiatrist prescribe the Ritalin long-term) told me that I should take a tolerance break between semesters - basically stopping the med for a while to make sure I don't develop a tolerance. I'm currently doing that; I've become one with the couch most days and it's not very fun (and honestly kind of demoralizing)\n\n\nSome of the literature says that tolerance breaks are important for ADHD patients; other stuff not so much. I'm not sure if the tolerance break is misinformation, and since I research that in school I might look into the sources of that belief more, but anyway: what have your experiences been like with tolerance to stimulants &amp; the effects of taking breaks from them? do you have any info on whether tolerance breaks are useful? any advice is honestly helpful - I am very excited to be in a

A little background info about me: I\u2019m diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia and depression, as well as (undiagnosed but likely) ADHD-PI. I used to be on Wellbutrin XL (bupropion) 300mg, an NDRI. This was a miracle drug for me - sent my depression  and motivational anhedonia into remission with little to no adverse side effects. Also kept me feeling gently awake on normal days (in a non-jittery way like caffeine and a non-hyperfocused, antisocial way like on Modafinil). On extra tired days, I would supplement with Modafinil and/or caffeine, but the Wellbutrin was what primarily got my life together again. After a few months however, I had a Wellbutrin-induced seizure and was forced to taper off. \n\nI really didn\u2019t want to go on a traditional serotonergic antidepressant (like an SSRI) because of its sedating effects, as well as other unwanted side effects like sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and emotional blunting. So I asked my doctor for Sunosi, which seems to be the only NDRI on the market that\u2019s similar to Wellbutrin.\n\nI started on 75mg, which did practically nothing for me. For the first time today I took 150mg, which is the standard dose for people with Narcolepsy. And wow, do I feel amazing. \n\nSunosi feels like Wellbutrin (300mg) in terms of its mood-lifting effects, but it also is more wakefulness-promoting. Now I have a bunch of questions that I\u2019m unable to find online because it\u2019s such a novel drug (it was approved in 2019).\n\nSo here are my questions, if anyone is able to answer or provide insight:\n\n1. Is it better to take Sunosi everyday? Does it \u201cbuild up\u201d in the body like other antidepressants (i.e., Wellbutrin) do? The Sunosi website doesn\u2019t specify, and my psychiatrist seems to think it\u2019s more like Modafinil where you take it as needed.\n\n2. Is Sunosi extended-release, like Wellbutrin XL, or short-release? How long does it last for, and do people taking Sunosi take it all at once or in two doses to extend its effects?\n\n3. Why is Sunosi not considered an antidepressant? It\u2019s mechanism of action isn\u2019t well-known (as seems to be the case with all stimulants/ADs), but the only difference I\u2019ve found is that Wellbutrin is a weaker inhibitor and also inhibits acetylcholine. I found somewhere that they originally made it to treat depression, but it was shown to cause insomnia, so they made it a Narcolepsy med instead. So could it technically be an antidepressant for narcoleptics who don\u2019t experience insomnia on it? Or should I try to find a supplemental antidepressant that doesn\u2019t make me extra sleepy and lethargic?\n\n4. For anyone who has tried Sunosi, what has your experience been? Can anyone speak to the differences between Sunosi and Wellbutrin? There seems to be a lack of information out there since it\u2019s so new, so any information on personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\nThanks for reading! Hopefully I can get some answers. Also going to book an appointment with my sleep specialist soon, who will probably have more insight than my psychiatrist who prescribed it.\n\nTL;DR: Forced off of Wellbutrin (bupropion) because of seizure. Trying Sunosi now, but have many questions about how it works/how it\u2019s different from Wellbutrin that I couldn\u2019t find answers to on the internet.", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone!

I found somewhere that they originally made it to treat depression, but it was shown to cause insomnia, so they made it a Narcolepsy med instead. So could it technically be an antidepressant for narcoleptics who don\u2019t experience insomnia on it? Or should I try to find a supplemental antidepressant that doesn\u2019t make me extra sleepy and lethargic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has tried Sunosi, what has your experience been? Can anyone speak to the differences between Sunosi and Wellbutrin? There seems to be a lack of information out there since it\u2019s so new, so any information on personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading! Hopefully I can get some answers. Also going to book an appointment with my sleep specialist soon, who will probably have more insight than my psychiatrist who prescribed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Forced off of Wellbutrin (bupropion) because of seizure. Trying Sunosi now, but have many questions about how it works/how it\u2019s different from Wellbutrin that I couldn\u2019t find answers to on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Narcolepsy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rhx3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Narcolepsy", "subreddit_subscribers": 16460, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "top", "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Sunosi Questions?", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "ups": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/rohxtk/sunosi_questions/", "user_reports": [], "view_count": null, "visited": false, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}], "domain": "self.Narcolepsy", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/roia9a/sunosi_help/", "gildings": {}, "id": "roia9a", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1dc256e2-a17e-11e8-9e9a-0e976fd50694", "link_flair_text": "Medication", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/roia9a/sunosi_help/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1640469201, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3526, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Sunosi Help!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "/r/Narcolepsy/comments/rohxtk/sunosi_questions/", "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/Narcolepsy/comments/rohxtk/sunosi_questions/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Thesaurus-23", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_80xjc87l", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1640374012, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/rnt1ag/newbie/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rnt1ag", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b0a7e18a-a17d-11e8-88ac-0e14fa46b726", "link_flair_text": "Advice Request", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/rnt1ag/newbie/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1640374023, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi!

The doctor offered me no treatment because of this, despite me having a textbook clinical picture of IH. I've had symptoms since I was probably 8 years old, but my doctor said it does not seem to be due to a primary sleep disorder and is probably secondary to my depression (which I didn't develop until I was 14 and is now in documented remission). Anyways, after my normal PSG/MSLT he told me to get mental health help and to come back if it gets worse. I'm really discouraged because, as I'm sure you all understand, my symptoms are unbearable. I'm currently in nursing school and don't think I can successfully continue without treatment.\n\nTL;DR I was dismissed after a normal MSLT with no treatment, despite every clinical sign of IH according to the sleep doctor.

Falling asleep during my 7-minute commute a couple times. Falling asleep at the table, in public, when out to lunch with friends. On a flight during this pandemic, with bars closed, &amp; no alcohol service on board. At work, in the middle of an interaction. These things are relevant, because I'm laying the groundwork of this rant-y post, &amp; the questions I have. \nNot only has this horribly affected my life, but unlike other health issues, the general public doesn't understand it, &amp; treats you as less-than. Very judgey. They assume you're a sloppy drunk, or on drugs, or whatever. (Anyone is free to live their lives, but it's embarrassing to be written off as a slob, when you're totally sober.)\nSo, after both a poly &amp; MSLT, my doctor prescribed Sunosi. Feel free to attack me if I'm wrong. But from what I understand, this drug sounds like it's still under patent. There is no generic version to be had. I don't like stimulants, &amp; am more enthused about wakefulness promoting drugs, with little to no side effects. I requested the least invasive treatment. The first drug mentioned isn't ideal for me, as it interferes with hormonal birth control. \nSo, my doctor said this medication was very expensive, &amp; prescribed 15 pills, because Sunosi's website offers a voucher for a free 15 day trial. In that time, I'd see how well it works for me, get insurance approval, &amp; go from there. \nWell. It's working AMAZINGLY well! I'm feeling human &amp; present for the first time in almost two years! No jittery side effects! Then my insurance required pre-authorization. Yesterday, they rejected the claim. My doctor appealed it, &amp; a rep at United Healthcare gave me a one-time override, so I can get one more refill, for the co-pay I would've paid if this prescription were covered: $90.\nSo, I'll get up to a month &amp; half with this drug. The out-of-pocket cost for this medication without insurance coverage is a whopping $900/month! It's clearly unsustainable. Insurance wants me to spend up to two months on a CPAP before approving medication. But I wanted the least invasive treatment. I don't want machines. I want to just feel normal, &amp; Sunosi has helped tremendously. If Sunosi accomplishes this, then I clearly don't need machines.\nSo now, all I think of is that in a certain number of days, the clarity I have now will fade, &amp; I'll be absorbed back into my comatose life. \nHas anyone else been through this situation with insurance, or had success with accessing the right treatment? If not, what does life look like with other treatments?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3471, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Sunosi, &amp; being assaulted by insurance.

During this period I stopped taking my medication, stopped going to the doctor, and the MAJORITY of my issues with sleepiness seemed to taper off to a manageable amount. I still had episodes of EDS, but, compared to being on 2nd shift, was a night and day difference. \n\nWell fast-forward to about 2 months ago, I recently got promoted at my job but working a rotating 3 on, 3 off on night shift. All of the same issues I had leading up to my diagnosis 7 years ago are all starting to come back. I big problem is working the last day of my rotation, immediately going home and sleeping for 8/9 hours, stay awake for about 4 or 5 hours, and then proceed to sleep for another 8/9 hours. \n\nI'm leaning towards this being just shift work disorder, but, I am no doctor. I still wonder if I was misdiagnosed or if I just have a mild case. My MSLT still showed me entering REM sleep in under 5 minutes or what my doctor would refer to as micro sleep even though I never felt like I had fallen asleep.   \n\nAnyways, sorry for the rant.

I'm 18 and taking a gap year before I go to college because I want to start up a decent savings fund. My only problem right now is all of the jobs I could get with only a high school diploma aren't very IH friendly. I work at a Dunkin' Donuts in my area, which has a very fast paced environment, and I feel like I can't keep up on most days. It's not that I'm trying to be slow or anything, I swear I'm really trying to get my work done! I just get so drained out, and when I'm coming home after work I feel like I'm almost falling asleep while driving and am too tired to do anything when I get home. I feel so bad at work too because everyone is rushing around and I'm just moving around all sluggish, then when I get home my little brothers wanna do something or I have to pick my sister up from theater practice and I just can't. I feel like if I worked in less of a fast paced environment, then I might feel a little more energized and might be able to keep up the pace more while working. But of course I also face the fact that a job too slow paced could put me to sleep.\ud83d\ude05 Hence my dilemma. Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone knew of any places I might be able to work at that could have a decent pace? OR if you have any tips for a young girl who recently started working and recently discovered she has IH? Anything will help!

I've dealt with excessive tiredness and un-refreshing naps for about 10 years. I have many of the commonly listed symptoms - un-refreshing sleep, sleep 9-10+ hours per night, brain fog, plus some others that may or may not be related - poor coordination, conversations in my sleep w/ no memory, and I'm a deep sleeper (really loud noises in the night don't always wake me up!). Thankfully, these issues have never been debilitating, but I'm tired of being tired and it's very frustrating! Caffeine, exercise, good sleep hygiene - none of it seems to help! All my labs run by my PCP have been normal. Finally got in to see a sleep specialist and got an overnight sleep study w/ MSLT ordered. I had the study done but feel frustrated and wonder if it's a false negative. I was anxious about the results leading up to and during the test, did not feel as tired as I typically do, got distracted by leftover adhesive stuck on my face (from the cannula to measure if I stopped breathing the night before), and the last nap - which I did not fall asleep during - was calculated in my average sleep latency time. The impression said \"significant hyper somnolence.\" I have reached out to my sleep specialist to try to discuss this before my follow-up in about 6 weeks, but nothing back yet. Any ideas or advice?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nALSO a question for everyone on here - do you feel your symptoms vary with different context? For example, I feel much more tired - sometimes uncontrollably falling asleep - at different times or situations. While driving or reading, after eating, after showering, afternoon/early evening, or during/after a weekend outing (I can become \\~exhausted\\~ after running relaxed errands for 2 hours).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Long-term symptoms suggestive of IH, debatable MSLT results, overall frustrated and don't know what to do. Does anyone else get extra tired during certain times/activities?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3442, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Undiagnosed, strong suspicion for IH, false negative MSLT?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/r0ugrx/undiagnosed_strong_suspicion_for_ih_false/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Bongbart", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_t2at2", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1637584978, "crosspost_parent": "t3_qzdhi8", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "DuaneFarmer32", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fdzqgcw1", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1637557098.0, "created_utc": 1637557098.0, "discussion_type": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "i.redd.it", "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "id": "qzdhi8", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "notverified", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Not yet verified"}], "link_flair_text": "Not yet verified", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_qzdhi8", "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 2, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/Awwducational/comments/qzdhi8/the_southern_viscacha_is_a_species_of_rodent/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "GIFvbh7tZXVc89Fwj_aJupY158ZOcr6RLfVNrGwr5eo", "resolutions": [{"height": 103, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/o0558oedw2181.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3e34e450dbb292fe69e3258916309de1c913c3c", "width": 108}, {"height": 206, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/o0558oedw2181.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19256ebe53139a62dc7ed7903f43c1fed5e8871c", "width": 216}, {"height": 305, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/o0558oedw2181.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b844524f758985cbba6054f20f0dcf82e6b6a09", "width": 320}, {"height": 611, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/o0558oedw2181.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13210db8bb18947456e73d4f9fddbf97e1b6cea9", "width": 640}, {"height": 917, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/o0558oedw2181.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e380ddd031559de8a54d4388ba6472b6305231c1", "width": 960}], "source": {"height": 917, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/o0558oedw2181.png?auto=webp&amp;s=1a157376064bf83248b21f67c3e98df7c5ada778", "width": 960}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "removed_by": null, "removed_by_category": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 927, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "selftext_html": null, "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Awwducational", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vi0z", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Awwducational", "subreddit_subscribers": 3223984, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "confidence", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Z_iNg44uhnNyYSyR5gcTQhzqX-kNxnn3P034KHzI7_Y.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 133, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "The Southern Viscacha is a species of rodent native to Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru.

I\u2019m incredibly hard to wake up and for years have used the iconic sonic bomb alarm with bed shaker and can still sleep through this. \n\nI trialed modafinil and armodafinil and they helped a little bit but I had an allergic reaction and had to stop taking them. My psych didn\u2019t feel comfortable trying anything else without the MSLT.\n\nIt\u2019s taken my life, my personality, my abilities to think. Im on thin ice at work and I work remotely. They say I\u2019m inconsistent and I want to scream that it isn\u2019t my fault and the very nature of this illness is inconsistency. I\u2019m trying so hard. I have the nighttime routine, the daylight lamp, the Alexa lightbulbs auto set to come on. My husband will help me suck up a little coffee after my first awakening to ease my transition to being awake. I\u2019m here to vent and hopefully get some words of support from people who understand. My shame and guilt feel like a 100 pound weight I never let go of. I\u2019m so hopeful and so scared.

I\u2019m so frustrated and have been dealing with hypersomnia for over 3 years now. My rhuematologist says it\u2019s all in my head and my GP just prescribed me vitamin D. A year ago I went to a sleep doctor \u2014 had both overnight and MSLT done but they came back normal. I didn\u2019t fall asleep even once during the naps because although I\u2019m exhausted, I\u2019m not usually one to fall asleep \u201con demand.\u201d Sleep doc said there was nothing he could do for me because it clearly wasn\u2019t narcolepsy or sleep apnea. And that was that. I don\u2019t know who else to go to. \n\nI\u2019m so tired that I can barely function. I\u2019m falling asleep at my desk at work. I\u2019m falling asleep while driving. I frequently have to take a 4-5 hour naps within just a few hours of waking up in the morning \u2014 which is doable because I work part time from home but it causes me a lot of stress thinking I\u2019ll be caught. The other day I accidentally ran a red light\u2026 I think I was micro sleeping or something. There are times when I literally have to force my eyes open as wide as possible while driving as tears fall down my cheeks just so they don\u2019t close. On the weekends, I sleep 17-18 hours at a time and cannot wake up no matter how many alarms I set. I always have stuff I want to do and get done after work or on the weekends, but I usually end up too tired to do them.

I suspect this is a common journey of \"seeking\" for those that are relatively new to the diagnosis (for me it's been a few months since dx). \n\nI'm curious if any of you experience what you might call \"crashes\" (don't know what other word to use). When I'm having crashes (some last a few hours, some a few days, the most has been a week), my stimulant medication just does NOT work. I feel very sleepy/drowsy, very cognitively \"slow\" (like nothing is firing in there), very \"low and depressed\" feeling, and my body feels like it weighs 1,000 pounds (worst in upper arms and legs; also occasionally hard to hold my head up). The thought of doing anything active is out of the question. Sometimes even just moving from couch to another room is a \"no\" from my brain. No other symptoms (no sore throat, fever, swollen nodes, etc.)\n\nTypically if I can \"rest\" enough, I finally come out of it, and I'm back to baseline - still with drowsy symptoms here and there, but my medication works like it is supposed to. \n\nI've cross posted a version of this on the CFS board with an ask to help determine how to track whether this might be what is considered \"PEM\" (post exertional malaise). But, it would help me to know if any of my fellow IH'ers out there have similar experiences. \n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH in advance - I know how much energy it can take to answer these questions, and I so appreciate any input you can provide to me.

All I was told from my sleep study was that I slept throughout the 7-8 hour night study, and slept during all five of my daily naps and was able to fall asleep within 3 minutes. If I remember correctly they also said I dreamt during all 5. \nWhen my doctor gave me my diagnosis he said it in a way where he was pretty sure of it. \n\n\nI started on 200mg of Armodafinil but it's only helped a little. \n\nWhat's making me wonder if I really have narcolepsy is that my experience with cataplexy doesn't exactly match the definition of it. \n\nAbout once a week or so I'll have periods where my muscles gradually start to feel more and more weak, where my face, arms, hands, neck, become drooped and it feels like I can't support my own weight. This usually takes several minutes to reach its worst point and can last up to a half an hour. \n\n\nIt's not necessarily triggered by strong emotions, but it can happen sometimes. It usually occurs when I'm very stressed, or suddenly switch from one thing to another, like going to a different room. \n\nThe worst episode that's ever happened is once I was walking in my kitchen and I suddenly felt horribly weak and spacey, and kind of slid back against the wall and laid there for a good half hour. (I felt crappy before hand but it still happened all of a sudden.) It felt like I was dreaming but was totally aware of what was going on around me, and could hear clearly. Eventually it felt like I was losing connection to all of my limbs and they weren't even there. My roomate tried to talk to me but I could only manage to get out a few word response. \n\nIn the end I gained enough will power and really had to force myself to get up and was able to get to my room.\n\nI'll also frequently experience muscle twitching, usually in my face, and feel almost as if my muscles are \"bubbling.\" \n\nWhen I usually have a less severe episode its as if I have no strength in my body and can't support myself. But I can will power through it most of the time. \n\nBut I've had people tell me that cataplexy is usually more instant and like a disconnect with your brain and your muscles. And will resolve faster. \n\nInfo:  I can sleep up to 14 hours all at once, and probably up to 18 hours a day if going back to bed. But I'm always fatigued and sleep is usually refreshing once I wake up, but fades after about a half hour or so. I've been woken up while I'm dreaming sometimes and it seems like my dreams are playing over into my wake state. I'm also frequently spacey or dizzy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts?

I decide to spend some extra time and actually try to read doctor's handwriting and see if it gives me any new information beyond lab results. And boy oh boy, did I find some interesting details. Turns out even at the age of 9, I showed symptoms of tachycardia and had an enlarged heart. When I was NINE! Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure it's far from normal, especially since I was completely healthy oterwise. Either way, my parents apparently either shruged it off or forgot to look into it, despite my complains about being constantly tired. \n\nIt's one thing to know you weren't diagnosed for years because nothing showed up on tests that were run, but another to know you actually had proof that something was off, but your parents just did literally nothing about it (it wasn't a money issue for sure). It frustrates me so much to realize that my never ending tiredness could've been fixed years ago (not confirmed yet, but likely), if only people in charge would have actually do their fucking job and look after me.

I took a medical leave to get my \u201cexcessive tiredness\u201d figured out because I kept failing exams in my masters program and couldn\u2019t stay awake for most of my lectures. \n\nI\u2019ve always been a mostly A and B student, and while I struggled with my symptoms in undergrad, I had my little hacks and tricks I used to stay awake or keep myself from looking \u201clazy\u201d (stepping out of lecture and doing jumping jacks in the hallway when no one was there, pinching myself, eating very crunchy food during class, etc). I also kept myself very busy so that I was on my feet constantly, which helped keep me awake. Fast forward to fall of 2020; two sleep studies later I got diagnosed with IH. After a trial and failure of taking adderall, I\u2019m slowly adjusting to nuvigil but my school is basically telling me that I can\u2019t fail an exam or they\u2019re going to remove me from the program.\n\nI\u2019ve done everything I can think of to modify my lifestyle; I got on a rigorously consistent schedule, exercised every morning for 45 min, ate more protein, tried to drink coffee (which made things worse so I stopped), tried power napping, taking extra B12 and Vitamin D, cut gluten out of my diet for 5 years (partially because of IBS), etc. you name it, and I\u2019ve probably done it.\n\nI always wanted to be a higher level medical provider but now I\u2019m considering just going to accelerated nursing route so I can get licensed and work as an RN without struggling my life away as a physician trying to hide/be ashamed of my symptoms. \n\nThis is the first time I\u2019ve actually had to make a life decision based on a medical condition (I have asthma and have been taking iron supplements for iron deficiency for years) and I\u2019m feeling torn; I feel weak for thinking of \u201cgiving up\u201d on pursuing something I\u2019ve worked so hard for. At the same time, with not doing so well in my PA program I\u2019m worried that I will barely eke through it even if I pass my exams and that I will barely function during my rotations. I only did one semester of my program so it\u2019s not too late to switch trajectories. I just don\u2019t want my symptoms to become unmanaged a year in and have spent nearly 50K on my education for it to be jeopardized by my IH. I still want to work in healthcare, which is why I\u2019m considering going to RN route; it\u2019s just that I always pictured myself as a future PA.\n\nI guess I wanted to hear from someone currently working as a PA or NP (or even an RN) and how they\u2019re managing their IH. Anyone who works a demanding job with shifts upward of 12-16 hours and how they manage can also provide their input.

I could tell my friends and family, but they will never understand. \n\nWith writing this, I hope to get some interactions back from you guys (Dm or comments. no pity though i promise it\u2019s not a sob story :P). But it would really mean so so much to me.   So here goes:\n\nI am F, 18yo and a freshman in college. I\u2019ve always struggled with fatigue and sleepiness; as a child I\u2019ve been able to sleep anywhere at anytime: the floor, car, table, you name it. In retrospect my problems probably began in 7th grade. I remember beginning that summer, i started waking up around 12pm, but i thought it was average. Normal teen things. My family just thought i was lazy, even though I did sports, volunteered, and was an honor roll student all my life. In terms of mental health I never had acknowledgement, my family is pretty traditional and never attended school (yep, not even elementary); i\u2019m first gen. in all aspects. \n\nStarting highschool, my fatigue became noticeable. I fell asleep during my classes and in the car to and from school. I always tried so hard to not fall asleep, especially in classes I struggled in. I\u2019d \u2018go to the restroom\u2019 and take a walk around campus, i started smuggling energy drinks to school, i\u2019d dig my nails into my skin to wake myself up. But i always fell asleep, everytime i did, i always felt so guilty. Why was I so weak? I thought it was because i slept 6-7 hours every night and stayed up doing schoolwork after sports practice. I felt deficient; everyone else could go about sleeping 7 hours but not me. On Fridays, I\u2019d get home and sleep from 6pm-12pm the next day. My mom would get angry at me everytime she saw me nap at home. The days I didn\u2019t nap, I would lay down at home for about 2 hours doing nothing. During those hours I\u2019d fight off the urge to nap as well as I could, but rested to try and ease my fatigue. Might as well call it a nap i guess. \n\nWhen it was really bad, I vividly remember going to bed at night, And as I put my head on the pillow I would begin to cry. Tears of joy. I was so happy to be able to sleep. \u201cFinally, I can sleep. I just wish I could sleep forever and never wake up. I just want to not be tired anymore\u201d. Looking back, those were the dark days (physically), only made tolerable by my friends at school. I thought i was doing the right thing: putting education first and giving 110%. I don\u2019t know how i survived without passing out, but i did. I guess I\u2019m strong for that. I never want to go back to that suffering again. \n\nOnce covid, hit I stayed at home and made it a habit to sleep 10 hours a night. I was a senior, I wanted to get better before I got to college campus. During the summer, i figured my fatigue was a problem since i was getting in good hours but still felt bad. I became worried, and was able to convince my mom to get me tested. After 2 months of waiting, I  finally got scheduled for an MSLT in October and was diagnosed OSA. I was sad, relieved and shocked: i thought i was just making it all up. Because that is how everyone had made me feel whenever i tried explaining that i was tired. But I felt terrible knowing I had to use a mask for the rest of my life. I thought to myself \u2018What hood am i if I can\u2019t even breathe at night properly\u2019. As the weeks passed though, I became attached to my machine, hopeful that this was the answer to my fatigue. These past few months i\u2019ve been using my machine religiously. But I began noticing Nothing had really changed at all, even though my apnea had decreased substantially. I started becoming really depressed. I had no answers. I felt sorry for myself in all the worst ways (it was just really bad lol). \n\nOK, so now, Present moment. It\u2019s been about 6 months since my original diagnosis of OSA, and last week i did my second MSLT. I genuinely did not think I was going to get a diagnosis, but i did (yay?). HELLOOO IH!! :D  When my doctor read my results to me, my heart was pounding. For a split second I was happy, because what I had been experiencing for so long was finally acknowledged. It was given a name with real meaning. But it\u2019s definition sucked. Uh oh, incurable?? Neurological disorder?? Oh no, sadness again :( Though i\u2019m not bedridden, it felt like at this point I should be. But that\u2019s not true!!! Though my family and friends will never understand, those who care for me will try to support me. A diagnosis is a step forward in coping at least. \n\nSometimes (often) I dissociate. I have brain fog all the time. I feel a little dumber and my memory kind of sucks. I can\u2019t stay out late with friends. Driving late at night or in the sun is dangerous for me, i get way too sleepy. One can look at all these things and anyone can see a reason for giving up. Heck, I\u2019ve wanted to so many times. But all of my suffering has to mean something. And if it doesn\u2019t, then i\u2019ll make it mean something. I have accomplished so many things while having these disorders, and I can accomplish so many more. But if i don\u2019t, do accomplishments really matter? I\u2019d say it\u2019s quality over quantity anyways. I can have really really bad days, but i can\u2019t let those overshadow those awesome moments i get to experience with friends, family, or at my job. Life isn\u2019t fair, but i need to make the best with what i\u2019ve got. I can\u2019t just sit around and wait till i \u2018\u2019feel less tired\u201d to do things I want to (as i have been doing for the past year). I would never get anything done. I will no longer sit on the sidelines. But i can take breaks from playing, and longer breaks than anyone else. When needed, I will give myself days to lie in bed and do nothing and feel sorry for myself till i cry myself to sleep. It\u2019s natural, because how is a 18 year old who\u2019s got their whole life ahead of them cope with the fact their brain is messed up and can\u2019t fully wake up? \n \nI have been masking my symptoms for so long, but I won\u2019t anymore. It takes too much energy, energy i could be putting into fun hobbies that i have unfortunately abandoned because ive been too tired to do anything. Though fatigue is a valid reason to quit a hobby (or anything) it cannot let it define me. Because now I know I will always feel like this; fatigue will stick with me forever. So i gotta get used to it. You can\u2019t cry over spilled milk or what could have been. I just need to learn to cope and keep going. \n\nThough my illness makes me feel weak and fragile, I have to accept that I am not. I have somehow accomplished amazing things, even with IH. And even now, though I can\u2019t give 110% anymore as I used to, I can choose my battles and do the best I can. At least I have to try. Though I often want to give up and even wonder if my life is worth living, I will to beat the odds. I will keep going. \n\nIf you read this far, I really appreciate you. \nThanks :) &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 2817, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Story: The Development of my fatigue (A Happy Ending)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/muimhu/my_story_the_development_of_my_fatigue_a_happy/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "CurlyBill03", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4zg0gac2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1618752690, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/mtcvag/had_2nd_psg_and_mslt_diagnosed_with_hypersomnia/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mtcvag", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "dd880108-a17d-11e8-9cd0-0e59699c06fa", "link_flair_text": "Diagnosis", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/mtcvag/had_2nd_psg_and_mslt_diagnosed_with_hypersomnia/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1618752702, "score": 1, "selftext": "My first psg I didn\u2019t sleep enough and neurologist recognized that not sleeping enough could still indicate narco/Hypersomnia.

I have an appointment with my sleep medicine NP tomorrow afternoon and I could really use some input. \n\nBackground: I'm 21F and currently have an IH diagnosis. I had my sleep study last June and while I fell asleep very quickly in every nap (fastest was under 2 mins, average was around 4 mins I believe), I didn't hit REM sleep at all. This kind of blew my mind because I was SO SURE that I had N2. My brother is currently diagnosed with N2 and my mother shows all the symptoms of N2, never knowing what it was. I have had EDS since I was about 12 and spent nearly all my time throughout middle and high school asleep when I wasn't in school. I have sleep attacks daily and before I was medicated, I had hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations several times a week. My nighttime sleep has always been horrible for as long as I can remember. I used to wake up every hour and a half to two hours all night long, usually meaning I woke up at least 4 or 5 times a night. I dream every single time I go to sleep, whether it be two minutes or two hours. I also dream when I'm not even fully asleep where I'm aware of everything going on around me but am also actively having a dream at the same time. I have pretty much every symptom (minus cataplexy, as far as I know). From the research I've done (and I've done a LOT of it), my symptoms don't seem to align much with IH nor are they similar to symptoms from those I have spoken to with IH.\n\nIn terms of medication, I've taken Modafinil at 100 mg and then 200. It worked well for about a month but then stopped working. I've since been taking 200 mg twice a day with Adderall IR 20 mg, also twice a day. At night, I take 6.25 mg of Zolpidem CR (generic extended release Ambien). The Zolpidem has actually let me sleep for \\~5 hours straight, which was an absolute miracle for me and has never happened before. It also has greatly reduced my hallucinations. While I feel that it's helping me achieve slightly deeper sleep and has made my nights a lot easier, it's nowhere near the amount I need to feel better during the day. I also know that there are a lot of people who think that Ambien shouldn't be taken long term but it's unfortunately the only thing I have access to right now and it's certainly better than nothing.\n\nI've been on the above medications since June, minus the Adderall which I started in October. It makes my life slightly more bearable but I crash so insanely hard from the stims that I truly only get about four hours of usable time per day. Working a full shift at my job (\\~6.5 hours, once a week) leaves me so exhausted I feel like I have the flu for the rest of the day. I'm a college student and I've been working my ass off to hopefully get into medical school one day, but the exhaustion is so debilitating that I feel like sooner or later, I'm going to have to give up.\n\nThat comes to where I am now. I have my six month follow up tomorrow and I feel so defeated. I have no idea why I didn't hit REM sleep during my study. I wasn't taking any REM suppressing meds at the time. My provider gave me a Lunesta to take the night of the study and I was so worried about taking a new medication that I decided to take half of a Unisom instead, which I had previously used for sleep occasionally. I've tried looking up any information I could about Unisom and I couldn't find anywhere that it suppresses REM sleep. My provider was frustrated that I didn't take the Lunesta and said that would have potentially gotten me a diagnosis?\n\nMy NP believes I have N2 and has always mentioned getting another sleep study \"down the road\" but 1. I have no idea if my insurance would pay for another one and 2. I have no idea what went wrong the first time so I'm worried I'll just get the same results. She mentions frequently that if I had a N diagnosis that it would open more doors for medication which makes me think that if and until then, Xyrem/Xywav is off the table. I found the form online that providers can fill out and submit stating that they believe their patient should have Xyrem/Xywav despite not having an N diagnosis and why, and I considered printing it out and bringing it but I don't want to seem like I'm pushing too hard for this super restricted drug. I know Jazz has a patient assistance program but I'm pretty sure you still have to have an N diagnosis to qualify for it so I'm out of luck there.\n\nI know that my issue is my sleep at night. It's always been my sleep at night and no amount of Ambien or Unisom can change the fact that my brain simply doesn't know how to go into deep sleep and stop hanging out in REM sleep most of the night. I'm so afraid that one day I'll go see her and she'll essentially tell me that this is as good as it's going to get. My insurance fought me hard enough on the Adderall so I highly doubt that they would ever approve anything higher (Sunosi, Xyrem, etc.) without an N diagnosis. I even looked up my insurance's specific policies on those medications and they all explicitly state that the patient MUST have a narcolepsy diagnosis and the sleep study results to prove it.\n\nI apologize for the long, depressing post.

I had been diagnosed about 1.5 years ago but I was pregnant and I didn\u2019t have a decision on whether to take meds at the time. Also a sleep study would not have been conclusive as the baseline for pregnancy has not been established. So finally I had that test done about 1.5 months ago and the doctor has confirmed my diagnosis of IH. \n\nAll that said, I was really stressed about the results. During the test they would ask me to rate how sleepy I was before and after and how long I thought I took to fall asleep. I didn\u2019t honestly think I slept at all for at least two of them and that it took a long time for the other two. I felt stressed about not being able to sleep and how they might take my meds away (they assured me they wouldn\u2019t since clearly they were helping me regardless) and that I would have been \u201clying\u201d and wasting their time and all that. I also thought I got woken up often for the overnight test and that I tossed and turned a long time since I was distracted in my head. \n\nApparently my latency was 6m average with 3m being quickest and 10m longest. Doctor has confirmed I am very sleepy and it\u2019s not my imagination and it\u2019s not my fault. And it\u2019s such a a strange relief to have that show up on a test and not feel like a fraud and have some sort of answer. But also, wtf. I really honestly thought I didn\u2019t sleep almost at all. I was really frustrated about that. I would have swore under oath. Apparently night sleep took me 2m to fall asleep and I thought it took me an hour. Apparently they only came in my room twice but I thought it was 5-6 times. \n\nNow I\u2019m slightly questioning my sanity. Am I having visual hallucinations? Am I dreaming about not being able to sleep? Am I just wildly misremembering?

So this whole IH thing is kicking my butt. After about a solid 15-month journey of plenty of research, I was diagnosed with IH in January of 2020. Now, I\u2019ve felt the presence of it throughout my life, but never really acknowledged it or respected it enough to take my exhaustion and weakened brain seriously. Like I remember being the hardest person to wake up in the morning dating all the way back to early elementary school. School was rough because I always hit a mental wall around 2/3pm where my brain would just be DONE for the day. After-school sports and homework were virtually impossible for me to handle.\n\nBut anyway, I\u2019ve tried a lot. Numerous sleep and alert medications (including modafinil). Napping. Weighted blankets. Adjusting pre-sleep routines. I\u2019m just running out of patience. I\u2019m either having to sleep 10/11 hours every night and MAYBE have more energy to cram my life into less time or I have more of my life by sleeping less (6-8 hours) but being miserable. And there\u2019s only so much caffeine my body can take without exploding. With trying to work full-time, make time for family and friends, and then also try to manage my own personal time, I\u2019ve really become stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nI\u2019m not looking for answers, because obviously everyone is different. I just want to hear from you all about how you get through your day. Do you need daily/weekly assistance from someone? How much do you work? Do you have an understanding support system? It just feels like every day I get deeper and deeper into the reality that my life will forever be this struggle, and it makes me feel like I\u2019m going to miss out on so many opportunities in life by just keeping me in this groundhog day-like feeling. It\u2019s to the point where I don\u2019t even know if I could live on my own (I still live at home).\nI compare IH to the small-town last stop on a one-way train. Almost everyone has gotten off at other stops (sleep apnea, restless leg, narcolepsy, etc.) well before reaching the end. There\u2019s hardly anybody left for the last stop. This super rare disease we fight can make you feel so isolated knowing that so few people truly understand what it\u2019s like to live like this, day-in and day-out. So this is me reaching out to the only other people I know that share this disorder with me.\nWhether you respond to this, or want to message me separately, I\u2019m more than interested in hearing whatever you all have to share with a random 25 year old dude who has to say the word \u201ctired\u201d way too often in his life so far.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 2765, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just Looking for Perspectives", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/mlb7z7/just_looking_for_perspectives/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "prophecygirls", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5zb4akbe", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1617708664, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ml9i3f/methods_of_snapping_yourself_out_of_a_sleep_attack/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ml9i3f", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ml9i3f/methods_of_snapping_yourself_out_of_a_sleep_attack/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1617708675, "score": 1, "selftext": "With my IH, I experience periods in the day when I just cannot keep my eyes open.

Hoping I can get some ideas from you guys. Hope to keep this short as possible. \n\nI'm profoundly deaf, type one diabetes, 40M, and have had IH for 25 years. I live in the UK. My IH is diagnosed and I'm under the care of a specialist.\n\nAnyway, life is moving on and I'm stuck. My mother was my advocate but she passed four years ago from a brain tumour. She got too sick to help a few years before then, so I spent my waking hours mostly looking after her. \n\nPrevious sleep clinic told me when I was 19 that I'd grow out of this. Then they said I didn't have IH and that I had restless leg syndrome, before changing back to IH. I was then removed from that hospital's treatment list without being informed for four years. I'd asked my other family members to call for me, but they claimed I was being paranoid. I had to pay someone to call the hospital and find out for me. \n\nI now visit another hospital for IH, which is a nearly 400 mile round trip but whatever it takes.\n\nI was on Ritalin then Modafinil, that stopped working, so switched to Dexamphetamine. That has stopped working more drastically. I've now arranged to go back onto the Modafinil until I can talk to the specialist. \n\nI have to email the hospital, write down what I need, wait two weeks for a email response, which is usually a \"doctor will send a letter\", then four weeks later I get the letter. Nothing changes.\n\nI'm asking for any ideas as to how to make things happen. I can't call every day until they respond. If the secretary misinterprets what I say in email, it starts all over again. I'll make the drive up and then only get to see one of the junior doctors, not the specialist, and I'll get criticised for my sleep hygiene or that I've: \"filled out the Epworth Scale wrong\".\n\nThe NHS is a great thing, but with cuts and everything, it doesn't work very well anymore. I am unable to work a job with the IH. I can't get very much financial support because IH is not recognised like, say, fibromigalia is. Alarms don't wake me in the morning because I'm deaf. My diabetes is barely under control because they can't understand how to make it work with IH. \n\nThe cynical part of what thinks that they know that I can't push or fight for treatment. They're aware that I only have a few minutes a day where my brain is not enveloped in a stupefying fog and I have to use that time to do basic things, shopping, cooking, washing, etc.\n\nAre there any resources I can use to get some support? I've looked at the links on here, but they are mainly US or Australian based and involve the use of a telephone.\n\nDid anyone here have any success using an advocacy service? Any tips on getting a doctor to do more? \n\nI know the diabetes and IH is a combination that means my outlook is not good, but I'd like to try anyway. I've done what I've been told, been patient, taken the meds, done the tests, etc. Nothing is working. I'd like someone to actually, you know, try?\n\nSorry for the length of this, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 2755, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Advice on assistance", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/mjw6qt/advice_on_assistance/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Mestophalies", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1fg4btkz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1617465643, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/mjbb3p/wondering/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mjbb3p", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/mjbb3p/wondering/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1617465768, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey all I have been diagnosed for a little but now and  was wondering what works for you.

And what about some kind of brain scan that could be done? I'm also wondering if IH is caused by a high level of this thing called gamma-aminobutyric acid. From my cursory googling, it seems that when someone has low levels of that acid they get insomnia, and when they have high levels they sleep too much. This might not always be the cause of insomnia or IH, I don't know, I'm no doctor or scientist.\n\nBut I really just wanted to post here and ask y'all generally if you know of any tests that could be done to diagnose IH other than a sleep study. I got my study done last year and was diagnosed this January, and recently started taking Modafinil. It might be my anxiety (probably) but there's a worry in the back of my head that says there's a chance I don't have IH and it could instead be something else. So I'd love to learn about any additional tests that could be done. Thanks!\n\nTL;DR: Are there any diagnostic tests for IH other than a sleep study?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 2750, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is there any sort of \"chemical\" test for IH?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/mio95u/is_there_any_sort_of_chemical_test_for_ih/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "alexabutnotamazon", "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "56de33b2-a13b-11e8-86fb-0ec44c28c910", "author_flair_text": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_reqdpta", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1617290958, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/mhxr7h/what_doctor_to_see_for_medication_management/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mhxr7h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "d2ac6514-a252-11e8-9353-0e3d3172c776", "link_flair_text": "Doctors", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/mhxr7h/what_doctor_to_see_for_medication_management/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1617290969, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone! So I was diagnosed a few years ago, and I\u2019ve been taking Vyvanse for the past 5-6 years. I really like it and it works great for me. \n\nI was diagnosed by a sleep specialist after my sleep study (obviously), but I really did not like her at all and did not want to keep seeing her. I had been seeing my primary care doctor since I was about 10/11 years old, and she was willing to take over writing me prescriptions. So the whole time I\u2019ve been on Vyvanse, it\u2019s been prescribed thru my family doctor. \n\nHe\u2019s my situation and question. I recentlyish moved and need to establish with a doctor in my new city. I have all the documents backing up my need for Vyvanse (diagnosis, sleep study, old dr. said she\u2019d even write a letter explaining my sitch)\u2014 but even with all that, I\u2019m a little concerned that a primary dr will decline to prescribe it and I\u2019ll have look for a different doctor. I\u2019d rather not keep seeing a sleep dr for med stuff because the copays are higher for specialists, and I really don\u2019t need to see them at this point.\n\nWhat type of doctor do you guys see for your controlled substance prescriptions?

During the overnight, I thought it took me way longer than is typical for me to get to sleep, but apparently it only took me 6 minutes. But then during the MSLT, my sleep latencies were 13, 9, 13, 7, and 5..... so my mean sleep latency for the MSLT is around 9.5 which is just outside the objective criteria for IH diagnosis.

I\u2019m also on a few medications that are wakefulness-promoting/have given me RLS, including Strattera, Vyvanse, and Prozac.

As I mentioned other day, I literally fell asleep while I was having a mole removed from a not so fun place.\n\nAnyways, was so worried about MSLT didn\u2019t even think twice about PSG! At home, as soon as my head hits pillow I am OUT and nothing short of a nuclear bomb can wake me up (I have slept through a smoke alarm before). I got all hooked up by 10 pm, an hour past my usual bedtime and could barely keep my eyes open during process...and then...my brain went into anxiety hyperdrive. There was also a blinking blue and green light from machine that I was sure was cutting a laser hole in my eyelids. The tech came in and taped it up for me, but I still couldn\u2019t fall asleep. (I\u2019m sure didn\u2019t help that I\u2019m a stomach sleeper which was impossible with all the wires) I was convinced that I was awake entire night. At one point, all the techs came in room and yelled at me and told me to leave because I had failed, which I eventually realized was a dream and that I had just woken up? I laid there for what felt like an hour, my heart racing, totally awake, until (sobbing because I was so distressed) I checked my phone for time. And it was 8 am. Tech came in all cheerful with breakfast asking if I had slept well and I was like -huh-?\n\nNot entirely sure what happened (they won\u2019t give me data), but tech laughed when I told her I didn\u2019t think I slept at all. My first nap is in an hour, and now I\u2019m extra nervous. So if folks want to send me good no-anxiety vibes, they would be much appreciated!\n\nAlso, pro tip: definitely bring your own blankets and pillows.

Dexedrine used to work better but now it makes me actively feel \"nothing\" and \"numb\" emotionally... Not sure what happened. My insurance doesn't cover Evekeo and my sleep doc doesn't seem to want to bother with the PA for that. Desoxyn was a disaster for me (made me extremely depressed). Ritalin does nothing for me (granted i was only ever allowed to go up to 30 mg because that was a \"high dose\"), and Focalin at 20 mg gave me nothing but panic attacks. Nuvigil 250 mg worked okay when it was still brand-name, but generic is crap and does nothing. Provigil at 400 mg does nothing at all either.\n\nWas wondering if anyone has tried any of the new meds for IH? Xywav in particular is in trials for IH and seems to show great promise, but when i asked my sleep doc about it, he promptly turned it down and said he didn't feel like going through the hoops with my insurance company to get it covered off label...

So I'm thinking if i want to venture to try either Sunosi or Wakix (or both), then I'm going to need to find a new sleep doc...\n\nOtherwise, is it worth it to go down the rabbit hole of trying ultra high doses of Provigil or Nuvigil?

What sometimes helps fully wake me up is engaging my brain, I guess. So when I pick up my phone to turn off the alarm I\u2019ll open an app like Reddit, to start reading or watching something. But sometimes this doesn\u2019t work and I\u2019ll fall back asleep. But my fingers are still using my phone. I\u2019ve sent gibberish texts, called/FaceTimed people, deleted emails, started writing new ones, I frequently rearrange my apps on my phone. \n\nThis morning I accidentally turned off my cellular data and thought my service had been cut off, even though the bill wasn\u2019t due yet. A couple days ago I \u201cliked\u201d my own text message I had sent a customer a couple of weeks ago. Sometimes I\u2019ll think I\u2019m more awake than I am and I\u2019ll start writing a text to someone and I just fall asleep in the middle of it, but I think I\u2019ve sent it. For example, earlier this week I woke up from a nap and started texting my fianc\u00e9, asking him to wake me up when he got home. I never sent it though, I thought I did, and of course I was upset he didn\u2019t wake me up when he got home. \n\nDoes this happen to anyone else? I think I need to get a regular alarm clock that allows me to set multiple alarms so I\u2019m not interacting with my phone before I\u2019m fully conscious. I was considering one that some people who are hearing impaired use, it vibrates your bed quite strongly. So maybe that in conjunction with a traditional alarm clock?\n\nI have a referral for a sleep study, but the VA wants me to do it at the hospital, 2 hours away.

The only option for me at diagnosis in Feb 2017 was Dex and I have been on it ever since. \n\nI have the usual side effects, dry mouth and lack of appetite. I also sometimes get an upset stomach (most likely from hunger) and frequent (almost daily)  headaches. I only take the pills on days I'm working which are Monday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. I recently came to the realization that the dex was the cause of my horrific (TMI) bowel problems and frequent diarrhea at work. I'm a checkout operator at a supermarket so it's not the most ideal workplace to have that side effect. \n\nI mentioned the bowel problems to my specialist on my previous visit. He personally hasn't had a patient with those side effects before and he considered it somewhat of a rare side effect but it definitely can happen. He told me that it makes sense with the stimulants stimulating everything it makes sense it could also over-stimulate the bowel as well. He said, unfortunately, he didn't know what else to offer since he believed it was the amphetamine in the pills that was causing it. Aside from Nuvigil/Modafinil (that isn't an option financially), he wasn't sure what else there was that didn't contain amphetamines. \n\nI had another appointment today to get University paperwork filled out and he asked if I was still having bowel problems. He said he thought about it more after my last appointment and thought Methylphenidate could be an option. He said it's still a stimulant but since its not exactly the same so there is a possibility it might help on the toilet side of things. \n\nWhat is everyone's experience with Ritain, especially after swapping from dex?

Frustrated, I booked a private one at Boots. I turned up expecting to pay, but they went through the criteria for NHS eligibility and said I did qualify because I had a neurological condition.\n\nFor the next few years, it didn\u2019t matter that my doctors surgery had refused. I got my flu jab from pharmacies who always deemed me eligible for the free one.. \n\nBut with the covid vaccine, it suddenly mattered very much - as being (wrongly!) deemed ineligible for the flu jab meant I probably wouldn\u2019t be included in vaccine group 6 for people with underlying health conditions. \n\nIf you are in the same boat, here are some key things to know:\n\n- The list of underlying conditions includes neurological conditions. IH is a neurological condition. The \u2018green book\u2019 (the government\u2019s vaccination information for health professionals) doesn\u2019t mention IH but the guidance makes it clear that the list is NOT exhaustive.\n\n- The 'green book' guidance states that: The examples above are not exhaustive, and, within these groups, the prescriber should apply clinical judgment to take into account the risk of COVID-19 exacerbating any underlying disease that a patient may have, as well as the risk of serious illness from COVID-19 itself.\n\nI read about this in an article in the Guardian and found [this template letter from the ME association](https://meassociation.org.uk/2021/02/latest-covid-19-me-cfs-and-the-jcvi-priority-vaccination-list/). You could adapt this if you need to. \n\nI contacted my GP surgery a while ago and asked about group 6. My current GP is great and has been very helpful to me, but she told me it wasn\u2019t that straightforward and they\u2019d need to establish that I was eligible - I am not sure she was right about this, but they wrote to my neurologist who I was seeing for some other symptoms outside of my IH. (I asked my sleep specialist myself. He\u2019s usually great but I could not get him to understand the question. He just kept telling me I wasn\u2019t in the shielding group, which wasn\u2019t what I asked.) My neurologist wrote back to my GP saying IH is a neurological condition and meets criteria for group 6. \n\nYesterday I received this: https://ibb.co/YN2MYb2 \n\nSo, IH friends. Ask for your covid jab. Ask for your flu jab. You do qualify. It really sucks that we have to fight and push for things, but if anyone\u2019s having trouble I really hope this helps you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 2610, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "FAO people in the UK who are having trouble getting included in the covid vaccine underlying conditions group", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/llpger/fao_people_in_the_uk_who_are_having_trouble/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NotAJointAccount", "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "56de33b2-a13b-11e8-86fb-0ec44c28c910", "author_flair_text": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_812w434k", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1613449897, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/lkvuj9/feeling_proud_of_myself/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lkvuj9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/lkvuj9/feeling_proud_of_myself/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1613450482, "score": 1, "selftext": "It's been about 2 years since diagnosed and about 1.5 years of being treated (yay insurance).

Once I'm awake, I'm not usually confused or sluggish, so this was strange. I went back to sleep a couple of times because every time I woke I felt awake, yet sort of faint. Can't really describe it. The only thing I can compare this to is an incident where I had been on my feet all day and night and when tried to get up after only a couple of hours of sleep I fainted two times (nothing severe just a short blackout, dropping on the floor and standing up again). Now in my last sleeping session this morning, I had a dream where I was supposed to do a task (cleaning the stables of a medieval castle or something similar). But as the character I was in my dream, I was having continuous blackouts, too! My partner also was there in the dream and I was very upset and talked to him about it. Apparently they gave me the stable job because it seemed the one thing I could manage that with my blackouts.  But I couldn't. I would take a few steps and everything would go black. After that dream, I finally woke up fully and was able to get up. I've had some episodes of sleep paralysis, and it wasn't that. For the first half of my day, I kept feeling rather weak, somewhat as you might feel when you are fasting or recovering after a severe cold.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?

TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI used to be an event administrator for a community, and one day someone walked in saying, \"We're here to participate in the event you planned for us.\" I swear I had never met this person in my entire life. At first I thought, \"Surely they have the wrong building.\" My confidence quickly grew to panic as they knew my name, my position, and begun telling me all these plans the two of us made in the past. In my eyes, I was talking to a stranger, a stranger who seemed to know more about what was going on with my own job than me. This was my first red flag. A few days later, I was sitting in my room when I heard a clicking in the kitchen. I walked out to see the stove was on. It was then I realized I just had another memory lapse, a dangerous one at that.\n\nI set up a doctor's appointment that day. My doctor appointment was pretty typical, I told them that, \"Yea I wake up with migraines every day, yea my body is so sore I have to physically extend my limbs to keep them straight, yea I could fall asleep anywhere anytime within a minute, yea sometimes I hallucinate, yea I'm pretty much confused and disoriented on a regular basis, yea it can be hard to tell the difference between reality, my imagination, and dreams, but it's been that way as long as I can remember, that's how everyone is right?\" \n\nOne thing lead to another and I was having my sleep study done, they told me something is up, I had my MSLT done, and was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia, probable narcolepsy. I tried Adderall, nothing, I tried Armodafinil, made it worse, my words became slurred and I couldn't sit up straight, Modafinil, same story.\n\nEventually I was out on Xyrem. A week or two into it, I had a new lease on life. I realized how truly exhausted I was before, how much I was suffering. I stayed on Xyrem for over a year, until the one side effect was driving me batty. It gave me sever anxiety.\n\nI had all the energy to do the things I always wanted to do, and all the anxiety to stop me from doing it.\n\nI read some reknown books on sleep neurology/medicine and discontinued Xyrem. I've completely revamped and MASSIVELY improved my sleep hygiene. So now I'm on a nightly regiment of 250mg Magnesium-Taurate, 3,000UI vitamin D, 100mcg K-2, and 600mg of L-Theanine.

I even started taking Adderall in 2019, first because I thought I had ADHD, but then when that turned out not to be true I continued to take it just because it keeps me awake during the day. (But it makes me feel awful physically and I don't think I should be on it.) I finally decided to seek proper treatment last year.\n\nI got a PSG and MSLT in September. I should emphasize that I got a very bad night's sleep that night, waking up repeatedly from the discomfort of all the wires and breathing tubes. When I went to a sleep specialist for a diagnosis, the doctor read over my results and diagnosed me with \"mild sleep apnea\". He said no CPAP required, just recommended I get an oral appliance to wear during the night. Mind you, I do not snore, nor do I display any other symptoms of sleep apnea besides excessive sleepiness. I knew in my gut this diagnosis was wrong, and everyone in my life, doctors and non-doctors, agreed with me.\n\nSo, yesterday I went to see a different sleep specialist so she could look at my sleep study results and give me a second opinion. This doctor was worlds different from my first one. She was very thorough and seemed to actually take interest in figuring out what I have. After much questioning, she read my sleep study results (taking my rough night's sleep into account) and concluded that I do not have sleep apnea after all! She diagnosed me with hypersomnia, either idiopathic or medication-induced (I am on antidepressants and she thinks they could be the cause). Best of all, she prescribed me Modafinil which will replace my stupid Adderall. I'm cautious to feel relieved/optimistic because I fear some other complication or bad thing will occur. But that's just anxiety. This is good news, and I hope this is the final piece to my puzzle.\n\nSo, my first sleep doc was wrong after all. From our first appointment he came off as unprofessional and uncaring so I can't say I'm surprised that he made a bad diagnosis. I am making this post not only to vent, but to also encourage folks to follow your gut when something doesn't seem right, especially with medical diagnoses. It's often worth it in the end.

I don't know why, but my first doctor was certain that this couldn't be anything but depression and thought that sleep tests were just for fat old men. He didn't even consider that I could have had the early stages of narcolepsy or something else. First I got an at-home test (ApneaLink, if I remember right) which showed a very low AHI and an RI of 8. My doctor thought that meant all was fine and pushed the depression theory of his. \n\nI soon after moved and went to a new doctor that was more interested in my sleep theory, so she referred me to a sleep clinic where I got a PSG and MSLT and was diagnosed with idiopathic insomnia as my AHI was 0 and my RDI was 0. I was a bit startled that my RDI was 0 as I thought that the average, even in normal people was non-zero, but I was kind of sick of all of it and decided to just go on with the idiopathic hypersomnia diagnosis. Mostly, I tried to pretend my sleep issues didn't exist.\n\nPredictably, things got worse. I read some and learned that RDI is often not actually scored in sleep clinics. I decided to talk to a sleep doctor again (I had moved since the previous test, so it was a new doctor) and because of covid backlog, I took an at-home test, a WatchPAT test. And it ends up that these score RDI and mine was decently high.

psychiatrist.  In addition to IH I have anxiety and treatment resistant depression.  With my psychiatrist we have been using ketamine as part of my treatment.  Honestly, the best results I\u2019ve ever had.   6 rounds of IV treatment followed by a prescription for a ketamine nasal spray for weekly maintenance.  \n\nThis has helped me so much and would recommend it to anyone in my shoes\n\nI see my shrink monthly and showed him my sleep and mslt results.  \n\nOn the sleep side I have a sleep doc and a neurologist I found through the IH foundation.  \n\nIH neurologist included IH in the results\n\nMy psychiatrist stated IH isn\u2019t real. He agreed that I appear quite sleepy, but said IH means we have no idea what is wrong. \n\nMy sleep doc as I said diagnosed N2 which I received a Xyrem script for \n\nSo discussion yesterday revolves around his concern on the use of Xyrem.  He said I should absolutely feel better along the sleep front since  Xyrem puts me in \u201csuper sleep\u201d but was most concerned about wether the benefits of such a drug were wort it or not. \n\nApparently he did know a lot about Xyrem and was concerned about the long term effect and it potentially impacting our progress on the depression front. So he has asked that I keep an eye on the benefits and to pay attention to possible effects on my mental health. \n\nQuite a statement for a doc who advocates for ketamine and its benefits to say he was concerned about Xyrem. He also firmly stated that the two will not interact with the 4 hour time span I have between the two.  \n\nHe firmly believes that depression can be a contributor to my sleepiness. \n\nAlso, I managed to get an appointment with Dr. Rye at the Emory sleep center in September, and this is with me calling for the appointment back in December.  \n\nSo I take Ketamine and Xyrem.

I don\u2019t feel that I tested optimally as the staff were extremely loud which made it very difficult to fall asleep, I was extremely anxious, and was in a lot of pain due to another medical issue (dislocated bones) going on at the moment. They told me they didn\u2019t see any signs of IH but were still leaving it on my diagnosis chart. When trying to ask whether or not I should retake it and why I felt I did not test the way I normally sleep I was kind of just ignored. Finally at the end I was recommended to a psychiatrist because somehow he thinks that may be the cause of my IH??? I\u2019ve been to multiple psychiatrists and know how to tell the difference between my situational depression (which only happens when I\u2019m living with my narcissistic parents) and my IH which happens everywhere I go, every second of my life since I can remember.

I asked a few, and he seemed very dismissive in his answers. Now, here's the kicker. After my third question, **he literally stood up and went towards the door**. Didn't ask if I had anymore questions, didn't even wait one second to hear if there was another question coming after. \n\nI asked one more question, he sat back down, answered it (dismissively, without really answering it) and then I gave up and left.

It influences every part of my life and limits me every single day.\n\nIt took 10 years before any doctors took it seriously and another 10 for me to-- hopefully now-- finally accept it.\n\nFor many many years, I\u2019ve fought to believe that I was (or could be) in control of the situation. That, if I tried enough things and believed hard enough, I could get better. Even just a little bit.\n\nAnd even though that meant constantly failing myself at every turn -- falling asleep and missing appointments, deadlines, social events, work; hurting friendships, career, and relationships with expectations and promises I couldn\u2019t keep; and fostering a deep self-hatred and anxiety by not being able to \u201cfix\u201d myself and \u201cget it together\u201d -- believing this was in my control was (and is still, if I\u2019m honest) easier than accepting this illness and its limitations. Because at least I could hope that, if I could just get my act together and not be a perennial screw-up, I could someday be \u201cnormal\u201d, or, at the very least, better than I am now.\n\nWe live in a positivist culture where acceptance is often seen as \u201cgiving up.\u201d We believe that we must believe, and that being positive in our actions, our words, and our thoughts, will make a difference, if not all the difference.\n\nI am not giving up. I continue to try new treatments as they become available. I strategize and try new things as I have the energy to take them on. But I can no longer attempt this positivism, even though its promise of control is still so tempting and the societal pressure so ubiquitous. This disability exists whether I want it to or not. It limits my life whether I accept that or not. And if I want to live my life with any kind of joy, I cannot constantly be fighting for a cure or solution.\n\nFinally admitting this, I hope I can gain a deeper kind of acceptance of myself and live my life, however limited.\n\nHaving all of you know this-- I hope-- will help too. This disease is invisible, and can easily be confused with \u201claziness\u201d, lack of \u201cwill power\u201d or \u201cwork ethic\u201d, \u201cflakiness\u201d, and other such things I have been called and called myself.\n\nI hope maybe if everyone knows, I won\u2019t have to feel like I have to hide the symptoms for fear of being misunderstood.\n\nAnd I also hope that this will maybe help people to extend the same benefit of the doubt to others who disappoint or aggravate.

I'm not diagnosed but I am almost 100% sure I have IH or at least some sort of hypersomnia. Last week I did an at home sleeptest for sleep apnea and I'm waiting for the results. It's the basic blood pressure monitor and the little tubes in the nose, as well as the thing on your chest checking what side you sleep on. \n\nSince I do work as a roadie/stagehand I work weird uncomfortable hours, which is fine by me. I usually have like 20ish alarms to wake me up. Lately I've noticed I sleep an estimated 11-14 hours a night and I've just stopped giving myself shit about it. There's nothing I can do about it right now until I get a diagnosis so I can receive medication. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I worked as usual last night and got to sleep around 1 am, and due to forgetting to set my usual alarms, I ended up sleeping 20 hours uninterrupted. I thought i'd oversleep a little bit, get up around 2 or 3 pm, because that's relatively mild for me. But I slept 20. Woke up close to 9pm at night and I've not been feeling very great about that.

However with time comes experience and with experience comes wisdom and I have gotten better with each passing year so I shall pass down whatever little wisdom I have to you guys via Reddit Cloud Servers And this humble post.\n\nSome things that have helped me:\n\n1. Proper Medication. For me I take Wellbutrin. SSRIs like Lexapro make sleep disorders like this worse IME. I also struggle with depression and anxiety but Wellbutrin nearly kills those. \n\n2. Occasional LSD trip. This might be controversial and risky. Do your own due diligence but this helps me immensely with self esteem when I\u2019m feeling really down and like my problems are out of my control. It\u2019s like a complete reset and for a month or two you sleep like a baby if you do this right and have a good trip. \n\n3. Therapy. This is a more conventional method and the results are like 2. I see a therapist when things are boiling up and life is becoming out of control and it helps me gain perspective. This is highly relevant to you guys as well because you can talk to a good therapist about anything and you probably don\u2019t talk with your friends about your most intimate problems if you are like me but you need to vent. This has tremendous psychological benefits and arguably long term sleep and health benefits as well. \n\nTherapy and Medications are musts, particularly if you suffer from some mood disorder like me along with this bc they help you with things that are out of your control - your neurochemistry, neurobiology. But they are foundational. You must build on top of those foundations and baseline with disciplines (which are much harder to start and sustain) bc to truly live a good life you must have a great lifestyle which brings me to:\n\n4. Sleep Hygiene. (I don\u2019t do this all the time as I should because I\u2019m a college student so I imagine this will be easier if you work FT and don\u2019t bring your work home with you. When you are in school, you have homework and procrastination which equals late nights and poor sleep routines) But when I do this properly it really works so I\u2019m gonna keep improving this when I graduate: \n\n0. Plan how much sleep you require on average. For me it\u2019s about 8.5 hours. Plan when you have to wake up. If you are working FT it will be around 6-7 AM. That means if you need to get required sleep and get up on time that you have to be in bed for me at 9:30-10:30. Now here is how you fall asleep and wake up properly. Also open up your curtains so the sunlight can come in the next morning. This also helps a wee bit. \n\nA. Think about your next days responsibilities, schedule and a planner helps with this. Think about your morning routine and what it will look like. \n\nB. This is critical. We live in a world where I imagine sleep disorders and anxiety are increasing because of our increasing consumption of digital media particularly over smartphones. DO NOT LOOK AT REDDIT OR SURF WEB AT NIGHT WHILE IN BED. After you set your alarm you keep your goddamn phone on the side table. This definitely messes up your circadian rhythymn And id argue is the biggest factor of this disorder or at least the rising prevalence/impact of it. \n\nC. Before you go to bed, spend 5-10 minutes meditating. I do this with the guided meditations on the headspace app and headphones but I consider this responsible and mindful use of my phone. This does wonders for not only sleep but lingering anxieties and stress. \n\nD. Take L-Theanine at night. This is a supplement I found browsing r/nootropics. This helps you get drowsy after an hour but imo works better than melatonin which is more hit or miss. This also helps relax you and starts taking the edge off the stimulants you are on.\n\nE.Read a Book you like for 15-20 minutes but limit yourself for that time and do not read longer than that, especially in the night and as it pertains to this sleep routine. This will make you sleepy especially if you have taken l-theanine. \n\nF. After you have taken your l-theanine, thought about tomorrow, set your alarms, meditated for 10 minutes, read your book for 20 minutes, you put your book down. And you go to sleep. And you sit in silence for 10-15 minutes. You don\u2019t look at your goddamn smartphone or reddit. You sit there for 15 minutes in silence. I know a lot of you won\u2019t do this. You will go back to the reddit. Hell I would. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not perfect. But you\u2019ll get better and you\u2019ll realize that reddit and your smartphone is not help your circadian rhythymn. (There is NO EXCUSE for this step). It helps you ruminate your problems. You can\u2019t sleep and spend 5 minutes quieting your mind, then you go on reddit and spend 5 hours bullshitting. See it\u2019s a vicious cycle. You break this goddamn cycle. Read the power of habit by Charles Duhigg. \n\nG. If you have done all that, and done step E. Responsibly, and tried to sit in silence for 10-15 minutes but still can\u2019t go to sleep, then you put in your headphones and you listen to ambient noises for another 10 minutes. I do this with the headspace app. I really like the headspace app as you can see \ud83d\ude04!\n\nNow waking up the next morning when that alarm goes off. \n\nH. You wake up having slept at a good time, with the required sleep amount comfortably and are waken up by the alarm. The curtains are also wide open and there is sunlight or darkness of dawn peering in the room. You are groggy but not as groggy as usual.\n\nI. Take your medication and down it with a glass of water.\n\nJ. Hit your juul if you are a juuler to get that morning nicotine stimulus. \n\nK. Get up in bed and do a quick wake up meditation by headspace and put your headphones in.\n\nL. Stimulate yourself for 5 minutes with Twitter or reddit. Now it\u2019s the morning and you can go mindless on reddit but only for 5 minutes.\n\nM. Jump out of bed. And start your morning routine. \n\n\nIf you have read this thus far, I implore you to try this. At worst you have nothing to lose. At best you have something to gain. And if you actually try all of these steps or most of them, please let me know how it goes. I saw a lot of ppl complaining about their problems on this sub. I have recently read the subtle art of not giving a fuck by Mark Manson and he says something very important that roughly goes something like this: \u201cyour problems are not your fault but they are your responsibility to deal with\u201d.  Amen. If you guys try all that and still have problems than at least you tried. Never give up. And if you try this and it works, awesome. If you lose discipline and fall of the wagon. Just get back up eventually. The more you are mindful of falling off the wagon the better you will be. \n\nBut don\u2019t look at this subreddit from 12-5 am and then sleep late. And fuck up your circadian rhythymn. Because those are problems within your control. and it is your responsibility to take control of them. \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 897, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Grateful for Finding this subreddit and some wisdom if I may", "updated_utc": 1553199015, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/arhtdt/grateful_for_finding_this_subreddit_and_some/"}, {"author": "Dang_thatwasquick", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ezww2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1550169272, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/aqmxk8/one_thing_thats_been_helping_me_to_wake_up_in_the/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "aqmxk8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b0a7e18a-a17d-11e8-88ac-0e14fa46b726", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/aqmxk8/one_thing_thats_been_helping_me_to_wake_up_in_the/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1550169272, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was diagnosed with IH about 3 years ago. Like many of you, I\u2019m on stimulants (Vyvanse) but I didn\u2019t really solve the problem of getting my ass up out of bed in the morning. I realized in the weekends that it was a bit easier to get out of bed when the sun was up (and after sleeping 12+ hours but still). The problem is, during the week, I have to get up before the sun rises. \n\nSo I got some Philips Hue lights and plugged those suckers into my bedside lamps. They\u2019re on an automatic timer to be on full brightness by a certain time depending on that day\u2019s schedule. I also set an alarm on my phone for 10 minutes after that just in case the lights don\u2019t wake me up. I\u2019ve been doing this since the end of December. Happy to report that I always wake up before alarm, and it\u2019s helping me keep a regular sleep schedule, even on the weekends. I\u2019m still groggy in the morning, but I think being brought slowly out of sleep instead of lurched out it helps, which means I wake up in a better moods. One down side is that Philips Hue lights are pricey. I think a starter pack is like $120 for just the white ambiance bulbs. \n\nI\u2019m hoping this advice can help some of you.

Not a single person took me seriously when I tried to explain how tired I was. It became a running joke.   \n\n\n2 years ago I gave up trying to have it dealt with. Everyone said if I got a normal, 9-5 job, ate better, and generally reduced my stress level I'd feel better. Everything would work out.   \n\n\nSo I did. January 2018 I started a real, honest to god, 9-5 office job. Entry level, no overtime or working off the clock. No subordinates, minimal responsibility. I hated the work, had no friends, everything I did was 100% meaningless. \n\nI took charge of my health. Weekly therapy, CBT, monthly at least GP visits. Trimmed my meds down to the bare minimum. No hobbies, no special projects, nothing to tax me or stress me out. Started cooking and improving my diet.   \n\n\n6 weeks ago I saw a post in r/ADHD, about IH. It read like the story of my damn life. I spoke to my GP she immediately apologized for not thinking of it sooner and we started the tests. Conclusion: IH. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGetting a diagnosis is good right? Helpful? \n\nSure. Except the fact that the standard treatment for it is Adderall XR, which I've been taking for 20 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo now I have an explanation for the last 20 years of my life. No cure and zero hope that I will ever be less tired. I hate my job, my friends (who have never been numerous) are dwindling, and everything I've done in the last year has been for nothing. Very difficult to see any reason to keep moving forward.   \n\n\n  \nTl;dr  \nChanged everything about my life to be less tired. Diagnosis IH. All for naught.

It took me about seven years to get anyone to listen and take me seriously. I know I was fairly lucky in that, once I was diagnosed, the first drug I tried (modafinil) really helped me and has continued to do so.\n\nAnyway I got to thinking and ended up with this random jumble of tips and thoughts that may or may not help other people. I hope something in here helps somebody! \n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to get a doctor to listen, it helps if you bring along a sleep diary covering at least two weeks documenting when you fell asleep and woke up, where you were, how you felt and any caffeine or alcohol you had. Also search online for the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and fill this in.\n\nI stopped telling people I have a sleep disorder or a problem with sleep. I don\u2019t want the hassle and stress of fielding their stupid comments. I say I have \u2018a lifelong illness\u2019 or \u2018a serious health condition\u2019. \n\nIf you work in an office get them to assess you for an ergonomic chair, if this is an option. I asked for this because I have back problems and once the assessor heard I had a sleep disorder she recommended a chair with arms and a headrest - I don\u2019t really fall asleep in the day now, but if I do I won\u2019t fall out of my chair.\n\nIf something unexpected comes up, sometimes you have to say no because you\u2019re saving your energy for something else you need or want to do. It can help to kind of check in with yourself about whether you really want to do something, and what the cost will be - you kind of have to be honest with yourself about what you can and can\u2019t do, so that you can prioritise. Like the time I had to ignore a friend texting me saying \u201cI\u2019m in your street, are you free for a coffee?\u201d as I wouldn\u2019t have been able to also go out for my husband\u2019s birthday. \n\nSome people would say you should push yourself and try to do more, but those people generally don\u2019t have sleep disorders. Get to know yourself, and work within your own limits. \n\nI have filled in the emergency medical ID section of my iPhone and added this wording which I adapted from the [Hypersommia Foundation\u2019s amnesia guide](https://www.hypersomniafoundation.org/get-our-anesthesia-and-ih-guide/). Here\u2019s what I have for my notes in there: \n\n- Medical conditions: Idiopathic CNS hypersomnia (similar to narcolepsy without cataplexy)\n\n- VERY IMPORTANT: my condition and my medication may interfere with other drugs and/or anaesthesia. May either reduce or increase effects of anaesthesia. May cause delayed emergence from anaesthesia.\n\n- Medical notes: IH causes excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty awakening, automatic behaviours, and symptoms related to the autonomic nervous system.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself. This illness sucks and it\u2019s not your fault. So I have nice bedding that makes me happy, cosy warm bed socks and lovely pyjamas.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 881, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I\u2019ve had my IH diagnosis for nine years.

The positives of having IH.  Please feel free to add more.  \n\nSo......why did I write this?  3 reasons.  1) I have idiopathic hypersomnia, 2) I have an interest in genetics and 3) wanted to post something positive \n\nSo first, according to the NIH, idiopathic hypersomnia is a neurological sleep disorder that appears to be genetic: \u201cSome people appear to have a genetic predisposition to hypersomnia; in others, there is no known cause.\u201d (NIH, Hypersomnia Information page)\n\nThe genetic part got me pondering.  If there is a genetic component, I often wonder why nature has \u201callowed\u201d this disorder/disease to continue in our gene pool.  Then I got excited because I realized that nature has her reasons and there must be all sorts of positive reasons for \u201cus\u201d.   (Please bear with me, I\u2019ve done this with depression too, wondering why this disease persists but was surprised by the positives.  It actually made me feel better as a person, especially on days when all I could do was sleep). \n\n1. We are unique.  We seem to be a rare breed, \u201conly 5% of people sleep more than nine hours a night\u201d (Kevin Loria, Business Insider, December 2014)\n2. Creativity and dream work - I dream a lot because I sleep a lot.  I can remember most of my dreams and they are vivid, real and deep.  This has greatly enhanced my creativity.  I also joined a dream group.  We discuss our dreams and the symbols.  The leader of our group (who helps us translate our dreams) thinks I\u2019m some sort of mystical goddess.  She loves translating my dreams.  We need art and music in this world.  The dream world helps us create. \n3. Problem solving - sleep provides answers.  You know that ole saying, \u201clet me sleep on it\u201d well, it works.  I used to think that I was avoiding things when I\u2019d go off to sleep.  No, I needed time to think and energy.  I\u2019ve done my best brainstorming while in bed. \n4. We are sensitive souls.  Right now the world is in chaos.  Even without a sleep disorder, there is this constant tug (from multiple places) that is vying for our attention.  It\u2019s exhausting for all, it\u2019s incapacitating to us with IH.  We are sensitive, we feel all and shut down in a heap.  We are beautiful beings because \u201cwe get it\u201d\n5. When we have a good day, we really embrace it.  We probably do more in that one good day than most people do in a month.  \n6. We get it.  We are empathetic to other folks with invisible diseases.  We don\u2019t judge when others are struggling because we get it.  We can have deeper friendships.   \n7. We are survivors and don\u2019t give up.  \n\nI stumbled across an extremely optimistic writer who has embraced having narcolepsy.  They have taken the family disease and made lemonades out of lemons.  Found it inspiring.  The piece was called, \u201cThe Advantages of Narcolepsy\u201d (on Wordpress by notquiteafairmaid).  \n\nAnother positive.  Besides this awesome forum, there are several organizations that offer support and clinical trials (please check out NIH\u2019s webpage and search \u201cidiopathic hypersomnia\u201d)\n\nFor so many years I lived in shame.   I was depressed because I was always tired.  I felt like I\u2019d never conquer my dreams because I\u2019d sleep through many of the steps I needed to take just to attain them.  So I\u2019d just keep drifting and shifting dreams (looked just like ADD).  \n\nThen last year I went to my doctor and just collapsed.  I confessed to him that I was sleeping in my car during my lunch break.  I was so tired, I didn\u2019t care about anyone or anything.  I was giving up.  \n\nHe talked to me for 40 minutes.  He looked at my record and all the tests.  He then looked up and asked, \u201cHave you ever done a sleepy study?\u201d   I was dumbfounded.   You see, all these years (17 yrs old - present, 42) I had just assumed my desire to stay in bed was just depression.  Never ever thought that the depression was a result of the sleep.  \n\nThe sleep study changed my life.  I cried and cried and cried.  I cried because I was happy I finally had an answer.

When I was in school, doctors always told me to make lifestyle/sleep hygiene changes before they could look into it more, so I finally got serious about those/pursuing a diagnosis at age 25, and finally considered sleep as the issue about 6 months ago--got a sleep test, diagnosed with IH, and now I've been testing stimulants for the past 3 months. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've always considered my fatigue 'mild'; I can hold down a job and juggle a bit of a social life etc, but I get regularly frustrated, overwhelmed, and depressed at being trapped in a state of constant fatigue, and anxiety about getting enough sleep or having to endure fatigue holds me back in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now, I take two 5mg adderall in the morning, a 36mg ER ritalin plus another two 5mgs adderall during the day, and then another two 5mgs in the late afternoon to get through the evening. I take one day off per week to avoid building tolerance. I don't feel 100%, but I do feel like I'm operating between 60-80% most of the time and that's a pretty big improvement and I am very grateful!  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, my doctor recently also 'prescribed' two enormously difficult lifestyle changes for me: 1) Exercising daily, and 2) not getting into bed until I'm imminently close to falling asleep and then getting out of bed immediately upon waking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has been recommended to do either of these things, and what your experience has been? Or even what your experience has been with exercise in general? I am plagued with constant soreness and drowsiness from trying to exercise this much (despite being a regular 2-3x/wk exerciser before--not sure why this is happening, but I blame it on IH). I'm also having a hard time emotionally/mentally with the not-lounging-in-bed thing--reading my phone and cuddling with my husband and dog in bed was such a source of daily joy/comfort/relief, and doing that sitting on the couch just doesn't compare.

I eventually ended up falling asleep in many classes. This continued on for at least a year before I mentioned it to my dad, because I knew his go-to response would be \u2018stop playing video games\u2019 - and I was right!\n\nI went without any professional advice for 6 years, and each year was getting slightly worse. However, I didn\u2019t notice the fact that I was exhausted each day - to me, that feeling became completely normal, and I thought that that was just what being awake felt like.\n\nMy dad still didn\u2019t believe it was a real issue, that it was due completely to my own actions. It wasn\u2019t until I told my aunt about it (who\u2019s a nurse), and she told him that I should get checked out.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until my appointment a few days ago that many things started to make sense. The neurologist told me that, based on my sleep study, I have hypersomnia.  I\u2019m not sure how common this is, but my sleep study consisted of sleeping at the facility overnight and then taking a series of scheduled naps throughout the next day. The doc told me that I never enter REM (in my naps at least, not sure about the overnight sleep), so I would wake up just as tired as when I fell asleep. Im sleep deprived 24/7.\n\nHearing this, I started connecting some dots. I never really feel myself get tired at night, my theory is because I\u2019m already so tired that I\u2019m just used to that feeling.

Since my late teens, I\u2019ve struggled with: fatigue, depression, and brain fog.  I\u2019ve: been to therapy, had multiple blood work ups,  physicals, allergy tests, MRI, therapy and have been diagnosed with depression and ADD.  \n\nAll these years I thought that my hypersomnia was due to depression.  \n\nFor some reason this year, the need to sleep heightened to such an extreme; life became completely unmanageable and I knew I needed help when I started going out to my car during the work day to sleep.   I would put up a note on my office door, which stated I was at a meeting, and I would sleep in my car for 2 hours.   I seriously did not care if I got fired because then I could sleep in peace.  Any fear of becoming homeless and destitute (due to losing my job) was trumped by my desire for rest.  Nothing and no one else mattered.  I knew I needed help.  \n\nI went to my doctor and confessed.  He immediately suggested a sleep study.  No one had ever suggested that before.   Again, thought it was part of my depression.  \n\nThank you so much for reading.  I mostly wanted to post to introduce myself and again, I\u2019m so glad I found you.

I cut out caffeine and adderall the past few days but I'm still up until 2 or 3 am every night for no reason known to man. Hence me posting at 6AM. I know everything only got so out of whack due to the stress of finals but I'm ready to be back to some kind of semi normal sleeping (as normal as someone with IH can) Other than the usual sleep hygiene rules what suggestions do you guys have?

I've lived in hell my whole life, you can't just prance in without leaving g your shoes at the door. Yeah sleep and waking up sucks for everyone but kid, please, you can feel rested without 16 hours just let us have his.\n\n3. This one is hardly justified and just me being bitter but if anyone refuses to do an important activity because they aren't a morning person. Yeah, mornings are the worst. Over the years  anyone who wouldn't do mornings tasks claimed they couldn't even though they could just didn't. It just bothered me as I would have to go through so much every singke day just to wake up and get where I go for 830am. I just hate how much people take their sleep for granted, and their waking up.\n\n4. Hypersomnia? Never heard of it so obviously it isn't real or worthy of my understanding. But call it narcolepsy and that's real different. This of course too true for people and company policy for such disorders.\n\n5. \"Yeah, just tired. That's just my face. No I'm not sick, I just look like that. Yes I slept last night. Of course i eat enough.\" My character dialogue that plays when you interact with me as I looked like a sickly, malnourished, lanky green been of a person. Also, dark circles at age 8 is strange, dark circles now means I'm \"creepy looking\" or \"terminal\". Naw lads, that's just my body hating itself.\n\n6. For those who know of your IH, they ask if their is some solution. You then say no with a lovely awkward silence that fills the airwaves after. You are used to the fact of no escape, your friend has just realized you are in a permanent state of, \"is it safe to drive:. I doubt the topic will come up much anymore.\n\n7. I got a hunch why I have IH, but it does not matter at all because the information is useless. But still, I like knowing above not knowing I have it.\n\n8. I won't deny the more...sketchy things I've done in my life, many things as ways to cope with what I didn't know was IH. You know how people with ADHD tale adderall and find it easier to pay attention in specific tasks. My genius ass, who had a lot of ADDish symptoms either from or amplified by IH, tried some heavy drugs quite a bit in high school. I would not recommend, but I will say that there was a point where I took a large dose of breaking bad tier stuff, and proceeded to have a school day where I felt like a normal person. I then only slept for 9 hours that night. Drugs are bad but my god, the strongest drug in the world can make us feel average while other people have psychotic episodes. \n\n9. I really want to hang out tonight but I really don't want to hang out tonight.\n\n10. You know that sound old people make when they stand up. You better learn to enjoy it, bitch.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading kids.

I am not diagnosed with IH but I feel pretty strongly that it must be what I suffer from, everything I read about it sounds all too familiar. I see most folks on here saying they started feeling the symptoms later on in life, but I would say for me it started at 7. I had an enormous amount of difficulty getting up for school from that time on. I am 25 now and it just gets worse and worse all the time. I feel like I have to lay down every couple of hours. I\u2019ve missed so much work because I just can\u2019t get alert enough to do what I need to do. My house is constantly a wreck because I\u2019m too tired to clean. I currently use Kratom as a stimulant but I think I\u2019m starting to develop a tolerance to it.\n\nThe worst part of all this is how I feel about myself. Right now I\u2019m on the train headed home from work - I only made it two hours into the day before feeling like I couldn\u2019t go on. And I just feel like a failure. I know deep down that this is out of my control but I just want to feel like a normal adult again. My coworkers have been supportive but then I just feel worse because I feel like I\u2019m letting everyone down. I want to spend more time awake and doing things with my friends and my fiance but I\u2019m struggling so much. Meanwhile, my sleep specialist will not get back to me even though I\u2019ve tried to contact them multiple times over the past month about getting on modafinil. My PCP won\u2019t prescribe in unless the specialist says it\u2019s okay, so I\u2019m kind of stuck.\n\nI talk to my therapist about these feelings, a lot. And it does help. But I can\u2019t fully shake them.

At least in your experience.\n\nI don\u2019t know anyone with any similar disorders, and though I have some supportive friends, they have a hard time understanding things like how it feels like this disorder takes away my personality in a way, not just my energy.

I saw the doctor today about my Provigil not working at the highest dose as described in my previous post and I wanted to update y\u2019all on what happened! \n\nI was SUPER nervous because this is a new doctor to me (my doctor of over 10 years moved) and I have only seen him once before. Being a chronic pain patient already on a narcotic, I was worried about asking for another. \n\nI told my doctor that the Provigil wasn\u2019t working adequately- describing my recent 22 hour sleep. He was at a loss and said the only thing he knew of to do was to draw labs to check thyroid, anemia, and vit d. \n\nI immediately asked him what he knew about IH. He admitted that he knew nothing about it (I see a PCP for meds) and I was his first patient with it. I described the symptoms and he asked what the treatments for it were. I told him that after failing Provigil, the treatment is generally a stimulant. He immediately said \u201cSo Adderall? We can definitely do that!\u201d \n\nHe wrote me for 10mg BID, which is a low dose but I totally understand because we have zero idea how my body will react to it. I was also really surprised he wrote for it considering I had a HR of 150 and had to have an ECG while I was there! \n\nHonestly, I wish everyone could have this amazing of an experience with their IH doctors. I know some of y\u2019all struggle getting the right meds and deal with doctors who are NOT understanding at all. I wish I could change all of that. Please don\u2019t give up and if you can, get a new doctor! You deserve proper medical care! \n\nThank you so much for the support on the last post- it meant so much to me as someone newly diagnosed.

I\u2019m 22 and have recently (finally) been diagnosed with IH. It was a difficult road to diagnosis since I have lupus, which also causes fatigue. However, after regularly sleeping more than 15 hours per night and still needing naps, along with the occasional 17-22 hour periods of sleep, I was diagnosed. \nI currently take b12 injections and Provigil.

Just found this subreddit and I thought it a good idea to share my experience. I was diagnosed with IH about 7 years ago but I know I've been suffering from it since I was 16. Always had trouble staying awake in class and would consistently fall asleep every time I tried to study.\n\nFast forward to now where I have a desk job. While my symptoms are not on the extreme end I struggled with getting up in the morning, feeling asleep at my desk and always feeling irritable. My doctor prescribed stimulants which helped but I didn't want to have to take them for the rest of my life. I searched for other answers, checking my vitamin levels, exercising more and eating better. All didn't improve my symptoms.\n\n6 months ago I stumbled across the ketogenic diet. I read that some people on the diet experienced improved energy and focus. I figured I would give it a shot, having nothing to lose. Once my body entered ketosis I experienced something I never have before, complete wakefulness! I literally felt like a new man, it was incredible. I was so relieved and excited that I was able to find a solution for myself without medication and with something that I could control. I took two weeks off the diet and went right back into the fog and haze. After that I worked  with my doctor and I've been back in the diet eve since with great results.\n\nNow for the disclaimers... My symptoms are not completely gone. There are some times where the sleepiness tries to come back but now it's much easier to shake off, typically by taking a walk or doing anything that gets my heart rate up a little. I have no indication that carbs are what were causing my IH but what I've gathered is that the keto diet greatly reduces the affects of after meal crashes and just gives me an overall sustained boost in energy. I feel as if my IH is still there but this diet has shifted me further towards awake on the sleep spectrum. I have only taken my stimulants a few times in the past 6 months, which I can totally handle.\n\nAs for the diet, I STRONGLY recommend that anyone considering it first talk with their doctor and a nutritionist. The keto diet has become a fad diet, even though it's been around for a very long time, and there can be some risks in trying it without proper guidance. My doctor is checking my blood every 3 months to ensure nothing goes out of wack. This was a really good idea as my cholesterol went way up after the first 3 months, which we are now managing through adjustments in my diet and with supplements.\n\nLast comment on the diet; it's not an easy adjustment. It will take work and preparation but if anyone finds relief then the effort is 100% worth it.\n\nI hope my experience can help others. Our body's are all different and react differently so I can't say this is the solution for IH, but if it can help some of us then that's a step in the right direction.", "send_replies": true,

I've posted here a few days ago but yesterday I called my local health center and asked for an appointment to see a doctor about my sleep issues.\n\nI said on the phone that I thought I might have sleep apnea, THEN I told them my symptoms. \n\nYknow, good stuff, like: unless I have alarms I easily sleep 16 hours, it takes really long for me to wake up in the morning, I set 50 alarms on my phone 2 hours before I need to leave for work. Sleep inertia is BAD in the morning, it takes like 10 minutes to even start getting dressed because my brain is so out of it. I'm constantly tired and I randomly get daytime sleepiness that makes it hard to concentrate. I take naps sometimes but I try to avoid it because then I won't wake for like 3-4 hours. I've slept through fire alarms. \n\nI have had these issues since my early teenage years, so roughly 10 years since I'm 22 now. Before it's affected my school performance a lot and now it's made me lose out on work opportunities.\n\n\nSo I'm thinking that starting with getting checked for sleep apnea is the best course of action, make sure it's not that before I ask to be sent to a neurologist or similar.\n\nThat said, I doubt it is sleep apnea, mostly because I have an app that records sounds I make at night. I know I snore loudly enough to have kept my ex up at one point. My parents both snore loudly too. But the app is very sensitive, so it catches just my more silent breathing between snores as well. Through all the recordings I've never heard anything sounding like absolute silence and then gasping that signals sleep apnea.\n\nOnce that's confirmed as not being the problem I'm going to suggest IH. Now that I know that I am not just lazy and that it's a real neurological thing that can be diagnosed I just want to get the ball rolling as soon as possible, get some kind of diagnosis so I can start trying medications that can possibly improve my symptoms, because I am so very sick of living like this, having lost out on so much thanks to this goddamn condition. \n\nThe sooner the better. Please wish me luck, I'm really nervous that once I do tests everythings gonna come back normal and I'm gonna get the dreaded clich\u00e9s again \"You just have to try harder to get up in the morning\" and \"try going to bed earlier\" \n\nDoes anyone have any tips on what kind of tests to ask for once IH is on the table to possibly speed up the process? Is it enough to just ask for a sleep study? I hate going in blind and wasting time because doctors have no clue what to even look for or test for...\n\nThank you in advance, I'd really appreciate any suggestions!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 728, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Going to see a doctor about my sleepissues Friday", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/9z4axt/going_to_see_a_doctor_about_my_sleepissues_friday/"}, {"author": "hekadoyoshi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_a819j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542550736, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/9y6a1n/new_follower_new_research_into_ih/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9y6a1n", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/9y6a1n/new_follower_new_research_into_ih/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1542550737, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello! I'm Heka, 22 yo, undiagnosed sufferer of IH for around 10 years now. I've suffered from all symptoms of IH since puberty and paired with my diagnosed depression, it's not been easy. \n\nI'm also diagnosed as being on the high-functioning end of the autistic spectrum, but to be fair, autism has only been a minimal hurdle in my life in comparison to IH and depression. I struggle with my diseases every day, but one big success I can now claim is the fact that about a month ago, after all these years, I read about *hypersomnias* for the first time. Then I found idiopathic hypersomnia, and it all fits. It strange how it doesn't feel like a more groundbreaking discovery for me, you know, that my years of not being able to get out of bed isn't just me being lazy and unmotivated. I guess I've just gotten over beating myself up over being a constant failure in the one basic thing every person on earth seem to do just fine, get out of bed. I realized this couldn't just be me, not everyone could be struggling this hard. \n\nI'm just relieved, I'm suffering from a real disorder that I cannot control, and all the shit I've gotten from family over the years, losing out on job opportunities... It's not my fault. There's a certain amount of frustration at the fact that no doctor has ever even tried to figure out why I had such trouble with waking up, they just chalked it up to it being a bi-product of my depression. But no, I've been depression free short periods in my life since I was diagnosed and my crippling problems with sleep have still been there. \n\nI know it's not recommended to self-diagnose, and don't get me wrong, I have been to a more serious doctor and explained my problems, said I've read up on it and think I have IH. He seemed very confused by my trying to explain my symptoms, like he'd never heard anything about IH before, which I'm not surprised by. But I'm going to hold fast and insist on this being looked into. I want to get sent to a sleep lab or sleep specialist who doesn't just focus on sleep apne. I'll be fucking annoying if I have to. You have to be if you want to get the healthcare you have the rights to here in Sweden, where I live. Our healthcare system is overloaded right now, my doctor said he'd call me back in one week and it's been three weeks now. It's frustrating and tiresome but I'll have to be patient. Previously I had absolutely no clue what could possibly be wrong with me, so I had no way of seeking help- But now I have a massive clue, so I'm going to use that and I'm not going to let up until I can get some goddamn meds so I can function and pursue my ambitions and goals.\n\nI also believe that a big reason why I'm still struggling with my depression despite having dealt with and faced a lot of my traumas is because it all comes back to my sleep problems. Constantly struggling with that takes a big toll on my self-confidence and how serious I seem at a workplace. My personal economy and struggling with it doesn't help my depression either, so just making waking up and staying awake just a bit easier every day is going to be a big boost in my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alright, it's okay if you didn't care enough to read that heavy introduction! Here comes something actually exciting!!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's start by telling you about the Karolinska Institute in Sweden! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Excerpt from wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karolinska_Institute)\n\n\"The **Karolinska Institute** (sometimes known as the **(Royal) Caroline Institute** in English) is a medical university in Solna within the Stockholm urban area of Sweden. It is recognised as Sweden's best university and one of the largest, most prestigious medical universities in the world. The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPretty good stuff, they do tons of medical reasearch, and a lot of investment into companies that are developing new pharmaceuticals, one of them being **Umecrine Cognition!** \n\nThey are described by KI like this, *\" Umecrine Cognition is developing pharmaceuticals against neurological disorders in the central nervous system\".*\n\nAnd currently, ***Umecrine Cognition are researching a new possible compound that could be used to improve IH symptoms in patients!*** It's past its pre-clinical phase and phase I, currently in phase II, and they seem to be seeing a 34% successrate in phase II. I'm not sure if those are good numbers, but compared to the successrate of the other reasearch being done it doesn't seem better or worse.\n\nI don't know if anyone here already knew about this, but I'm very excited to know that there's current active research being done about this rare disorder! I for one am going to follow this research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are their recent progress and milestones pertaining to IH\n\n \n\n### Recent progress\n\n* Positive Phase Ib data for GR3027(subject compound in study) presented (September 2017).\n* SEK 20 million(about 2.2 million usd) raised from existing investors to fund a Phase IIa study in IH (October 2017).\n* First patient included in clinical Phase IIa study in patients with IH (November 2017).\n\n### Expected milestones\n\n* Results from Phase IIa study in IH expected in 2018.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's some nice links for anyone who wants to read about the research:\n\n[Karolinska's portfolio](https://www.karolinskadevelopment.com/en/our-portfolio), [Umecrine Cognition](https://www.karolinskadevelopment.com/en/umecrine-cognition)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 725, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New follower, new research into IH!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/9y6a1n/new_follower_new_research_into_ih/"}, {"author": "3Vil_Admin", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7ns7u", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542129294, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/9wqyd2/nothing_works_im_losing_hope/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9wqyd2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/9wqyd2/nothing_works_im_losing_hope/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1542129295, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was diagnosed with IH about five years ago.  I've suffered from it since my early twenties (I'm now 42).  I've seen four different doctors who have prescribed nearly every stimulant in various doses and nothing works.  I get zero relief from anything.  I'm currently on 80Mg of dextroamphetamine with three 5Mg boosters of methamphetamine per day.  I don't even know what it is supposed to feel like to have energy.  I can sleep at anytime of the day no matter what I've taken.  Twelve hours of sleep makes me feel the same as two hours of sleep.  I've tried losing weight, exercise, and sleep hygiene and nothing happens. \n\nThree of the four doctors I've seen have all been in the same hospital system.  The last of those doctors is the head of sleep medicine for the hospital system.  She basically told me that she's at a loss on how to help me.  The last doctor I went to was at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.  He was confident he could help me but for whatever reason he will not respond to inquiries from either me or my other doctor. \n\nNeedless to say I'm extremely frustrated and horribly depressed.  I've had four sleep studies and three MSLTs.  The last suggestion I heard was about a MWT but I don't see us gaining anything from this other than me being in further debt to the hospital systems.  Xyrem has been suggested but I cannot afford that and I'm not sure I can deal with the restrictions needed to be on that.\n\nI'm currently trying to find a new doctor and I'm pretty much open to anyone in the United States.

Mine is not so severe as some of yours, My hats off to you guys that would be horrific.  \n\nI wanted to share my story because this does exist in a lighter state , maybe it can give other people the reason to get checked out \n\nEven when I was a baby I slept more the. The average person. I hear stories of me sleeping 24+ hours and my mother constantly checking on me because that wasn\u2019t normal.  As a young kid I had an extremely difficult time waking up.  My mother used to get so mad. She finally started waking me up with a spray bottle of cold water,  and that only worked sometimes the get me out of bed quicker then usual.\n\nI have memories of drinking 2-3 jolt colas (show your age, who remembers ?). And going to sleep immediately.  Other than randomly falling asleep in places , I did not have any major symptoms , people thought I was just lazy. \n\nInto adulthood I was always able to function mostly - I had to (and currently do) set 8 alarms. \nI have to be up at 6? My alarms start at 5am for me to wake up..  sometines I would sleep through them but majority of the time this worked. I didn\u2019t know what it was at the time but sleep driunkenes  is an issue most mornings. \n\nLong story shirt that\u2019s what I lived with, just feeling tired all the time. \nIn my early 20\u2019s falling askew driving started happening , so primary care dr with no test diagnosed me with narcolepsy and gave me Ritalin. I had no insurance  and that did not continue . \nFast forward to present : \nI have always just felt. Pullover and get out if the car when I started falling asleep. These were the worse for me as they felt like random sleep attacks that I couldn\u2019t control or predict could be otw to work right after I woke up at my desk , or 3pm in the afternoon , driving for the road - \n\nWent for a sleep study, they found I had sleep apnea.

This is my first time making a self-understanding based post not asking for help, but trying to give some.  In no way shape or form am I a medical professional and do not act as one. These are all my personal experiences that I have to share (partial). I really hope this helps some people out there and would love to hear other peoples thoughts as well. For staters my name is Danny, I am a college student and I am 25 years old. I was diagnosed with IH when I was 23, which for me was a shit show like many other people. I was in the military at the time, and I would like to say that I was good at what I do, but one day I had no energy, I was depressed, I did't want to hang out with anyone, and I found myself struggling to keep my fitness up. In all of that I was a wreck, I had no idea what to do because I thought this was my body showing signs of aging because everyone around me seemed just as tired as me. I mean we we're doing 12 hr shifts with one hour turnovers; so try and take into concept of trying to put your life in that schedule as well. I plan to just skip ahead to things that actually have to do with this topic unless someone wants to hear the steps that I took to end up with my final diagnosis.   \n\n\nSo, the things that I found help me deal with the situation of IH. In the mornings I feel extremely groggy I have set my haptic settings on for my alarms. For people who don't know what that is that is the setting that sets your phone to strobe your flash. I like using this because it stimulates my body to think that there is a foreign light source in the room almost like daylight. Now here's the thing I think it's important to put it on the highest volume with this as well as putting it as far away as possible from your arms reach so that you have to get up and shut it off which for me, makes it so that I am aware that if I lay down I will be out for \"X\" amount of hours. Now the next thing I do is I take a cold shower because that instantly puts me in a slightly energetic state, which then allows me to move forward in my day. The big thing for me to make sure that I am awake is that I drink a cup of coffee before I leave as well as I eat something. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExercise, is a real important thing; it sucks I know. I feel that this is something that ends up getting overlooked because we all hate doing it and we are all to tired but it's important. I say that it's important because any time that I don't do it my body hurts but also I find that I will be in rut if I don't.   \n\n\nI'm currently keeping this short to see if people have an interest in this, I just hate seeing that all we have is drug based thoughts; that stay cliff hangers.

I started my \"what's going on with me\" reddit search with Chronic Fatigue and have searched around and found the most in common with you all with Idiopathic Hypersomnia. I've not been diagnosed with IH, but I am curious as to whether those of you who have been experience similar things. \n\nI've been sleepy since high school (I'm now 24) and have been diagnosed with and successfully treated for with anemia and Hashimoto's disease since then. Waking up has been a challenge for me as long as I can remember, requiring at least an hour's worth of snoozing in order to feel ready to keep my eyes open. I'm sleepy during the day every day, but never enough to pass out in the middle of what I'm doing- usually I just get overwhelmed or frustrated at how exhausted I feel and need to stop to nap or drink caffeine. Even so, the naps I do take aren't restful enough to justify, yet I can't seem to function sometimes if I don't. \n\nI'm a freelancer so I'm not beholden to a 9-5 schedule, which means I'm usually working from around 11-7. This is fine and all, but it seems that no matter how much sleep I get, I'm fatigued during the day. The most comfortable amt of sleep for me is around 9.5hrs/night, but if I don't set an alarm then I'll easily sleep 11hrs and feel jet-lagged. \n\nMy doctor suggests that I should be exercising at least 3 days a week, which I'm slowly working towards since exercise is hard for me to afford. I get the feeling it might help morale, but won't solve the issue because regular exercise hasn't helped me in the past. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this sound similar to your experiences? If you've been diagnosed with IH, how did you go about getting that diagnosis? As I mentioned, my doctor just wants me to get more exercise and hasn't seemed open to other options yet. I've been feeling hopeless because it's hard to be sleepy all the time and the societal pressures (even from my partner) of getting up early are strong and persistent. Not to mention that coffee has been giving me digestive discomfort recently, so there hasn't been much at all I can do to help myself other than sleep a TON. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance for any advice or encouragement!

I look forward to contributing in this forum as much as I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLittle background about myself :\n\nI am a 21F and have struggled with excessive daytime sleepiness since I was 17. It has definitely gotten worse the last couple years, and specifically the last 6 months. In Undergrad, I maintained a very high GPA (3.9) in a pre-medical major. The only way that I was able to get through school was to cram before every test, and skip classes to study on my own time (I could never pay attention in lectures). In addition, I abused caffeine pills and ephedrine in school to accomplish the grades I needed. Looking back at it, I have hardly any memory of the material in any of my classes, which sucks, but it is what it is.\n\nI recently was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia and obtained a mean latency sleep time of 5 minutes during the MLST sleep tests. **Something I never really understood was that I was told to take my medication 2 hours before the MLST test which was a combination of 30mg vyvanse and 10mg adderall IR (I am obviously even more tired/sleepy without my medication)**. During the \"nap attempts\" thought I was awake during every single nap. I honestly remember laying there with my eyes half open the whole time.\n\nI currently only take whats prescribed (dexedrine) and in the prescribed dosage, but I find that it doesn't have the motivational \"kick\" like the L-amphetamine salt in adderall does. Previously when I was misdiagnosed with depression/ ADHD/ CFS I took the following stimulants in no order or specific combination: Caffiene, Ephedrine, Yerba Mate, Clenbuterol, yohimbine HCL, Buproprion HCL, adderall, dexedrine, methylphenidate, vyvanse, modafinil, armodafinil, and even cocaine (once!)\n\nI tried kratom for the first time last week (1g tea) at a kratom bar with a friend from school. I immediately noticed an improved mood, my focus was heightened, and for the first time in a long time, my brain was clear. Socializing became easier, and I didn't feel tired at all. I am in no way encouraging this as a treatment, as it is dangerous and illegal in some states (It's legal in Ohio, where I live).

It lists a few others including methylphenidate SR and modafinil.  So it doesn't necessarily need to be bupropion.\n\nA couple months ago, I finally went to a psychiatrist to address anxiety and depression.  He prescribed me Bupropion, which is a stimulating anti-depressant, and told me to take it right away in the AM.\n\nThen I started telling him how bad my sleep drunkenness was.  I had bruises all over from running into stuff, and it was extending for hours and hours into the day.  At that point he goes, \"Oh! I actually published a study on this!\" (I sought this guy out because he had a strong sleep background, albeit, with parasomnias, not IH). \"Take the Bupropion immediately before you fall asleep at night.  The effect should be immediate.\"  \\**cue my face lighting up\\**\n\nThe effect was immediate.  I could even remember what I was thinking about before falling asleep the night before!  It was insane.  I'm no longer turning off multiple alarm clocks because I *can't* get out of bed, I'm doing it because I *refuse* to get out of bed!\n\nThe hardest part has been making sure I take it before I fall asleep.  Since it's a stimulant, if I take it too long before falling asleep, it can keep me.  If I forget to take it, I have to take it in the morning, which sets off a bad cycle of staying up late that night, going to bed late, etc.  I literally take it like 2 minutes before falling asleep, so sometimes sleep wins that race, and I pass out before taking it.  Dealing with establishing the habit of taking it at night, though, has been totally worth it.  My whole day is no longer spent trying to wake up.\n\nJust wanted to put some hope out there, for anyone dealing with sleep drunkenness and depression (though I don't even know if the depression is a necessary factory, Bupropion is also prescribed as a smoking cessation drug.

I feel like it was but a mild inconvenience before. I didn\u2019t have the classical long sleep times, napping, falling asleep during the day... but now, I am miserable. I still don\u2019t fall asleep during the day, but all I can think about is how tired I am, and how badly I just want to sleep. (I am incredibly stubborn) I\u2019ve fallen into despair. I was capable of so much. Now I\u2019m worried my whole life is gone. I have a house, a career... I\u2019m considering selling my house, because I\u2019m scared of progression, and not being able to function on my own, and I am not coping well currently. I also have depression and anxiety, which really came to a head back in March, I was soon diagnosed with IH after that (I had the appointment set up before my breakdown). They started me on armodaphinil 150mg. I really don\u2019t feel a difference. I feel like I never see any success stories with IH. Someone please tell me there is hope.\n\nI don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t feel like I fit the bill. I sleep 9 and a half hours at most (almost never, usually 8 or less). I never nap. I got super sleepy at my desk at work before, but I assumed it was boredom, quiet, and lack of stuff to do. But I never just went down for long periods of time. I don\u2019t have sleep drunkenness, I am annoyed at having to wake up sometimes, but it\u2019s not the worst thing in the world. My memory seems fine. Except now, I get so frustrated with my tiredness...\n\nI am hoping the sudden severity I\u2019m facing is caused by depression. Which honestly I don\u2019t know how to fix, as it seems to be a vicious cycle.\n\nDoes anyone have an experience similar to mine?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1995, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Recently diagnosed", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/hvzoqc/recently_diagnosed/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595435068, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/hvwtfz/ah_yes_i_have_gerd_now_so_i_have_to_take_my_naps/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hvwtfz", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/hvwtfz/ah_yes_i_have_gerd_now_so_i_have_to_take_my_naps/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "deleted", "retrieved_on": 1595481928, "score": 2, "selftext": "[deleted]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1995, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Ah yes, I have gerd now, so I have to take my naps sitting up", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/hvwtfz/ah_yes_i_have_gerd_now_so_i_have_to_take_my_naps/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "nosirrags", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12ymsa", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595431866, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/hvvu0v/ihdiagnosed_and_adhdundiagnosed_26f/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hvvu0v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/hvvu0v/ihdiagnosed_and_adhdundiagnosed_26f/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1595479255, "score": 4, "selftext": "I was diagnosed with IH 8 years ago. Over the last year I've had a growing suspicion that I might have ADHD. My older brother has it and my dad has symptoms of it as well. None of us are particularly hyperactive, but I have a terrible time focusing, a short attention span unless I get completely fixated on something, and have noticed a very steep decline in my \"work ethic\" over the last 6 or so years. I became afraid that I was just a bad worker or lazy, but I just graduated from the top masters degree in my field in the world and spent 2.5 years working my ass off... But when I don't have the immediate pressure of a deadline everything goes to hell. When the pandemic hit and I had to work from home and not in a studio environment I basically didn't do anything for 3 months. It kind of ruined my thesis. It's not that I don't want to, it's that I just can't seem to focus for more than a few minutes at a time. I have plans and good intentions, but when left to my own devices almost nothing is accomplished. I always attributed this to my exhaustion, but now I think there's something else at play. \n\nI am currently on Adderall and was on Ritalin for the last year but it got too expensive. I have never spoken to a doctor about my suspicions of ADHD, but I notice a huge improvement for the 2 or 3 hours a day that my medicine works. It's definitely powerful enough as is, but doesn't last long enough. So here's the question - is the medicine helping only because I have IH and I'm getting relief from my exhaustion, or is it also making me focus and be productive because I have ADHD? \n\nTLDR: Do you have ADHD and IH?

I'm new to this subreddit. Was diagnosed this year. My doctor is awesome and it's such a relief years of bad ones. My spouse is as supportive and helpful as can be. They both encourage me that naps are expected and a good daily thing. I am on modafinil. It is helping but lasts 5 hours at a time, both times I medicate. So there are gaps. 2 pills in morning and 2 later. The gap in between the two is when I'm falling asleep. \n\nThe problem is that my guilt is preventing it. My brain is mean and says I'm lazy, wasting my day, neglecting my pet owner/house owner/spousal duties.

I told my family and they told me I can\u2019t use it as an excuse and that the world is hard and still goes on and that I should pick up a second job to work nights so I can make more money as well as making me go to the gym three times a week. \n\nI enjoy working and being productive but somedays it is way harder than others (if anyone is curious I can tell the plan we have in place), I now have ritalin and its been helping me out a lot when I know that I have things to do that day. Right now though, I already have limited hours but making it to just the one shift a week can be difficult. I\u2019ve had a lot of trouble accepting it and realizing that I need to listen to my body and not just push myself like I normally would just to get through half of the day only to be completely drained from anything else once I get off. I feel like my family just puts it off as lazy and it just makes me feel worse about myself, I\u2019m constantly battling having to accept it and take it easy on myself with also wanting to work as much as I can and push myself to seem as normal as possible to my family and others. If I can\u2019t figure myself out within a month on this new weekend only work schedule I may have to pick up another short term job at night time just so I can make some more money with college starting back up soon. I\u2019m just nervous and don\u2019t want to overestimate myself. \n\nBUT! MY MAIN QUESTION WAS: \n\nI was wondering what routines work best for you guys or if you have even found one? Work/school/day-to-day wise. Does exercise help?

unrelenting sleepiness we feel.  'Tired' doesn't capture it.  Even 'exhausted' falls short.  \n\nBecause tired and exhausted are normal conditions.  The healthiest among us know what tired is - according to their experience.  They know tired as a temporary state - one that is easily resolved by sleep.  So they assume that it's all the same thing.  And they assume that if they can endure it, we should be able to as well.  And if we don't, it must mean we're lazy, or depressed, or seeking pity or just bad at managing life...\n\nBut with IH, tired and exhausted only scratch the surface.  They don't begin to describe the degree to which this illness debilitates. \n\nI'm interested in hearing what YOUR tired actually feels like.   To find some better words that more accurately characterize the difference between 'normal tired' and 'IH tired'.  Because we're not crazy, or lazy or unwilling.  And tonight I think I just need a reminder. \n\nI'll start:\n\n\\-Exhausted, but jittery.  When you're so tired, you can't sleep.  When you're running on fumes and your body starts to overcompensate with empty energy.  It's exactly how I use to feel in college the day after I had pulled an all nighter.  I was exhausted but buzzy - not anxious - more like an unpleasant kind of high.\n\n\\-Quicksand feeling followed by euphoric rest or napping.  On some days, it's as if my body is begging me to sleep.  Everything just feels heavy - like i'm moving through quicksand.  And when I lay down or go to take a nap, in those first few moments, it's like a euphoric release.  My body goes from heavy and overextended to \"aaaahhhh\".  This one is hard to explain but I'm including it in case it resonates with anyone else.  \n\n\\-Eye pain.  Not from reading or staring at a computer screen.  But just from the effort of keeping them propped open all day.  Some days it's more of a burning and other days it's a stabbing pain but it's always accompanied by tears and redness.  I blame it on the allergies that I don't actually have.\n\n\\-Fogginess.  It feels like there's a film of dust clouding my brain.  On my worst days, when the stimulants aren't doing what they're supposed to, forming an intentional thought or sentence, takes enormous effort. Nothing happens organically -  I can't just find the words or connect the dots - I have to work for it all.  And I'm especially prone to forgetting things, or bumping into walls, or wondering why I entered a room or started an email.  \n\n\\-Emotionally spent:  When i feel like shit, my emotions are like a time bomb - just waiting for a reason to go off.  I think in part bc bad physical days, offer a stark reminder of what I'm up against.  And it makes me angry that i have to deal with this shit.  Which makes me want to lash out and blame somebody (which is obviously ridiculous and irrational).  But it's also I think bc I'm using all my energy to do what needs to get done, that I have nothing else to expend.  It takes energy I don't have to restrain my negative emotions, and it becomes much easier to just let them sweep over me.\n\nI'll stop here - there are a few more but I'm getting sleepy, and I'd rather read yours anyway:-). \u2764\ufe0f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1958, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What does your \"tired\" actually feel like?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/hmkpag/what_does_your_tired_actually_feel_like/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "rebetzels", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_17ef92qj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594068739, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/hmg9ba/who_can_prescribe_modafinil/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hmg9ba", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b0a7e18a-a17d-11e8-88ac-0e14fa46b726", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/hmg9ba/who_can_prescribe_modafinil/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1594071631, "score": 2, "selftext": "I don\u2019t have a \u201csleep doc\u201d - I\u2019ve been diagnosed with sleep apnea but also believe I suffer from IH.

Even if I read before bed, my brain will loop themes from the story over and over. For instance, I\u2019m reading a fantasy book where there character is learning how to detect poison in food. My mind could not let go of this concept and it seemed like all night it was looking for poison in hypothetical food. \n\nIt definitely could be related to anxiety, because I\u2019m getting a lot of hypnagogic hallucinations as well, and those are worse when I\u2019m struggling with anxiety. I\u2019m on an SSRI though, and even got it upped a few months ago to combat an increase in anxiety. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m looking for here, in terms of responses.

They don\u2019t, most of the time sadly. Sometimes they do but not nearly as much as I would like. \nI can\u2019t always rely on people because it shouldn\u2019t be others job to wake me up, especially when sleepy me is so stubborn. I don\u2019t like bothering others when I\u2019m having a hard time getting up, and sometimes people aren\u2019t even there to help. Most of the time, honestly.\nAlarms don\u2019t help much personally, because I get so used to alarms they don\u2019t wake me up or bother me. I can\u2019t use alarms while out of the house because they can\u2019t detect if I\u2019m sleeping or not. The only way is to set and alarm every 10-30 minutes, but even then I still get used to the noise/vibration and it doesn\u2019t bother me.\n\nSo, I was thinking a service dog would help a lot. But I wondered as to how it could even work? A service dog would have to be able to help me stay awake when I fall asleep, maybe even help me with keeping a steady schedule of sleeping because I rarely get sleepy at night so I don\u2019t like going to bed, and would help me wake up in the morning.\nThe only issue I see with that is that, how I do I help the service dog train so that way they help me sleep at night, but help me stay awake during the day? I thought maybe to train them to only do it when they have a vest on, or when I\u2019m not at home. But it can\u2019t be the latter because sometimes I have to stay awake for doing work at home (which I\u2019ve tried to avoid but it\u2019s impossible to not have work at home forever) or for catching appointments. \nAnother thing is that I did research on how service dogs help for narcolepsy because they can detect sleep attacks before it happens, but I don\u2019t *think* I have sleep attacks. It feels more like I\u2019m resisting a pull to sleep 24/7, but sometimes I\u2019m so tired I can\u2019t resist. Would the dog know by body language? And how would I teach them that certain body language? \n\nI know that I don\u2019t need a service dog right now, my IH isn\u2019t as bad as it could be, but I also know that it could get worse with how my sleep has been since the pandemic. I don\u2019t have the money either haha but I was curious as to how it would even work? And if anyone has a service dog that works the way I described?

My eyes burn and ache all day. I yawn and yawn and yawn. When I sleep I dream. So real they are like a continuation of my waking day. Standing on the prow of a sinking ship, struggling to dial 911, carrying and delivering a baby, a girl that I name Bea. They are so real, so vivid that upon realization of waking I grieve. I confuse them with my own memories and live in a perpetual state of deja vu. Sometimes I can't even tell a real memory from a dream. My body feels like a dead thing that I drag around, so heavy, and I am trapped here.\u00a0\n\nAnd I am now realizing that this is not something that can ever be fixed. That I will never go to bed and wake up rested. That I will always be seen as lazy, that I always will *be* lazy for the rest of my life. That no one will understand that I can't just get out of bed, go work out or shop for groceries, it is not a choice I am making. I do not want to be like this. To have wasted\u00a0all these years and now I know I'll continue to waste the rest of my life. No one is more disappointed in me than me.\u00a0\n\n\nFor years I have been telling doctors how tired I am no matter how much or little I sleep, how I have no energy to do anything. How it has been sleep over everything to my own detriment. I got told it was anemia, hypothyroidism, given supplements and vitamins, diet and exercise regimens, sleep hygiene rituals. Nothing ever made a difference. Until one day I stumbled upon Phentermine. Appetite suppressant and amphetamine. Lose weight and get an energy boost? The dream. It was amazing. Like night and day. I had not felt this good in I don't know how long. I bounced out of bed for work every morning, I didn't have to rush home in the afternoon\u00a0 everyday to nap, I didn't uncontrollably fall asleep on my couch at night. I was running errands, I was working out, I was living the average life that I had coveted of others for years. I felt happy.\n\n\n\u00a0However, phentermine is not a long term solution. Bad for the heart and you quickly develop a tolerance. But\u00a0now that I knew there was the possibility of feeling this way I went back to my doctors determined to find something I could take that would mimic the effects in a safer way. I got passed off between therapists, my PCP, psychiatrists, finally to a neurologist who instantly said IH after hearing my symptoms. I'd never heard of it before, always assuming that sleep was a symptom, not the root of my problems. But after doing some research and with how I reacted to phentermine it all fit.\u00a0\n\n\nJumped through dozens of hoops to be able to try modafinil and armodafinil, they didnt do anything for me but make my heart race. Now that the sleep labs are open I am here doing a 24 hour sleep lab. I slept for maybe 3 hours last night and not at all for my first 2 naps. At home when I nap I fall asleep instantly, but with the pressure of how much this means I don't think I will be able to at all. I desperately want to get the right results so I can continue on to more powerful medication options but I also don't want to have IH because it's for life. I'm exhausted right now and so anxious.\u00a0\n\n\nI wrote the above after I first found out about IH as a way to try and explain to my family how I feel but I'm hoping someone here might be able to relate.\u00a0", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1934, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "After years of misdiagnosis neurologist suspects IH, I am at my sleept test now.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/heinv3/after_years_of_misdiagnosis_neurologist_suspects/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "wheatosm", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6zeutpjc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1592864132, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/he2335/waiting_for_results/", "gildings": {}, "id": "he2335", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7ab03dc6-a320-11e8-807c-0e6fe7d73958", "link_flair_text": "Symptoms", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/he2335/waiting_for_results/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1592869457, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m a week away from my follow up to figure out how my overnight/MSLT went and can\u2019t stop thinking about my symptoms/experience and how my tests went! I feel like i have no one to really talk to about how i feel so i figured i\u2019d post here (i apologize in advance for the super long post!!) :\n\nDuring the overnight i slept but kept waking up due to overheating lol..they had me stay the next day and i am positive that i slept through all four naps they had me take. When i nap i typically either fall into a long dead sleep or am aware i\u2019m sleeping and wake up unsure if i even slept or not- it varies between the two along with vividly dreaming every so often. During the MSLT i don\u2019t remember dreaming but i do remember my brain playing out a story in my mind while i wasn\u2019t yet asleep (at least i think) if that makes any sense??? And i would wake right up as soon as the technician entered the room for every nap. \nAlmost every time i sleep or nap i typically wake up feeling pretty refreshed for a few hours before feeling exhausted and out of it again. I nap nearly every day from an hour to about three hours at a time and at night i typically cannot fall asleep until around 12-1am. \n\nFocusing is also difficult for me and things that aren\u2019t basically automatic or interesting make me exhausted- which makes college particularly harder to get through. It started to get worse when I got mono a little over a year ago and has progressed since then but i didn\u2019t think anything of it until i was uncontrollably falling asleep in my classes, having to leave class because i felt like putting my head down or falling asleep often would come off as rude, or not going to class at all for multiple weeks because of it. I started sleeping through plans with my s/o and oversleeping easily for work. I\u2019ve only knowingly experienced hallucinating while driving lately after a wave of exhaustion randomly hit me and my body of course ends up feeling heavy or weak and i\u2019ll have to sit down often at work or my head becomes heavy which makes it harder to keep it up when driving but not to the point where i\u2019m incapable of driving. I occasionally have lapses in time where i forget if i\u2019ve done something, how i got where i was when driving or even mid sentence while talking- forgetting completely what i was even doing or talking about or it sometimes being difficult to listen in conversations which comes off as rude :/  \n\nWhat confuses me also is that i\u2019m sometimes able to push off my symptoms and am not as tired some days as i am others and it makes me feel like this is all just me overreacting :/ my main doctor recommended me to my sleep doctor who asked me my symptoms and even listed off some that resonated with me without knowing. He told me he highly doubts its sleep apnea after looking at my tonsils and having a hard time finding them lol but also that he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it is narcolepsy or something else but to have a sleep study done just to be sure. Again i\u2019ve been waiting months due to covid and finally got the study, then had to wait another month for my results which i\u2019ll find out in a week! But i cannot stop questioning everything and overthinking whether or not i\u2019ll even get some sort of diagnosis so i figured i\u2019d let it all out here. \n\nIf anyone has any other questions i\u2019ll gladly answer and again im so sorry for how LENGTHY and possibly confusing this post is if anyone even reads it all lmao, and if you do, THANK YOU!!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1932, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Waiting for results", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/he2335/waiting_for_results/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kvenice999", "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "56de33b2-a13b-11e8-86fb-0ec44c28c910", "author_flair_text": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 [QC]", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5coptswr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1592846538, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/hdwjks/missed_important_work_meetings_after_weekend_of/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hdwjks", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b0a7e18a-a17d-11e8-88ac-0e14fa46b726", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/hdwjks/missed_important_work_meetings_after_weekend_of/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1592854748, "score": 4, "selftext": "Hey everyone..

I have skype meetings with our manager 3x a week @7am and with our team supervisor every morning @8am. Everything has been great with a few times I overslept. \n\nFinally, they managed to set up some Virtual Skype Trainings to replace the normal in-person ones. I am currently signed up for one every day 11am to 3pm for three weeks. Its been hard staying awake and focused during the entire skype class sunce its heavy on the theory with 0 practical references but I\u2019ve managed. \n\nToday. I had an important meeting at 9am with our newly appointed Manager and then my training at 11am. Problem is I woke up maybe an hour ago.. Missed the meeting and I\u2019m extremely late for my training. I\u2019m in no state to join the course. I\u2019m mentally and physically exhausted. My job does not know about my IH and now I\u2019m stressing out trying to decide what to do. What do I tell them?  How do I explain it..

naps\n\u2022 Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with, and for 2 months after stopping, modafinil.\n\u2022 You must ensure that all female patients of childbearing potential are informed about and fully understand:\na) The potential risk to a foetus if modafinil is used during pregnancy\nb) That modafinil should not be used during pregnancy\nc) The need to use effective contraception during treatment with, and for 2 months after stopping, modafinil.\nd) As modafinil may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraception, alternative or additional

I decided since I was feeling so well not eating that I would just go on a fast for a couple of days and see what happened.  I hadn't eaten much in the last few days but a couple of oranges and some yogurt so I was already halfway there. \n\nThis morning was day 3, and the sinus drainage started in earnest .  I evidently had eustachian tubes and sinuses bulging with candida, not to mention my gut.  I haven't fed them in most of a week and coupled with some probiotics and candida complex I had laying around the die-off has started.   What started out as a lump in my throat a couple of days ago has turned into what feels like grapes rolling down the back of my throat every few minutes.  I'm pretty sure I have never been able to smell this well before, and I can actually hear and see again.  It crept up on me so slowly, I didn't realize how bad I was.  It didn't help that it made me stupid and sleepy.   I'm not sure how the neurotransmitters fit into this equation, but OMG am I relieved to know it is something relatively mundane.  \n\nI'm guessing I got colonized during the hospital stay when I was on IV antibiotics for 10 days and it just built up so slowly I never noticed it.  Well, I did kinda notice the by-products coming out of my skin in a couple of places, but I thought it was acne.  Nope.  Yeast poop. Surrounding my brain.  And it smelled terrible.  I smelled terrible.  And I was so full of it my wife says she can visibly see my neck is smaller in just 2.5 days.   I know this is just the first step down a long road, but I now feel like I have a map and a destination in mind.\n\nThank you everyone that helped with advice or information, this has been a multi-year journey to find out what the hell was wrong with me.  I guess its time to do this once a year whether I need it or not, as I can't feel it creeping up on me and when it does I get dumber and dumber by the day.  That is the worst feeling in the world, feeling yourself get dumber and dumber yet not being able to do anything about it.  I was so worried about brain damage due to oxygen deprivation during the pneumonia phase, or an unknown head injury I received in one of my car accidents where I fell asleep at the wheel.  Turns out I had a sinus cavity stuffed full of candida, and even a relatively light knock to the head will allow it to cross the blood brain barrier where it gets up to all kinds of no  good.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1908, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Food poisoning update: Figured it out!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/h8hawr/food_poisoning_update_figured_it_out/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PMME-SHIT-TALK", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_40x82l7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1592003524, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/h7vfi9/recently_diagnosed_with_ih_not_sure_i_see_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "h7vfi9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 26, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/h7vfi9/recently_diagnosed_with_ih_not_sure_i_see_it/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1592045508, "score": 6, "selftext": "This week I got the results of my sleep study back and my neurologist confidently informed me that i have IH. I had never heard of it before and after looking into it online with the few resources there are, I'm not sure it fits for me.\n\nI've always been a terrible sleeper, hours of tossing and turning and have had almost every sort of prescription med for sleep. My insomnia got worse then usual about 6 months ago and my doctor pretty much told me it was past his abilities and he sent me to a neuro. My main issue was tiredness during the day and the neuro attributed it to sleep deficiency. After trying some different meds i finally start getting a decent amount of sleep at night (about 7 hours now compared to the 4 I was getting) and I told her im still tired after about 3 weeks of the 7ish hour nights. She made me do a sleep study and now says I have IH. \n\nI see a lot of stuff about IH and these massive sleep times, 18-20 hours or more of continuous sleep. I sleep poorly at night, and only get 7 hours if i'm lucky during the week, then crash hard on weekends and sleep for MAX 10 or 11 hours. I get some sleep inertia and during the day I never feel like I can really ever fully wake up, except for about 7 at night when I finally feel fully alert and oriented. When I wake up to my alarm clock for work after about a usual 6 or 7 hour night, I am a zombie. I feel dizzy, heavy,zoned out and like i'm on auto pilot, it feels terrible. I explained the feeling once as being similar to taking a massive dose of antihistamines. This happens with every sleep med I take, and it happens on nights when I sleep with no medication. However, this does not and has never happened when I can wake up on my own time, such as on weekends.  During the day I have really bad concentration, feel absolutely terrible with fatigue and I take forever to react to things happening around me. I always feel like I want to sleep, but have never accidentally fallen sleep or felt like I'm losing consciousness. Most of the time, even if I try to nap I cannot fall asleep. Sometimes when I nap I feel great upon waking, sometimes I feel slightly better, sometimes I feel no different. I feel like I rarely dream. Multiple rounds of blood work has all came back normal.\n\nDuring my sleep study I slept about 6 hours, and in that 6 hours I woke up 3 times. During the MSLT, I slept during the first nap but the next 4 I was wide awake. \n\nMy questions are, does this sound like IH to anyone? and also, does anyone have any idea about what they could have seen on my polysomnography and MSLT that would point towards IH?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the wordy post, and thanks in advanced to anyone who replies.

I do however have symptoms of almost all sleep conditions such as; sleep apnea, narcolepsy, Idiopathic hypersomnia, chronic fatigue syndrome, etc...I am doing a sleep study soon, they think it\u2019s sleep apnea or excessive daytime sleepiness. I don\u2019t want to be tested for just ONE thing.\n\n-I literally cannot get out of bed. Even running errands wears me out and I literally feel like collapsing if standing too long. It\u2019s taken over my physical and mental health. I could sleep all day if no alarm. I cancel plans all the time and can\u2019t even do simple tasks like wash my hair as often as I should anymore. Just constant exhaustion all day. But yet at night time I have SOME energy(very little), and can\u2019t always sleep... maybe it\u2019s because I sleep all day lol. But I really can\u2019t live like this.\n-I wake up with a headache EVERY single day. \n-also congested when I wake up\n-I have a dry mouth and eyes upon waking\n-Unrefreshed sleep or naps.\n-Sore throat almost daily. \n-I started having eczema in my scalp which has NEVER happened before...\n-It\u2019s making me irritable, I get the chills, my body aches.\n-I have trouble staying alert in the day and my memory is AWFUL.\n\nI\u2019m so sick of this and the doctors not figuring anything out for me. I\u2019m getting bloodwork done soon. Any recommendations for what they should test for in my blood? :/  \nWhat has worked for you guys to be taken seriously and getting a proper diagnosis. To be told it\u2019s NOT just depression. I feel like my PCP judges me and doesn\u2019t take me seriously.\nLike yes NOW I\u2019m depressed because I can\u2019t do anything without wanting to be in bed. It has ruined my life. It\u2019s gotten worse over the last few months too.\nMy body is clearly telling me something and the doctors just don\u2019t give a shit. I\u2019m just another \u201cdramatic woman\u201d. It\u2019s annoying. I hate the US health system. :/\n\nWhat has worked best for you guys to be heard? \nThese referrals take so long and they hardly even know who to refer me to. I have awful health insurance too. A free one so they generally don\u2019t care and give me the worst doctors. \nAlso any recommendations on medications or vitamins that have helped any of you be alert in the day that I can bring up to my doctor? I heard of sunosi but idk if they\u2019ll just give me that in the meantime so I\u2019m trying other things that I CAN do while I wait. Not asking you guys for a diagnosis.

I wanted to see if we have these in common or if it's varied, so I guess a little bit of an experiment haha! Some of these might be a lil invasive but it's because others I've talked to have said they had similar experiences, so feel free to say if you don't want to answer some, completely understandable. Thank you c:\n\nI've been recently diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia.\n1. How does caffeine affect you, if at all?\n     - I don't really feel the effects of it, but I've never tried any stronger caffeine things like energy drinks, only soda, tea, etc.\n2. How long did it take to diagnose it when it was a serious problem?\n     - Around 2 years, I kept trying to find a cause, like perhaps my dreams.\n3. Have you had any history of eating disorders or depression?\n     - I had anorexia for I would say 2 years, and borderline anorexia for 5 years before that\n4. What was sleep like before any noticable sleep disorder occurred, or was this an early on thing?\n     - Around 1 year before it became serious, I was majorly depressed and would come home from school and immediately fall asleep, and get up to get food at 6pm, then go back to sleep until the next day which continued about one year. \n5. What are dreams like for you?\n     - my dreams are very vivid, sometimes very scary without warning, or very stressful, or just boring. They bounce around between these emotions a lot.\n6. Have you ever fallen asleep or almost fallen asleep while talking to someone, driving, standing or other things like that?\n     - Yes, a few times while talking, quite a few times I almost fell while standing and waiting, and twice outside while waiting", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f",

I was diagnosed with narcolepsy, although my doctor did not seem to concerned about the cataplexy part.

I am in 250mg of nuvigil, which seems to be doing its job by keeping me awake. But I can\u2019t sit up and move around for long periods of time because I still feel like my overall body just feels weak and achey. If I sit at a table for to long my back muscles bothers me and I need to lay down. Before I was diagnosed I would get terrible tension headaches because I was trying to fight sleep and hold my head up. This feeling of body fatigue is sometimes worse at times than others.

At random times during the day, my legs and arms start buzzing and my muscles sort of give out. I know that I have to sit down when that happens now but I used to fall to the floor or drop objects. For a few minutes I can only talk really slowly (if at all), my eyes are barely open. I feel like I'm floating in a cloud. This seems to be triggered by strong laughter or fear, sometimes also by sudden temperature changes (I think?). It stops after 5-10 minutes and I'm fine again.\n\nMy doctor, who has seen a video of one of those things, thinks that it isn't cataplexy but he's positive it's sleep-related because of the way my eyes behave during an attack.\n\nI had a sleep study done last year that ruled out narcolepsy based on the MSLT results and overnight readings. I have mild sleep apnea, which is monitored but not yet bad enough to require a machine. I've read about people whose hypersomnia was kind of on the border with narcolepsy, with overlapping symptoms. People with IH having sleep attacks that look like \"smaller\" versions of cataplexy, that sort of thing.\n\nDoes anyone else here have those sleep attacks while having a IH diagnosis that they feel applies to them/helps them?\n\nAgain, please don't redirect me towards a narcolepsy diagnosis - my IH diagnosis is helpful and I trust my doctor about it.\n\nThanks a lot!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1800, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Weird sleep attacks - does anyone else have this?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fzbsuq/weird_sleep_attacks_does_anyone_else_have_this/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "averageghosthuman", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2ox9lafs", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1586516874, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fydyl7/but_i_thought_you_said_you_were_always_tired_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fydyl7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7aa39bd8-a17d-11e8-8d78-0e5ba871de4c", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 22, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fydyl7/but_i_thought_you_said_you_were_always_tired_a/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1586516876, "score": 1, "selftext": "Does anyone else have trouble falling asleep at night?

Even though i got diagnosed with IH i never went through anything like a sleep test and i only get dismissed with antidepressants which are making me feel worse. So idk what to think of this.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what time of the day, how i plan my sleep, what i try and eat. I wake up like 2-3 hours after sleeping mostly. Is this normal? \nWhat i suspect might be a cause is i\u2019ve had a lot of stress and brain fog. Enough to cause direct problems to everyday functions like eating, writing, etc. \n\nEg: My hand grip is so weak i most definitely flunked all my exams today cause whatever answer i managed to write will likely be unreadable. Everything i eat makes me want to directly throw up. \nI don\u2019t understand if these are normal symptoms of IH or i should be wary of them as something else. \nBecause last time my memory fog turned out to be sleep drunkenness. \n\n\nSo idk how to handle this and i can\u2019t go to doctors because of covid in my area.

All my meds were at good levels and everything was fine.\n\n4 years ago was when the never-ending sleepiness started. After many specialists, tests, and medical institutions around the country, I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia. Currently, I find I need about 11 hours of sleep a night. I'm on 250mg of armodafinil which makes my brain similar to how it was before all this happened...for about 7 hours. And then I crash.

The armodafinil allows me to work and then work is over and I crash. Old hobbies are kind of out, because at that point I'm just fighting sleep.

It's been about a year and the Sunosi 150mg and Adderall XR 25mg have done wonders for me. I'm no longer randomly falling asleep while driving, at work, etc.. I still get tired some days, but it is no longer the uncontrollable sleepiness, and I think it would be considered a normal \"tired\" for once. \n\nI'm now able to focus and think during the day after my meds have kicked in. I'm so incredibly grateful for having gotten a diagnosis and finding medication that helps me after struggling with this since Jr. High, but I'm cannot seem to figure out a way to wake up in the mornings.\n\nDuring the day, as mentioned, I am fine and I like to believe that everything seems to be under control, but it is starting to put a strain on my job from coming in late. I have so many alarms set, different noises, another alarm clock across the room to get myself out of bed, timed fan in hopes I'll get hot and wake up. I've tried the daylight type alarm clocks. Nothing seems to help. \n\nI've spoken with my boss and I've told him about my diagnosis and gave him a brief explanation as to what it is, and he is understanding. He pulled me aside the other day and has told me that he has seen the improvement within the last year and that he's glad I'm starting to figure things out. I'm INCREDIBLY grateful of this, but it is not the same with my coworkers. The ones I work closely with are also aware now, but they give me so much shit for being 2-3 hours late sometimes if not more. I have tried EVERYTHING that I can think of and it pisses me off when they tell me these things because like, I don't like that it happens either. I don't want to be late. I don't want to schedule meetings with clients later in the day because I can't guarantee that I'll make in during the mornings. I don't want to be prolonging the length of my assignments and audits because I can't get started on projects at a more decent time. I don't want to be a no-show to plans with family and friends (even if they understand). \n\nIt's just so frustrating that I cannot find anything to help me wake up and get moving in the mornings. The sleep inertia and drunkenness is overwhelming before I'm able to take my meds and let them kick in. I'm in a facebook group that I read in hopes of finding other alternatives to try and wake up, but I haven't seen any, and I'm too afraid to post because some of the members are friends or relatives to people I know, and I guess I haven't completely accepted my diagnosis or something, but I don't want others that don't need to know, to know of my condition being that it is now relatively under control. It sucks explaining it to people also because they're like \"that isn't that bad. I get tired all of the time.\" It just has such a bad stigma attached with it. \n\nI think I made this post a lot longer than it needed to be, but I think I just also needed to vent. I know others have it so much worse and can't even find medication that works for them to make it bearable.\n\nAre there any suggestions others may have to being able to wake up in the mornings?

So glad there's a community I can relate to. This post is a bit long but you can skip the ending. I would love to know what you guys think, if you can relate or if you have any general advice or support for me. Thanks in advance for reading!\n\nSo I don't know if this happens to a lot of people, but I just feel like my body is so fuckin stubborn when it wants to sleep that it has devised these mechanisms to make sure I don't wake up. I constantly alternate between dreaming and being awake. Sometimes it's so hard to tell which world I'm in.\n\nToday I had to go to court for a matter (had to reach at 10.30 am) but I just couldn't wake up. My phone was in my hand and my alarms kept ringing. I would wake up and turn my alarm off, then instantly go into dream mode where I'd see that after turning my alarm off, I have texted my boss saying I'm unwell and won't be able to make it to work. How considerate of my body to sate my anxiety so I can sleep without any tension... My dream even made me feel like I am actually feverish. My poor cat kept meowing to try and wake me, but in my dream I saw that I fed him and pet him. \n\nWhen I finally woke up (thanks to my alarm), I was shocked. It was 9.40 and I had missed calls from my boss, plus I would be late to court. Those messages where I told him I was sick were nowhere to be found. I didn't have a fever. I was just late. And sleepy.\n\nThis has happened to me multiple times, although it's not very common. My brain makes me see exceptionally vivid dreams where I'm awake and being fully functional and doing all my work and being super productive, until I wake up and realise I was in a dream and didn't actually do shit except be late for work. \n\nYesterday I was in a meeting with my boss, he got a phone call and started speaking to someone. I got bored and immediately started dozing off. Literally right in front of him. And as soon as I would doze off, I would start dreaming that I'm awake and paying attention. I don't even realise I'm asleep until I'm nodding off and I'm forced awake because of the jerky head movement. Then it happens all over again. Extreme drowsiness and heavy lids. I'm so frustrated. I just want to be normal.\n\n(You can skip reading this bit, just adding a lil extra info)\n\nThis also happened a lot when I went through a really rough break up, I used to go to sleep full of anxiety and my dreams showed me that my ex was texting me and I was replying to him and we were talking things out. It was so fuckin realistic, I can't even explain. My brain got all the details right, like me getting up from my side of the bed, his profile picture at the time, time stamps of our messages and how long he took to reply to each message, his manner of talking, the specific words he used. And our conversation was completely in line with his personality and my personality around him. It was just so real.\n\nI don't know, if I could monetize my dreaming abilities, I would never be late for work because I wouldn't need to work in the first place!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler":

I'm almost never fully alert. But since I fall asleep less, I'm doing better on paper. The nurse didn't really note or seem to care that I still struggle to function in daily life. I still take long naps.  I get maybe two hours a day where I don't feel like melted ice cream. And I often take a while to fall asleep. That is partly because of my stimulant meds. But it is also because sleep feels like a prison that I have to escape every morning. I often dread it as much as I crave it.   \n\n\nSo I sorta feel like the ESS doesn't function fully for IH.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3257, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Opinions on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pt9q96/opinions_on_the_epworth_sleepiness_scale/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dryerfresh", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_87r56", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1632289357, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pt0ze1/i_am_just_so_discouraged/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pt0ze1", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "d2ac6514-a252-11e8-9353-0e3d3172c776", "link_flair_text": "Doctors", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pt0ze1/i_am_just_so_discouraged/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "1rW-x7DSmCG-z2CPA_agPHw75jFBD55z_lmwIe5u7NE", "resolutions": [{"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hfyUlp-ew7Ktfc-meQ3k3L0XfLBqH-78-ftEdfW5fnU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=468bc3f2bf2a40db572c0445b69d0d20b5abf3f2", "width": 108}, {"height": 324, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hfyUlp-ew7Ktfc-meQ3k3L0XfLBqH-78-ftEdfW5fnU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32d2abbb379254a8ade400c04f298c81ccb74943", "width": 216}, {"height": 480, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hfyUlp-ew7Ktfc-meQ3k3L0XfLBqH-78-ftEdfW5fnU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef9c0d6ddecde15e20389b9ef309f0d3d04e5e7b", "width": 320}, {"height": 960, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hfyUlp-ew7Ktfc-meQ3k3L0XfLBqH-78-ftEdfW5fnU.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67b1830cb2fc981029a6612a4897e5ecbed17021", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 1125, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/hfyUlp-ew7Ktfc-meQ3k3L0XfLBqH-78-ftEdfW5fnU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0262d29994c721a369d7bdda24e48a31a741dd6c", "width": 750}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1632289367, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I was diagnosed with \u201cprobable IH, possible narcolepsy type 2\u201d in August, though have been dealing with issues for a long time.

Sorry! I intended to keep it short, but that ended up not happening...\n\nJust a few details about me:\nM, 40yo, living in Australia, have suffered IH (or something similar) for 26 years.\n\nI have not yet been diagnosed, which is why I am posting this - to vent my frustration.\n\nI am currently in the worst state I've ever been with my IH, plus the denial of a diagnosis and refusal of treatment by several doctors has caused EXTREME demoralisation to the point I literally cannot look after myself properly anymore. I'm barely eating and haven't been able to leave the house in over a week due to total mental exhaustion, despair and hopelessness.\n\nMy symptoms mainly consist of a feeling of permanent sedation, never feeling even CLOSE to properly awake and alert, and therefore unable to think properly at all. Brain fog I guess. This feeling has worsened gradually over time. I don't have trouble with falling asleep uncontrollably or struggling to stay awake, but I do have a lot of trouble with sleep inertia, typically takes me 4+ hours to reach peak wakefulness. No daytime napping. My sleep duration is all over the place, anything from 5 to 15 hours, lately consistently 10+. Sleep latency is a problem for me, it takes me a LONG time to fall asleep, and it always has. \n\nInterestingly, when I was taking 15mg Dex I could fall asleep quicker (&lt;10mins) and easier than at any other time in my life. 10mg didn't have this effect. Lately with no treatment my latency has been as long as 10 hours some nights/days. I have heard of the concept of \"low circadian amplitude\" which sounds very much like what I have (very little contrast between sleep and wake in terms of \"activation\" or mental energy/alertness), but I don't know if it's a recognised thing or not.\n\nI realise my symptoms don't quite match the classic definition of IH, but I haven't found anything that matches any closer, and everything else has been ruled out. It can't be Chronic Fatigue Syndrome as I don't have any physical fatigue or chronic pain. Brain MRI has ruled out any neurodegenerative disorders or physical abnormalities (Chiari malformation etc). PSG ruled out apnea, UARS, PLMD, REM Behaviour Disorder. I do suffer from depression sometimes, but that cannot be the main cause.\n\nMy IH began in 1995 after I had major surgery, which included a bone graft using donor bone (allograft). In 1996 I had surgery again (autograft this time) and my IH symptoms worsened. My GP/MD at the time sent me for all sorts of tests but nothing showed up, until I was eventually diagnosed with diabetes (Type 1, but it took a long time to develop - I was on tablets for 8 months before I had to change to insulin) My GP/MD gave up any further investigations at that point, as she was confident my fatigue was caused by my diabetes (to nobody's surprise -- it wasn't)\n\nMy IH symptoms have slowly worsened over the years, costing me a full-ride university scholarship, many friendships, any chance at relationships, nearly all my hobbies and interests, and my job. I was only able to work 3 days per week at my best, but then IH took that away too.\n\nIn 2018 I was diagnosed with Non-24 Hour Sleep Wake Disorder, but the sleep specialist diagnosed me on the spot and didn't do any further investigation, which I consider EXTREMELY negligent. At this stage I certainly had Non-24 symptoms but had never heard of IH, so I didn't know IH can cause the same symptoms. The sleep specialist started me on Dexamphetamine (20mg per day), which helped a little, but I was frustrated that it didn't work as well as I'd hoped. It fixed my sleep cycle, but I still felt increasingly fatigued and sedated. I repeatedly asked, BEGGED, for further investigation, but they refused.\n\nDespite the Dex not doing a very good job, I was able to be somewhat productive for the first time in my adult life. I worked on a number of medium to large projects around the house and achieved quite a lot. I was planning to go back to work. I was just BARELY building up some self-esteem for the first time ever... But then things turned upside-down.\n\nIn April 2021 the sleep specialist paused my treatment as my blood pressure was creeping up. OK, fair enough. The Dex had almost totally stopped working by this point so I was ready to try something else (modafinil). I had a 4-week break from the Dex, which was very difficult due to a significant worsening of my symptoms compared to when I started treatment. After the 4 week break the sleep specialist refused to restart the Dex as my blood pressure was still too high. I asked about modafinil (they had repeatedly told me I could change to modafinil, but the cost held me back) but they POINT BLANK REFUSED any further treatment at all. I realised they had never given me a conclusive diagnosis, and asked about IH. They immediately rudely cut me off and denied it could be IH, ignoring my very detailed sleep chart that clearly showed my sleep duration being FAR longer than the diagnostic criteria they quoted. The other diagnostic criteria they quoted were not even close to correct! (not that diagnostic criteria mean all that much for a DIAGNOSIS OF EXCLUSION!)\n\nThey arranged a sleep study, which turned out to be a total waste of time as I had difficulty falling asleep due to being EXTREMELY stressed out by the whole situation.\n\nIn the meantime I saw another sleep specialist at my own cost, and he agreed that I most likely have IH. However he didn't want to start treatment (modafinil) until after the sleep study. I had a followup appointment with him after the study and his attitude was TOTALLY different - he completely denied any possibility of IH, refused to offer any treatment, and told me not to bother making any further appointments! I have no idea what caused him to change his mind so completely.\n\nThe sleep specialist who arranged the study declined to follow up and has now removed me from the patient list altogether.\n\nBoth sleep specialists \"diagnosed\" me with depression, which I did not have at the time, and which could not possibly cause IH-level symptoms anyway! My psychiatrist has totally denied any link between depression and my IH symptoms, as depression is always cyclical (mine included) and my IH symptoms haven't lifted at all in 26 years, not even for a single day.\n\nI'm not feeling depressed at the moment - I have SEVERE demoralisation due to the situation I'm in, but there's a big difference between the two: Demoralisation is much more severe and DOES NOT respond to medication. I have been on courses of 11 different antidepressants since 2014, to no avail. None has helped either my energy OR my mood whatsoever (except they may have prevented or lessened a few depressive episodes) My baseline mood has dropped massively in the last few months and continues to worsen. In the past it never completely recovered after even minor setbacks. I suspect I may also have Schizoid Personality Disorder, which might explain my inability to recover from difficult situations, especially social situations involving loss of self-esteem.\n\nDue to being ignored by two specialists, lacking support from my GP/MD, and my psychiatrist giving up on me after running out of medication options, I'm now pretty much totally out of hope. Why should I bother going to see another sleep specialist - if I can find one - when it's likely the same thing will happen again? The hopelessness directly makes things worse, as I'm exhausted from being stressed all the time.\n\nTo add to my stress, I have been unable to find any psychologists - even via Telehealth - who are currently accepting new patients. All 5 psychologists I've seen in the past are unavailable at the moment.\n\nThere are very few other sleep specialists in my state, so I don't know if I'll be able to get another opinion. My GP/MD is of no help either, she won't treat me without a specialist diagnosis! Even though she could easily prescribe Modafinil or Clarithromycin, she won't. My psychiatrist can legally prescribe pretty much anything, but will only prescribe antidepressants - not even add-ons like Atomoxetine...\n\nI live with my elderly mother who has poor health; I'm supposed to be caring for her, but I'm so debilitated by IH that she's basically looking after me. I feel absolutely TERRIBLE about this, and she would be objectively better off without me. I'm constantly having to talk myself down from just ending it all, every day.

A few months in, a cloudy state of inescapable fatigue set in and I wasn't even able to keep my eyes open in a setting I couldn't be more fascinated by.\n\nThis is when I realized the worn-down and drained feeling I tried to escape from when I stopped working as a general laborer wasn't just due to me walking around a construction site for 30 miles a day. Despite such an active occupation, I struggled just to stay awake and the 1,500mg+ of caffeine I'd drink could more useless. I could still fall asleep with ease, no matter how much caffeine I had. \n\nThis should have been the first sign something was wrong. Even though I suspected I might have had sleep issues before, I knew it was all too likely to be written off as just being a teenager, and little would be done until that could be ruled out as a source of my problems sleeping. \n\nI was having more trouble staying awake while only having a total of 5 hours worth of class and commuting to commit myself too. At the beginning of September, I started seeing a physician, hoping to find relief for the sleeping disorder I had refused to acknowledge until then.\n\nKnowing the many potential sleep disorders I might have, I decided to ask first for Trazodone, as I was having problems getting more than 5 hours of sleep while working and going to school full time. This constant sleep deprivation from putting too much on my plate took its toll until I graduated from that program in December, and I thought this was the beginning of a turning point for me. I couldn't have been more naive.\n\nAlthough I'd never consider myself to be an optimistic on the best of days, I never found myself without hope that I would soon find an effective treatment and my life would go back to normal. It was many failed prescriptions ago that my optimism ran out.\n\nI researched as much as I could about anything that might give me the smallest measure of relief. I had my first sleep study in October of 2019 and was diagnosed with IH by a sleep specialist set to retire by the end of the year. Besides an average sleep latency of 7 minutes, my PSG showed that only 5% of my total sleep was spent in REM, with most of that time instead spent in N3 sleep. As such, he sent me an interim prescription for methylphenidate, and then modafinil (100mg twice a day) to be taken in conjunction with the methylphenidate. This sleep specialist informed me that I could refer to my primary physician for follow-up prescriptions based on my diagnosis.\n\nMonths later, after trying flumazenil up until its highest dosage, and then buproprion, I was finally handed off to a sleep specialist for further treatment because my general physician didn't feel comfortable prescribing the other medications recommended to treat EDS. While waiting for another sleep study to be performed, I transitioned to another medication, duloxetine, which like all my prescriptions before, made no noticeable difference whatsoever.\n\nThis is about the time I faced the realization that if I ever do manage to  effectively cope with IH, it won't be soon, so I was forced to stop working until I managed to find an effective treatment.\n\nLeading up to this decision, I started having trouble dozing off while driving home in the dark for 45 minutes, which seems relatively common, regardless of any underlying sleep disorder. However, this behavior started occurring during my morning commute, and during my shift, leading to me dozing off dozens of times a day.\n\nI'd drift to and fro at night, going from rumble strip to rumble strip as I traveled alone on empty roads. Many nights I stopped at the nearest off ramp just to close my eyes for a few moments. This process further developed into long (15+ second) periods of driving where I would \"zone out\" and stop processing what was occurring in front of me while driving. I would suddenly snap back into lucidity only to be disgusted and terrified by my sudden disconnect with waking consciousness while doing something as dangerous as driving for 90 minutes a day.\n\nAs I started making mistakes at work during my shift because of brain fog and inattention I struggled to find \n any and all opportunities to sleep. With my manager's permission I would nap instead of taking a break and would skip my lunch to instead sleep in my car. When I'd get home, I'd often skip dinner to go to sleep sooner and sleep more at the cost of not eating breakfast.\n\nThis is when I realized my urge to sleep was unmatched by any other desire or urge I could ever have. Without question, sleep was more important than the desire to eat, and I started to rapidly lose weight because of this.\n\nI'm ashamed of myself for stubbornly continuing to try and manage my lifestyle for the many months I did before admitting defeat and accepting I had a major health issue I couldn't ignore or fix any time soon, if ever at all.\n\nMy second sleep study in March of 2020 showed an average sleep latency of 7 minutes, same as before, but with 10% of my sleep spent in REM with the rest shifted to N3.\n\nSunosi and Wakix have also not helped me at all, but 400mg of modafinil in the morning with another 200mg at noon slightly eases the burden of sleep inertia at the cost of severe nausea and suppressed appetite, neither of which I've ever had to deal with before and have profoundly reduced my quality of life further than I thought possible with just insufferable sleepiness alone.\n\nXywav was the most promising medication I've yet to try, but I had little hope of paying for a prescription, until the FDA approved it as the only and only treatment of IH so far, although I am not holding my breath for a miracle.\n\n No amount of sleep hygiene experimentation has made a noticeable difference day to day. I wake up feeling like I've been awake for days and struggle for most of the first half of the day to shake off this sleep inertia, if I'm able to do it at all. Some days are better than others and there seems to be a natural ebb and flo to the severity of my symptoms with no correlation I can nail down.\n\nI feel my best chance at finding any and all things I can do to improve my sleep is to buy/modify an affordable EEG of moderate accuracy to run 24/7 for comprehensive data that I can use to inform me about what specifically affects my sleep and to what extent. Unfortunately, the only EEGs I have found for less than $1,000 all have complaints about accuracy/usability and aren't designed for 24/7 monitoring with live output\n\nThe most disheartening aspect of living with IH is that I'm wholly incapable of being able to assist others as much as I know I could. A gap in access to affordable EEG equipment for those in need of continuous monitoring means we are unable to measure sleepiness and states of wakefulness objectively. This is just as important to finding effective treatments as it is for monitoring our IH day to day.\n\nThis is incredibly important to me given the shocking revelation that others have mentioned they had during their sleep studies: all 10 of my MSLT naps resulted in what is considered stages of sleep, but I myself never felt like I went unconscious or blacked out. All I did was close my eyes and lay down for a few minutes but I was lucid, conscious, and in control of my body. I have lost my right to say I can distinguish conscious wakefulness from stages of sleep and I can't think of much that's more terrifying to me.\n\nGuess this all means I won the wrong lottery and am just destined to stumble through the rest of life zombified and in a disassociated stupor\n\nFor better or worse, I'd say I'm generally far too tired to feel miserable, or anything at all for that matter, except the oppressing urge to sleep \n\nJust found this sub but I had to post in hopes of maybe finding people to relate to\n\n\nOnly thing I might be able to do is start some sort of Engineering, Prototyping, 3d Printing, and/or Design Consultation service to be able to practice something I love in a way I can manage with IH but starting such a campaign has proven impossible while the call to close my eyes is all I can think about from the most unpleasant instant I am thrust into consciousness at the start of the day.\n\nAlthough I see myself as incredibly uninteresting, feel free to ask me questions about anything should you want to. \n\nThanks for bearing with me on this rant of a post. \n\n\nHere's to wishing everyone a good night's rest!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3240, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Life is Over but I'm too Tired to Care", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pp9bi2/my_life_is_over_but_im_too_tired_to_care/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Less-Lengthiness114", "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "56de33b2-a13b-11e8-86fb-0ec44c28c910", "author_flair_text": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia, bipolar disorder 1", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_714h2bcr", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1631760170, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pp4rli/modafinil_vs_armodafinil_what_have_been_your/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pp4rli", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1dc256e2-a17e-11e8-9e9a-0e976fd50694", "link_flair_text": "Medication", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pp4rli/modafinil_vs_armodafinil_what_have_been_your/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1631760181, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm currently getting \"little more than 2 or 3 good hours\" on 400mg Modafinil, and will be switching to 250mg Armodafinil in a few days.

Sleep issues have been a severe issue for me my whole life. I recognize now that EDS has been a huge problem for me, but one with which I have mostly been able to cope (though I take frequent and regular unrefreshing naps). However, the biggest issue for me is the issue of waking up in the morning. At this point, I cannot be relied upon to do it unassisted, and therefore my spouse has been getting me up in the morning, every morning, for the better part of the year ever since I was almost fired for sleeping through work multiple times. This was what started me on my journey to finally get diagnosed with IH.\n\nAnyway, now that I have my diagnosis, I will be seeing my primary doctor later this week and I want to talk to him about requesting reasonable accommodations under the ADA. I was hoping others here have been through this part of the hypersomnia journey and could offer some helpful tips. For context, I work in an office environment that requires a lot of analytical thinking and communication with people. 8 hour shifts, 5 days a week. Please offer any input or your experience if you have been through requesting reasonable accommodations for your own illness, even if it doesn't align with my specific work industry.\n\nHere are some of my ideas:\n\n* Allowed to be late to work up to two times per month without penalty OR miss two days of work per month without penalty\n* Ability to take longer breaks (I was thinking 15 minutes instead of the current 10 minute policy)\n* Ability to take one extra break per day\n* Ability to take an additional 30 minutes unpaid break per day without making the time up with more work\n\nPlease offer your thoughts, or commentary on anything you think is not reasonable. I want some ideas to present to my doctor. As I said, I was almost fired due to how this condition has affected me; while I feel it is currently \"under control,\" I also feel it has been progressing in my life and I feel the need to protect myself legally.

My new sleep doc doesn't seem to agree with my IH diagnosis - in both sleep studies I had a large number of spontaneous arousals (56 per hour in my first, 26 per hour in my second), which I acknowledge isn't typical for people with IH. I had no apneas, but I do have a mild snore, so my doc wants me to try out a CPAP for a month on the off chance I have Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS). \n\nThe problem that I have with this is that since I have no apneas, the CPAP won't be covered by insurance at all. While my parents cover my medical bills, I'm not super thrilled about asking them to pay $700 minimum for the machine when they just paid $800 for the sleep study itself. Especially when my doctor can't even tell me for sure whether I have UARS or not.\n\nDoes anyone have experience trying out a CPAP for UARS?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3232, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Any experience having a sleep doc try to figure out whether you have IH or UARS?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pnnlx4/any_experience_having_a_sleep_doc_try_to_figure/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "it_is_freezing_", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_813eibal", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1631562731, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pnmz7y/message_from_doctor_is_this_accurate/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pnmz7y", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_metadata": {"jysp5c02sbn71": {"e": "Image", "id": "jysp5c02sbn71", "m": "image/png", "p": [{"u": "https://preview.redd.it/jysp5c02sbn71.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79c3e33c3ac8b081410ebea47c9b475395c1c14e", "x": 108, "y": 12}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/jysp5c02sbn71.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4c422d58b27871a9c33c4a54c4f3b36979d2980", "x": 216, "y": 24}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/jysp5c02sbn71.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a5c8f392f41df9174cf3e037de84d8e1b7f963d", "x": 320, "y": 35}, {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/jysp5c02sbn71.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=814e53825e4f5d9efb2a5aa8301ab31c028d47d5", "x": 640, "y": 71}], "s": {"u": "https://preview.redd.it/jysp5c02sbn71.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84f36cde8ff570f0bcf1db1c0629dc0a4ea222c8", "x": 764, "y": 85}, "status": "valid"}}, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pnmz7y/message_from_doctor_is_this_accurate/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1631562742, "score": 1, "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jysp5c02sbn71.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84f36cde8ff570f0bcf1db1c0629dc0a4ea222c8", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3231, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": 15, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Message From Doctor - is this accurate?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pnmz7y/message_from_doctor_is_this_accurate/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "KaiMeansAnd", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6rniayg", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1631537568, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pnesp0/over_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pnesp0", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7aa39bd8-a17d-11e8-8d78-0e5ba871de4c", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pnesp0/over_it/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1631537579, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m so over this nonsense.

My primary Dr, who prescribes my meds, referred me to their sleep specialist because she didn't feel comfortable as she wasn't well versed in those meds. \n\nSo I see this guy for the first time last week. He was in the room a total of two minutes (after making me wait a half hour while he ran across the street for coffee after my appt time, as I was in the waiting room, checked in, and watched him leave). He didn't pull my chart up, didn't even sit down, didn't look at me at all. He said \"so your don't have any medical conditions and aren't in any medications?\" Yeah, if he actually had glanced at my chart he'd see the laundry list. He didn't even know I was on Adderall or that I was diagnosed with IH. He immediately asked if I'd gained weight recently, and I said truthfully that actually I've lost weight.  Butt he interrupted me to say I need a PSG, because it's probably sleep apnea. I said I've had a PSG, and an MSLT, and I've used CPAP just in case it would help, and nothing shows sleep apnea. Again, interrupted. \"Well, I'm going to schedule you for a PSG and we will find the cause of your sleepiness\". Then he was gone.\n\nI couldn't even process what happened, I just sat there in a daze as the nurse came in to tell me they've already scheduled my next appt (for a day and time where I'm at work), and that the sleep clinic will call me soon to schedule. I can't imagine how stressful that would've been for someone who didn't even know what a PSG was! \n\nI'm so pissed off, I'm already dealing with shit from this new HR guy who has decided he knows what my FMLA parameters are better than me or my doctor, my doctor is currently on maternity leave so I can't talk to her right now, and I just want to hit my head against a wall as that would be more productive than this doctor appt!\n\nI'm all about thinking horses before zebras, and if it was apneas and ask I needed was a CPAP I would cry from joy at having a solution, but I know, it's been proven, that sleep apnea is not my problem. \n\nThis HR guy actually tried to write me up because I want calling in before my (5am) shift started, and even my boss said that I can't call in if I'm unconscious and that's unfair to put that on me. For three years my FMLA has covered up to 6 shifts a month, either the full day, or by the hour. It says from 1-24 hours on the paperwork. But now this guy who had been there a couple months, just out of college, and claims he's a \"professional\" when it comes to FMLA, and all the other HR people just couldn't do their job, says that whether I'm a minute late or miss the whole day, it counts as a full shift towards my monthly allowed time. I refused to sign the write-ups (there were two, for the late call-ins, and for \"going over\" my allowed FMLA for the month). I called in 4 shifts, and was late the times, totalling 5 hours. My shifts are ten hours, so that's 4 1/2 shifts, out of 6. But he now says each day counts as a shift, so I'm at 7 which is one over. And I guess he has no records from before he started, and he admitted that the last person never gave me the summary of what was allowed (it's nowhere in my record), yet still expects me to sign it? I can't even see how many hours I've missed before April when he started he said, so I can't prove that I've done this before and never had an issue. \n\nI just had to vent, I'm sorry.

Normal body weight, healthy. No history of drugs or alcohol.\n\nStarting around high school (2007-2011), I would find myself awake past midnight watching TV when I should\u2019ve been in bed. Back then I would sleep 9-10 hours a night with little daytime fatigue. In college (2011-2015), 9-10 hours was no longer enough. I only took classes that started in the afternoon and would take a daily nap before doing homework in the evening. At this point in time, naps were still refreshing.\n\nSymptoms worsened over time and have since peaked/stabilized the past couple years. These days, I sleep 10.5-12 hours per night, and either: A) take a daytime nap lasting 1.5-2 hours; or B) power through the day to maintain some semblance of a body clock. I wake up 1-2 times per night to go pee then fall right back asleep. My sleep ***feels*** deep but is **entirely unrefreshing** and I wake up feeling as though I never slept. My lengthy daytime naps are also **entirely unrefreshing**. It\u2019s like pouring water into a bucket with a hole in the bottom.\n\nI am chronically tired, to some degree, every minute, of every day, of every year. There are no exceptions. I can force myself to do things when absolutely necessary, for example, willpower my way through a workday or make myself spend time with friends, but it\u2019s not pleasant.\n\nAside from chronic fatigue, my most relenting symptoms are heavy eyelids and eye ache, combined with tenderness in the back of the head (occipital nerves). Some days I have headaches. **A lot of the time I\u2019m usually just tired enough to want a nap but just alert enough to not be able to nap.** I spend ***all*** my free time lying in bed watching YouTube videos from my phone as it distracts me from my symptoms and doesn\u2019t take any energy. **I also go to bed very, very late and have the most \u201cenergy\u201d at nighttime**. I sometimes get comments from others that I look tired.\n\n(Sexual aside) I **never** wake up with morning erections, which is atypical for men. I think it\u2019s potentially telling of a problem with my REM sleep as that\u2019s when erections naturally come and go. Achieving and maintaining an erection during the day isn\u2019t an issue, and I\u2019ve had my testosterone tested twice (both times normal).\n\n**Despite the tiredness, I am still cognitively sharp** and can meet deadlines when absolutely necessary. I let my to-do lists, laundry, dishes, and house chores pile up for weeks at a time, then force myself to do them all at once with a burst of borrowed energy. While my diet, exercise, and sleep hygiene are **far from ideal** today, I have perfected them at various points over the course of my decade-long bout with fatigue, which has yielded some relief, but not a cure. I have seen many doctors and been tested for vitamin D3/B12, anemia, diabetes, a full thyroid panel, and sleep apnea (only an at-home test, which is not perfect). I have spent hundreds of hours researching the cause of my fatigue and believe I can rule out Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia because I don\u2019t have physical pain, flu-like symptoms, or post-exertion malaise. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a psychiatrist three times and he recently diagnosed me with clinical anxiety. He also believes I have accompanying depressive-like symptoms, but not **clinical depression** itself. He believes anxiety is **causing** my problems, though I am not totally convinced as many of my psychological issues came years after the fatigue. He believes anxiety can manifests itself in many ways, though. He prescribed me 25mg of Zoloft which I haven\u2019t started yet.\n\nI am eerily similar to my mom who I believe has undiagnosed Generalized Anxiety Disorder (excessive worry, thought loops, etc.). She sleeps a normal 8 hours per night and is full of energy. She talks about her problems, whereas I bottle mine. I think a case can be made that my fatigue is caused by G.A.D. as I have a neurotic personality type, a history of hypervigilance, rumination, worry, and obsessive-compulsive tendencies. I haven\u2019t heard of anxiety causing long, unrefreshing sleep, though, which is where I\u2019m not convinced.\n\nRegarding the depressive-like symptoms: I am sad, down, and hopeless ***about*** my fatigue, but still have interests, high self-esteem, a healthy appetite, etc. Every day I **want** to pursue my hobbies, hangout with friends, exercise, and eat right, but can\u2019t because of the fatigue.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI\u2019ve seen a sleep specialist twice. We eliminated the possibility of Type 1 Narcolepsy because I **don\u2019t** have cataplexy. I also don\u2019t have sleep paralysis or hallucinations. He suggested I may have Idiopathic Hypersomnia back in 2019 and ordered me a sleep study. Unfortunately, I have failed two Polysomnographys (December 2020 &amp; July 2021) because I couldn\u2019t fall asleep during the studies; and therefore, couldn\u2019t complete the daytime MSLTs. The sleeping conditions were **very** uncomfortable, and I put myself under a lot of pressure in hopes of landing a diagnosis. These studies took months to arrange and a lot of back-and-forth with insurance, so it was disappointing outcome.\n\nI have researched I.H. heavily since hearing about it in 2019, and it sounds very fitting on paper: long, unrefreshing nighttime sleep and long, unrefreshing daytime naps as a staple.\n\nA very common symptom of I.H. I **don\u2019t** have is \u201csleep drunkenness:\u201d confusion, disorientation, or grogginess upon waking. I can wake up from a first alarm and am mentally acute despite the tiredness. I would also use the terms \u201ctired/fatigue\u201d before \u201csleepy,\u201d but realize these terms are often difficult to differentiate and overlapping. I don\u2019t score significantly high on the Epstein Sleepiness Scale but hit the mark on some I.H. questionnaires online. I have tried modafinil (up to 400mg) and felt nothing.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s anxiety, maybe it\u2019s idiopathic hypersomnia, maybe it\u2019s something else entirely. I need guidance.\n\nAs per the sidebar rules, I am not asking for medical advice or a diagnosis, but rather to hear your experience with I.H. so we can compare. I was purposefully long winded in the hopes that an outside perspective may spot holes in my story, and notice symptoms that are/aren\u2019t common with I.H. Please point out these discrepancies to me so I can discuss them with my doctors. Any feedback would be appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3203, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia, Anxiety, or something else altogether (a long story - help appreciated)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pidpfb/idiopathic_hypersomnia_anxiety_or_something_else/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Sleepy-boi-", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4wcyzy5c", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1630746200, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pho4qm/how_to_get_healthy_physically_when_i_can_barely/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pho4qm", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7ef5f290-a320-11e8-a4c6-0e019bf20b18", "link_flair_text": "Lifestyle", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/pho4qm/how_to_get_healthy_physically_when_i_can_barely/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1630746212, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am what some might call pudgy.

I'm 26(F) now. I've been treated consistently for depression, anxiety, and panic disorder over the years, with no change in my exhaustion. My executive dysfunction and memory difficulties became so severe that I started seeking other diagnoses. I was diagnosed with ADHD in March of this year and finally diagnosed with IH in July (after almost 10 years of seeing doctors!!!). I was only diagnosed with these things because I consistently advocated for myself, changed doctors when I felt I wasn't because heard or taken seriously, and was lucky enough to find a sleep center that took self-referrals.\n\nI've been on a combination of Adderall &amp; Modafinil for a little over a month now (in addition to Wellbutrin &amp; Lexapro for the aforementioned depression &amp; anxiety), and I don't feel perfect or normal. But I am amazed at the changes I've noticed.\n\nI still have lingering brain fog and a lot of issues with time management. Some days I still need a nap. But I'm getting to work earlier. I'm actually doing my work how it's supposed to be done. I can wake up in the mornings. I haven't fallen asleep while driving or talking on the phone.\nI don't feel \"normal,\" but I feel like I am doing well enough to have the energy to actually set the foundation for good routines and habits in my life, and I am just amazed.\n\n\nSome days I get frustrated that I am not where I want to be. Today, for example, I pulled into work at 9am and still had to take an hour long nap in my car for going inside. But I am still clocking into work by 10:30 when 6 months ago I was clocking in anywhere from 2-4pm.\nI have to remind myself how far I've come and remember to give myself grace.\n\nAnyway. I just wanted somewhere to share these feelings with people who understand.\n\nI'm so grateful to have found this group\u2764\ufe0f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3199, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Not perfect, but better.

Went from being an A+ athlete &amp; social butterfly with huge dreams, to falling asleep in class daily and quitting sports because I was too tired to run at practice. Everyone pinned it on being 'burnt-out' from high-school, so I took a gap year (in 2014-2015) and then went to university (in 2015) despite these things persisting. In university, I started sleeping and napping 12-20 hours a day and was diagnosed and treated for depression and anxiety for several years. None of the doctors I saw knew what more to do or who to send me to, other than recommending me for therapy, which didn't do anything. I wasn't depressed or anxious most of the time, just tired. Finally I decided to quit school after three years (in 2019) - I just didn't have enough energy to finish it. I had accommodations for extra time and exams, but people were generally distrustful of my need for them, and I felt like an outcast.\n\nIn 2019 I decided I would make a push to finally figure out what was wrong with me. Leading me down this deep, dark, confusing, never-ending rabbit hole of doctors, disorders and diagnoses that have no conclusive existence, let alone any conclusive treatments (maybe an exaggeration - but also kind of not).\n\nI started back at the basics. With no family doctor (thanks, Canada), I went to the nearest walk-in clinic. Retold my story of severe tiredness and past diagnoses of depression/anxiety. They ran a blood test, found no abnormalities, and set me up with my fourth try of antidepressants. I went back frequently for adjustments, dose increases, medication add-ons. Nothing even came close to helping. Frustrated, and with a referral to psychiatry with a 12 month waitlist (thanks, Canada), I saw an emergency psychiatrist, who increased my doses yet again, but at least told me that maybe I should enquire to my doctor or other psychiatrist about using stimulants - he couldn't prescribe that though, since he wasn't my regular doctor. I asked him - what should I do next? I don't feel depressed - just tired - who should I see? He told me to talk to my family doctor. Great.\n\nI went to a new walk-in doctor. Cheery, helpful, wanted to help. Referred me to a sleep specialist and did some research into Modafinil. Prescribed a low dose, and it did help some. I would say I felt 20% better. Promising! I thought - here we go, finally, I am closer to an answer.\n\nA few months later, I see the sleep specialist for a consult. He thinks, based on my symptoms, we were looking at narcolepsy without cataplexy, or 'at the very least' (in his words), idiopathic hypersomnia. However, after a sleep study (a very uncomfortable 24 hours - the lab had the driest air I've ever breathed and a rock hard bed), he couldn't conclude any particular sleep disorder from my results. I did tell him I'd had a horrible sleep, and that I wasn't sure my results could be accurate, but regardless, he insisted that I had no sleep disorder other than hypersomnia 'not otherwise specified'. Essentially, he said, there are just some issues that doctors haven't yet discovered, and that even though nothing was definitive, we would still treat my symptoms. So, 6 months of medication alterations later, and I am taking 20mg Adderall XR and 5mg Dexedrine daily. The sleep specialist won't see me anymore - nothing more he can do, I suppose. Though at least I am now able to function somewhat, I am still exhausted most of the time. Some weeks are worse than others. Stress makes it worse, I know that for sure. I do get sad sometimes - depressed even - because I can't do a lot of the things I want to do. I feel bad for my partner, who was as hopeful as I was for a better resolution.\n\nSo, after this long-winded, fairly inaccurate, poorly written recap of the last 8 years, my question to this community is: What now? Is this as good as it will ever get? And if I build up a tolerance to the medications, will it only get worse from here? Do I tell my partner to run while he has the chance (Mostly kidding on this last one - he is very supportive. Still, I can't help but feel guilty)?\n\nTL;DR - 25 year old who has been fatigued for 8 years - daytime sleepiness that I can feel down to the bone, unresolved by naps. Seen many doctors, diagnosed with depression, took antidepressants, then saw a sleep specialist who deemed my case was probably not depression, but still inconclusive. Now prescribed stimulants to treat my fatigue, feeling better than I have in the past, but not 100% (more like 50%). Worried that I won't ever feel better. Also confused as to what the heck to do now. Looking for some form of advice, but also might just be venting? Not totally sure.

I am a 20M college student that has hypersomnia. I have been on medicine for hypersomnia (prescribed by my sleep doctor) for about 3 years now and nothing is working. I have tried Ritalin (IR and XR) and modafonil for years in different increments (different doses, multiple doses, a combo of both, etc).\n\nRight now I just need advice and encouragement. I have been taking my meds (currently on a mixture of moda and methylphenidate IR spread throughout the day), but I get like 30 minutes of clarity after each dose then I feel horribly tired again. But by like 3pm, there is no amount of meds that can improve my tiredness. Since I\u2019m in college I have a lot of flexibility to nap if I keep them short.\n\nMy issue has been that I wake up and feel amazing after taking my meds and then 3 hours later I hit the wall. I can\u2019t process anything because i\u2019m so tired, if I try to do homework I can\u2019t understand it, I look like I haven\u2019t slept in years\u2026 I literally turn into a vegetable. So I try to lay down and take a nap just so I can wake up and feel a little better. But I can\u2019t. I will lay down and I am so tired that I can\u2019t do anything, but I can\u2019t actually fall asleep. I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m on stimulants that are keeping me awake, but thats it... I\u2019m awake. It feels like I haven\u2019t slept in DAYS but my brain can\u2019t turn off to go to sleep. I feel like all of the doses and different meds keep me awake, but don\u2019t improve my brain fog or tiredness at all. \n\nBy the time it\u2019s 5pm, I am useless. My brain is so slow and i feel like i\u2019m stuck in between being asleep and being awake. It\u2019s like I\u2019m sleeping in my brain, but I\u2019m moving around and still know what\u2019s going on. The worst part is, when I get this delusional and tired it makes me have horrible anxiety attacks.\n\nI hope someone has some advice or knows what I\u2019m talking about because I feel like I am the only one experiencing this. Thank you so much in advance for anyone who can provide guidance.\n\n(P.S. I know the obvious answer that I need to adjust my meds and go to my sleep doctor soon, but even when I go see him he tells me that we don\u2019t have many options left)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3166, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "at my lowest (please help)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/p7135x/at_my_lowest_please_help/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "boom-chaac-a-laca-", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_363f27ec", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1629309274, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/p6wero/doctor_with_ih/", "gildings": {}, "id": "p6wero", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b0a7e18a-a17d-11e8-88ac-0e14fa46b726", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/p6wero/doctor_with_ih/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1629309286, "score": 1, "selftext": "Anyone a doctor with IH?

He said \"they dont work, are too expensive &amp; im done dealing with it. Waste of time\". Which is fair.

He tells me my insurance wont cover the meds (big no brainer) and I'll have to pay out of pocket. So at this point I'm hesitant but then he says \"30-40$USD no problem\".

context was necessary. Scroll down to the bottom if you don't feel like reading. I (24F) was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia last august after having 2 MSLT tests done and my Pulmonologist put me on Adderall 5mg extended release. Prior to my diagnosis I tried everything I could to manage my symptoms (gluten free low sugar diet, exercise regularly and especially be on my feet when tired, using a standing desk, taking multivitamins and extra Vitamins D due to being a POC). I'm not overweight (5'8, 135lbs) and don't have sleep apnea, so I didn't have the usual predispositions.\n\nAnywho, he didn't want me on provigil/nuvigil because I take hormonal birth control to manage iron deficiency (heavy periods run in my family and I have been iron deficient since I was 14 so copper IUD wasn't an option, nor is depo shot due to having history of vitamin D deficiency) and he didn't want me to get pregnant. Feeling that I was getting sensitized to it despite doing 4 days on, 3 days off, I was switched to immediate release 7.5 mg. Same story with the drug being less effective, so after doing a pregnancy test, I finally was able to take nuvigil/armodafinil.\n\nPulmonologist wanted to start me at 150mg, which I thought was pretty high but he said, \"you got used to the adderall so quickly so this should be fine.\" I still cut the pill and took 75 mg, which kept me up for nearly 20 hours; I had to take melatonin for the first time in my life to help me fall asleep. Dose was tapered down to 50 mg, which soon became ineffective as I was starting to fall asleep thought the day again, then brought up to 75 mg. At this point, I had been taking nuvigil for almost 2 months. Once my dosage was brought up to 75 mg, I was still feeling tired, but no longer falling asleep during the day. I reached out to my doctor who told me to begin taking the 150 mg, upping me back to my original prescription. This is where things get weird.\n\nOnce I started taking the 150 mg dose, I started feeling tired ALL DAY. You know that feeling you get right before you're about to fall asleep? I began to feel like that from the moment I took the 150mg nuvigil to the moment I went to bed at night, except I wasn't falling asleep at all during the day. This went on for a week before I stopped taking it altogether and reverted to my leftover adderall since I needed to be function for med school classes. Feeling frustrated and confused, I tried to make an appointment with my pulmonologist who was out of the office. I ended up getting an appointment with another Pulm who told me that I don't have idiopathic hypersomnia because the 2nd MSLT study average was 11 min and that there is another underlying cause to my condition. I never got the results of the first or second study (Kaiser is a mess of an insurer with being consistent about sending patients documentation from outside facilities they partner with) so this was news to me.\n\nShe ordered a ton of bloodwork (TSH, CBC, iron, ferritin, etc.) and scheduled me for an ECG, an EKG, and some tracking device to track my sleep/wake cycles for 2 weeks. She also scheduled me for a drug test (I already get drug tested for school and have never taken any stimulants recreationally or otherwise until my diagnosis) and said she was going to fill a prescription for the 5mg XR adderall for a month until my original Pulmonologist is back but that I should stop taking it after that. I'm feeling even more confused and frustrated as I'm not even sure if I have hypersomnia. I tried to ask her what she thought could be causing my symptoms if I do have hypersomnia (as that was my original diagnosis) but she kept saying \"follow up with your doctor, he's smart and he can take it from here.\"\n\nI had some weird health issues pop up in late middle school/early high school related to edema in my foot and was shuttled between rheumatology, podiatry, and my pediatrician. I missed a lot of school and was on all kinds of weird medications (prednisone, azothiaprine, methotrexate, etc) that caused all kinds of weird side-effects and created more problems than the initial issue itself. It was a really tough time and it honestly makes me hate the prospect of having to go through lots of testing all over again. After my most recent visit, it's upsetting that I may have to put myself through something similar again, especially now that I'm in medical school with a demanding schedule.\n\nTLDR; I have Hypersomnia but it's not idiopathic except I don't know what's causing it and now I have a bunch of tests ordered and I don't know why.

My husband showed me this subreddit and I said, \"people understand me!\"\n\nI was diagnosed in November and was given 15mg Adderall XR. I started it mid-December because I was scared to take it. When I saw my doctor a week after starting it, I said, \"this medicine is life changing!\" But slowly over the past month, I have been getting sleepier and sleepier each day. I commute an hour each way to school and almost fell asleep at the wheel today (and a few days last week) even with adderall and black tea. (I have been drinking black tea because if I have coffee I feel my heart pounding and it makes me anxious.) I hate relying on this medicine, but I felt like a functioning human for once. I tried taking \"medicine vacations\" on the weekends so I didn't grow tolerant to it, but here we are. And now on the weekends I sleep 15+ hours a day. \n\nI am a woman and I am about to start my period, last time I was on my period and on adderall I felt off, but my depression tends to get worse during my period too. Is IH tide to hormones? Does Adderall not work as well around that time? I am so new to all of this that I was hoping to figure it out over time and see patterns but I don't know if I am thinking too much into it. But I also want to be safe and not crash because I fell asleep while driving... again.\n\nI am supposed to see my doctor in early March but I am probably going to call tomorrow and moving up my appointment. \n\nI guess my overall question is, how did you figure out your medicine or how to function without medicine in a healthy and safe way?

Will have many things to ask you guys abut (managing a full-time job, how not to turn into a hermit, the right medication) but today I want to focus on my strategy for the emotional toll of this illness.\n\nNormally I manage to muddle through, but some days, it just flat out sucks. It's tiring pretending to be alert around people 24/7, it's horrible losing your memory and it sucks turning down opportunities or letting people down because you don't have the energy to commit to social events. \n\nToday was one of those days for me. But one thought has pulled me out of it. No one really knows what dreams are for, but one of the conclusions has been that it helps you to be creative. Studies have shown that people with certain sleep disorders are [more creative](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2206959-people-with-narcolepsy-may-be-more-creative-because-of-how-they-sleep/) and I can confirm that in the brief moments between brain fog, I can come up with ideas others don't, as I have a way of seeing the world that they will never know.\n\nI went to see an alternative therapist once and he told me maybe I was born this way because I also had a life to lead in the world of dreams. Certainly, I feel like I'm dreaming most of my waking life because I'm so tired. \n\nNever believe them when they say you are 'wasting your life' by being asleep.

This is my first post on here, so I apologize if I do anything incorrectly, and, if so, please let me know so I can fix it ASAP.\n\nSo, I'm waiting for an official diagnosis. After finally getting my shit together/realizing how I felt wasn't normal, I told my GP how exhausted I am, all the time, for as long as I can remember. She did blood work, ruled out anemia and other nutritional deficiencies, but found I was severely Vit D deprived, which wasn't too surprising. I've been taking a high dose vitamin D supplement (Rx ergocalciferol; 50,000 IU, once a week) for the last six months, and while that's helped clear up some things (back pain, low immunity, hair loss, etc), the tiredness beast still rages on. \n\nShe referred me to a sleep doc (pulmonology) who listened to my symptoms and said it sounded like N w/o C. He sent me in for a sleep study (PSG followed by MSLT, which I hear is pretty standard) which I just did yesterday. \n\nAs I wait for the results, I guess I'm just looking for some encouragement and advice on what to talk to my sleep doctor about at my follow up appt., based on whatever he diagnoses me with.\n\nA little (okay, a big) backstory: I'm almost 22 y.o., female, and have been tired for as long as I can remember. I was home schooled until I was 13 and basically slept all of the time--most days, I wouldn't start my independent study until almost noon. I would have bursts of hyper-activity and energy, though, and I did competitive gymnastics and liked to stay up late reading, so I guess my parents just thought I was a night owl. When I turned 14, I went to public school, so had to start waking up at 6 AM, and man, was it *impossible.* My alarm would shriek and I'd sleep right through it--it would wake up family members all the way downstairs and I wouldn't even budge to hit snooze. My mom would come in and open the blinds, turn on all of the lights, take away my blanket, and still, I couldn't get up. I'm told I would have full, coherent conversations with my mom (and even yell at my sisters) about how *I was so completely awake and would they stop bothering me already because I was UP DUH* and remember none of it. At one point that first year, I told my mom to try pouring ice water on me, which kind of worked?\n\nThings got worse after that. I couldn't get up in the mornings; I was late for school almost every single day, and slept  through it entirely on others. When I made it to school, I would fall asleep in class, or go to the nurses office and say I had a headache so I could take a nap there. Every day, I came home and either went straight to bed or would try to do my homework and end up falling asleep at my desk or on the floor. On the weekends, I would sleep until 2 or 3 PM and my family would tease me about how lazy I was, and how grouchy and disoriented I always was when I finally got up.\n\nI was a good student, smart, tested well, worked hard and was engaged and interested in class when I could stay awake for it--it was just getting work done at home that was hard. **What's funny/weird is that I've always had the ability to push my brain and body into overdrive and use adrenaline to be hyper-focused, hyper-alert, hyper-active, hyper-social--but then I crash afterwards, hard.**\n\nAlso, my entry into school wasn't the greatest--bullying and stress and all of those other fun middle school things--and I definitely dealt with some anxiety and depression, and I think that's what my family figured was making me sleep all the time. They sent me off to a psychiatrist who loaded me up with a cocktail of SSRIs and stims and sleep meds, the specifics of which I don't remember. I don't remember much, in general, of age 15-17, so it's all a little messy.\n\nI started drinking coffee when I was about 14.5, and using caffeine pills the following year. I cannot emphasize enough how firmly I believed everything I felt was perfectly NORMAL. Everyone was always talking about how tired they were! Everyone joked about wishing they could take a nap every day! Everyone popped Addys and chugged Red Bull and snoozed in class sometimes.\n\nI switched schools three times, to see if a later start time, friendlier peers, a different environment would help. Ultimately, I dropped out and enrolled in an online high-school-early-college program, figuring I'd be fine if I could do the work on my own. But nope, whenever I sat down at my computer, I couldn't do it. I wouldn't  always fall asleep, but I would feel a crushing wave of tiredness that made it impossible to focus.\n\nIn short, this \"tiredness thing\" is the reason I've yet to attend college, although I've only recently admitted it. I just felt like I, as a person, wasn't capable. I felt like maybe I was just lazy and unmotivated, that I lacked drive and will power and the ability to function like everyone else.\n\nFast forward to the present and I am really, deeply unhappy with my life, both day-to-day and long-term. For the past five years, I've worked full-time, and always jobs that keep me moving and standing (food service, hospitality, gymnastics coach, nanny) and thought that was probably why I was tired. \n\nEvery morning, I set \\~30 alarms, one every 2-5 minutes for a two hour window. I'm lucky if I actually get up to the last one. I live with my boyfriend, so he usually wakes me up, but I'm often too groggy to remember the time I work or when I need to leave to get there. \n\nI work at a coffee shop, so stand and chug espresso for about seven hours, then come home and crawl into bed (usually around 2 or 3 PM) and \"nap\" until 8 or 9. I wake up, unrefreshed, eat something, and hang out with my boyfriend until 11 or 12, then go back to sleep. The next morning, when my alarms go off at 6 or 7 or whenever, it's the same story. I NEVER feel rested. I didn't know that was a real thing, that people out there wake up and don't feel like shit. Rarely, I feel \"good.\" Once a day or so, I'll have a fifteen/twenty minute burst of crazy energy, usually right before I crash. I don't do much besides go to work and sleep. No matter what I'm doing, I ALWAYS wish I could be sleeping instead. I, literally, spend the entire day counting down how long it is until I can get into bed. \n\nSorry for this novel of a rant. It just, sucks, you know? I'm so, so happy I found this forum, because reading all of your stories made me feel so seen--like, this is real and it's hard and it's not just me being weak. \n\nI just want to feel good, normal. At the risk of being dramatic, I want my life back. I see co-workers work long days, then still have the energy to run errands and pursue hobbies and go out with friends, and I just don't have that. I feel like I have the energy quota to do exactly one thing each day, whether that's going to work, or doing laundry, or meeting a friend for lunch. I can choose one of those things, and then I'm pretty much dead to the world for the rest of the day. \n\nOn my days off, I can't wake up until 4 or 4:30 PM, and even then I can only get up because I realize I've wasted an entire day, get angry with myself, and drag my body out of bed. Those days, I shower, go to the coffee shop and have a few espressos, eat dinner with my boyfriend, and fall asleep again around 11 or 12.\n\nI'm tired of it. I want to do things! I want to read more than three pages without falling asleep! I want to go to the movie theater without worrying about accidentally falling asleep on a stranger's shoulder! My boyfriend is incredibly compassionate and supportive, but I hate how much my low energy level and constant need to sleep affects our time together. \n\nI'm assuming my sleep doc is going to diagnose me with something, whether it's N or IH. My dad has IH, and my mom has periodic limb movement disorder. Both of my sisters take Adderal for ADHD, so I'm not sure what their sleep/energy situation is like without that. I'm apprehensive to take stims, myself, but know that's typically the best bet for treatment. Basically, all this being said, I want to know if there's anything I should ask my sleep doctor about in particular, and also ask you all if this sounds like your experience, either with IH or N. I think I also really needed to vent, so thank you if you read all of this.\n\nI'm excited/nervous to get the results of my sleep study. It definitely wasn't a normal night (or day) of sleep for me, and I was so wired and anxious and thrown out of whack that I feel like I didn't sleep at all, but I know a ton of people feel that way and still end up sleeping and even hitting REM. I just hope my sleep doc is understanding and a good listener and competent and cares etc etc--I don't know him very well yet. \n\n\\*\\*\\*Also, sort of a side note, but some nights when I'm falling asleep for the second time around 1 or 2 AM, and have to get up for work at 4 or 5 AM, I'll get so anxious about oversleeping and missing my alarms and being late and getting fired that I'll wire myself up so much that I can't sleep at all. The days when I go to work on 0-2 hours of sleep, I actually feel like I have a ton of energy and am bouncing around like crazy, talking too much and really rapidly. Is that my body in survival mode? Sometimes I wonder if I would function better if I regularly got 2-3 hours of sleep, instead of more. Anyone else??\n\nOk, fin!!

I then proceeded to take a 3 hour nap.\n\nThis sort of stuff has been happening for years and I always put it down to sleep debt but I must be in credit by now if anything.\n\nThe doctor I've seen a few times basically said yep, it sounds like hypersomnia but there's not a whole lot that can be done. Just said diet, exercise, sleeping patterns, etc.\n\nAnyone have any practical advice to managing this?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1539, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "So what now?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ejl6g7/so_what_now/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Sleepy_Ananas", "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "56de33b2-a13b-11e8-86fb-0ec44c28c910", "author_flair_text": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4sumttq0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578042893, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ejd0z7/how_do_yall_deal_with_new_years_eve/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ejd0z7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b0a7e18a-a17d-11e8-88ac-0e14fa46b726", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 33, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ejd0z7/how_do_yall_deal_with_new_years_eve/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578117809, "score": 4, "selftext": "Hi everyone, happy new year!\n\nThis year's NYE has been my first one with full-blown IH (as opposed to what I was doing before, which was basically pushing through the sleepiness with insane amounts of caffeine and the power of denial).\n\nUsually I would stay up until 2am, sometimes longer and feel tired on January 1st but that was it. I was mostly functional by January 2nd and back to what I thought was normal by the next day.\n\nThis year I stayed up until 1am - I usually go to bed at 10.30pm every night - and I was completely destroyed the next day. Yesterday (January 2nd) was a day off so I got lucky, cos I was tingly and weak until noon and then was only able to do a few errands which took me twice the usual time. I then did some basic sewing which completely killed me.\n\nToday (Jan 3rd) I have to work from home because I fell back asleep right after muting my alarm. I'm super weak and during a phone call with work earlier I noticed that I can barely think and talk at the same time.\n\nI've always loved staying up and watching the fireworks and I'd be bummed if I had to go to bed at 10.\n\nAll of this to ask - how do you guys deal with NYE?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1539, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do yall deal with New Year's Eve?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ejd0z7/how_do_yall_deal_with_new_years_eve/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ambermareep", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_vxoe4l1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577970746, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/eiy2o5/questions_to_ask_at_a_follow_up/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eiy2o5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/eiy2o5/questions_to_ask_at_a_follow_up/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577970749, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a follow up appointment tomorrow.

Either way I can sleep 16+hrs after doing the same the night before and when I do manage to get up I'm dizzy and stumbling and can't see straight. I have the memory lapses people have talked about on other forums I've read too, and they don't only happen when I first get up but sometimes through out the day when I'm too tired too. I fall asleep standing after turning my alarm off and fall into my heater and wake up to my legs burning. I fall asleep sitting up putting my shoes on and wake up with drool all over my legs. I fall asleep in weird positions and wake up with my legs totally asleep and hurting really bad. I get foot/leg \"cramps\" when I wake up before my body wants me to also, it's like my feet/legs are still dead asleep and they hurt so bad I moan about it, does this happen to anyone else? Even when I'm full of restless energy if I lay down I can go to sleep, and I'll want to lay down. Feeling restless and exhausted at the same time some days is really frustrating and most people don't seem to understand what I mean when I talk about it. So many people in my life are starting to get really irritated with me because I keep being late to or sleeping through things and nobody understands that I WANT to show up but my body WON'T let me. It's really taking a toll on my self esteem. I get really depressed about it because everyone thinks badly of me for this and for dosing off while at work/in groups as though I'm not interested. It doesn't seem like I have much control over this and it's scary and makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong. I keep talking to my drs and my therapist and they say the same shit about \"well you need a regular sleep schedule\" which I really DO and I wish I COULD have one. I'm trying so hard and nobody seems to get that. The drs test me for the same shit over and over again. I'm not anemic, I'm not diabetic, my thyroid is fine, and I am depressed but I know what depression naps feel like and this isn't it. I got into recovery from many years of alcoholism and a year of heroin use after that this May (7 months clean, whoo!), which might be making this worse but everyone in my groups and meetings thinks it's odd since people who take depressants like that usually have the opposite reaction to sobriety. I'm really just looking for someone to say \"Hey, this isn't just you and I recognize that you are trying\", that would be really great. I feel like a total dud and I miss having time in a day to do things I like to do. It's really putting pressure on my sobriety too, because I used to be able to self medicate this and now I don't have that option(never did uppers habitually, depressants seemed to do the trick for some reason). Does anyone have suggestions on how to talk with Drs about this and get them to actually understand the problem and how it's affecting my life? I'm going back to my Dr on Thursday where we'll talk about my normal thyroid and I think a sleep study is next, did anyone get conclusive results from a sleep study? Thank you for taking the time to read my post, I really appreciate having a place I feel might be receptive to what I'm talking about.

For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve not only been sleepy but also frail. I mean that in the sense that I\u2019ve been to many specialty doctors over the years for various acute issues which more often than not, lead to a diagnosis of a \u201cnot very common inflammatory disorder.\u201d I admit, I don\u2019t eat great but I do try with my limited resources. I am a healthy weight (5\u201910,\u201d 120 lbs) although I find it harder and harder to maintain an appetite as my IH medication dose is increased/changed. I have an active job (radiation therapy), and have no known genetic disorders. I very rarely get sick and don\u2019t suffer from any allergies. Overall good health except a few random anomalies scribbled in my medical records over the years. These include:\n\n-trochleitis:  acutely inflamed trochanter (eyeball ligament) with no known cause\n\n-prognosis of developing arthritis by the time I\u2019m 30 according to my orthopedist and podiatrist of separate practices...my joints have always been subpar but I associated the mild  discomfort to poor form when running and overuse of my wrists when playing instruments for years but I suppose most 21-year-olds don\u2019t have this same problem, especially throughout most joints. I had a bone graft in a carpal bone 2 years ago to fill in the hole of a cyst that randomly developed INSIDE the bone (again, super random/uncommon and no known cause)\n\n-tooth root resorption: a condition of unknown cause where the tooth pretty much decays from the inside out, unrelated to any sort of gum disease/cavity...going to need 2 teeth implants as soon as I can afford it)\n\n\n- TMJ: not exactly rare but still considered to have no known cause. I certainly am aware of my jaw clenching throughout the day and relax it when I take notice. However, my jaw has \u201cpopped\u201d for as long as I can remember when it\u2019s opened beyond a certain point. I also can not  always open my mouth fully in the morning to brush my teeth for at least 30 minutes. Some days. This is not painful but possibly notable in relation to the other conditions.\n\n\nI\u2019m seeing a trend of bone/connective tissue degrading \u201cfor no apparent reason\u201d and have been wondering if maybe they could be related. Anyone else with IH experience similar symptoms? Diagnosed with any other disorders? No general Dr has the big picture to put these pieces together so please help me out with my own \u201cresearch.\u201d Much appreciated to anyone who took the time to read/respond without falling asleep:)\n\n\n\nAs a complete side note, I realize today, upon answering some standard questions, that I very rarely have a headache. I can probably count on 1 hand every headache I\u2019ve had in the past 5 years and those were mild...even when I walked into a low pole fairly hard (it sounded like I should have a concussion and really scared me that I might but I never developed symptoms) a few weeks ago.

Might as well be a game to me). And it struck me recently how absurd my thinking this way actually is. I've joked about sleeping for a long period of time, or feeling tired. Its a good way to talk about it and cope. I've been depressed about how held back I am comparatively to other people, jealous of having a normal life. And I've been angry at how people can just fail to understand what is such a simple concept. \nI'm tired.\nIs it a simple concept though?\nHere's what's sparked this;\nWhile watching YouTube, there was a video where a guy challenges himself to go as long as possible without knowing what the time is. The guy in the video says \"I was only awake for 9 hours the previous day, so I could have only slept for 30 minutes, or 6 hours.\". For a second I thought to myself \" what do you mean you were \"only awake for 9 hours\" you won't sleep a full night after a day?!. What kind of pers- oh yeah, people are normally awake for 16 hours a day.. I think\".\n\nIt felt very strange to realise I was completely disconnected from other people, in the way they view time and sleep. To me it was messed up so much in my early life and since, almost my entire adolescence, my sleep has been anything but normal and its occupied a lot of my thoughts. I couldn't see fully until now how much its separated me from other people. Even though, it's literally my life. Even though I've obsessively thought about how much better my life could be if I was just like everyone else. \nIn a way, I still thought I was like everyone else.\nDoesn't make much sense. I can't put the right words to it.\n\nMaybe this is why other people have such a hard time fully grasping the struggles and weight of such a condition. It sounds so simple, so you think about it and explain it in a simple way. But the ways it seeps into you life, ways it can affect you, controls how you live, influences how see things. Its not simple. So we are people on the opposite side of a wall, shouting to others about what our side is like, And there a window, but its small, tinted, and blurry. Which is why its so frustrating. \nIt took me 5 years for it to smack me in the face.\n\nObviously I realised quite early that I would live differently to other people. But this feels different, and there's something disconcerting to me about it, that I can't fully articulate.\n\nDoes any of this make any sense at all?\nI kinda feel insane rn.\n\n-Sorry for the thesis.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1497, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My perception of time and sleep Is not normal.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ebbdvl/my_perception_of_time_and_sleep_is_not_normal/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Self_Motivated", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bf9iq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576136927, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/e9kms9/epsteinbarr_virus_connection/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e9kms9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/e9kms9/epsteinbarr_virus_connection/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576136928, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi,\n\nSaw an ENT recently to see if I had sleep apnea following a sleep study.

Finally got a diagnosis of IH in May 2017, but I had a high number of respiratory events from my breathing slowing down too much, only one brief obstructive event recorded. \n\nSo today, my sleep specialist who doesn't seem like much of a specialist (I've been considering switching doctors for a while, but wanted to see what happened at today's appointment), claims he thinks I suddenly have sleep apnea from gaining some weight (yes I know it happens, but symptoms started before I was overweight and being skinny didn't stop em later) and wants me to do an at-home test and CPAP. Honestly the whole speech sounded like he was trying to sell something. Didn't even suggest losing weight first or give tips on how to while also being exhausted. This same doctor has fought me on meds the whole time. He doesn't like stimulants because they can be abused, even though I'm always careful and have never given doctors a reason to think otherwise. \n\nI've been thinking for a while about how a current trial is based on the fact that some IH patients show benzo side effects or signs of long term use or abuse, because I have those side effects. Guess what can also slow breathing?? Sedatives! Number 1 warning is to never mix them with other respiratory depressants (like alcohol) because you can stop breathing altogether. \n\nI'm not a doctor, but I also know how to do research and I understand science well when I'm not sleeping. So basically just needed to vent after being ignored, but I'd also like input. I'll be working on losing weight for one thing. Tips on exercising exhausted or stop the sleep deprived carb cravings? I have been told to start with 5 minutes exercise and go from there. And for the testing, should I pay up to $500 for an at-home test and probably more if he decides it's apnea, or go to a different hospital with better doctors and available equipment/resources for a second opinion? Leaning towards second opinion at a better hospital that's more up-to-date. Can't afford $500 because I sleep too much for a full time job, so I'll end up having to put it on credit and pay it slowly. \n\nSorry and thanks to anyone who reads this mess lol", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1485, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Frustrating Follow-up", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/e8zea5/frustrating_followup/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "clairevoyantlycrazy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_37bh8fbo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576001315, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/e8u8g7/modanfinil/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e8u8g7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/e8u8g7/modanfinil/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576001322, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been diagnosed with IH for awhile now and they\u2019ve tried multiple stimulants on me and so far only adderall has worked but as everyone knows it only works for so long and then you have to up your dose constantly.

If something insignificant happened, I wouldn't be able to understand that it's not dangerous or calm myself down. Or if I got frustrated, I might start crying and be unable to be rational about it. Usually I'm disoriented enough to make bad decisions and give nonsense answers to things when asked, but sometimes it's bad enough that I can't figure out how getting a bowl of cereal works or I might not recognize things around the house that I see every day. Usually my memory is really fuzzy or non-existent afterwards. \n\nSince getting treatment, paralysis happens less often and I wake up and feel fine but then I'll start to notice things. Like, I'll be putting off tasks without really understanding why. To the point that important things don't get done but for some reason, no \"um, you need to be a responsible adult?\" alarm goes off in my head. Which is scary. When pressed, I realize that I just feel really foggy and confused about the task and I start getting anxious. It's a different kind of anxiety than what I'm used to. It's like I can't really figure out why it's happening, that's super out of the ordinary for me. Sometimes I feel okay until I realize that an hour or more has passed without me realizing it. It might have only felt like 20 mins. Time usually continues to pass that way for the rest of the day and it's pretty scary honestly. Or I might feel foggy but think I'm mostly okay until I realize that I don't know what day it is or what I'm supposed to be doing and the morning has passed without me realizing how bad of a state I'm in at all. \n\nI'm pretty scared for obvious reasons but also the medication is working on days that aren't like this. I forgot what it was like to not have fatigue all the time and I'm sleeping normal hours. I'm worried that like, this is as good as it gets? Or like, when I look up symptoms sometimes mine don't match, what if I have something less treatable than IH? (I don't expect anyone here to have an answer, I'm just voicing a fear.) Does anyone else with IH get cataplexy? I've seen so many different definitions of cataplexy so far I'm not even sure if it applies to me anymore, honestly.  I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has had the same problems?

I sure as hell didnt. So short story time: I live with two of my childhood best friends (who are married) and their 1 year old. I moved into my room in the basement at the beginning of the summer. They know I have a sleep disorder, but havent really asked about it, nor do they understand it. This morning I woke up for the second time this week to one of my roommates loudly playing guitar at 9am, for the second day in a row.... after I very nicely asked him yesterday not to play until a more reasonable hour. This is the second weekend in a row I've been woken up around 9 am because they were doing some unnessecary task very early. Im not proud but I went upstairs and kind of yelled at them. Honestly even if I didnt have a sleep disorder its pretty rude to vacuum or loudly play guitar with your amp on when you know someone is sleeping, but I guess it pissed me off more because they know I have a sleep disorder and I constantly struggle with sleep issues. Im in law school, I have to jobs, Im up at 6 am M-F so the weekends are the only time I can get real sleep. Its so precious to me. Anyways they apologized, but I still dont think they get it\n\nI came down stairs and balled for about an hour out of pure fustration. Im always tired, always. This was my only day to sleep in and it was thoughlessly ripped away. I dont know about you guys but once Im up Im up. Im extremely sick of people with normal sleep patterns having no concept or even the slightest consideration for someone with a dabilatating disease. So instead of being pissed about it I decided to make them a informational brochure. At least that way if they still dont get it, I know I tried. \n\nAnyways, Ive included all the basic stuff about IH, but is there anything you would want a normal sleeper to know about having IH? Anything they can do to be helpful? Or is there anything they should say? My current list of shit not to say includes:\n\nWhy Dont You Just Go To Bed Earlier?\n\nI know what its like to be tired, Im so tired all the time too\n\nStop Being Lazy\n\nIf its really that Bad Just Go To The Doctor\n\nYou Probably Just Drink To Much Caffeine \n\nHave You Tried Sleep Hygiene\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince you guys are experts I thought Id make sure I dont miss any major points because Im doing this project on NO SLEEP.

For most of the past two years, I have taken 50mg and have tried to take it only every week, alternating with caffeine, so I don't build up a tolerance to either. One week, I'll do unlimited coffee. The next week, I'll do Nuvigil.   \n\n\nOn the days I don't take Nuvigil, I've noticed I'm SO SO SO tired. I slept 10 hours last night, had two coffees, and it feels like I can barely function today, like the entire day is just one I have to throw into the shitter. Caffeine isn't working anymore, or I'm not spacing it out far enough to prevent developing a tolerance to it. I feel like I should be taking Nuvigil every day to stay awake, but I'm afraid that with no off days, I'll develop a tolerance. My doctor has said that the less I can take of it, the better, which I agree with.   \n\n\nMy questions: when did you start Nuvigil/Modafinil? What was your starting dose and how much do you need to take now?   \n\n\nDo any of you rotate Nuvigil/Modafinil? How have you avoided developing a tolerance to either?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1436, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cycling Nuvigil to prevent developing a tolerance?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/dyfs4t/cycling_nuvigil_to_prevent_developing_a_tolerance/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "taradoodle", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4udfyqri", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574095685, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/dy5pq7/ih_and_hyperhidrosis_update/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dy5pq7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/dy5pq7/ih_and_hyperhidrosis_update/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574095687, "score": 1, "selftext": "Thanks so much to everyone who commented on my earlier post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/dxzstw/modafinil_side_effects_after_11_years_without_a/\n\nI\u2019ve been to see the dermatologist and they said:\n- all medication can have side effects so that alone isn\u2019t necessarily a reason to change\n- as modafinil works so well for me they\u2019ll try an oral medication to stop the sweating \n- changing sleep meds is a last resort, not the first thing to try\n\nAnd they prescribed propantheline, fingers crossed that will work.\n\nThank you all so much for your comments and kindness.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1433, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "IH and Hyperhidrosis update", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/dy5pq7/ih_and_hyperhidrosis_update/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "taradoodle", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4udfyqri", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574060988, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/dxzstw/modafinil_side_effects_after_11_years_without_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dxzstw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 32, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/dxzstw/modafinil_side_effects_after_11_years_without_a/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574060992, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey all. I am so upset right now and just need to talk to people who understand. \n\nI am in my late 30s. I was diagnosed with IH in 2008, in my late 20s. I\u2019ve been on modafinil ever since and it works brilliantly. I wake up when my alarm goes off and hold down a job. My sleep is more productive. I don\u2019t really think about the fact that I have a sleep disorder. My only real symptom is lack of energy. \n\nDone. Sorted. Or so I thought. \n\nEarly this year I developed a condition called hyperhidrosis (which has its own sub, but I wanted to talk to sleepy folk) where my feet sweat constantly - it has been horrendous and is ruining my life. \n\nMy doctor checked the side effects for modafinil and didn\u2019t see sweating or hyperhidrosis in there. Everyone has been treating it as primary (ie no underlying cause) even though this is unusual in adulthood and most adult-onset cases have an underlying cause. I\u2019ve been through a load of hospital outpatient treatment that hasn\u2019t worked.  \n\nYesterday I checked online and learned that this IS a known side effect of modafinil. Damn.\n\nI\u2019m seeing my dermatologist today - I booked the appointment to talk about how nothing was working but now I\u2019ll be talking about how it seems to be a side effect and does that affect how they treat it. I have no idea how to get my dermatologist and sleep specialist (both UK NHS at the same hospital trust) to talk to each other and I\u2019m not seeing my sleep specialist until February when I have my annual outpatient consult. \n\nI don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll give me medication to try to make the sweating stop or if they\u2019ll just say I have to talk to my sleep specialist instead.\n\nI don\u2019t know if modafinil is the cause or if coming off it will make this stop.\n\nI don\u2019t know if any other medication will work for me, and I\u2019m so upset that I might have to try switching, but this other condition is making my life hell so I think I might need to try if the doctors recommend it. \n\nSo potentially I have to choose. Stop the sleepiness or stop the sweating. I have been pretty zen about my sleep disorder since it\u2019s been under control, but now I\u2019m just re-experiencing all the grief that comes with knowing I am stuck with a life-long disease.\n\nThanks if you read this far. I would appreciate:\n- any kind words of support\n- experiences of switching medication, and what that involved eg did you have to have a break between them?\n- experiences of medication other than modafinil eg does anyone take Ritalin? What symptoms does/doesn\u2019t it help with and have you had many side effects?\n\nWhat\u2019s not helpful: telling me to think positive, or that I\u2019m lucky to have had meds that work.

In high school I went to a neurologist for it, and he wanted me to do a sleep study, but my parents didn\u2019t have the funds at the time so that never happened. I\u2019ve always lived with people so if I do forget my alarm (which is rare since I know the consequences), someone\u2019s bee there to wake me up after 14ish hours.\nRn I live with my boyfriend and he\u2019s on vacation and my family lives in another state. So I fell asleep last night without setting an alarm, and there was no one here to wake me up. I fell asleep around 8pm (I have a normal sleep schedule of 8pm-5am). And I didn\u2019t wake up until 2pm today when cops were banging on my front and back door, which according to them they had been doing off and on for several minutes while they waited for the okay to break down the door.\nSo me sleeping 19 hours (when you figure in daylight savings time) caused basically a whole search for me among my family, friends, work, neighborhood security, and the cops. My dad didn\u2019t hop onto his flight for a business trip because he thought he may have to take one to get to me, and my boyfriend was looking for tickets home when I called.\n\nSo needless to say, I need to figure out what is going with my sleep so this doesn\u2019t happen again.

This is all just casual curiosity. I would've gone for a science degree if I wasn't asleep all the time. Emory University is studying the possibility of a problem with GABA in IH patients. There are patients who have successfully been treated with flumazenil, which reverses benzodiazepines like narcan. A couple days ago, I thought to look up benzo side effects, both regular and long-term, and also found abuse signs. I realized I have almost all benzo side effects and even some mild abuse symptoms but I've never even touched them. \n\nSo basically what I'm looking for is people with similar IH symptoms. I don't need any personal info except age of onset. I'm just looking for correlations. I think this is a separate hypersomnia that hasn't been discovered yet. The only way it might be used is as an anonymous mention if I get around to typing out my notes, which will still be kept confidential. A few of these symptoms will be consistent with all IH. \n\nDiagnosed IH with:\n\n**Extreme caffeine withdrawals. Crashing for  several days after having caffeine\n\n**long sleep time, 10+ hours at night, 3+ hour naps\n\n**don't respond to modafinil or narcolepsy meds much, or at all. Even sleeping deeper while taking them\n\n**crashes or flares\n\n**headaches, especially with less sleep\n\n**noticeable period where IH worsened or progressed and didn't go back to normal. \n\n\u2022short sleep latency\n\n\u2022regular sleep hallucinations and auto behavior\n\n\u2022what was your age of onset or when did symptoms start? Usually different from diagnosis age. \n\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who can answer! I've just been getting sick of doctors saying \"I don't know\" for so long, and I'm sure everyone else is too.

I have been suffering from hypersomnia for like 5 6 months now. It came suddenly out of the blue one day and never really went away, I don't remember being this sleepy person. No matter how much I sleep I'm always feeling like I have not slept for 2 days and it sucks, my eyes feel like a burden and it's like I want to leave everything and just sleep. Also when I wake up I'm sweating and feeling very cold. I feel goosebumps, idk why. I feel like closing my eyes and just lay down. It's the worst feeling ever. That pain is indescribable. \nMy parents said you're on your own, we ain't doing anything for this because this is not a disease, you are just lazy. I sleep for 7 8 or more but I'm still feeling the same. I'm not able to do anything, I can't walk or study because I feel sleepy. I went to a psychiatrist and he gave me medication but I don't think anything happened. I feel like ending my life because everyone is living their life to the fullest and I'm dying. In between I felt good for 2 3 days, it was like I had control over my damn sleep but then again it became worse. Will it get worse day by day? How do you guys cope up, what's your story. I'm very hopeless at this point because I don't have anywhere to go. I think if I end this all it'll be okay because everyone's sayin this fucking disease has no cure or medicine. And that moda drug is dangerous and develops resistance over time. Maybe this is my destiny. But if you guys share your story maybe something will happen. People are happy :) but I'm miserable. Maybe life isn't for everyone mates. :\") I'm so depressed I can't explain in words. My parents hate me. I got no friends. And now this.

So far blood tests of various type and MRI didn't show anything wrong].\n\nIs there any scientific data that would discuss diet in relationship to hypersomnia? I have multiple food intolances, that paired with my preferences results in high-carb diet (even if it includes a lot of veggies and \"good carbs\"). After reading a post here about food coma, I decided to see if change in my diet would make any difference. \n\nSo, today I cooked some steamed veggies and mushrooms for my breakfast. Added curd cheese, mayo, low carb rusks and a cup of tea (technically fruit infusion, but yes). I wasn't enjoying myself a ton, but daaamn. The result was pretty spectacular! If normally my sleepiness can go up to 8-9/10 after breakfast, this time it was maybe reaching 3/10 at worst. After few hours I did take a nap (I slept about 5-6h at night), but overall I felt more alert and awake throughout the day. This is absolutely anegdocal evidence, but maybe the same change would improve your situation. Might be worth a shot, right?

I yelp and brush the spider away (gently of course), when my partner who was sitting in bed beside me asks \"what's wrong?\" \nI tell him there was a spider crawling across our sheets, to which he playfully responded \"...is it a REAL spider?\" And he asked me questions to make sure I was actually awake. I found humor in the fact that this was such a common occurance, that when for the first time I found a REAL spider in my bed, my long-term partner wasn't sure it was real. I have so many funny stories about the weird things I've done in my sleep!\n\nRecently, I was reading whatever scientific articles i could find for IH, and among them it was often stated that parasomnias are common symptoms in those with IH, but it is possible to have IH without the parasomnias. This kind of got me wondering...\n\nWhen I experience hallucinations and/or confusional arousal, I don't remember them. At most, I might get this vague feeling, or instinct, that something odd has happened, but don't have much memory on what I might have seen. The best way I can describe it is \"something doesn't feel right...\" When I get these feelings, I'll ask my partner if he witnessed anything the other night, and the answer is usually dependent on whether or not he was awake. Sometimes, I don't even have that feeling of vagueness, and in the morning my partner will be like \"you did the WEIRDEST thing last night\" and I'll burst out laughing at his testimony, because i truthfully have ZERO memory of ANY of that! \n\nI've never personally experienced sleep paralysis though, but I have friends without IH who experience sleep paralysis fairly regularly, and it seems like your memory is working during these episodes. So I'm mostly curious about parasomnias besides sleep paralysis. \n\nSo my question to those who have IH without parasomnias:\n\n1. Do you sleep alone, or next to a partner or family member? \n\n2. If you do sleep by yourself, and have IH without parasomnias, how do you know you don't experience them?\n\nMy parasomnias have been around since I was ~11/12, so before I began sharing a bed with my partner, I was sharing a bedroom with my siblings who witnessed my sleep activities. (Id also frequently nap on the carpet immediately after school, in front of the whole family)\n\nIf it weren't for my family members or my partner, I would have never known about the things I do in my sleep, and I might have passed off any vague memories of my hallucinations as bad dreams.\n\nReally, REALLY interested to hear everyone's answers and experiences!!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 2372, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Those who have parasomnias, do you have any funny stories to share?

However, I'm too fucking twitchy, so I don't sleep through alarms and I don't sleep in public places.\n\nI'm a very light sleeper, I have trouble sleeping anywhere that isn't home. Vacations are fun and exhausting because I don't sleep for three days. In my first sleep study I slept about 5 hours, second about 5 hours 30. All less than required 6 hours. \n\nSo I'm like 85, 90% hypersomnia. I've just got this little puzzling bit that keeps me from getting the sleep study results. My last doctor (neurologist) was like \"oh well\" and tried nothing.\n\nI found a new doctor (also a neurologist). I think he's an ass. He told me I can't possibly have hypersomnia, I didn't present like a hypsersomnia patient, I was too alert, and someone with hypersomnia would never have trouble sleeping. OK, I'm sleeping 12 hours a day and I feel exhausted all day long and I struggle to function. What do I have? \"Oh, depression.\" Our entire discussion was focused on my sleep and tired, we didn't talk at all about my personal life, how I spend my time, my job, literally anything. So neat to make a diagnosis with no evidence?????? Wondering if there's a new definition of depression where you are happy and content in life and enjoy your hobbies and sleep too much? No? Ok then.\n\nHe then berated me for not caffeinating myself and taking caffeine pills all day. I ventured that didn't seem healthy and he dismissed me. Eventually he said maybe he could prescribe me some modafinil off label because I don't have a sleep study. Oh, he berated me for those, too. He said a) I could get another sleep study with him, b) He could give me the modafinil and then I could come for a sleep study, or c) he could give me modafinil and I could go around insurance and he didn't like that but he would do it \"for a while\".\n\nLook, I've already spent almost $4,500 on sleep studies. I'm not eager to do this horrible thing, again, for no results, because it will be the same, because it's always the same.\n\nI've been on it for almost a week and it's so amazing. That constant fog has lifted, I can think clearly, I feel like a human again. I have so much time now that I'm not sleeping half the day away. I have actual energy, I feel like maybe I could even exercise! Wow! Of course, \"at some point\" he won't give me the meds anymore.\n\nIH is a bit of a \"anything leftover goes in the bucket\" diagnosis. There's not a clear diagnostic, like a blood test or anything. Even the MSLT has a shitty test-retest reliability, like 40% without looking it up.

I tend to crash hard around 3 pm, and i take the modafinil at 9am. I feel like i\u2019m at my wits end. I am having trouble in college, in my relationship, and with my mental health. The brain fog is so severe it feels like i\u2019m dreaming all day, barely having memories or thoughts. i am truly a zombie and it\u2019s difficult to live like this.\n\nWhat is your experience with modafinil and brain fog? Have you noticed any visual symptoms along with the brain fog? What sort of things helped your brain fog. \n\nIf you took the time to read or answer thank you, i feel like i\u2019m losing my mind and my mental health has taken a sharp decline.

Is it annoying to stop five times a day to put cream on? Yes, but it beats the alternative, either sleeping the day away or having severe side effects from the stimulants. (For context for what follows, I'm turning 20 in just over a month; symptoms started just before my 18th birthday.)\n\nMy problem is the sleep inertia. No matter what alarm clock I use, no matter what method I use to wake up, I just can't help but fall back to sleep and continue sleeping the day away. I have taken medication before going back to sleep, and it just won't wake me up. We've tried some pretty creative medicines (well, I suppose everything is off-label for IH, and an antibiotic of all things is one of the big treatment options), and apparently a new medication just hit the market that's a stimulant but at a low-enough dose my doc wants to give it a try. \n\nI've had plenty of other medical issues in my life which I won't go into here, but having something which is idiopathic and which I feel I'm coping with rather than actually treating is new to me.\n\nAs you might expect, the sleep inertia is impacting my schooling heavily. I was in a post-high school collegiate-level program when symptoms started, and I took a year off to get treatment (my school actually threatened to throw me out even after I got my diagnosis). Sleep inertia was much better in the summer with lots of sunlight streaming through the windows (I'm from the South), but now I'm in New York in stress-filled freshman-year of college (biomedical engineering) and the sunlight's just not cutting it. (School is aware of my IH and is cutting me some slack, but I'm can't help but feel like there's eventually a point at which they'll say enough is enough.)\n\nI don't know anybody IRL with any sort of sleep disorder beyond sleep apnea (which, naturally, is a lot easier to treat than this ridiculousness), so I tend to talk with my parents about these issues. My mom has the opposite problem - insomnia - and my dad can function on about two hours of sleep it seems. Ironically, it's my dad who I have an easier time talking to about this, because while he still doesn't fully understand the disorder he's very empathetic. My mom, who I'd expect to understand the struggles of staying awake all day, is very much \"you don't need that medication, you just need to get up and get going.\" No, it doesn't work that way, Mom. (You can call her Karen if you want; she is a baby boomer, but at least she encourages me to get my vaccines. Yes I'm taking these medications anyway; I'm over 18 and insurance is paying for everything, so there's zero harm to them in my following doctor's advice. Here's hoping whenever the pharmacy gets this new prescription in that it'll work.)\n\nI know that I'm doing everything I can and eventually there will be an end in sight, but on an emotional level I still feel bad that I'm not meeting all my responsibilities. If friends ask how I'm doing, that they haven't seen me around in a while (ones that I don't share afternoon classes with), I just tell them I'm sick or something; surprisingly few people IRL actually understand the pain of something like this.\n\nI'm on antidepressants anyway to counter the side effects of the flumazenil (xyrem is literally the only thing we haven't tried yet, and that's even more likely to make me depressed), but all the stress both school and this condition are causing me are getting to be a bit much. And...I'm the kind of guy who, when depressed, would rather sit in my dark dorm room eating potato chips and browsing Reddit and YouTube all day (no NSFW) until my depression magically goes away than actually trying to roll out of bed and do stuff (unless I have a class to make, in which case I just sulk in the back of the classroom instead).\n\nIn my random Reddit browsing I found this community, so I thought I'd post my story here. If nothing else, it's nice having people to talk to who understand what I'm going through.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1274, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Really suffering with IH and need some support", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1569620210, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/d9qdob/really_suffering_with_ih_and_need_some_support/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tallmattuk", "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "56de33b2-a13b-11e8-86fb-0ec44c28c910", "author_flair_text": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12j4j3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1569274024, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/d8d7me/ih_social_in_manchester_uk_26th_oct_2019_2pm/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d8d7me", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/d8d7me/ih_social_in_manchester_uk_26th_oct_2019_2pm/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1569274025, "score": 6, "selftext": "Meeting up at the Foundation coffee house, Lever st, in the Northern corner.

But basically about a bit under a year ago around My 17th birthday I started having extreme sleepiness. I got medical attention very fast as I had a history with depression and panic disorder and had regular appointments with a psychiatric nurse. I slept for 16 hours each night and I couldn't be woken up. I started missing school a lot I've completed 4 courses and I'm too sleepy to think straight most of the time. I'm in a STEM school and I can't do any tasks related to maths, physics and chemistry because they often require a lot of thinking and problem solving which has become impossible all of the sudden. Eversince the symptoms starting I've started sleeping an average of ~12 hours per night with a lot of daytime sleepiness and I couldn't be woken up. I had all possible tests done and I recently had a sleep polygraphy done. Guess what. Everything came out fucking normal... The doctors have been suspecting idiopathic hypersomnia but their hesitant to diagnose me with anything because the sleep polygraphy was as normal as it could be and every other test has come back normal aswell. But I've done 4 courses in my upper secondary school during the time of my symptoms withing 4 periods when the excpected rate to finish courses is 6 courses per period whilst I'm completing an average of 1 course per period. At this pace I'll graduate in 6 years. I can't get shit done every test ever comes out normal. How am I supposed to do anything with my life. Even when I get to school with 12 hours of sleep I still fall asleep during classes or am too tired to do anything. Caffeine also doesn't do anything I once had 5 cups of coffee before an exam even tho I rarely drink coffee. Still feel asleep mid exam.

I've been in the field for about 13 years. My workplace recently changed the scheduling structure, sort-of mandating that we see clients for half an hour each, instead of the traditional \"clinical hour\" (50 minutes). I don't know that that is exactly the straw that broke the camel's back - though seeing between 11 and 13 people a day with significant traumas, up from between 5-7, is an extra workload - but whatever the case, I'm feeling the hurt. A lot of exhaustion, more than usual.) (Okay, not so brief.)\n\nMy questions for the hive mind here:\n\n1. What general workplace accommodations have people requested?\n2. Do you have any ideas specific to my job that I could consider?\n3. Could you share your experience of the whole process with me?\n\nI'm pretty nervous about taking this step. I've always kept it hidden from employers. (My time in session with clients has always been one of the few situations/environments I could rely on to not fall asleep. It's strange but true. And fortunate, since I'd be a garbage psychotherapist if I fell asleep listening to clients!)

The technician's cologne! My instructions said to not wear fragrant deodorant or perfume/cologne, yet the first tech. was drenched in it. Made a note on the feedback form - my allergies were not happy.\n2. Sooo, I had three different technicians working with me. I was initially told it would only be 2; ended up having to repeat myself a few times since each one asked nearly identical questions.\n3. The technicians wouldn't stop slamming doors or talking to the other patient that was present.\n4. Because of the aforementioned conversations with my fellow sleep study subject, the main tech. didn't shut off the blindingly bright fluorescent tube lights until after 11 pm. It took me a while to fall asleep since the wires still needed to be checked on both of us, resulting in more late-night door slamming.\n5. There was construction at the hospital across the street during the napping part and I overheard the phone ringing quite frequently.\n6. The walls were apparently super thin because I also heard the entire conversation next door the prior night. Not only that, but I could hear two of the technicians discussing the other patient and laughing about him. Unprofessional, right?\n\nAnyway, overall, I was happy to have slept 6 or so hours at night - my last study was very inaccurate due to GI upset and the resultant 2 hours or so of sleep. Thankfully, the bed and pillows weren't bad. Mainly, I'm just annoyed that my usual symptoms didn't present, but, from having read other posts, I won't stress too much about it affecting the diagnosis. I still suffer at home and my partner can attest to the effects of my excessive sleepiness, as well as a couple parasomnias. I came to the conclusion that this long-distance air-travel-like experience affected my normal routine in a few ways: \n\n\\- I had my day-to-day indigestion/acid reflux issues causing some discomfort, which also made it difficult to eat in between lying down. Because I didn't eat very much, I felt tired and wired at the same time.

One thing it hasn't changed, though, is the sleep drunkenness and depth of slumber I experience when either deliberately trying to \"nap\" or accidentally falling asleep. My neuro and I established a while ago that I cannot take normal, short naps, unless I'm planning to remain asleep for a few hours. When I was a kid, I was a lighter sleeper and ready to go as soon as I was up. Now, my partner can't rouse me - I won't hear him or the alarm. When, or if, someone succeeds in waking me before the 3 or so hour-mark, I have a difficult time staying awake. It's a lot like being on a sedative. Specifically, it brings to mind the sedation I endured while on Amitriptyline, which was prescribed for GI reasons before my cholecystectomy. Does anybody else have problems with this? It's taken years for me to finally get a nap study appointment and I'm not sure if it is IH or something else.

I have not been officially diagnosed with IH yet (still pending a MLST/PST) but visited a sleep specialist yesterday who advised me that he thinks I probably have both Narcolepsy 2 (w/o Cataplexy) and IH. After doing a bit of reading on IH, it feels like a lightbulb has gone off - I am so relieved that there is actually a name and a potential diagnosis for this thing that I have been struggling with for the past 3+ years. But I am also absolutely terrified that there is no cure and this may be something I have to live with for the rest of my life.\n\nA bit of life/medical background: my boyfriend suicided 4 years ago and since then I have been on desvenlafaxine for depression. I have experienced sleep issues since then, with them progressively getting worse until for the past 6 months I have been feeling suicidal over my constant tiredness and anxiety about not being able to show up to work on time. After my boyfriend died, I went through about 12 months of major depression and sleep issues which in turn affected my ability to work - my workplace was initially supportive but after about 6 months of flexible working and going part time, told me that it was becoming an issue for them. I increased my working hours and threw myself back into work but several months later when my workplace went through a huge restructuring, I was told that my position was being made redundant HOWEVER, they would keep me on a 6 month fixed contract to cover for someone for Maternity leave. I was told that prior to my contract finishing they would assess the possibility or making me permanent again. At a regular monthly meeting with my manager, I asked what the reasons were for my being made redundant and what I could do to improve my skills/Performance. I was told it was not an issue of my performance but the fact that I was simply \u201cunreliable\u201d due to my mental illnesses. My manager told me she had considered firing me at several points due to my inability to be at work, but this was never communicated to me during the six months. I was absolutely devastated by this - even during my mental illness when I was was unable to be present full time, I had still remained one of the highest performers/call takers in my team and had great customer feedback. I always turned around my work promptly and knowing that my redundancy was solely based on my illness was soul destroying and I felt very cheated that HR (ironic because I worked in the HR dept) had not communicated the seriousness to me during my illness. I felt the fixed term contract was a way for my work to see if my illness had stabilised before making the decision to keep me permanently. Subsequently, I found another job (which I love) and quit.\n\nMy new job is full time and for the first year I was pretty much able to work the hours without major issues. On occasional days I would wake up exhausted (usually after a night of vivid dreams) and call in sick or arrive late - stating that I had issues with my sleep or a migraine to cover myself. I had stopped going to the gym because I was too fatigued (prior to my boyfriends death I would go 5 days a week). I often addressed my sleep issues with my doctor but was told that my fatigue, long sleeps and naps were a result of my depression. In the past 6 months, my sleep has become unmanageable. No matter how long I sleep, I am always exhausted - 5 hrs, 8 hrs, 12 hours - it\u2019s never enough. I nap whenever I get a chance and if the opportunity arises, I can nap for 3-4 hours. Getting up in the morning has become impossible and I just snooze alarms without really being aware of what I\u2019m doing or the consequences. Again, I thought it was my depression rearing it\u2019s ugly head due to some stresses in my current relationship - I started seeing a psychologist again/increasing my medication but I began noticing that even as I resolved issues and my mood seemed stable, my sleep was not improving. However, my anxiety was through the roof due to my inability to show up to work on time/work full days - a lot of this anxiety relates to my previous workplace experience with mental health issues &amp; \u201cinvisible\u201d illnesses.\n\nI went to my doctor a few weeks ago in tears to talk about my sleep and I felt he was just exasperated and brushed me off. He said it must be sleep apnoea because I am overweight (I have put on almost 30kg in the past 4 years) and I snore softly. He referred me for an at home sleep test. After discussing my concerns with my psychologist, she brought up the possibility of narcolepsy and suggested I get a second opinion - which led me to seeing a sleep specialist.\n\nI\u2019m not able to have my sleep test until 18th of October (only one public hospital in my city does it so there\u2019s a long wait list, even with me going private). I\u2019m concerned about the next couple of months and communicating my issues to my workplace until I get an official diagnosis and can look at medication. I live alone during the weeks (my current partner works Fly in Fly Out and is only home weekends) so don\u2019t have any help getting me out of bed. My questions for all of you are:\n\n- how do you manage full time work and getting up in the morning? Any tips?\n- how do you talk about your condition with your workplace? Do you share it with your colleagues? I have one particular colleague who I think is really bothered by my current absences.\n- how do I communicate my needs to my boss? Have any of you changed start times/working hours? Does working flexibly from home help so that you can sleep if need be?\n- I am feeling so guilty and scared that everyone will think I am just lazy (if I do indeed have IH). How do you deal with these feelings and perceptions?\n- How do you manage doing household chores/tasks after work and on weekends, and balance this with having a social life? I have not been able to do things I enjoy for so long (like go for walks or to the gym) because I am exhausted and constantly thinking about how I\u2019d rather have a nap.\n- coping with tiredness - how do you combat this or is it best just to sleep?\n\nI know this is a long post, but I am so anxious and at the end of my tether! I am so scared of losing my job, my colleagues hating me and my boss thinking I am hopeless. I\u2019m at the point where I am thinking of resigning but the problem is, I love my job and I know it is really crucial for mainting my mental health - I get a lot more depressed when I can\u2019t be at work. I feel like I am stuck in a vicious cycle. I just needed to vent and ask all those unknown questions from others who have been through what I am going through.

Even when I felt \"normal\" I would have gotten sleepy in this environment, but now?! Holy hell, I had no chance, just repeatedly dozing off in my chair. Afterward, I went to my boss, who knows I've been in this hell of seeking a diagnosis and being so tired. I asked her what she wants me to do the next time this happens, as it likely will. She said she'd need to think about it and get back to me. Today, about a week later, she told me that she wants me to work on getting medical documentation for accomodations through HR. \n\nThat's...not what I was thinking. Like, I meant does she want me to get up and walk around to stay awake, or excuse myself and get coffee to see if that helps. Has anyone else navigated this? Did HR actually help?

New here, and don't officially have a diagnosis of IH, but it's the strongest possibility my sleep doc has right now. I'll try to share as much info as I can along with my questions, if that helps. I'm 29/F. \n\nBackground info: \n\n* As a kid, I could sleep pretty much any time, anywhere. I used to nap on the school bus, on the floor at my grandparent's business, in the library. I was really hard to wake, my mom would have to take the blankets and come in multiple times to get me up for school. I sometimes fell asleep in class in high school and college. I've had a couple scary moments of nearly dozing while driving (maybe 5-7x in 4 years), but always at night. \n* I've had hypnopompic hallucinations for at least a decade -waking from sleep to a visual hallucination. Usually scary/weird things like aliens coming down (from a panel on the ceiling), or a dragon with blinking red eyes (smoke detector), or seeing objects, animals, or people in the room. Sometimes I sit up, talk, or even get out of bed to react to them. If I stare at it long enough, it resolves into normalcy, and I go back to sleep. I saw a doctor about it in 2012 or so, and he referred to a sleep study for parasomnia. Then I moved cities and never got around to it. They didn't mess with my sleep too much, and weren't every night, so I've just sort of dealt. \n* I had a kid in September of 2016. Healthy pregnancy and delivery, nothing out of the ordinary. Now my sleep hallucinations occasionally involve my son, like seeing him with a bloody mangled foot in his bed, or seeing a stranger holding him in the doorway of my room. He now sleeps completely through the night, and has for a while. \n* Big life changes in the past year. We moved in July 2017, I got a new job, and shortly thereafter our area dealt with a major natural disaster. New job is ok, but I'm not thriving and we have literally no friends here. So, lots of emotional load, if that makes sense. \n* In about February, I started experiencing extreme fatigue. Stuff like - Falling asleep at work a few times; getting lightheaded doing normal things like singing to my kiddo or standing up; needing a nap to get through a work day; going to bed at 7 PM, waking at 7 AM, and still feeling tired. I also had a massive increase in the amount of hallucinations and sleepwalking. Nearly every night for about three weeks I would do one or the other. I saw two different doctors and a counselor. Tested for mono twice, negative. Full blood panel for all the usual stuff, normal. Neither primary doc nor counselor thought mental health related. Since then, the fatigue has come and gone, with good weeks and bad weeks. \n* I had the Nexplanon implant for birth control from Feb 2017 - April 2018. I did some research and saw they recommend seeing your doctor if you experience sleep disturbances or fatigue. Had it removed. Currently not on any birth control, but no chance I am pregnant. \n* I have never experienced sleep paralysis or cataplexy. \n\nSo, my primary care doc referred me for a sleep study. Results: \n\nNo snoring, AHI 5.7/hour. \"Electromyographic tonus was elevated during multiple epochs of REM, and more notable in the later REM stages.\" (He said this was mostly in my chin, and he wants to keep an eye on it because it can be an indicator of later Parkinson's). No parasomnia activity that night. \n\nMSLT - slept all 4 naps, Mean Sleep Latency of 4.6 minutes, no REM. Doc described as \"markedly abnormal\" but the no REM essentially rules out narcolepsy. He recommended pursuing possible treatment, but also said that all other possible causes of fatigue and hypersomnia should be ruled out. He didn't diagnose IH, but said it's the best possibility with what we know now, and that I will likely need to do more sleep studies over time. \n\nAt this time, I am beginning fluoxetine to treat anxiety (and the possibility of IH doesn't help that...) and holding off on any stimulants for sleepiness. If it is IH, I figure I have a lifetime to try drugs for it... \n\n\nSo, questions. And thanks if you've made it this far. \n\nWhat was the onset of IH like for you? Over what period of time did it show up? What was the progression like? \n\nIs it possible my sleep doc is holding off on a diagnosis because it will mean I have a pre-existing condition, and health insurance law is getting worse? Or is that my anxiety / paranoia talking? \n\nI've read a number of people's stories on here, and it seems like what's going on with me is different, and not nearly so severe most days. But, is that just how it starts? Should I expect things to go downhill? \n\nThe sleep doc also suggested REM Behavior Disorder as a possibility. Anyone also have that or any experience with it? It has a strong overlap with Parkinson's  and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). My grandmother had DLB, as did Robin Williams. See look you learned something by slogging through this giant anxious post. \n\nAll advice appreciated, happy to answer any clarifying questions.

I was diagnosed with IH a little less than a year ago. Long story short, I always struggled with not falling asleep and with other various symptoms. Once I started to get in trouble at work for it, I decided it was time to see a doctor. After the diagnosis, I was put on modafinil, which for the most part, has helped alleviate some of the more severe symptoms, but it is not doing as well as I had hoped, which I will bring up at my next appointment.  \n\nI ran across an article about narcolepsy and the possible benefits the keto diet could have and started looking into it. From what I've found (from reliable sources, I can follow up later if anyone is interested, I'm typing this out at work right now), it is very beneficial for epileptical children and it has been theorized to possibly have beneficial effects for other neurological disorders (like narcolepsy, which seems to be the starting point for treating IH since its closely related). So after looking more into what exactly it is, how it affects the body, possible dangers, and the testimonial from non-epileptic people who have other neurological disorders, I figured why the fuck not, let's give it a go for a little while. \n\nSo I was curious, have any of you tried something like this along with medication to get symptoms under control or at least some semblance thereof? Has it helped at all? \n\n(I'm aware of the fact a lot of people consider it a fad diet or a trendy diet, which is why I've been digging into it so much. Since it is considered a legitimate way to help with at least one kind of neurological problem, I figured there might be some substance behind it and that it was worth at least looking into.) \n\nTL;DR Has anyone ever tried the Ketogenic Diet to help alleviate IH symptoms?

Also I apologize in advance for the formatting because I am on mobile. \n\nI will start from the beginning. I had sleep issues that consistently got worse as the years went on so I decided to ask my doctor about getting a sleep study done. After the first sleep study they couldn\u2019t find anything so I wasn\u2019t diagnosed with anything. Several months, maybe a year even I asked again and this time they had me do an in home sleep study. \n\nThe doctor diagnosed me with obstructive sleep apnea and I was prescribed a CPAP machine. This did help to the point where I didn\u2019t feel like I was going to fall asleep while driving anymore but unfortunately it wasn\u2019t the only thing ailing me. \n\nFast forward about half a year I am still having significant sleep issues and I had a sleep titration done which the doctor now had my CPAP set to a constant 12 pressure. This doesn\u2019t seem to do much either. \n\nAnother few months go by and the doctor decides to test me for narcolepsy. During the day portion of this test I was able to fall asleep on command within 2-6 minutes. But the diagnosis was that I did not have narcolepsy. \n\nThe doctor stated my official diagnosis was IH and put me on 2x a day 200mg modafinil. Since being placed on this medication I have felt great. I\u2019m still tired here and there but I can focus and not doze off at work etc. and I just feel normal again for the most part. I am so much more productive and happier as well. \n\nI would like to add that the doctor stated there were no further tests he could do to determine the actual issue that is causing me to have consistent excessive day time sleepiness. He also stated that during my sleep titration from before that I did in fact sleep and there did not seem to be any issues after the pressure was set to 12. \n\nI know there is some other underlying issue going on and I am at a loss for what to do or who to go to next to figure out the real issue at hand. I\u2019m not asking for medical advice but if any of you have ever had a similar experience or have any advice in my next course of action I would deeply appreciate it. \n\nIf it helps any I live in Texas, USA. I am also male 26 years of age and I am a little overweight. 5\u20197 and 241lbs.

I have some experiences I want to share and see if others can relate to them and/or share their own experiences so I can get a better idea of this condition and if my symptoms may fit. I am currently waiting on a sleep study approval, but in the meantime I'm just trying to get a better understanding of the possibilities.\n\nMy fatigue seems to express itself in something of a wave. I'll have low periods and high periods lasting weeks or months, but my fatigue is very seldom not present. I'll maybe only have 10 days a year where I actually feel what I believe is \"normal\" energy. My \"high periods\" are just less tired periods. I regularly wake up feeling unrefreshed and often more tired and foggy than when I went to bed.\n\nOne very particular thing I've noticed with my fatigue is that it seems after about 5-6 hours of being awake I regularly experience a hard crash forcing me to take a nap if I have any hope of being productive the rest of the day. This nap isn't even guaranteed to help, as sometimes I will feel worse upon waking than I did before; although, these naps generally are more likely to be refreshing for me than my nighttime sleep.\n\nIn general, I just don't have the energy consistently to maintain very basic things like working out regularly or even maintaining my living space to the degree that I would like. Every time it feels like things are starting to go well (i.e. I'm tired but I have enough energy to at least maintain things and start looking to the future) it only lasts a month at most and I find myself dropped down into a bout of fatigue that can last months at times.\n\nAlso, as a bit of a side point I guess, do any of you know how to articulate your fatigue to other people? It's gotten to feel kind of invalidating at this point to have try and re-explain how I feel and how debilitating it is to people. Most people don't really seem to be able to understand and it's kind of annoying to be told it's \"just a rut\" or that I just need to work out regularly or find more structure in life when I'm trying to explain to them that I want those things more than anything but just don't have the energy consistently enough to maintain it. To me, it feels almost like telling someone with a broken leg they just need to do jumping jacks every day to get their leg stronger. I know that it generally comes from a good place but it just gets depressing to not be able to get others to relate or understand.\n\nThanks for any and all comments!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3091, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Sharing My Experiences and Seeing if Others Relate", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ops7nc/sharing_my_experiences_and_seeing_if_others_relate/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "emilyallisonp", "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "56de33b2-a13b-11e8-86fb-0ec44c28c910", "author_flair_text": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_116jg5ge", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626969690, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/opgtl7/allergy_trouble/", "gildings": {}, "id": "opgtl7", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1dc256e2-a17e-11e8-9e9a-0e976fd50694", "link_flair_text": "Medication", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/opgtl7/allergy_trouble/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1626969702, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi all, I have terrible allergies but I cannot seem to find anything that I can take that will not make me drowsy.

Reddit to the rescue lol\n\nJust alil random bits about me that may be used as context in my rant(itll probably be confusing and I don't expect anyone to actually read it but if you happen to be reading it then cool thanks:) )\nI'm a senior in college who has been dealing with IH for what feels like my whole life. I've always been a napper and always felt like I needed to sleep but it really became an issue around my middle school years. Around that time as well I began to develop severe depression and generalized anxiety(clinically diagnosed) with a brief period of anorexic tendencies/thoughts(brief period being the time I actually pursued unhealthy habits to lose weight although those thoughts still sometimes linger but aren't nearly as bad). Sophomore year I attempted suicide (with the naive intent of OD-ing on sleeping medication that I would later find out, was essentially just benadryl). That same year I checked myself into the psychiatric hospital again(first being attempted suicide/non optional stay) for fear that I would attempt suicide a second time.\n Since around 8th grade I've been on and off medications but nothing works quite right. Junior year of highschool is when I was diagnosed with IH after taking a couple of sleep tests. No medication has really worked for me either(surprise surprise), they are really just there to aid in my sleepiness.\nI am an animal science major and HAD aspirations of becoming a vet. Reality hit last semester and I decided to go to grad school instead to pursue research. I'm currently working 3 part time jobs(2 lab jobs that have very few and irregular hours) and another that I've worked at for over 4 1/2 years where I just get 8 hours a week due to covid store hour(now permit) changes. I have 4 cats, 3 rats and 3 ferrets. 1 of my rats has chromic respiratory issues and has probably almost died twice now because it this. 1 of my ferrets was recently diagnosed with insulinoma while a couple years back she was diagnosed with adrenal disease. Vet bills are high but my love for them is even higher:'). Today my psychiatrist told me for probably the 3rd or 4th time that I should get rid of them/give them away or something I don't really know. Obviously she has no pets of her own and said I shouldn't have to deal with those large responsibilities which may be true but I'm not about to dump my fur babies into some other, possibly horrid pet owners hands when I know I give them the best possible care and I do a damn good job because I love them.\n\nWith all that info that probably may not even relate to half of what imma say,,,, here we go\n\nI just want to start of by saying since a year or so ago I have been so upset by the realization that the world doesn't accommodate for illnesses. Everything, every rule, every guideline, everything in society is based off the assumption that everyone/anyone it applies to is a perfectly \"normal\" \"healthy\" \"illness free\" human being. Atleast that is what it feels like. Sure there are accomodations for school, parking etc but why does it make me feel different? Not normal? Like I'm \"special\" in a bad way. You would think that with the amount of people in this world that have a disability or an illness, there would be more variety in accomodations. You'd think it wouldn't single you out or make you feel alone or different. I didnt realize how common disabilities really were until I took my first college course which was public speaking. Half of the students wrote an informative speech about either their disability or a family members disability. I was in shock at how many people also struggled like me. I was surprised because everyone looked \"normal\" and then I realized I was just like everyone else, assuming people were \"normal\". Idk where any of this was going but this is something that has been upsetting to me for awhile. It was particularly upsetting when I realized that vet school was likely not possible for me. I was determined to make it happen but when I spoke with someone who worked in admissions, she quickly blew out any fire and drive I had in me to make it work. I can have certain accomodations but there are requirements when it comes to the amount coursework/load/classes you need to take and the time frame for completion. She told me that I should reconsider because of my disability. I had asked if part time was a thing for vet school and that was her response. I understand its a hard job and you need to learn a lot but why is it required that you spend every waking moment studying and learning? Most vet students spend so little time sleeping. I cant be successful in vet school because I require more sleep? Because my brain can sometimes be a little slower from brain fogginess? It didn't seem fair that the ONLY way I could pursue my dream was if I was \"normal\". I also had a couple of vets tell me the same thing..\nAnother thing that upsets me is that NOBODY understands. Unless you live with IH, you can't possibly begin to understand how hard life can be a lot of the time. I feel like IH can be one of the worst invisible disabilities to try to explain to people because I cannot even tell you the amount of times someone has said to me \"oh yea I totally know how you feel\", \"I sleep all the time\", I love naps\", and the worst, \"oh yea I love sleeping. Maybe I have what you have\". Yes. I know, youre a college student who gets less sleep than most people our age should but that doesnt mean you understand. For them it's just staying up late and sleeping a few hours one night. For us/me it's sleeping all day and feeling tired. Sleeping the appropriate amount and feeling tired. Drinking coffee with no help(atleast for me, coffee does absolutely nothing). While I know it is always possible anyone else can have it, the way they.go about it is so infuriating and almost makes the disability sound like a joke. Like its not a big deal. That's the first impression I get from every single person I tell. They don't quite understand what IH does to you. I know that it's absolutely not the worst disease in the world, but it's one I wouldn't ever wish on anybody.\nAnother thing that goes along with that is sort of just like the teasing that comes from it. I joke about everything, it's a coping mechanism of mine so I don't mind the occasional joke about how \"oh well shes probably off sleeping somewhere\" or what have you but it really upsets me when the intellectual jokes hit. I know I'm not stupid. I know I'm smart. I've always been a good student and have always gotten good grades. I've always had a high GPA and high expectations for myself but deep down I have this little bit of insecurity that it's not just my IH making it hard for my brain to work, that it's just me. I struggle with brain fogginess a lot. It takes me sometimes double the amount of time it takes other students to take exams because I have to sit there and re-read question. When people talk to me, sometimes my brain isn't able to comprehend what they say. If something requires me to think critically or about something complex such as science, it makes the sleepiness worse, almost like my brain is running a lifelong marathon but that kind of effort is like making my brain sprint the marathon rather than jog it. I can't think quickly, games where you need to be quick, I'm often joked about being the slowest because my brain just can't process anything very fast. I feel like the amount of effort that I have to put into studying just to make the information stick isn't even worth it because it will just end up with me being asleep. This brings me back to the lack of accomodations. There isnt anything I can get other than extended time. \nThis causes so much stress and I already deal with severe mental health problems which depression and anxiety feed off of each other and make things 100x worse. I feel like on the outside I look \"normal\" and people expect so much of me but on the inside I'm this tangled jumbled up mess of thoughts and emotions and nothing makes sense even to me but nobody knows. Sometimes I just want to scream but what do I scream? Nothing in my head makes sense. It's just quick rapid waves of emotions and snips of thoughts that pass. But then I stop and think to myself that I'm overreacting and that I am fine and normal and I'm being dramatic and that I'm using my disability as an excuse or that I'm milking it for anything and everything I can get from having it. \n\n*Trigger warning-self harm*\n\nI started self harming back when I first started experiencing intense mental health issues. It quickly and silently became an addiction because it was the only thing that eased my pain and cleared my head and slowed my thoughts. I got so bad to where my legs were covered in scars. I'd self harm in the bathroom at school, then drive to work and while on the way, stop at a gas station and then sit in my car before going into work, then I would go in the bathroom at work, then back to self harming in my car after work, then in the bathroom of the gas station on my way home/to my former bfs house. Then at my house/former bfs house. Nobody but me knew but it was something I longed for.\n I haven't self harmed for nearly 4 years now. I stopped because of my current bf but I still, after 4 years, feel strong urges to self harm. Nobody knows how hard it can be for me sometimes but of course there is no way that they could because I dont want anyone to know.\n\n*End of trigger warning*\n\nMy dad treats me like shit and always has because he says I remind him of my mom from whom he is divorced. He expects me to be extremely successful while also putting me down at the same time. I live with my mom but she pretty much just lives with her bf so I'm by myself. My bf goes to school 3 hours away and when he comes back home he works full time and his mother makes a huge deal out of him spending all his time with me. I have friends but they live in town but also struggle with issues and they have their own lives to worry about. Sometimes I feel so alone but I know that I'm not. I'm struggling financially, despite having 3 jobs and I just don't know.\n\nIf you somehow managed to read to the end I'm genuinely impressed and sorry for the mess of a rant you just endured. I know this got way off topic from IH but it's just stuff thats been floating around in my head.\n\nOverall I know everything is going to be okay and that I'm loved and that if I need anything, so many people will help me out but it doesnt stop the feelings of loneliness. I feel alone in my journey of illnesses and I just wish so badly, that I could live a day free of disabilities. I feel like I have so much to offer. I have so much potential. I feel like I can do so many great things but my disabilities put a barrier between me and the finish line. I feel like even if I somehow manage to succeed, I'll end up failing because I wont be able to keep going once I've reached the top. Once I reach my goal, my dream job, future plans, I wont be able to  keep pushing through to maintain those goals. I'll lose my job, life etc. because of my disabilities. It often times just seems so pointless. Why stress and work so hard to be able to stress more and work harder for the rest of your life? I just wish I could go to sleep and wake up feeling rested for once ya know? Know other people struggle with this as well helps me feel a little less alone but I wish I KNEW more people like me.\n\nI hope everyone is having a good day and is managing their IH better than me\ud83d\udc97", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3034, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Vent/rant/random mixed up thoughts I need to get out", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ogjtfm/ventrantrandom_mixed_up_thoughts_i_need_to_get_out/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kcproblemsss", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1o0v2gaq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1625767762, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ogcv9b/tension_headaches_symptom_side_effect_or_unrelated/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ogcv9b", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "f5245e5c-0509-11e9-8cf7-0e8975bb3ebe", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ogcv9b/tension_headaches_symptom_side_effect_or_unrelated/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1625767773, "score": 1, "selftext": "Anyone else have constant daily relentless tension headaches?\n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s bc I clench my teeth from the stimulants or if I sleep on my neck funny or what but all day every day in addition to being exhausted I\u2019m also have a stiff, heavy, dull pain from my forehead down through my temples, through my jaw and neck, and into my shoulders/back. \n\nAny one else?

I chew a lot of gum to stay awake and try to take breaks where I walk around so I don\u2019t give in to the sleep but this isn\u2019t always possible.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 3025, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Staying awake at work", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/of36qu/staying_awake_at_work/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "beanbag1986", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1kntoqn2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1625521941, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/oeh8kq/trialling_armodafinil_eyes_flying_all_over_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "oeh8kq", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1dc256e2-a17e-11e8-9e9a-0e976fd50694", "link_flair_text": "Medication", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/oeh8kq/trialling_armodafinil_eyes_flying_all_over_the/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1625521952, "score": 1, "selftext": "My doctor is away for another 3 days.

because the fatigue was significant enough i had to leave mid-day and would sleep for five to six hours when i got home, for timeline purposes i just turned 20 yesterday, and i had to quit my job back in january of this year because i, at first, could no longer drive myself to work (about a ten minute drive for reference) and eventually could no longer adequately perform tasks at my job. now i struggle to drive even three minutes away to starbucks for a much needed triple shot latte and frequently have trouble standing at the stove to make breakfast, and standing in line anywhere is an anxiety inducing struggle to stay cognizant enough to check out my items. bonus points to anyone here who can relate to sitting down in the shower. im hoping during my upcoming neurology appointment my neuro will be open to prescribing flumazenil since modafinil was a bust like the stimulants i took years ago for adhd (the \"stepping on the gas with the parking break on\" metaphor is truly a perfect description) because im tired of feeling like im sitting in the backseat in my own head.\n\nthanks in advance for any replies, and i hope that one day everyone here can get the answers,

But today (actually two weeks ago I just haven\u2019t had a chance to post) I do! \n\nA little background: I have been dealing with all the usual IH symptoms for about 3 years, give or take. I am also in the military which makes some aspects easier and some much harder. I had my first sleep study done in December of 2018 and was diagnosed with sleep apnea. After a few months (around July 2019 I think) my sleep doctor decided we needed to do another overnight sleep study + an MSLT because the original one didn\u2019t make sense and the CPAP wasn\u2019t helping (spoiler alert: it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t have sleep apnea in the first place). That study (2nd overnight, 1st MSLT) came back with an average sleep latency of 3.5 minutes and REM in one nap, so I was diagnosed with IH. Life got honestly a lot easier with medication, though it\u2019s always been constantly adjusted to keep up with this shit show. The worst of my symptoms (or maybe hardest to deal with.. depending on who you ask. The military would choose this one tho) is difficulty waking up in the morning, and my doctor mentioned Xyrem ALL THE TIME.... then said I couldn\u2019t be prescribed it because I don\u2019t have narcolepsy. After about 6 months of this same conversation, he decided to do another sleep study + MSLT since I was so close to a narcolepsy diagnosis the first time. \n\nThat study was about a month or two or three ago (my memory is shit but it was recent ish). I had the appointment to go over the results two weeks ago. My average sleep latency was 1.5 minutes (even the man that specializes in sleep disorders sounded impressed by that) and I entered REM in all four naps (they ended it one nap early). \n\nSO all that to say, I have the narcolepsy diagnosis now and my Xyzal should be here within the next two weeks. I have high hopes, though I know that\u2019s dangerous and I\u2019m likely going to be disappointed. At least things for the military are slightly easier now, as no one knows (or really cares) what tf I\u2019m talking about when I say have IH but narcolepsy makes them stop in their tracks. \n\nSo anyway, if any of you all are on xyrem/ xyzal and have anything to share with me about it, please do!

I was a 19 year old student when I first exhibited excessive daytime sleepiness, extreme fatigue despite sleeping 13+ hrs at night and another 7hrs+ nap through the day on average. I had sleep paralysis when I woke up from naps, I would sleep through multiple alarms and wake up hours later and would wake up really disoriented and worse than before I had the nap. I couldn\u2019t concentrate at all and my memory was really bad. I was really scared about what was happening because I just wasn\u2019t in control and my mood was so low because I just wasn\u2019t functioning and so I went to my GP. They asked questions about my symptoms and mood etc. I have a family history of mental health disorders and they diagnosed me with depression. I tried various different standard antidepressants and nothing seemed to help my sleepy symptoms. \n\nI eventually resorted to google and after reading about what antidepressant treated excessive sleepiness, I came across Bupropion and so I spoke to my GP who really wanted to help me get better and so she prescribed this medicine (even though it isn\u2019t licensed in the UK for depression). The Bupropion 150mg worked almost instantaneously: my sleepiness was gone, I had so much energy that I could exercise, I could stay awake long enough through the day to be able to do everyday things other than sleep. I moved back home to my parents and got a job in the NHS for a year -I still slept for about 10 hours at night and was tired during the day, but I was happy that it was an improvement at least. I then started studying for my masters degree- I managed my symptoms and just put up with feeling tired all the time, having no concentration and poor memory. Fast forward 7 years and I am still on Bupropion, but I\u2019m not functioning very well- I have had to take a leave of absence from university because I failed part of the course due to my mental health - I couldn\u2019t cope with the fatigue, poor concentration and memory etc. as well as family problems and academic pressure on top. \n\nAfter a year of even more different antidepressants, I finally convinced my current psychiatrist to refer me to the sleep clinic. I had a phonecall with a sleep specialist in April this year and they said it sounded like Idiopathic Hypersomnia or Hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorder. After months, I have now received a letter to say that they think it is Hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorder but they said hey would analyse my sleep anyway through actigraphy and a 48 sleep study, but I still haven\u2019t been told about when this is. I have already deferred my university course for 1.5 years and have to complete it by September next year. I can\u2019t go back and finish part of the healthcare course without being deemed fit to do so. \n\nPeople (including doctors and therapists) keep telling me I should go for a walk, or exercise or to do things I enjoy etc. and that will help my mood and sleep. I don\u2019t feel better after any form of exercising, if anything I feel worse and then my mood gets worse as a result. I\u2019m not convinced that my sleep symptoms are attributed to my mood. I think my mood gets worse because of my sleep, poor memory and concentration etc. \n\nDoes anybody else have this diagnosis or know anything about it? Any advice on this situation would be much appreciated so thank you in advance!\n\nUK", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id":

I would say 2-3 days a week it happens. I get up and I loose all sight and hearing. Sometimes I can make it though standing, but other times I will fall to the ground, or if my fiance is near he knows to hold me. It used to happen a lot less then it does now, but I'm starting to get concerned.\n\nRecently when I get up, or stretch or just move in general I get extreme throbbing headaches and feel really fuzzy. Sometimes my vision and or hearing are slightly affected.\n\nDoes anyone else have similar issues? I have a slew of side effects from Adderall, could it possibly be from that?

So if Light sleep was 60% of your night it would say its high for example.\n\nMy first night it read deep sleep as being high (every other sleep stage normal), and the second, third and fourth nights night it flagged REM as low and deep sleep as high.\n\nTo me this doesn't seem to track with my understanding of Narcolepsy or IH as I would expect excessive REM and low Deep Sleep, so I thought I'd see what y'alls experience is.\n\nAlso, I don't have a diagnosis yet (my sleep study/MSLT is next Monday) and if I do get one back my doc expects IH so we'll see.

The specialist never specified what sleep disorder he suspects but, after looking into them, it appears that IH is the only possible disorder I have.\n\nHe\u2019s going to refer me onto a sleep disorder specialist, but the waiting list is 6-9 months. \nOriginally he had put me on 5000mcg B12 / day (to enhance cognitive ability) aswell as on a strict diet to ensure I wasn\u2019t suffering from a food intolerance- both of which did nothing to help my tiredness (if anything, the diet made me feel so much worse because it took more effort to cook and I didn\u2019t have the energy to).\n\nAfter this didn\u2019t work, he prescribed Modafinil, and so I\u2019ve been on it for a few weeks- I\u2019ve found it hadn\u2019t really helped me at all (the first few days I was wide awake, but still exhausted- but now it doesn\u2019t even have me wide awake).\n\nBasically, did anybody else think that CFS or untreated ADHD before they got a diagnosis of IH? \n\nAlso, once seeing a sleep disorder specialist, how long did it take to receive a formal diagnosis?\n\nALSO, is it normal to still be exhausted (not talking about sleepy) on modafinil, if it is IH you have?\n\nThanks so much for reading!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 2906, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What did you think you had pre-diagnosis?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ne4559/what_did_you_think_you_had_prediagnosis/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SyracuseStan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_557erc8h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621180167, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ndr616/does_adderall_make_anyone_else_thirsty/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ndr616", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1dc256e2-a17e-11e8-9e9a-0e976fd50694", "link_flair_text": "Medication", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/ndr616/does_adderall_make_anyone_else_thirsty/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1621180177, "score": 1, "selftext": "Not the Martha Stewart attention thirst, the real thing.

My alarm is set for 5:40, I usually hit snooze until the last moment, 6am. At 5:40 I hit snooze, and again, and again, at 6 I forced myself up as usual. Started looking for the kids clothes and that's about where it hit me. Lots of energy, lots of focus, maybe too much focus. Got the kids dressed, cut fresh fruit and packaged it up for their school snacks instead of just throwing in the usual chips and whatever. Noticed the kitchen needed some cleaning, and cleaned. Looked out the window and saw the patio was messy, so did some cleaning. Went upstairs to get myself dressed and noticed my bathroom sink and mirrors needed cleaning, cleaned them. Went to the bedroom to get dressed, and made the bed and straightened up there too.\nAt this point I was a little worried about how it's affecting me, but still got in the car to drive to work. Felt less grogginess, less distraction, ate my apple, I'll often start feeling tired at this point of the morning, about 7am.\nAt work I had plenty of energy, I don't know if this is how normal people feel, or how people on drugs feel, however it felt pretty good. People say Adderall gives you energy while you can still feel tired. At 10:30am, as usual, I started feel that, tired, yawning, eyes watering, I drank my first energy drink which took care or that. I normally would've had coffee until now but was out. Took my second pill at 12, not 3 like the doctor said. Somewhere around here I started getting THIRSTY! Very thirty, I drank my 64oz thermos and had to refill. Stayed thirsty through the afternoon. The second pill didn't seem to last as long the first, I started feeling tired again around 3 and cracked open a second energy drink sipping until 4 where the tiredness finally passed, I worked until 5:30 which is the latest I could before heading home to watch the kids. I could've definitely had worked more. The whole time I maintained energy, felt focused on whatever I was doing, and generally felt much better. Bought some melatonin on the way home to wind down, I can see sleep being an issue. Been watching TV, turns out the kids are out with their mother, and haven't fallen asleep which is a major accomplishment.\n\nAll in all it's somewhat disturbing the amount of energy I had, and how much I liked it, I will definitely have to keep an eye on that. A tolerance lowering the effects I felt today might actually be beneficial. A pretty good day, but also some worrying issues as well. Guess one other side effect I didn't work in is the absolute lack of appetite.

Some questions: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Does anyone have experience with asking for accommodation (especially in the US)? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What accommodations have worked? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How did you start the dialogue? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Did you experience blowback? If so, were you able to pinpoint that the cause of blowback was disclosing your disorder?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are we protected by the ADA as long as we disclose that we have a medical condition and are capable of completing the requirements of the job?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many thanks for any input or guidance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Narcolepsy", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rhx3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Narcolepsy", "subreddit_subscribers": 13704, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": "new", "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Work Accommodations", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "ups": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/nb8tj8/work_accommodations/", "user_reports": [], "view_count": null, "visited": false, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}], "domain": "self.Narcolepsy", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/nb8uct/work_accommodations/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nb8uct", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/nb8uct/work_accommodations/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1620881906, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 2898, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Work Accommodations", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "/r/Narcolepsy/comments/nb8tj8/work_accommodations/", "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/Narcolepsy/comments/nb8tj8/work_accommodations/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "girlwiththem0usyhair", "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "56de33b2-a13b-11e8-86fb-0ec44c28c910", "author_flair_text": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia | US", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5jamxdur", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1620863555, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/nb33ad/myoclonic_jerking/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nb33ad", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/nb33ad/myoclonic_jerking/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1620863566, "score": 1, "selftext": "Is there anyone else with an IH diagnosis that experiences episodes of myoclonic jerking?

Modafinil 200mg in late January. I was only feeling its effects for about 4 hours, so my sleep doctor added an additional 100mg in the afternoon. This is my current dosage situation, and it's only extended the effects by maybe an hour or two. I've found that my tiredness catches up to me at about 3:20pm. If it matters, I switched to this from previously being on Adderall XR for about a year. Switched because Adderall made my heart pound, but now Modaf is doing the same, lol.\n\nIssue: Aside from all my other qualms with this medication, I've found that since starting it, there hasn't been a single night where I got 8 hours of sleep. I will naturally wake up after maybe 5 hours, and I'll feel like I need to sleep more, but something in my brain pushes me to stay awake. Before, when I was not on any sort of medication for my IH, I could easily sleep 10+ hours. So now, with way less sleep than that, I'm genuinely sleep deprived. Modafinil also usually prevents me from taking naps during the day, even if I absolutely need one. Basically, I'm \"awake\" but I'm an absolute zombie (in a different way from how IH usually makes me feel). And especially after the main effects wear off for the day, I feel even less productive than usual, not able to get off the couch or do anything but scroll on my phone. Also, it pushes me to stay awake into the night, sometimes keeping me \"energized yet tired\" until 4am. It's all very confusing for me.\n\nHelp: My sleep doctor did not help when I told her this. She suggested I simply stop taking the afternoon 100mg, and wasn't supportive. Gonna look for a new sleep doctor because she's never been sensitive towards my issue. I do not plan or wish to stay on this medication forever, but for now I just need to know if anyone else has experienced this, or literally any advice at all.

They come from two different camps in the field, one narcolepsy focussed, the other more general and from Europe, but both have the same aim of sorting out the muddle in ICSD-3.  Both papers are authored by experts in our fields, so they are worth listening to.\n\nIf you have the time or inclination, try to give them a read, but if not the main thrust is around amending the classifications so that it becomes Narcolpesy with Cataplexy, Idiopathic Hypersomnia (with long sleep time), and then a mixed group covering Narcolepsy without Cataplexy, IH (without long sleep time) and possibly a few other minor variations.  The naming is actually one point of contention, and linked to the access to medication below.\n\nThe papers also look at how we will be diagnosed, how useful or useless the MSLT is, why depression can be included in a Narcolepsy with C diagnosis, but ruled out for everything else (and the impact of mental health disorders), and the search for biomarkers to make our lives a little easier.\n\nSome of the sideline discussions have also included access to medication such that in both the US and Oz, having a Narcolepsy diagnosis gives one a much better chance of being treated properly than with IH, and people want to know why doctors/insurers/government can't get this sorted out.  Imho its better we have the correct diagnosis so that the prevalance of our illnesses can be understood.\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079220300496](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079220300496)\n\n[https://academic.oup.com/sleep/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sleep/zsaa044/5810298](https://academic.oup.com/sleep/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sleep/zsaa044/5810298)\n\nplease read if you can and make your thoughts known, here and to any organisations you might subscribe to for your sleep disorder.

Due to the Coronavirus work insisted I go to the Doctor, I was very angry.            \nIt was a cold, I know what to do for a cold FFS! I did not have any of the symptoms nor risk factors for Coronavirus either! Zero!         \nWork stayed firm, no letter from the Doctor = no work.            \n\nSo I went and because I was so pissed off I said to the Dr I want the maximum time off you are comfortable giving me.           \n\nSo he did, I got a week off. I also noticed a very strange thing, I would feel like absolute crap one day, sleep for 20 hours, just terrible. But the next day I was ok.           \nSo off to the Dr for more tests.          \nGot stuck in the test comes back normal, test for more things cycle.          \n\nFinally I think both the Dr and I had reached breaking point of this cycle so I said to him.           \nFine, I\u2019m completely normal why do I have the good day/bad day cycle and what can I do to support my immune system because although your tests say it\u2019s working well and is within normal limits it\u2019s not doing anything!             \n\nWe then has a discussion about allergies.        \nHad I ever had an allergic reaction to anything?           \nDid I seem to get a lot of respiratory illnesses as a kid?        \nDid I wake up in the morning and need to blow my nose?           \nDid I get a lot of headaches where I couldn\u2019t pinpoint the source?             \n\nI said yes to all of them.          \n\nHe looked up my nose, was very uncomfortable for me!          \n\nHe said I think you have allergies, your nostrils are inflamed which means the mucus membranes are not functioning as they should.            \n\nEssentially and this is me paraphrasing my nostrils are mad as hell at everything which means when someone with a common cold and I interact it smashes my body immediately vs taking time to progress hence why I get overwhelmed and she bounces back quickly.              \n\nAs with anyone who has allergies my nose is blocked a lot too even if I don\u2019t realize which means when I\u2019m sleeping I\u2019m struggling to breathe.             \n\nIt\u2019s been one week of treatment and I have to say I\u2019m feeling better.            \n\nI still have IH and always will but this small finding and change is helping me manage.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1765, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "By a massive stroke of luck I learnt something new!

I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Hypersomnia back in 2017. I have been medicated for a while (currently on both Modafinil and Adderall, very low doses of both) but have been feeling much worse over the past month or so. I'm trying to decide if I should pursue increasing my dosage but am concerned about implications of increasing. **Wondering how others have made medication decisions in the past. Have you tried going off meds for a period of time in order to improve their efficacy? Have you ever regretted increasing meds when you did? Are you all for increasing meds when needed? How much time have you given yourself before deciding it's time to increase?** \n\nMy experiences as of late: \n\nPrior to January, I had felt relatively happy with my dosage. Still some general fatigue. I've never felt 100% but medication makes me feel as though I have been given my life back. In January and first week of February I was finishing a graduate program while working simultaneously and during that period of crunch time, I pushed through many nights of minimal sleep in order to finish school. I felt god-awful physically, but I finished. I'm now realizing that the lack of a consistent sleep schedule and the decrease in amount of sleep I got in January has taken a lasting toll on me. \n\nI thought that by resting a lot during the remainder of Feb. and March I'd bounce back. Ever since beginning of Feb., however, my fatigue has remained ever-present in a way that has seriously been interrupting my life once again. So now, I feel like I'm at a crossroads. I can't decide if I should 1) increase my medication, 2) go off my meds for a few days in hopes that when I took them again they would be more effective, or 3) give myself some more time and perhaps I will recover gradually.\n\nI'm really hesitant to increase my meds because if this is a life-time thing (which it seems to be), I don't want to max out on medication too young (I'm 31) and be in a situation where meds no longer help me whatsoever.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1754, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Decision to Increase Medication", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fkhqxe/decision_to_increase_medication/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "krg122", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_b4xb6bu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1584407016, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fjw824/the_silver_lining/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fjw824", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fjw824/the_silver_lining/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1584407223, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm going to use this social distancing plan/everything being closed as a chance to break from my medicine and sleep a ton.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1739, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Silver Lining", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fjw824/the_silver_lining/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PeachFM", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_r9wl7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1584250692, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fiwn2n/3_sleep_studies_clear_symptoms_of_ih_still_no/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fiwn2n", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fiwn2n/3_sleep_studies_clear_symptoms_of_ih_still_no/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1584250695, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have all symptoms of IH. \n\nSleep average 14 hours a day for last 8 years.

The sleep inertia is much better, and I've dropped to a single nap. \n\nMid morning is usually really difficult to stay awake unless I'm active. By around 10am I can barely function.

By the second dose, I'm functioning better but it does still feel somewhat forced. This has continued through the higher dose.\n\nFor the last two days though, I've felt generally really good. As stated above, the sleep inertia has improved quite a lot. I feel like my concentration has improved, and I'm feeling a bit more energetic. However, I cannot get to sleep at night.

I stopped taking medication and just dealt with it as I always have. I went to my PCP last week to have blood work done to see if there is an underlying condition that could be causing the fatigue (along with major hair loss). My blood work all came back normal, thyroid levels are normal and vitamin levels are normal. So he asked if I wanted to try Provigil or possibly even Vyvanse. I decided to try Vyvanse since Provigil is pretty much the same thing as Nuvigil just not as hardcore (or so I've heard).

Is anyone going through what I'm going through with nothing helping or having the opposite effect and how do you deal with it?

I took a few weeks off after letting my new current boss know the situation and how I needed to take leave to switch medication as advised by my sleep specialist.\n\nMy new medication Modafinil helps to an extent but no where near the same as my first stint on Dex. I haven't been able to attend the gym since my Dex stopped working. I've been unable to keep up with communication in my daily life and found it unbearable. I deleted my Facebook, stopped answering calls from my parents - which has resulted in them completely not understanding and attributing the change to me being an addict or similar. I'm now pretty much cut off from my once close family.\n\n It's been a while since and I've since been constantly in trouble for every little thing. It seems no matter how hard I try it's never good enough. I'll give my everything and have nothing left. I get home from work and sometimes I can't stay awake till dinner and sleep instead. I'm lucky I have a supportive partner who takes on the brunt of housework including cooking. I feel guilty for this but otherwise I'd just not eat and since moving in with them I've gained 8 or so kilos because of this fact. \n\nI'm now on a non formal performance plan at work and I feel like my boss is just waiting for me to forget something or take a day longer than wanted to follow something up, maybe I'll be tired and miss a formatting error in a document. I feel like I'm just waiting for this to escalate further up the chain until I'm fired. I don't feel like I'm in control at all. \n\nSo do I stay and try and speak with hr about my disorder or do I find a new industry and leave? \n\nSorry this is so long!!

I'm 25 and was diagnosed with IH about...close to a year ago now? But I've been suffering from it for like 3 years now. It's so validating to finally having a name to why I'm always tired. I take Modafinil but I'm also on medication for anxiety and birth control (for migraines and mood swings). \n\nAnyway, I'm never sure if its an interaction between medicines or what, but I find myself still extremely exhausted sometimes as if Im not on medication at all. Usually without medicine I can only stay awake 2-3 hours at a time before I need another 6 hour nap. Weirdly enough, I also experience bouts of insomnia too sometimes where even though I can be exhausted, I just can not sleep. Especially at night. \n\nI've asked my doctor about increasing my prescription but our last visit he wasn't really on board with it. I don't remember the exact explanation but basically it was along the lines of him saying it wouldn't make much of a difference. Planning on broaching the topic again on my next visit. \n\nSo I wanted to know if you guys had any helpful tips, life hacks, or just general advice on how you work around/beat the lingering exhaustion, insomnia, etc. How do you go about exercise and being active without crawling back into bed? I hope I'm making sense here, but with my doctor only able to provide so much and no one in my friends or family sharing this with me, it's hard to get anything really helpful....\n\nThanks for coming to this long mess of word vomit &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1728, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction/Advice?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fekd2f/introductionadvice/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "queenoffolly", "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "5c5c5c42-a13b-11e8-b5a6-0e93b72fa604", "author_flair_text": "Undiagnosed", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_cdoso", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1583524803, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fej774/how_did_your_doctor_exclude_medication_as_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fej774", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "f5245e5c-0509-11e9-8cf7-0e8975bb3ebe", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fej774/how_did_your_doctor_exclude_medication_as_a/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1583524809, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi all, I'm undiagnosed but for the past several months I have been experiencing symptoms that would lead me to believe I could have IH.\n\nI have a lot of comorbid conditions that could easily explain why I sleep so much (anywhere between 9 and 14 hours).

I\u2019m living off microwave meals of varying nutritional value. I fear I may be fired soon, I can\u2019t do the hours they want and I\u2019ve tried to reduce them but no dice.         \n\nI\u2019m surrounded by people who say they understand, they support me but I feel alone.            \n\nI tried taking time off from my job, it didn\u2019t help. I feel no better and no worse.              \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, I can\u2019t afford to not work, I don\u2019t want to be this sad sack, a shell of a human, constantly feeling exhausted, wanting to just sleep, to chase that sleep that I will wake up refreshed from.          \n\nSometimes I even consider asking my psychologist to bring my anxiety back, at least I could keep my damn house clean!           \n\nI\u2019m not suicidal, I don\u2019t want to die.

As a result I was on sick leave and then had to work from home the rest of the week. On Sunday I couldn't avoid a family function, which made the fatigue even worse - I think I was asleep most of the day - and I had barely recovered when I finally went back to work yesterday.\n\nMy workday ends at 4pm and I take the train to work and back. Trains are rare though because it's a small line and if I miss my train at night I have to wait 1.5 hours in the cold for the next one. I can't really deal with the cold so I usually avoid this by leaving work on time and taking a bus to the station, so I'll be sure not to miss the train while avoiding the 30-minute walk to the station.\n\nYesterday a colleague came by my office at 4.10pm (I was packing up to leave) with a problem that was very urgent and couldn't wait until today. I usually have a policy of politely saying that I have to leave and please come back first thing tomorrow because I know that it will exhaust me if I miss my train. But I couldn't really refuse because it would have been super rude and he would have been in trouble, so we worked on that and obviously I missed my bus and the train.\n\nI came home super late but I didn't feel that bad. I went to bed at my usual bedtime.\n\nThis morning I barely heard my alarm. I fell back asleep right after turning it off and my wife had to wake me several times over a long time. I could barely move my legs for a few hours cos they hadn't woken up yet, and when I finally made it to the kitchen I felt like throwing up after running a marathon.\n\nI guess this taught me to be more strict with my policy of \"when I'm off work, I'm off work\" because my colleagues don't get the impact it has on my health, but this is so frustrating because it was so avoidable.

IH sufferer here (no user flair on mobile). Struggling with combination of symptoms, medicine changes/ineffectiveness, misdiagnosis, lack of mobility &amp; activity, concerns about employment/disability/career change, and lack of social interaction &amp; support. Yeah, lots of stuff....\n\nI guess I'm hoping to find understanding/support here. It's just a lot to vent about.\n\nI'll try summarizing it all:\n\n1) Symptoms. IH w/LST, great trouble waking, long unrefreshing naps. Low appetite, low energy, severe tiredness.\n\n2) Medicine. Generic Adderall XR 12hr 20mg 2x/day + caffeine as needed (0-1000mg) while on Mirtazapine 30mg. Stopped Mirtazapine (30mg-&gt;15mg-&gt;7.5mg-&gt;0) and lowered caffeine (1000mg-&gt;600mg-&gt;400mg-&gt;200mg). Extreme sedation now gone, IH symptoms increased, but now too much physical energy to sleep at proper time, throwing off sleep schedule. Less caffeine/adderall = worse IH symptoms but sleep at right time. Naps also throw off sleep schedule so are avoided, but being awake is hell. Can't find any way to pass time before proper bedtime - nothing seems worth doing since it's all exhausting mentally when feeling so tired all the time.\n\n3) Misdiagnosis. I have all of the textbook symptoms of IH w/LST and really none of narcolepsy. However, MSLT had all &lt;5min sleep latency &amp; multiple SOREMPs. So got a Dx of N1 w/cataplexy (never had cataplexy either). Discussed and Dr kept N1 Dx but removed cataplexy part. All this on top of another misdiagnosis a year earlier, for sleep apnea. That Dx took months to get reversed.\n\n4) Mobility/Activity. Haven't driven since symptoms started 2+ years ago, aside from a several-month stretch involving bupropion (no longer effective...). Live at edge of a big city with buses. Can't tolerate the 1hr+ each way anymore, esp. with a bad knee and feeling this way. Family helps but still lack freedom to go places most of the time. I try moderate exercising but it drains me and makes the next days harder.\n\n5) Concerns. In software engineer career, been on disability insurance for 2 years. Severe depression half of that time. Mentally can't do complex/abstract thought anymore and now make many mistakes, so worked &lt;5hrs many weeks. Employer then officially reduced my hours, making me figure out and sign up for new health insurance amid all this. Disability insurance ends in a month - limited duration for mental/neurological problems. Financially prepared for long time once it ends, but concerned about long term. I expect a ssd application to get rejected due to invisible condition and physically being able to do some minimal kinds of work...so haven't applied (IH symptoms also getting in the way). Also concerned about cognitive &amp; memory problems - seem to be getting worse but hard to tell when every day feels like this. Two cognitive assessments in 2 years, so limitations are on record but as of 1 year ago did not show worsening. Share many symptoms of early onset alzheimers but as 30y/o that's not considered likely.\n\n6) Social. No wife/gf/kids, some fair-weather friends, moved back in with my mother for support but family not very close (emotionally &amp; on map). Only 1bdr personal space, nowhere in house but kitchen supports visiting with friends, and that's also very limited. Feel like I've pushed people away on social media by sharing concerns/feelings. Attend nearby boardgame night w/those friends when mentally/physically manageable, lately not. Feel guilty when offered/ask for a ride somewhere since I can't reciprocate lately. Could not mentally/physically plan &amp; make/buy holiday gifts for the few people close to me, adding to feelings of guilt. Also know nobody dealing with this stuff to vent to or talk with...which led to this post.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1705, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Lacking support", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fbbgaf/lacking_support/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TiredAcademicMama", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_234ld5u9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582942982, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fb5rg0/just_diagnosed_and_need_to_vent/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fb5rg0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7aa39bd8-a17d-11e8-8d78-0e5ba871de4c", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/fb5rg0/just_diagnosed_and_need_to_vent/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1582942983, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was doing well, really, I was.

Also, if you have any tips for fighting sleep inertia, lay them on me because I have sleep inertia from hell. \n\nI\u2019m supposed to be at work every morning at 8:00am. There were two days this week I got there at 8:01am. This has happened before, because me waking up in the morning is like trying to juggle flaming chainsaws, blindfolded, on a tightrope, underwater. It might happen, but probably isn\u2019t going to. I don\u2019t currently have any accommodations, but I\u2019m going to bring it up with my sleep doc next appointment. My supervisor can\u2019t live in a world of chaos where his employees are 60 seconds late so we were talking about why I was at work one minute later than I was supposed to be. \n\nFirst of all, I was embarrassed because 1) I was late and I hate being late AND IT WAS LITERALLY ONE MINUTE LIKE WHAT THE HELL LIKE I LITERALLY JUST NEED TO LEAVE MY HOUSE 65 SECONDS EARLIER, and because  2) I, a grown-ass adult, had to explain to my boss that I sleep through the seven morning alarms I have set and then when I do finally wake up, I have sleep inertia from hell so it takes me forever to physically wake up, then another forever to mentally wake up, and I\u2019m still not fully conscious for another hot minute, so I\u2019m always running late to everything. I\u2019ve tried to explain this before, but no one seems to understand exactly how much of a battle waking up is. While talking with my boss this morning, I was explaining that part of my brain hears the alarm and tells the rest of my brain to wake up. The rest of my brain doesn\u2019t understand what waking up means and so I have to fight really hard to physically wake up. Once I physically wake up, I have to fight sleep inertia so it\u2019s like my brain is now awake and is telling my body to wake up, but my body doesn\u2019t understand what waking up means either. It\u2019s a whole ordeal. \n\nMy supervisor was looking at me with the expression that people get when they don\u2019t really believe how bad/hard it is, but they don\u2019t want to say anything. He asked if I could just set my alarm two or three minutes earlier. I told him I would try waking up ten minutes earlier (because, you know, waking up earlier magically makes the sleep inertia go away), then said, \n\n\u201cMe trying to wake up is like walking into a room and flicking the light switch, but it takes the lights fifteen minutes to come on\u201d. \n\nI think he finally kind of understood what I was saying, which was nice. I\u2019m still so embarrassed that I came in one minute late, because saying I always run late because I have sleep inertia makes me look like a dumbass when it\u2019s only 60 seconds and I could literally solve that problem by leaving my house 1 minute earlier.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1676, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I\u2019ve finally figured out how to explain my sleep inertia/difficulty waking up so that people understand!", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/f74n0h/ive_finally_figured_out_how_to_explain_my_sleep/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "shawdowr", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kfo8d", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582236947, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/f70tx0/idiopathic_hypersomnia_and_sleep_apnea/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f70tx0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/f70tx0/idiopathic_hypersomnia_and_sleep_apnea/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1582236953, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a question for anyone who was diagnosed with IH and sleep apnea- did using a CPAP reduce your symptoms noticeably?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "idiopathichypersomnia", "subreddit_id": "t5_30y9f", "subreddit_subscribers": 1676, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Idiopathic Hypersomnia and Sleep Apnea", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/f70tx0/idiopathic_hypersomnia_and_sleep_apnea/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "booksdogsandnature", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_znllq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582160239, "domain": "self.idiopathichypersomnia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/f6krvh/scheduled_2nd_sleep_test/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f6krvh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "dd880108-a17d-11e8-9cd0-0e59699c06fa", "link_flair_text": "Diagnosis", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/f6krvh/scheduled_2nd_sleep_test/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1582160240, "score": 1, "selftext": "Posted earlier about my first failed test, https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/emdoad/failed_sleep_test/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\nI met with my doctor again, expressed to them that I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep again, and after a lot of deliberating they finally agreed to give me a short acting sleep aid.

My first sleep study was when I was only 16. I could only sleep for an hour or two at a time and was frequently prowling the house at night. I always napped here and there but I was a teenager and energy was in strong supply. It was bad enough that my father was concerned and took me to the doctor. They concluded my \u201cthree hours\u201d was like everyone else\u2019s 8 and I was just lucky. An aunt who was a nurse suggested chronic fatigue syndrome but it was the 90s and most doctors thought it wasn\u2019t a real thing and still don\u2019t. \n\nMy law professor in school used to take bets with my class for how long they thought I\u2019d go before I fell asleep in class. \n\nI always got amazing grades, because I\u2019m lucky to be naturally intelligent and can even sometimes stay partially aware while I\u2019m sleeping - which was helpful when a teacher would bust me napping and ask me a question. \n\nAt 35 I was diagnosed with adult add and prescribed vyvanse along with Prozac and Wellbutrin. My concentration improved, as well as mood swings, emotional outbursts and I quit smoking and lost 70lbs without even trying. But the sleepiness continued and so did the sleep studies. \n\nThey told me they\u2019d pull my drivers licence if I didn\u2019t get a sleep machine for apnea- so I got one. Yes, I felt like my night sleep was more restful overall, but still tired during the day all the time. \n\nFast forward to 41. I\u2019m exhausted. All the time. I have fallen asleep sitting at my desk, and I\u2019ve never made it through a live performance and rarely even a movie without passing out cold. I\u2019ve seen the phantom of the opera 4 times but I\u2019ve only actually seen the first fifteen minutes. \n\nI always joke that turning the lights out for me is like throwing a blanked over a bird cage. \u201cOh, look at that. It\u2019s dark. Must be time to sleep\u201d. This is not an exaggeration. I have slept through A Roger Waters concerts. I slept through the Queen Musical. I fell asleep at Paul McCartney two different times. Even nodded off during Bon Jovi and Eric Clapton. Cirque Du Soleil is just a nap with kart wheels.\n\nMy grandfather was diagnosed with narcolepsy and prescribed Ritalin. He was the same. But neither of us had any cataplexy incidents (although I DO get excessively sleepy when I am emotionally upset and usually need to sleep 4-6 hours before I can function again) he\u2019s long since passed away now, but needing to nap is a pronounced problem in our family. We all call it the \u201clast-name-here sleeping sickness\u201d. My dad, my siblings, my cousins and aunts and uncles. All of us can nod off at the drop of a hat. We could all sleep 15 hours and still need a nap the next day, although we rarely sleep for more than 3-4 hours without waking up. My sleep studies have all basically said I don\u2019t have narcolepsy, but they have no idea why I\u2019m so tired all the time. They\u2019ve also concluded I fall asleep excessively quickly (my record is four seconds from conversation to unconscious) and rarely dream. I sleep exceedingly deeply but wake frequently and then back into a deep sleep again. \n\nIt\u2019s not narcolepsy.  I don\u2019t just drop where I stand. But give me 5 minutes of quiet and sitting still and I\u2019m a goner. \n\nI nap at least once a day for one to three hours. I frequently have one to two other \u201cnaps\u201d during the day as well, which causes me to have to work from home as much as possible. I eschew functions and social engagements because I\u2019m tired and unmotivated. \n\nI feel embarrassed and lazy. My husband is wonderfully supportive and says it\u2019s not a big deal that I sleep so much and no one is judging me. But I still feel like a total slob to know that my in-laws can see me passed out like a drunk on the couch every day at least once or twice, even during a work day.  My daughter complains that I sleep all the time and I\u2019m frequently napping when she gets home from school. \n\nI torture myself that I\u2019m not trying hard enough, not working hard enough, and that I\u2019m just lazy and people think I do nothing all day. The fact that I manage to support an entire family by myself is really because I\u2019m massively good at my job and when I AM awake and alert, I can take on massive amounts of work quickly and effectively before I need to nap again.  \n\nNo one has ever mentioned idiopathic hypersomnia before they just laughed off narcolepsy or threatened to take my drivers licence away when I admit I have to pull over after less than an hour in the car.  This has just made me avoid the topic any time it comes up with my doctor instead. Now I just tell him I\u2019m fine. I take a nap or two a day and I\u2019m good and that\u2019s it. \n\nNow I\u2019m afraid to bring up this possibility to my doctor for a number of reasons. I don\u2019t want to lose my drivers licence. I am tired of sleep studies. I\u2019m worried everyone will think I\u2019m a hypochondriac (they probably already do with my damned allergies and sleeping all the time and emotional outbursts and migraines and other assorted autoimmune bullshit - I even blister in the sun and get hives from cold air) \n\nBut I swear to god I\u2019m not imagining all of this. If I could be normal, I would be. Living like this is awful and no matter how many times my husband says I should just sleep when I need and not worry about what other people think, I can\u2019t help but be sensitive about it. \n\nHoping to learn more about it here from people who have actually been diagnosed, and maybe find a way to bring it up with my doctor without raising any alarms or looking like an attention seeking

Was only diagnosed finally after a long battle of different doctors and multiple tests with IH around october of 2019.\n\nEven before I was officially diagnosed my psych had tried many different medications to help me stay awake so that I would not get into an auto accident or anything like that.  Nothing ever seemed to work right - and when it did it was either ungodly expensive, stopped working at a point, or had unbearable side effects.\n\nStill not sure what is the \"chicken \" and what is the \"egg\" here but I finally broke down into a very severe depression (been off and on battling depression all my life) to the point where I took time off work and put myself in a treatment program at a stress center for depression and anxiety.  \n\nI cant even get myself to treatment most days because I cant wake up. And even when I do wake up, I cant stay awake- even if I take my medication (which is Dexedrine currently).  I also have adderall which I was instructed to take both the dexedrine and adderall as soon as I wake up but then I end up having a major panic attack / racing heart etc , so now I've been trying without the adderall in the morning.\n\nDays that I fall back asleep usually result in a series of *very* vivid nightmares. I open my eyes here and there but then fall back asleep - basically continued fragmented sleep with vivid nightmares for several HOURS. Until at some point I eventually \"wake up\" and then struggle to reorient to reality and experience all the negative feelings of \"there goes my day\" \"what's wrong with me\" \"I'm never going to get better\"\n\n\nEver since recieving the official \"diagnosis\" I've lost hope on controlling this and being able to function like everyone else.  Today is a day I could really use some \"success\" stories. Preferably ones where maybe you were in the same boat as me, but figured it out somehow.
