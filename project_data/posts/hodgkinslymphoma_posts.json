I\u2019m having a hard time finding other HL patients or support groups since this decease is relatively rare compared to other cancer forms. \nThank you, I hope everyone on here is doing well and healing!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "hodgkinslymphoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j2yc", "subreddit_subscribers": 271, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anyone want to share experience?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hodgkinslymphoma/comments/ikgdlu/anyone_want_to_share_experience/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mghbounceback", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_28amxy0j", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598630071, "domain": "self.hodgkinslymphoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hodgkinslymphoma/comments/ii9m8x/support_for_young_hodgkins_lymphoma_survivors/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ii9m8x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/hodgkinslymphoma/comments/ii9m8x/support_for_young_hodgkins_lymphoma_survivors/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1598630083, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi!

Over the past 3 years or so I have noticed that if I have drank a fair amount of alcohol, then the next day I will have a very tender pain under my arms, in my chest, in my neck and up to my hairline. In addition to this, I have a lump under my right armpit which swells when I have been drinking. \nI went to the doctors about this in 2017 and had blood tests, where I was told I had some elevated levels (I can\u2019t remember what, I wrote it down on my phone and have since lost that phone) which indicate there might be something going on, but weren\u2019t high enough to warrant further tests, I was told to be retested regularly. \nAround 2 months ago I got concerned after I noticed the lump was consistently bigger and went to my GP. I had blood tests, an ultrasound of my stomach and liver and an ultrasound of the lump.

Spending my childhood days in Bangalore, I followed a conventional educational process where I first entered engineering and later moved to MBA. Presently, I work in a leading multinational firm in Mumbai. Returning to work after 6 months was both refreshing and exciting. Though I have gone back to my old ways of cribbing over deadlines, disagreeing with my boss, and sometimes (not consciously) pondering over colleague\u2019s appraisals, I am thankful for surviving cancer and seeing each dawn.\n\nI was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma. According to textbook definitions, stage 4 cancer refers to the last stage of cancer where the infected cells spread to other parts of the body. The doctors said I was at stage 4, but the carcinogenic cell activity in the spreaded areas was very little. My core treatment to fight the disease revolved around chemotherapy. My body needed 6 cycles that were spread over 12 sittings. Undoubtedly, mental and physical stress weighed me down, but I stopped putting my mind after a while.\u00a0For someone who has been working each day, for the past ten years of his life, suddenly staying back home can be quite challenging. It is a wholly changed dynamic if you are sitting idle. But being an optimistic person myself and support from my company helped me cope with my anxiety. I got a monitor and synced it with my working system. This allowed me to work from home and do at least 60% justice to my role. Though I moved to basic tasks, I still got to check mails, do conference calls, and handle information. My job instilled a renewed sense of importance in me and gave a boost to my confidence. Though I thank God for belonging to an upper-middle-class family, I shudder to think about the plight of the common man who lacks basic education, financial resources, and knowledge of crisis management. My parents, sister, and limited friends were my support system. Though I did not have any role model, I read a little on Yuvraj Singh, owing to my cricket love. Cancer temporarily made me stress less about petty issues like minor business losses and job competition. Now, these are slowly coming back to me. But I had already warned you right at the starting that I am just another average boy. I had an 80% chance of survival and clung to that hope until I won.

Then later after my 1 year I got another one done (which was like 2 months ago) it showed that my mass had grown even more! And now he\u2019s concerned, wants me to do another PET and biopsy bc he thinks I\u2019ve relapsed or it\u2019s another cancer or my thyroid. Idk so many things that it could be. Sediment levels are still normal too again. \n\nI was reading online and it was mentioned that fibrotic stroma could also be what is causing my residual mass to get larger, I don\u2019t want to get too hopeful but at least that\u2019s what\u2019s helping me sleep at night knowing that it might not be something too bad. Has anyone had to deal with something like this after chemo? What were the PET/biopsy results?

Please hear me out as this may come across as weird\u2026.it is to my doctor too. \n\nA bit about my symptoms:\n- Bone/nerve/ muscle pain\n- migraines\n- extreme fatigue \n- lip lesions\n- major weakness \n- low white blood cells for over 3 years (never gone up to normal)\n- Raynauds (diagnosed)\n- shakes and numbness in hands and leg\n- swollen neck glands that have not gone down in 5 months\n- mouth ulcers\n- tonsillitis often \n- new lower back pain \n- tachycardic when standing/ exercising \n- constant hyperthermic body temperature \n\nSo, all this started 3 years ago when my doctor found that my white blood cells were so very low. These symptoms I was having for about 6 months beforehand. I was sent to a hemotologist after 3 more tests weeks later showed my wbc still low. I see the hemotologist and he thinks it was lupus after doing tests. I get sent to a rheumatologist who then does testing. Get told by her it\u2019s not lupus at all. So I go back to my doctor and she said we should wait it out for 6 months and see if anything changes.\n\nNothing changes, symptoms get worse. WBC tests come back worse, never changing, always low. She sends me back to the hemotologist who then thinks it\u2019s cyclin neutropenia\u2026..but he sends me to a immunologist (Because he thinks it\u2019s lupus). Immunologist says he doesn\u2019t know what it is and he can\u2019t help me.\n\nI got thrown from my doctor to specialist after specialist for 3 years. 5 months ago I had an MRI to rule out MS, everything came back normal however they pointed out a lot of my lymph nodes in my neck were swollen. Since then I\u2019ve been having bloods done frequently and all wbc are coming back low still. The doctor feels my neck each time and is quite concerned because none have gone down and others are getting bigger. \n\nWe are in a cross roads as my doctor doesn\u2019t know what is going on and my hemotologist sent a letter to my doctor saying he can\u2019t help me because he has never seen anything like it and doesn\u2019t know what the cause is.\n\nSo the question, have any of you experienced this? Or something similar? Does this sound like another hemotologist may find something?

Lots of emotions, but we are both lucky to be surrounded by his family whom have all provided a wonderful support system. I could go on about how hard it is on him, on me, how i just want to be there for him but i\u2019m not here to tell my story or his, i guess. I think we just want to actually hear from someone who is going through/gone through what he\u2019s going through. \n\nHe had the port put in this week, and his treatment starts tomorrow. He had the PET scan last week, and we\u2019re due to get the stage results tomorrow. Although, from our understanding, it seems like it doesn\u2019t really matter what stage because the treatment sounds the same. I seem to remember reading here something like ABVD as the four iv\u2019s you can get during chemo? I know he\u2019s getting the fourth that starts with a B which he\u2019s explained to me to be more harsh than the others. He\u2019s receiving two rounds of this treatment (30 day rounds with a treatment on the 1st and 15th day). If he responds after that, they\u2019ll take him off the B treatment. If he doesn\u2019t\u2026.then we\u2019ll go from there. \n\nI\u2019m posting here just for some more personalized information that he or I haven\u2019t read via google or heard from the doctor. I\u2019m following along other posts, but i guess posting our own makes it feel more personal. He\u2019s an over-thinker, and this entire process has led him down a great many Dr. Google rabbit holes, so I\u2019m just wondering what everyone\u2019s experience has been. How fast did your results come? His PET scan results have taken a week\u2026is this an experience anyone else has had? We don\u2019t know his stage yet. How quick did the nausea set in, how weak were you on your worst days, how /ok/ were you on your best days, what kind of support helped you the most, what pissed you off to no end? Whatever your experience, it\u2019s going to be nice to hear it from an actual human experiencing the same thing, not the doctor telling him what he \u201ccould\u201d expect or google telling him the million possibilities. \n\nLast, a very personal question. This last weekend, he informed me that his semen had a very red tinge to it for about a week (2 weeks total now.) Him being the Type A personality that he is, he\u2019s taken some photos. Sometimes it\u2019s a faint red, and you wouldn\u2019t really think twice about it if it weren\u2019t on a white surface. Other times it\u2019s something along the lines of \u201chuh\u2026.well that\u2019s got a  red color to it.\u201d He received antibiotics with his port surgery, and when he gathered a \u201csample\u201d for IVF freezing after that, there was no red. So\u2026I guess i\u2019m looking for a good sign in that. We\u2019re asking his doctor about it tomorrow before chemo, and figure if there is anything anywhere else it would show up on the PET scan anyways, but has anyone ever at all experienced this??", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "hodgkinslymphoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j2yc", "subreddit_subscribers": 438, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Boyfriend was diagnosed\u2026treatment starts tomorrow", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hodgkinslymphoma/comments/obzkav/boyfriend_was_diagnosedtreatment_starts_tomorrow/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Hungry-Fun-434", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7vqq56l7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1624920136, "domain": "self.hodgkinslymphoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hodgkinslymphoma/comments/o9v8o6/need_suggestions/", "gildings": {}, "id": "o9v8o6", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/hodgkinslymphoma/comments/o9v8o6/need_suggestions/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1624920148, "score": 1, "selftext": "Wife 35(F) has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma, stage 2a.\nWe have a newborn, 2 months now.\nDoctor has suggested chemo, without radiation and has asked us to chose between the 2 drugs combo\n\nABVD and AAVD\n\nWhich one should we opt for?

A very important get-together is scheduled in a few weeks (two days after his treatment) and he is nervous about going because he knows he will be sick and not able to visit.

They don\u2019t make many efforts to see him (we are about a 2 hour drive away) and don\u2019t understand how sick he gets...I\u2019m the only one who sees that side. But they get mad when he cancels plans due to being sick. You would think they would be more understanding...Any advice on what to do or how to handle this situation?

I chalked it up as bad chow. Wasn\u2019t running a fever. I had an abscessed tooth all of a sudden. Then it began to throb. Back molar. I lost a portion of it maybe two weeks before this and was going to have it worked on. That Sunday night with my tooth on fire, crashing headache and woke up in a sweat as though I was laying in a river bed. Sick again on my stomach. Monday I pulled myself together and went to the dentist. Oh that tooth is infected. I never been allergic to amoxicillin. So between that and a script for Vicodin, we\u2019ll pull it on Thursday. I spent three days in the condition. Upon waking up Thursday the amoxicillin made me look like I was shot by rock salt. I\u2019m a mess. Still can\u2019t eat, my pee looks like coffee and yes my poo was like grey pudding. I go to the dentist on what energy I can. Blam, pulls it no problem. Friday I felt a little better.

I\u2019ve always thought of being a lucky girl but sometimes this takes over and I can\u2019t really be sad about anything because I\u2019m in a place where I can bear anything.\n\nNot so long ago, exactly 8 days before my 18th birthday, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma. Trust me when I say that I don\u2019t know how to feel about it.\n\nLast summer I started feeling a little bump on my shoulder and I talked about it with my mom. Few weeks later it disappeared but then came back again. I went to a dermatologist who defined it as cyst but, considering that the ultrasound was unclear, suggested to analyse it after a little surgery.\n\nSo, one day, I disconnected from my online classes earlier to go to the hospital. After two hours, or less, I was back at home feeling no pain and having no worries.\n\nThe histological examination had to be ready one week later, but it wasn\u2019t. Once it was, it talked about a benign tumor.\n\nThe following week, my mom received a call from the surgeon who had operated me asking to take an appointment with him as soon as possible. We went there and were told that the histological examination we were given was not complete and that he could not diagnose anything because multiple analysis showed confused results. After a quick check of lymph nodes, that were okay, he dismissed us suggesting a screening every three months.\n\nThe following day he called again and told my mum that further analysis proved that I had Hodgkin Lymphoma.\n\nWhen I was told about it I didn\u2019t know how to feel about it. Not happy for sure, but not even sad. I didn\u2019t expect it and I still need to realise what is actually going on with me.\n\nAfter three days I had my first appointment with a haematologist. The first thing she said was that I have to do Chemo therapy. She then talked about freezing eggs, heart ultrasound and other stuff I don\u2019t even want to think about. While she kept speaking I had teary eyes and, stupidly, kept thinking about letting my long hair go.\n\nAccording to my parents, who are not doctors but just parents that want what\u2019s best for me, she was going too fast and talking about a therapy that could be unnecessary. I was already feeling like giving up: I spent three days with no will of leaving my bedroom and I just wanted to watch old One Direction\u2019s video and Formula 1 content with no thoughts on my illness.\n\nMy mom took an appointment with another haematologist, whom she reached through a family friend who is a surgeon. Once again I was in the car with my parents travelling to a hospital.\n\nThis haematologist received us and, already aware of the situation, \u201cdenied\u201d what we were told. According to him, all the analysis were not done in a proper way (at least not according to his modus operandi) and the diagnosis was weird, considering that I had never had any symptoms. He also told us that the specific type of HL I was diagnosed with  is really rare and talking about a chemo therapy  with no insights was too rushed. He will soon repeat the histological examination and he will take  care of me.\n\nI think that the worst thing about this whole situation is people around me.\n\nMy mom is now hoping for a miracle that will give us better news with the next histological exam; she even brought me to a cathedral to ask a saint for a grace (too much, if you ask me). My dad, following my mom\u2019s thoughts, is thinking about suing the hospital who possibly gave us a wrong response of the histological examination. My uncles and aunts keep calling my mom to always get the latest news. Just one out of my thirty cousins called me and talked with me. My teachers at school always ask me if I\u2019m feeling well; one of them talked to me privately and told me that his family and him will be praying for me. I appreciate my teachers. My best friend keeps getting messages from me with all my thoughts and feeling after every appointment and, as I\u2019ve asked her, she doesn\u2019t make any questions.\n\nWhat I\u2019m mostly confused about is my classmates\u2019 reaction. I talked about the whole situation just with 7 of them but I feel like I ended up isolating myself. I don\u2019t talk about it too much but I would like to be asked more often \u201chow are you?\u201d. I know that they can\u2019t understand how I\u2019m feeling right now, but am I really wasting time hoping that they can empathize with me? I don\u2019 want to be pity but, seeing them every day, I hoped for a better understanding.\n\nMy mom is currently fighting breast cancer. My grandma died of breast cancer.

Now something changed his mind and I have to get radiation directly on my heart which is extremely dangerous. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to know what you guys think of my PET Scan results, would it be worth it to get radiation if it was you? Apparently it's just minimally above a 3 and he said it could or could not be lymphoma. \n\nHere are my results: \n\n\"A PET CT scan of the head, neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed. Images were obtained from the cranial vertex to the upper thighs 60 minutes after administration of 333 MBq of FDG. Noncontrast, low-dose CT was used for attenuation correction. Serum glucose was 5.3 mmol/L at time of injection of radiopharmaceutical. Water soluble oral contrast was administered for bowel opacification.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOTE: Any fused image numbers referred to in the following report, were taken from a dedicated nuclear medicine workstation and are for the purposes of reference only. These numbers may not always correspond to images transferred to PACS.  \n\nCLINICAL HISTORY:Hodgkin's lymphoma post escBEACOPP. PET scan March 4 suggestive of residual disease. Assess for evidence of progression.  \n\nCOMPARISON: PET-CT dated March 31, 2021. \n\nFor the purposes of reference: - Mediastinal blood pool activity:  SUVmax 2.1 and SUV average 1.3 - Physiologic liver activity:  SUVmax 3.8 and SUV average 1.9  \n\nFINDINGS:  Marginal decrease in the residual left anterior mediastinal soft tissue now with maximal short axis diameter of 3.3 cm, previously 3.5 cm. It demonstrates persistent uptake at its posterior margin with SUVmax 4.9 on PET image 190, previously SUVmax 5.2 (Deauville 4) as well as slight increase in intensity of the focus seen more superiorly on PET image 174, now with SUVmax 6.0, previously with SUVmax 4.1. The latter focus shows associated mild calcification on the CT component, likely related to post treatment change, but the uptake is also seen on the non-attenuated corrected images indicative that it is real and not associated with artifact of attenuation correction. The previously seen areas of relatively intense patchy FDG uptake in the sternum have resolved. No suspicious FDG-avid osseous lesion.  \n\nThere are foci of bilateral uptake in the posterior paravertebral upper neck and to a lesser degree in the supraclavicular fossae which correlate to fat on CT, most in keeping with physiologic brown fat activation. Interval resolution of the previously seen small left level IIA node with low-level uptake which was likely reactive. A small left supraclavicular node shows trace uptake below background mediastinal blood pool (SUVmax 1.9) on PET image 137 (Deauville 2).  \n\nNo FDG-avid pulmonary nodules.  No FDG-avid nodes below the diaphragm. The spleen measures 12.7 cm in maximal axial length and demonstrates uniform physiologic activity.  \n\nThere is mild focal cutaneous uptake in the midline of the upper abdomen / lower thorax.  \n\nOPINION:  There are a couple of persistent small foci of FDG uptake in the residual anterior mediastinal mass, which are above background liver (Deauville 4). Interval resolution of the previously seen areas of intense patchy uptake in the sternal manubrium.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?

It was a whirl wind of doctors visits, tests, results, surgery and then treatments and radiation from November 2018 till March of 2019. \n\nIt started out as a rash that wouldn\u2019t go away on my legs and getting strep throat three times in a couple months at the end of summer. Then the lump in my neck finally got to where it could be felt and seen. I was told not to worry by my primary doctor, my wife forced me to go to Ear Nose Throat, that doctor performed a quick exam and almost missed it because my lump was so large it felt like the whole side of my neck. Thankfully she felt it, biopsy, blood work and a pathology phone call and there I was with Hodgkins 2A in my neck. Got a port put in (fuck that thing) and then started ABDV chemo. \n\nI tried to work during my treatment. I made it through almost one month, 2 sessions of chemo and then got so sick I ended up in the hospital. I was only eating 300 calories a day and drinking less than a cup of water. The drugs had backed me up and all of that gave me a fever over thanksgiving while my wife was working and I was attempting to watch our two kids at home. My parents came down for the evening and my mother immediately took me to the ER where they whisked me to admit and I spent 3 days in the hospital with a contestant drip of IV fluids and hardcore antibiotics. I went home and didn\u2019t get back to work till March. \n\nI sat at home on the couch and watched the world go by and sank into a bad depression. Slept 18 hours a day and lost 30 something pounds from a lack of eating and drinking. I kept going to chemo and then had to get fluids at the chemo treatments plus more fluids on my \u201coff week.\u201d So I\u2019m getting 2-4 liters of fluid once a week in the infusion suite. My wife and I finally realize that I\u2019m having a major depressive episode (not suicidal thankfully) and got me on medicine. I start turning around in February as my chemo ends and my radiation starts. I\u2019m finally feeling like myself again as I go through radiation. I go back to work, start eating again (gained all my weight back and more, oops) and finally found a balance. \n\nI get a reoccurrence scare one year after treatment, apparently I have scar tissue around the main lymph node that was infected and so it showed as larger than it should be in the post CT scans. Blood tests and subsequent scans show no growth and no reoccurrence. \n\nI don\u2019t have any lingering symptoms but still use my antidepressant as I still have bouts of depression (possible reoccurrence did not help that). My life has changed for the better in many ways, and for the worse in some ways. I\u2019m blessed to still be here and I don\u2019t take that for granted. I\u2019m trying to make the best out of my life with my wife and kids after this and pray for a long healthy cancer free life from here on out. \n\nI just had to share my story with a group that understands. There are no support groups around me and my while my wife is amazing and a super understanding person I just don\u2019t feel like I can continue to rehash this with her. But I just needed to vent or share and offer advice to people who will listen to my advice. \n\nI\u2019m glad I started using Reddit again and I\u2019m glad I stumbled upon this sub. Hopefully I can be helpful to those who are starting their journey with this disease.  \n\nThere is a light at the end of the tunnel, you can do this and make it through.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "hodgkinslymphoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j2yc", "subreddit_subscribers": 355, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Survivor Story", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hodgkinslymphoma/comments/m0w5t7/survivor_story/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "JuniperJays", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3euwuhvn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1614324514, "domain": "self.hodgkinslymphoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hodgkinslymphoma/comments/lssj38/worried_i_might_have_hodgkin_lymphoma/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lssj38", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/hodgkinslymphoma/comments/lssj38/worried_i_might_have_hodgkin_lymphoma/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1614432952, "score": 2, "selftext": "So, for the past few years now, whenever I drink an alcoholic beverage, I get this immediate ache in what feels like the muscles of my arms, and the muscles of my chest.

I had been experiencing horrible night sweats, fevers that would come and go and I had a cough that wouldn\u2019t go away. I had been dealing with these symptoms for a three month period. Each time I tried to see A doctor, I was tested for Covid-19 and sent home to quarantined for two weeks. After the third negative test my wife decided to rush me to the ER. It was there, after an X-ray of my lungs, that they found the lymphoma. After the lung X-ray, I received a CAT scan and the results showed that I had lesions, in the words of the doctor, \u201c...All over you body.\u201d. That night we drove to Providence Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane, WA so I could be seen by a specialist. My diagnosis was confirmed. I also learned that a portion of my spine had been completed overtaken by the lymphoma and the symptoms I was experiencing are called B symptoms. I received my first round of chemotherapy at the hospital and released shorty after. I continued to receive chemotherapy at a local clinic and after the second cycle I went in for a PET scan to see how the lymphoma was responding to the chemo. The results of the PET showed that all prior lesion had disappeared, even what was found in my spine. I had gone into remission. Given the extent of the lymphoma, it was hard to believe that just after two cycles it was gone. But it truly was. I received my last round of A+AVD chemo on January 5th, 2021. I\u2019m due for a PET scan sometime in March. We are keeping our fingers crossed that I\u2019m still in the clear. Recently, I have been experiencing night sweats again. I\u2019ll been taking to my Oncologist about that. Otherwise, we remain hopeful. I hope whoever might read this gains something from it. This group here is awesome. Reading other\u2019s stories and the support being spread is something beautiful. Especially in these trying times.

In the meantime I'd like to run my symptoms by the sub to see if it matches anyone's experience. Reading stories I'm having a hard time being certain. I have some matching symptoms but they could possibly be explained away.\n\nCoughing. I'm a recently sobered heavy smoker of marijuana for the past 7 years or so, off and on, but very very heavy when \"on\". In the same time frame I've smoked cigs and vaped nicotine at high levels off and on. Both marijuana and tobacco use increased dramatically the past 6 months. Even more so the past 3 months. Up to 8 water pipe rips of tobacco and marijuana a night, more if I had the day off. I know, awful. I have also been sick recently and I'm not sure if I'm over it yet and it takes a while to shake the smokers lung.\n\nNight sweats. Again I've been sick recently. All instances include resting very near and in the jer stream of a heater, under a down blanket which could easily get overheated. I was also sick during half the instances.\n\nSwollen node. Mine is located right groin, right in the crease inner thigh. Four weeks ago it started causing me pain down my thigh, internally not topically, with no physical signs of issues. No redness, swelling. It feels like a pulled tendon or aggravated muscle but it starts at the node and depletes in intensity further from the node. It worried me and the symptoms matched femoral hernia. Especially the pain feeling sore and tight made me think the artery might be pinched. At work as a cashier at gas station the pain was more than ever before, and I couldn't ignore the possibility of dying at a gas station so I went to the ER. Bump was lymph node as we know. Blood test no signs of infection. No STDs. I asked if my smoking could cause it. Not alone he said. I asked about stress and he said not alone, it would only aggravate an existing condition. The past 6 months have been a steadily increasing bout of stress. The fear of herniating adding to this. Since moving home it has decreased in size, but the pain remains. (Wow three mandarins) /ignore the pointless reference, I'm partially zany from conceptualizing cancer./\n\nLoss of appetite. This could be due to marijuana withdrawal. I have limited appetite without it. 4 days sober now I dont have a problem with appetite, but it's not the same as when I wasn't sober, which could have been because of the pot.\n\nToday I shoveled off two roofs of about 3 feet of snow. Somewhere around 200ft squared. Very hard work. I felt sick here and there from being so out of shape but my node and leg pain didnt come until later when I was walking home from my friends house. My friend took a bong rip of marijuana and tobacco (the same guy who got me into the terrible behavior) and while he blew it out of the room window some remained. It could be that aggravated my node. It's still bugging me now some 5 hours later.\n\nI know it's a lot of info but specifically I wondered if anyone else experienced 3 out of 10 pain at the site of the affected node without swelling. Specifically groin located nodes and inner thigh pain. The pain does not go up from the node. Could it be its spreading down the lymphatic highway? Is there a more intenerally located node that is more severely affected that is causing the pain via displacement as it grows?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.

What? You just told us that we had nothing to worry about months ago! So we meet with this Specialist now I\u2019m attending the appointments and this doctor tells us that there is definitely something wrong and that they should have been removed back in February to get actual results of what it is ! So we schedule the surgery and they take out the one on his shoulder to test it ... they can\u2019t take out the one in his neck bc it\u2019s grown so much that it\u2019s wrapped itself around major nerves and there\u2019s a very good chance he will loose completely control over his bottom jaw ... so they test it and we went last Monday to meet for the results and he has been diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, we have to wait another 2 weeks to meet with the oncologist and set up treatment plans etc ...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "hodgkinslymphoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_3j2yc", "subreddit_subscribers": 48, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for some information on what to expect and what I can do to help", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hodgkinslymphoma/comments/a34d1y/looking_for_some_information_on_what_to_expect/"}, {"author": "DocWaterfalls", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1530498852, "domain": "self.hodgkinslymphoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hodgkinslymphoma/comments/8vf6xd/any_survivors_notice_any_changes/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8vf6xd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/hodgkinslymphoma/comments/8vf6xd/any_survivors_notice_any_changes/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1530498853, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m five years free of the suck and can\u2019t help but feel things are a bit off but difficult to quantify.
