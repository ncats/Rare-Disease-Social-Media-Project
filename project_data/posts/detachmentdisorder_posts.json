Profusely apologize for my actions, go above and beyond what was healthy to 'win back' that person's favour. Lie about little things out of fear of repercussions (forgetting to pick up milk for example). But it built this whole web of dishonesty and resentment and just totally ignoring my emotions. I heard the advice not to set myself on fire to keep someone else warm more than once. \n\nIt took a lot of self-reflection to own up to that and acknowledge that that's what I was doing and it was unhealthy for my relationships. I needed to improve myself. So communicate, even if I'm afraid of the potential conflict that would arise. Be more honest if I'm upset about something. \n\nHowever, I'm stuck at a different point now. I can't find a balance between being emotionally cut off and feeling everything at 110%. Anger and hurt and fear overwhelm me and I just break down. In the middle of an argument today I just shut down. I was aware that time was running out but I ended up having a breakdown anyways. Sobbing, wordless screaming, uncontrollable shaking... the whole panic attack shebang. \n\nAnyone have advice on how to find a balance between having emotions and not?

For some reasons it only seems to happen when lying down, especially lying on my left side.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "traumatoolbox", "subreddit_id": "t5_2z4au", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/traumatoolbox", "subreddit_subscribers": 7383, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Waking up in the middle of the night feeling like I'm going to have a seizure?", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "ups": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatoolbox/comments/j5eslh/waking_up_in_the_middle_of_the_night_feeling_like/", "user_reports": [], "view_count": null, "visited": false, "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}], "domain": "self.traumatoolbox", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/detachmentdisorder/comments/j5iclh/any_info_would_be_much_appreciated/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j5iclh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/detachmentdisorder/comments/j5iclh/any_info_would_be_much_appreciated/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1601900326, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "detachmentdisorder", "subreddit_id": "t5_m1tkc", "subreddit_subscribers": 96, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Any info would be much appreciated.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "/r/traumatoolbox/comments/j5eslh/waking_up_in_the_middle_of_the_night_feeling_like/", "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/traumatoolbox/comments/j5eslh/waking_up_in_the_middle_of_the_night_feeling_like/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "knockoffprogrammer", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_27els9x6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1601610640, "domain": "self.detachmentdisorder", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/detachmentdisorder/comments/j3nkrj/physical_touch_and_words_of_affirmation/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j3nkrj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/detachmentdisorder/comments/j3nkrj/physical_touch_and_words_of_affirmation/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1601610651, "score": 1, "selftext": "I guess this is just me wondering if anyone feels the same.

This was the first subreddit I ever created and I didn't realise reddit wasn't going to notify me about any activity here (posts, members joining, etc.), so I completely forget I ever made it and came back recently to find it had 95 members!\n\nA little about myself: I've experienced a lot of difficulty feeling emotions for about ten years now (I'm currently 25), although things have become insanely better the last year. I made this sub when I was in a really dark place a couple of years ago. I had to stop working due to a total lack of ability to function normally anymore and move back in with my parents. Since then I've done a lot of learning, picked up various practices and techniques, worked a lot on myself and while I can't offer much in the way of serious medical or psychiatric advice I can offer whatever anecdotal information or resources that I have.\n\nI'd love to see this sub become an active community. Being unable to feel emotions is truly hell, and it can last a long time if you don't actively seek out solutions.\n\nI'd highly recommend everyone read *The Body Keeps The Score* by Bessel Van Der Kolk. As far as I can make out from my own personal experience EDD (any many other psychological issues) seems to be a symptoms of trauma, and this is the best book on the subject. I'd highly highly recommend reading it (or getting the audiobook). Almost everyone who reads it gets a lot of relief knowing that this stuff is actually well understood, you just weren't getting the right information.\n\nAnother great book on trauma is *Waking The Tiger* by Peter A. Levine. He did a fascinating interview with the Rebel Wisdom YouTube channel here where he discusses his work: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiIm9NTC2JU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiIm9NTC2JU) The Rebel Wisdom YouTube channel has a lot of great resources on trauma and many other valuable topics. I've been told Gabor Mate is very good as well but I haven't read him.\n\nThe works of Jordan Peterson and Iain McGilchrist also helped me a lot [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtf4FDlpPZ8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtf4FDlpPZ8). The left/right hemisphere structure of the brain really seems to play a huge role in trauma.\n\nI'm going to compile a more complete and organised set of resources that I have used somewhere else but this is a good place to start.

She says its just easier to do that than feel anything.

At first, I just thought she was trying to act tough but Im convinced that she has no feelings about splitting up after 10 years. It just another day in her life. I know that she experience abuse as a child (mothers physical and mental abuse and father with drinking problem). Her mom always taught her to hold in her emotion (she was likely abused as well). Ive also always had a suspicion that there was a catastrophic trauma (sexual or bad physical assault) that she never felt comfortable telling me (but thats just speculation). She also said that she forgets important moments in the past (like has no memory of them unless described by someone). This includes the birth of our child and our engagement (so pretty big days). I wonder if this is part of the disorder? \n\nHeres the thing though, she has no desire at all to go to therapy. She sees it as a waste of time. She sees her emotional detachment as a superpower. She can get through life without any hurt.

I don\u2019t know how to phrase it exactly, but a few months back, during my summer vacations between semesters, I just lost all my drive at some point. I\u2019ve had depression for several years now. But this time, I just\u2026lost all interest in everything. I also think that I\u2019m slowly losing my mind. Although I know that it could just be me blowing things out of proportion, I\u2019ve seen and heard about perfectly normal and intelligent people going crazy. Hence, this post.\n\nHere are some instances which might help you understand my problem a bit better:\n\n1. This past summer, I was doing an awesome machine learning internship, my project was great, had helpful and intelligent mentors to guide me, great community and all - it was just a great opportunity. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say it happened somewhere from the end of May to the mid-June period. I gradually became disinterested in doing the work, writing the code, etc even though the project itself remained interesting. In the end, I didn\u2019t bother opening up my laptop to do any work, just stopped doing anything despite knowing I shouldn\u2019t. It was similar to the feeling of procrastination, only 10X stronger.\n2. I used to read a lot of academic papers in the previous semester, was in the zone for my exams, smashed them - scoring close to highest in almost every subject. After and during this summer, I\u2019ve read a total of 0 papers, I\u2019m doing relatively poorly in my academics, I don\u2019t even try reading papers or studying like I won\u2019t even open the textbook or download a paper, I just started feeling indifferent to that stuff.\n3. I had a great social life going the past semester. During this entire summer, I barely talked to 5 people and in less than a hundred texts over three months. I didn\u2019t bother texting people and they apparently didn\u2019t care to text me first either, which means that they weren\u2019t interested in being friends anyway. This semester, the only people I\u2019ve talked to are a couple of people living next to me, and my crush. The reason I\u2019m talking to them is that they live right next to me, and I do enjoy some of their companies. But it sort of sucks my energy and after hanging out once, I\u2019m drained out. I don\u2019t take naps because I\u2019m usually on caffeine or modafinil which don\u2019t let me sleep.\n4. Talking about the crush, I remember times when I used to actively pursue a romantic interest. Now, even though I have strong feelings towards my crush, I don\u2019t even go to the classes I have in common with her even though if I go, we tend to sit together. She\u2019s told me that she goes to the gym at so and so time but I don\u2019t even bother showing up at times even though I\u2019d really really like to bond with her. I\u2019m not getting any internal motivation or push to do anything even though I\u2019m sure that it will help me get together with her.\n5. With my resume, I\u2019d get into a lot of great universities and companies for the summer. I\u2019ve applied to a total of 0 companies this semester. I don\u2019t know why - I know it\u2019s good for me and that I should be doing it but somehow I just spend the entire day lying down in my bed and staring at the ceiling - evening comes around - play badminton for some time - come back to reddit - sleep - repeat.\n6. I used to read a lot of books. I finished reading 60 books this year by July. Your typical huge book nerd. Since July, I\u2019ve read a total of 5 books, 4 of them in July and August and 1 in September.\n7. For the past few days, this is one of the scariest things to ever happen to me. I\u2019ve been seeing something move in the corner of my eye - I look over there and there\u2019s never anything. I\u2019ll be sitting in my room doing something on my laptop when I\u2019ll notice something or someone moving in the corner of my room from the corner of my eye. I\u2019ll look over - there\u2019s never anything.\n8. I\u2019ve got relatively very few friends. The number of people I count as my extremely close friends is even lesser. Two of them, let\u2019s call them S and M, both guys, are close as well. They\u2019ve been having fun, throwing jokes at one another, and it\u2019s been making me jealous, even though I\u2019ve never felt this way before. I know it\u2019s totally unjustified - they should have fun - but I\u2019ve been feeling really insecure over how I might get left out.\n9. I know I should be proofreading this post and clear out the redundant sentences, etc, but I don\u2019t feel like I have any energy to even scroll up and read through all of this. I just want to lie down and have some TV running in the background. It\u2019s like my life in running and It\u2019s all just a background noise with me being numb to everything.\n10. Also, I love my parents, my brother, and would love to video call them, spend hours talking to them on the phone, etc but these days they text me all day, and I\u2019m usually sending back 1 word replies, just answering the question without making convo because apparently to my brain, even texting my parents and brother takes too much energy. Sometimes days go by and I\u2019ve not talked to them and they get worried and I love them and want to talk to them but doing a phone call feels exhausting.\n\nTLDR; I\u2019ve lost all internal drive and motivation to do ANYTHING and it\u2019s driving me crazy but I\u2019m still not doing anything other than just lying down in my bed almost the entire day and probably have some TV series running in the back.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions. I\u2019ll answer as many as I can.\n\n \n\n**EDIT: Another important thing I should've mentioned is that I'm a high-functioning guy. I can finish essays that take others 3-4 hours in less than 30 minutes. I studied for my midterm exams about 6-7 hours this semester and still am scoring 8+ (out of 10) GPA. This is not me bragging at all, hell, it won't do me any good even if I did for some fake internet points. It actually elevates the problem because from the outside I'm getting great marks, so probably studying, etc. I'm not eating much and periodically causing me to lose weight but people think that it's because I'm working out. Even leaving my room to go to the common mess room and then sitting with so many people to eat something as irrelevant as food is too much effort again, I just don't bother going most of the time.**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "detachmentdisorder", "subreddit_id": "t5_m1tkc", "subreddit_subscribers": 73, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It might not sound much but I\u2019m really scared and would appreciate some help.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572033231, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/detachmentdisorder/comments/dgxxz8/it_might_not_sound_much_but_im_really_scared_and/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "EthanEnglish_", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_109nea", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568660456, "domain": "self.detachmentdisorder", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/detachmentdisorder/comments/d54uio/new_around_here/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d54uio", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/detachmentdisorder/comments/d54uio/new_around_here/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568660457, "score": 1, "selftext": "Not sure how active this community is, but to cut to the point, I tend to slip when I feel myself getting to certain levels of anger.

I promised all of you I would explain how I'd overcome EDD (I can't say I have in any way that's meaningful for the general person but I can tell you I've gone from not being able to feel any physical sensation or affect to someone who feels content in their own body).\n\n**FOR A TIMELINE OF ME**\n\n* Ages 0 - 8: Feelings of fear and self-hatred.\n* Ages 8 - 12: Stress induced stomach pains and dissociative episodes.\n* Ages 12 - 15: Mild depression, social anxiety and generalized anxiety.\n* Ages 15 - 17: Suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, self-harm, loss of all emotional affect and numbness to physical pain or sensation.\n* Ages 17 - 22: Absolute numbness to affect, no emotional comprehension, constant suicidal thoughts.\n* Ages 22 - 25: Regular non-epileptic seizures, difficulty breathing, extreme anger and paranoia, inability to digest food, constant exhaustion.\n* Age 26: Regular feelings of contentment, solid emotional comprehension, self-confidence and feelings of self-worth.\n\nI'm going to do my best to describe my journey. Really any value will come from all of you asking me questions. I'm definitely not an expert but I at least I came through this myself and can offer my own journey.\n\n**WHAT'S HELPED ME**\n\nI experienced an extreme case of burnout when I was just shy of my 22nd birthday. Looking back this was just 22 years of stored up trauma coming to take it's revenge.\n\nI went back to live with parents at this time and discovered a worse situation at home than when I left.\n\nI saw multiple doctors, therapists and psychiatric nurses at this time who ranged in response from disinterested to dismissive and angry. At this time I knew nothing about mental health and psychology and thought I was just a completely broken person who couldn't be helped. I was really losing my mind.\n\nAfter a certain time I came a across a book called *The Body Keeps The Score*. I had already been learning a lot from Dr Jordan Peterson and Rebel Wisdom on YouTube, but having this book recommended to me by a therapist I was already seeing really made it all click together.\n\nI discovered what I was experiencing was *trauma*. Essentially the right-hemisphere of the brain could no longer communicate with the left-hemisphere due to an inability to contextualize my life-experiences. ^(For more information on this please refer to the work of Jordan B. Peterson and Iain McGilchrist)\n\nThis resulted in not being able to update old categories (childhood ideas of the world/left-hemisphere) but simultaneously being hyper-aware of everything (right-hemisphere/amygdala domination).\n\nAnother aspect of this was the polyvagal nerve; a nerve which runs from the cranium to the genitals and controls many of the functions of the body which respond negatively to stress (heart rate, digestion, liver function etc.). This accounted for many of the bizarre physical conditions I'd been experiencing, including my breathing problems. \n\nI should add that in this time I had started working out for the first time in my life (which helped), and eating better (because if I ate anything besides white rice and eggs I would feel sick). These things would make me feel better, but I could tell they were just an inoculant. If I ate a single piece of white toast I would lose my mind, which didn't exactly seem like a healthy body.\n\nI started to learn more about spirituality. Personally I delved into *The Duncan Trussell Family Hour* podcast and later *Buddha at the Gas Pump*. After a long time of listening idly I came upon Damien Echols who introduced me to the practice of High Magick.\n\nHigh Magick appealed to me a lot at this point because I had been deeply involved in Jungian psychology, it seemed like an applied version of that. After many months of studying High Magick, the TAROT and astrology in a contemplative fashion I found a lot of issues were resolving. This was combined with constant introspection and new perspectives being fed into my way of thinking from podcasts. \n\nUltimately my recovery was a product of many  many factors which are far too complex too explain. If anyone would like to ask me questions I'd be more than happy to answer. This post took me a long time to write because I really wasn't sure what to say. I'm still not sure what to say, so any questions would be much appreciated.\n\nAll the best,\n\n**The Mod**.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "detachmentdisorder", "subreddit_id": "t5_m1tkc", "subreddit_subscribers": 130, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My experience with EDD", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/detachmentdisorder/comments/ngb9gv/my_experience_with_edd/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tris_te", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_678g5f71", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1611197408, "domain": "self.detachmentdisorder", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/detachmentdisorder/comments/l1paa2/have_you_guys_ever_start_feeling_so_numb_and/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l1paa2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/detachmentdisorder/comments/l1paa2/have_you_guys_ever_start_feeling_so_numb_and/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1611197981, "score": 1, "selftext": "hi, idrk whether or not i have emotional detachment disorder but sometimes i think i maybe do?\n\nlately i've kinda been talking with someone for more than 2 months now, we started flirting and shit, and we know we both care enough to actually try and see where this could lead. and for the past days, i started to be more comfortable expressing my feelings, as in if something bothers me, i try to get that message across albeit usually end up delivering them in an irrational manner. he's been handling it fairly well and im learning to handle my emotions better but at the same time, i think i've come to this point again where i'm slowly emotionally detaching from the person/relationship. i know im still into him tho but damn, it's like i've numbed myself involuntarily.\n\nmy previous serious longterm relationship actually ended because of this very reason. i broke up with him because as the years pass us by, i find myself emotionally checked out somehow despite the certainty in my mind that i am deeply fond of the person i am with him. and that i do want him to be the person i spend the rest of my life with. but i cant help but feel emotionally detached at times, especially during at times that are emotionally overwhelming. i experience it usually when he starts getting too expressive about his feelings for me, or when i start getting bothered about something, or when we start making out. fucked me up so bad because it made me question the love i have for this person. for years i put up with this constant battle going on in my mind because i was goddamn certain that i love everything about this person.\n\nbut the numbness was overpowering my conviction. i finally gave up and decided to break up with him to have some peace of mind, and to think things through. months went on and i still miss him. a lot. and i  cant bear the thought of us not spending the rest of our lives with each other. i know i have deep feelings for him but why cant i \"feel\" them anymore? \n\nsometimes i feel like it has been a defense mechanism in my part so that i wont end up getting hurt or feeling stupid whenever i give my heart away. it has its advantages but it being involuntary?
