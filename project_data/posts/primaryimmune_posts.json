At the beginning of my treatments I only had one infusion site and my only problem was pain at infusion site for the following 24-48 hours after infusion.  Now my doctor has me doing two infusion sites to see if it will help with the site pain. I have done 2 infusions this way and have not noticed a difference. I have however noticed my stomach is really tender to the touch all the time. This is nothing I can't deal with but is annoying as I have young kids who love to come squeeze me and love on me and I have to ask them to be careful with mommy.  I have had great success with Hyqvia. I went for 10 years not knowing what was wrong with me, getting infections nearly every 1-3 months. Last year alone I was on antibiotics 10 out of the twelve months!  This year, since I started my treatments I have only been sick 2 times!  Also, Baxter, the pharmaceutical company for Hyqvia is easy to work with. They send me texts and call me to remind me when it's time to reorder my meds and supplies.   I hope this helps someone with questions regarding Hyqvia. \n\nRI", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "primaryimmune", "subreddit_id": "t5_32tl9", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hyqvia infusions", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/primaryimmune/comments/3soz3q/hyqvia_infusions/"}, {"author": "brokenjill", "author_created_utc": 1249142233, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_3kjrh", "created_utc": 1444172177, "domain": "self.primaryimmune", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/primaryimmune/comments/3nrozu/anyone_currently_on_flebogamma_that_has_a_crazy/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3nrozu", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/primaryimmune/comments/3nrozu/anyone_currently_on_flebogamma_that_has_a_crazy/", "retrieved_on": 1450748454, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'm an infusion nurse for CVID patients.

First time poster here for r/primaryimmune. My specific case is **Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome**, or **SCIDS**. I'm currently 21 going on 22, and was diagnosed with the condition since birth, having been diagnosed at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and then at 6 months of age treated at Duke University for a bone marrow transplant, and then went back to CHOP to recover. From there, my treatment consisted of monthly IVIG treatments administered at CHOP. \n\nBeing young at the time, I couldn't really tell you too much about dosage, the name of the medicine, or anything like that, and at about 7 years of age we were actually able to get the IV administered at home since CHOP is about a two hour drive away, which stinks to do every month, so it turned into a yearly trip just to see my immunologist, the wonderful Kathleen Sullivan. Into my pre-teens, I know the IVIG medication was called Gamunex. Through about April of 2012, this was the monthly IVIG medicine and treatment utilized until we decided to switch over to the weekly subcutaneous treatments with the medicine Hizentra, which I still use and self-administer to the present.\n\nShot in the dark, with how rare SCIDs is, and how active it is to find an active community to discuss the condition and treatment with since places like the IDF Common Ground are desolate, and this sub doesn't seem to be too active either, but I digress\n\n**My question is for those that are in a similar boat, having my condition and using Hizentra for treatment.** Does anyone ever feel frequent joint pain, stiffness, soreness, etc? Kinda like you just woke up from a shitty nap, or could use a good stretch, but like, allll the time, and you can't just stretch it out? I get like this quiiittteee a bit, but I'm trying to pinpoint the cause. I have a tendency to be stubborn, even with an immune deficiency; I don't like to admit to being sick, or I don't like to have feeling a little under the weather slow me down. As long as I'm not fainting or throwing up, you could make it to school / work, is my motto. I also don't like to jump to conclusions, or seem like a hypochondriac or anything like that, especially when other variables can be causing my soreness in questions.

I've always been the sick one, I've always been sickly, and it seems like I'm always dealing with something contagious. And every time I get sick, I seem to be more severe and stay sicker for longer than others. As a lifelong non-smoker (no cigars, no cigarettes, no vaping, no hookah, no mj, nothing), I have chronic bronchitis, and I had chronic earaches well into my 20s. Even when I'm not exposed to cigarette smoke, I end up with bronchitis over and over again. I'm sick of being sick all the time.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, I felt that all-too-familiar feeling, and I knew I had bronchitis. I went to urgent care, where they diagnosed me with bronchitis. They gave me Prednisone, NoHist cough syrup, and Amoxicillin. I took all my medications on time, used a clean humidifier, ate well, stayed hydrated, rested,, the whole nine.\n\nAfter I finished all my medications, I felt just as bad if not worse. So I went to the ER. They diagnosed me with bronchitis and a UTI and sent me home with Bactrim.\n\nI finished all my medications, and I \\*still\\* don't feel better. I can sit up relatively comfortably, which is a marginal improvement, but I'm still not myself. I'm congested, exhausted, stopped up sneezy, moody, depressed, I can't sleep, and I can't figure out if I'm too hot or too cold. My roommate gave me some Tylenol cold and flu last night, but it didn't help. I feel like garbage, and nothing helps. It's been almost 2 months. I can barely shower at this point, and they aren't refreshing.... they just make me more tired. I'm tired just typing this.\n\nMy friends keep telling me I need to give myself time to recover from all the antibiotics, but I don't think that's right. I've had bronchitis on and off for most of my life, and this has never happened before. And I've been on heavier antibiotic treatment before (3 antibiotics at one time for 2 weeks to treat h. Pylori) and I didn't react like this. \n\nI'm uninsured, but donations have allowed me to move forward with planning a trip to see an immunologist. I have chosen Dr. Andrew Pugliese. In the mean time, I need some guidance. And if any of you have any advice regarding the appointment, what questions to ask, what to mention, etc., I'm all ears.\n\nAnd maybe this is another piece of the puzzle, and maybe it isn't. But all these antibiotics have somehow managed to almost clear up a lifelong losing battle with psoriasis. [Which, to me, is odd](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psoriasis/comments/cv11ut/antibiotic_overload_almost_eliminated_my_psoriasis/). \n\nI'm just really trying to figure all this out, and I would really appreciate any help anyone can offer.

Giving a lot of information but you can skip to \"**Current**\" if you don't want to read\n\n# ____________________________________________________________________\n\n# Childhood\n\nI've had issues with infections my whole life. Between the ages of 0 and 10 I had many cases of **ear infections, eye infections, tonsilitis, skin infections with strep, yeast infections, bladder infections, palate infections, the list goes on**... My mom ended up restricting her diet while she was breast feeding me because something was exacerbating the ear infections. I had really bad eczema too. I probably had 3 courses of antibiotics before I was 1 year old but I stopped getting the ear infections after my mom got a second opinion with a naturopath and cut out dairy. A lot of random infections that required urgently meeting with the doctor on the weekends.\n\nDespite that I had a pretty normal childhood probably because I was homeschooled until age 8 and lived somewhere tropical where there wasn't really a cold/flu season. I traveled to third world countries and would only get sick from food/water when my parents would. The travel vaccines were well tolerated aside from the Typhoid vaccine which caused a rash on my arm. I'm also fairly certain that my brother and I got sick from the live intranasal H1N1 vaccine in 2009.\n\nDuring middle and high school my issues were mostly centered around debilitating environmental allergies and food allergies (also plantar warts). At age 12 I developed a peanut allergy and a soy allergy. By the end of high school my seasonal allergies were so bad that I was suffering severely from February - June and I couldn't wear contact lenses anymore. I was prescribed prednisone drops for my awful allergic conjunctivitis which didn't even help. I also developed very severe oral allergy syndrome to many raw fruits and vegetables and all raw nuts and seeds that would cause difficulty breathing. After getting my wisdom teeth out I ended up with an infection in my jaw bone.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# University\n\nThings started getting worse when I started university in 2015 at a school with 50,000 students. I was constantly getting colds and occasionally more serious illnesses. My first year I managed to contract strep C which manifested as stiff neck and a really high fever where I hallucinated (which at the time I thought was funny since it typically only infects immunocompromised people and livestock...if only I knew haha). Additionally I had multiple bladder infections. The summer between my freshman and sophomore year I had to go to the hospital for a kidney infection and get IV antibiotics. The next year played out much the same way because I decided to study abroad for a year and due to moving I caught everything that was going around it seemed. Repeat my junior year upon moving home. \n\n**Things really started to escalate my junior year with illnesses.** I caught what I assume was the flu in the spring and ended up going to urgent care because I had been **coughing up blood** for several days. That was the first time I was prescribed an inhaler and oral prednisone. I was still struggling weeks after and I had to do a **chest x-ray** to rule out walking **pneumonia**. I had a hard time recovering from that one and my lung capacity took awhile to come back and the fatigue lingered for a long time. I did a lot of follow up testing to see if there was any concrete reason and my vitamin levels were good (except D), I tested negative for EBV and CMV antibodies (they thought I could have chronic EBV). They told me my thyroid results looked good enough to frame and put on a wall.\n\nSenior year was better because I didn't move but unfortunately I was dealing with chronic pain and had surgery for endometriosis so it was really rough regardless. Surgery went fine but one of my incisions got infected and had to be chemically cauterized which hurt like a bitch.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Diagnosis\n\nI never actually thought all of the infections were weird. When head colds started progressing into coughing up blood that made me think twice but I probably would never have been diagnosed if I didn't also have Celiac disease.\n\nI had blood tests for Celiac disease in 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, and twice in 2018. The last 4 were done at the student health clinic at my university because I would go in for some other reason and then tell them to order that test on top of the others. **I had already stopped eating gluten because it was ruining my life so I didn't really care what any doctor had to say about the matter.**\n\nI only noticed that my tests were weird when I got the mobile app to view test results. All of the doctors I saw at the university health clinic never brought it up to me. All of them said **\\*preliminary results indicate that this sample has a low level of IgA, further testing may be indicated.** That was in June 2019. \n\nIn December 2019 while home for Christmas I ended up with another gnarly chest infection and I didn't have my inhaler so I had to go to the doctor to get checked out and get prescribed another one. I saw a new doctor who was young who I convinced to do the test for IgA. I told him I was convinced that I had celiac disease and that my past tests may have been false negatives.\n\nHe ordered the test and also ordered a nutrient panel for Celiac disease and made the diagnosis for insurance purposes. \n\nI didn't get to see him again before leaving town but we communicated over the portal about the results and he consulted with an immunologist who told me what the next steps were. \n\n**To be honest I wasn't surprised that I had 0 IgA**. I also came back deficient in zinc and vitamin A (even though I literally take those same vitamins every day!!!!!) \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Current\n\nI moved again and have been sick a lot ever since. I eat well and exercise but I still really struggle to stay well.\n\nSince August 2019 I have been sick enough to need an inhaler 4 times, not including other times where I was sick for a week but the cough wasn't that severe.\n\nSeptember 2019: sick for a week, **coughing up blood,** needed inhaler due to bronchitis caused by illness\n\nWas sick again for a week in October after traveling\n\nI was so sick in December/January that I had to get a lung function test in February to check to see if there was damage. I needed an inhaler to do low intensity exercise for 6 weeks. I was originally sick for 3 weeks, got better for 2 weeks, and then totally relapsed again at the end of January. That was probably the sickest I'd been in my adult life. I was coughing up blood and coughing so violently that I was puking in my mouth and the fits would leave me with my vision going black unable to stand up. I couldn't drive a car for fear of passing out from coughing.\n\nIn February I had to go to the **hospital** for a **kidney infection**. I was sent home with oral antibiotics. Developed a secondary MRSA infection on my face that I was battling until July. \n\nI wasn't sick much during the lockdown but after returning to work I've been catching things from other people like stomach bugs and colds which last 4-5 days. It's made it really hard to get work done during COVID because if you have any symptoms you have to stay home and get tested. I agree with this policy but when you're sick all the time it makes it impossible to be there.\n\nI've had continuing episodes of intense kidney pain since February and I'm trying to get it checked out. and anemia.\n\nI had an \"attack\" 4 days ago and have felt unwell since\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Blood tests\n\nAfter the initial testing I had to start again with a new doctor where I live who had to reconfirm the 0 IgA and send me to an immunologist at the hospital. Both times the tests said **undetectable IgA**. After going to the hospital they ordered more thorough bloodwork to rule out an IgG subclass deficiency and specific antibody deficiency. \n\nI'm only listing the ones that were abnormal at some point **OR** were specific to the testing done by immunology. Also not putting units because they're confusing, I will put the reference ranges though.\n\n**NOTE: ROUND 2 IS FROM HOSPITAL VISIT FOR (UNCONFIRMED) KIDNEY INFECTION**\n\n**\\*\\*My IgG1 is high** ***presumably*** **because I'm doing immunotherapy for pollen allergies.

My IgM isn't super high either, meanwhile my IgE is off the charts even though that test was from January when I don't have allergies. Not super convinced that my titers look good either but it was never discussed so I don't really know.**\n\nThis immunology department at the hospital primarily works with children with CF so they don't have time for me because I'm not sick enough. I haven't seen them since the initial appointment 11 months ago; I just got a phone call saying that my bloodwork was fine with no plans for follow up. My GP doesn't know what to do with me and can't order any follow up testing needed for monitoring because he doesn't have the authority to, meanwhile immunology won't give me the time of day. I don't have private health insurance here so the national system is what I am working with. \n\nMeanwhile I am waiting **over a week** for an appointment at my GP for kidney pain and malaise that brought me to the hospital earlier this year. They're like \"Do you have a fever?\" and I told them that I've felt feverish when waking up in the morning the past 2 days but **I don't really get fevers** but that I had really intense pain 4 days ago and a dull ache in my lower back/side ever since. I told the receptionist to check my record and see that I have a PID so things like this need to be investigated quickly because they can often turn bad on a dime. It didn't change anything. **Nobody takes it seriously and I sound like a whiny bitch when I KNOW how much it sucks to be sick out of your mind in the ER on IV antibiotics because people dismiss you early on.**\n\n**Given the issues that I'm dealing with and that I'm much more symptomatic than the average SIgAD person who is young, otherwise healthy, fit, and active, shouldn't I have follow up testing at 12 months (next month) to see where my IgG is at considering that it was so close to the bottom of the reference range last time?** \n\n**Thank you for anybody who can take the time to help me during this unprecedented situation, any guidance/commiserating will be appreciated.**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "primaryimmune", "subreddit_id": "t5_32tl9", "subreddit_subscribers": 324, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Please look at my bloodwork!

I hope everyone is staying safe and as healthy as possible with everything going on these days. Just a precursor, this is long, so grab a little a snack while you're able to :) \n\nI guess I'm just kind of in the dark about what has been happening to me and through some research, I feel like you guys could help me. I (20F) was always a healthy kid. Like when I say I never got sick, I *never* got sick. My mom would sometimes let me stay home for allergies, because I never got \"normal sick days\". Between the ages of 5-18 I threw up one time (and it was from food poisoning). \n\nThe only thing that ever seemed to get me \"sick\" was my allergies to pollen. Although, one year I do remember having them so badly I could barely breathe. Anyways, the point is that I barely ever got sick. \n\nThen something changed in high school. I think it's important to note that I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and OCD at the time (undiagnosed ADHD as well). I know that these things, when left untreated, can definitely manifest themselves in physical ways. But, I started getting colds all the time. \n\nAround my senior year of high school was when I started getting ear infections. The first one, my mom thought was funny in a way, because I had apparently never had one as a baby or young child (obviously the \"normal\" time to get them). Didn't think much of it. Then, in the spring, sinusitis. Once again, didn't think much of it. I think I got another ear infection that summer, but all of these were really no biggie to me. \n\nThen, freshman year of college. I moved across the country and stayed in a complete shit hole of a dorm, which looking back, I don't think helped with my health. That's when problems really picked up. I was practically sick every week. If it wasn't sinusitis, it was an awful cold. Eye infections consistently, despite good hygiene. A few ear infections. I brushed this off and blamed it on communal living and the fact that the air in my dorm building was probably an unhealthy quality. \n\nMy sophomore year of college (aka this year), my parents decided to not send me back to school. I lived at home this year, which I thought would help with not getting infected as often ( narrator: It did not). A few ear infections during the first semester (including two double ear infections at the same time. I feel like that's a home run in the world of ear infections). Maybe a case of sinusitis. \n\nThen 2020 hits! I've gotten really into working out this year, which I think helped with my resistance to general colds (?? I don't think that actually makes sense, but whatever). I remember in March even thinking *Wow, I haven't gotten an ear infection in ages*. But when there's a will there's a way! I had one, then had sinusitis, then developed folliculitis over my stomach which has scarred over because of it, then abscesses all along one of my underarms, then ANOTHER ear infection, and now some sort of inner infection in my boob. It's like this never ending list of moderate infections. Oh also a quick note, not sure where to place this, no matter how bad my infection is, I have never had fever or chills accompany it. \n\nThe thing is though, I've never had pneumonia, strep throat, mono, even the flu. And trust me, I've had quite my fair share of communal drinks and handles in college and beyond.  Like it seems as though my body is great at fighting off that stuff, but not the more surface level things. I would say I'm good with hygiene and my parents keep a very clean house (and I keep my room clean as well). I'm not really being exposed to many people while home and especially now, with the quarantine, I really don't think I should be getting all these frequent infections. \n\nI guess the main question here is: Is this worth looking into for me? How do I approach this conversation with my doctor in the right way? Or is there possibly something else happening here? Whatever it is, I want to thank y'all for taking the time to read this! Any advice on this would be great.

First time I saw a rheumatologist, I was blown off, despite having positive ana readings all three times I was tested (1:600, 1:280, 1:320 with a speckled pattern). Instead, I was referred to cardiology and neurology. I got diagnosed with Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome, Ehler Danlos Syndrome, POTs, and Celiac Artery Compression Syndrome with MALS.\n\nAfter receiving these diagnoses and adapting, I was fine for awhile expect for recurrent infections, muscle weakness, joint pain, a few rashes, constipation, and occasional hair loss. We decided to see a rheumatologist after some incidents of skin yellowing, eye rashes that mimicked dermatomyositis, and what looked to be calcium deposits came out of my fingers a few times.\n\nHere's where it gets sorta into weird territory for me. When I went to the rheumatologist there were two there, one who worked through a fellowship, and the other commonly worked there I guess. I was only expecting to see one rheumy. The one that worked with the fellowship wanted me to be checked for dermatomyositis, lupus, sjogren's syndrome, and (for safety purposes) scleroderma. The one my family booked an appointment with thought I had no autoimmune disease and that I should see gastroenterology for gastroparesis. During the appointment, I had a lot of pictures taken showing how fat and skin distributed around my legs, pictures of my pictures of rashes, and pictures of rashes on my body (that is something that never happened at an appointment of any kind for me).\n\nAlso at the appointment, I had 12 vials of blood drawn. Most of my results were normal, but my ANA was elevated with a spotted pattern, my IgG was low, and some things in my blood plasma were low. Five days later, I got a call telling me to NOT leave my house (for obvious reasons) and that I have an appointment scheduled with immunology TWO WEEKS later. I also have some x-rays scheduled for my hands and a MRI along with an MRA to check for infections embedded in my thigh muscles and to check the status of my artery compression. I was also scheduled to see a sleep specialist for sleep apnea (despite being young and normal weight?).\n\nTwo weeks later, I went to immunology. On the FIRST appointment the immunologist was already bringing up transfusions as treatment for my IgG lacking. After I brought up my stomach issues, yellowing, skin issues (including inchiness), and joint pain, they continuously asked questions about how thirsty I am (It constituted a third of the questions in the appointment). There were also a lot of questions about early childhood (which was expected, because I had a lot of bad reactions to vaccines as a baby).\n\nSome results came back from that appointment I have absolutely no idea what it means. My HLA/DR-DC3 is low (whatever that is), my IGg is low, and some other thing is abnormal (but IgM, IgA, and iron are normal). For the next few months, it appears that I am scheduled to be monitored for sjogren's through repeated blood testing along with lupus. I also was given a pcv vaccine to see how I would react to it.\n\nThis is all new territory for me and I really have no idea what level of concerned I should be. I am starting college in the fall and I am confused to whether or not that would be safe for me. Just curious if anyone else had any similar experiences and how they learned to move past it?\n\nAlso, how is the transfusion treatment in general? I have no idea what to expect. \n\n(thank you if you read all of this, I know it is long)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "primaryimmune", "subreddit_id": "t5_32tl9", "subreddit_subscribers": 273, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I don't know what is happening", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/primaryimmune/comments/gd38qp/i_dont_know_what_is_happening/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dee62383", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_klwf5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1587789229, "domain": "self.primaryimmune", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/primaryimmune/comments/g7nir4/how_does_a_vaccine_challenge_work_what_are_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g7nir4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/primaryimmune/comments/g7nir4/how_does_a_vaccine_challenge_work_what_are_the/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1587789233, "score": 1, "selftext": "Couldn't find duplicates of this anywhere, and my facility's customer service, my doctor, and Facebook groups aren't helping.

Then I was confused, because how was that going to measure my body's immune response to both vaccines?\n\nCue more sleepless nights and frantic, futile research.\n\nI think I got it, though. One day, you go get blood work and the first vaccine. THEN you wait 4 weeks, then repeat the blood work and the vaccine.\n\nSo I *thought* it was: (blood work + vaccine) &gt;&gt; (4 weeks) &gt;&gt; (vaccine). But it's actually: (blood work + vaccine) &gt;&gt; (4 weeks) &gt;&gt; (blood work + vaccine). Make sense?  \n\n\nDo I have this correct now?

However, the resident immunologist (I'm from a very small island) has said that they would only consider testing me for an immunodeficiency disorder if I am getting recurrent or chronic lung and/or sinus infections. I had pneumonia for the first and only time at 18 months old and I had my first sinus infection last year, which went away without treatment. \n\nHe told me that people with immunodeficiency disorders are often hospitalised with sepsis from minor infections. I have not been hospitalised since I was a toddler, for the pneumonia.\n\nHe has said that an immunodeficiency disorder would present in childhood. I was a healthy child and teen, my issues began seemingly out of nowhere at 21 years old. My six basic blood tests (CBC etc.) last year were normal.\n\nHowever, as stated in my last post I have recently discovered that I am prone to unusual infections with seemingly no trigger. I currently have endometritis (not *endometriosis*) for which I have absolutely zero risk factors. I also test positive for very unusual bacteria in my urine samples, always taken for reasons unrelated to infection, but I have no symptoms of a UTI. I cannot run a fever and this has led to a delayed diagnoses of serious infection (e.g. tonsillar abscess) on a few occasions. I have dramatic and unusual reactions to medicine such as hormonal contraception, for example I developed irreversible 'pregnancy gingivitis' and severe mouth ulcers from a few months of a very low dose of progesterone.  \n\nMy doctor believes I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, based on skin/gastrointestinal/joint presentations amongst other issues I have been experiencing since my early teens.\n\nI don't know where to turn to, it's incredibly frustrating to have so many unanswered questions. I am starting to doubt whether there is anything wrong with me based on what he was saying, but I still feel that something is just 'off'.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "primaryimmune", "subreddit_id": "t5_32tl9", "subreddit_subscribers": 268, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update and more questions.

I've posted in here before, but it's been awhile. So as a brief intro, I'm a 36 y/o female. I have hypermobile Ehlers Danlos syndrome (hEDS), and I have no health insurance and no income. I've been fighting for disability since 2008 (!!), and I am working as hard as I can to overcome this and get all my comorbidities diagnosed. And don't worry, I am not going to ask anyone for money!\n\nI began suspecting CVID many, many years ago when I saw it on an episode of Mystery Diagnosis. When I found out that CVID is a comorbidity of hEDS, I became even more curious. I seem to be sick with infections ALL the time, so it just got me thinking. I've had:\n\n\\* I've had infections of multiple kinds throughout my life, and they will NOT go away. I take antibiotics or do whatever treatment, and while that's happening, I see improvement. But as soon as I take my last pill, the symptoms come right back.\n\n\\* I've had an h. Pylori infection that has persisted as described above.\n\n\\* I have always had chronic bronchitis despite being a lifelong non-smoker and living in a home where no one smokes indoors.\n\n\\* I've had 2 to 4 staph infections (that I know of), and most of those were MRSA\n\n\\* I've had a tooth abscess despite consistently good dental hygiene\n\n\\* I had chronic earaches well into my 20s\n\n\\* I had shingles at 31\n\n\\* Constant, neverending fungal infections despite taking every possible precaution and trying everything\n\n\\* I'm always just getting sick with everything, and it's always severe. I was recently sick for three months straight, and it was so bad I barely had the energy to breathe or roll over in bed. No doctor could really figure out what it really was. The only thing that fits (in my opinion) is PCP, a type of pneumonia in the immune deficient.\n\nThose are just the examples I can think of for now.\n\nA few years after learning about CVID on Mystery Diagnosis, long story short is that after TONS of research, and countless phone calls and emails, I got the test for CVID. Sort of. I couldn't afford a specialist, so my PCP ordered the test, but the lab had never heard of it. So they did some digging and assumed that I wanted the GENETIC test for CVID, which was negative. When I contacted the immune Deficiency Foundation, and that's when I learned that the genetic test was negative because medical science hasn't identified the gene responsible for CVID. So it was a false negative, basically.\n\nAnother few years later, I had a stroke of luck, and found a way to see an immunologist. First, they did a breathing test, allergy tests. My lungs function at 111%, and the nebulizer only increased my airway by 3%. The allergy tests were totally negative. I reacted to nothing - not even the control - despite stopping all medications for more than a week prior. When I asked about getting tested for CVID, I got pushback, and I ALMOST didn't get the testing. But as I was talking to the nurse, I told her about my financial situation, and that I'd be getting this test thanks to financial assistance from Quest Diagnostics. So as I was finishing up with check-out, the nurse caught me and printed an order form with the testing I wanted on it. \"If you're doing financial assistance, you might as well get it all one at once.\"\n\nSo I left out a lot of the details about red tape, bureaucracy, and headaches, but that's my CVID story so far. I get my results on December 12th. I don't care if this is what I have. I just want answers! I don't want another dead end. Not having answers is sometimes more tiring than the disease itself!\n\nSo anyway, about those fungal infections. This has been a NIGHTMARE. I have been formally accused of not bathing multiple times, and that was TRAUMATIZING. So now that I know it's a fungal infection, I have tried everything possible to get rid of it - launder everything with hot water, wash my hands with soap throughout the day, bought brand new towels (and washed those in hot water before using them), constantly used brand new razors, new body poufs (mesh sponges), use Head &amp; Shoulders with pyrithione zinc, leaving it on for 2 minutes and rinsing off, and I did this for 2 weeks. Then the infection came back. So I did it again. Then it came back. So I left it on for 20 minutes. Then 30 minutes. Then I got Nystatin from the doctor. He wouldn't give me oral antifungal medication, because he said the infection wasn't bad enough to need both. But if I use standard body wash for all of 2 days, the odor is practically blinding! The Head &amp; Shoulders just makes it possible for me to be around people without offending them too much. I tried to explain this to the doctor, but he wouldn't listen. Anyway, I used the whole tube of Nystatin, then the infection just came right back. Just like my h. Pylori does. So should I use Hibiclens? That stuff is expensive, and I can't afford to spend a single penny on something that isn't going to work.\n\nSorry for the long post. I'm just really desperate for answers, and figured the more I share, the better.\n\nTL;DR: I might have CVID, and I'm battling constant fungal infections. It has persisted despite pyrithione zinc and Nystatin. The doctor wouldn't give me an oral antifungal, but the infection would probably just come back anyway.

I had cancer in 2013, aggressive treatment, which has kept me cancer-free, but not without many complications... including now being primary immune. The treatment that saved my life also destroyed my immune system, which never recovered.  I've been constantly sick for 6 years; infection after infection... mostly URI, but also got shingles, pneumonia a few times, multiple flu incidents (after getting the shots), cellulitis, and others.  \n\nIt took a year to convince my Oncologist that something deeper was going on and he reluctantly sent me to an immunologist. The immunologist was also reluctant and downplayed everything and said he's not likely to find anything... well, guess what?  After my blood work came back, he immediately called me because I no longer had an immunity to pneumonia bacteria among other things.  I felt vindicated knowing that I knew what the hell I was talking about, but sad that now I have a whole other thing to deal with... \n\nI started on Cuvitru, which was fantastic and noticed an immediate improvement. However, it's expensive and my insurance refused to let me continue after the trial period.  They put me on Hizentra and I don't know if it's helping or not.  I still get sick, maybe not as frequent... but it's 8 needles for the infusion every 2 weeks.  It's so depressing.  \n\nI've missed a lot of work due to illness and I'm on FMLA, but it's hard to smile anymore.  Everything is all about me all the time because I have so many appointments, working with insurance, the in-home agency, ordering supplies, or I'm sick, or I'm exhausted...or or or... and my family suffers.  My wife has been with me through everything and I love her to death, but our relationship has also suffered.  My kids are small, so mostly they don't understand except that 'daddy is sick again'....  Most of my friends have abandoned me over the past few years and I don't blame them.  It's been impossible for me to do anything, so they stopped asking.   My boss has been understanding, but I can sense the frustration when I have to miss another day of work... like today.  It's getting to the point where I don't enjoy anything anymore.  I used to be a very fun person and now I'm broken; my confidence has been shattered and I'm riddled with anxiety and depression.

I'm not sure if this belongs in here, so if not feel free to delete.\n\nFirst of all - I'm in Germany, so I might be a bit unsure regarding terminology. So please forgive/bare with me.\n\nI am currently 35 y/o. Back in 2005 I had a sepsis due to an insect bite (strep bacteria got into the wound). I was in artificial coma and in hospital for 4 months. Had roughly 30 surgeries/full anesthetics for wound care. Also numerous blood transfusions.\n\nIn 2008 I started getting abscess. This lead to a nephrectomy in 2009. After this I was sent to an immunologist for the first time. He was really good. We tested absolutely everything. All autoimmune diseases. There were a few things, but mostly they were able to be reversed (like secondary hyperparathyroidism due to Vitamine D deficiency and a pretty severe anemia and had Ferrum infusions for that).\n\nWhat stuck was the C4 complement deficiency. My C3 however is OK (well, borderline but still within parameters).\n\nI dealt with the abscess for years, but it eventually rather suddenly stopped. However the constant infections didn't really. In 2018 I had surgery because of a myoma removal which lead to a nasty abscess between bladder and uterus. And recently I've started to get skin infections again. Not as bad as previously, but it's still happening. Which naturally worries me because I only have one kidney left.\n\nI moved to a different city and the immunologist I went to then was horrible. I'm currently looking for a new one.\n\nCan anyone give me some advice on what tests I can suggest? Or what else they could look for?

The past 5 years this seems to be getting worse with up to 15 UTIs a year, normally 4+ progress to kidneys. I also get tonsilitis 3-5 times a year and normally have 2-3 chest infections requiring antibiotics. Had pneumonia multiple times but not hospitalised. I had chickenpox 3 times as a kid quite severely, have had covid twice (once before and once after double vacc - bedbound 1st time but not hospitalised, less severe 2nd). \nI noticed throughout the pandemic I was getting far fewer infections when we were in lockdown but now we have opened up they seem to be coming thick and fast. And I am back to having an infection of some description once a month that stops me working and socialising - finding it a bit depressing to be honest.. \n\n Ive been seeing urologists about the UTIs for years and am now on long term antibiotics (cephalexin 3x a day), which seems to keep them at bay. Recently he has referred me back to gastroenterology to check my spleen (hyposplenism is associated with coeliac), so i am awaiting ultrasound and gastro are considering refering me to an immunologist. \n\nI just wondered whether my history sounds familiar to any of you who have been diagnosed? From the reading I have done it seems very severe sinus/chest/gut infections are a more common indicator  and people are normally diagnosed as kids. I also know I do produce IgA as it shows up on my coeliac tests - so presume I cant be IgA deficient. \n\nAny advice welcomed - TIA", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "primaryimmune", "subreddit_id": "t5_32tl9", "subreddit_subscribers": 440, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for advice - history of recurrent infections, could it be PID?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/primaryimmune/comments/r2oo05/looking_for_advice_history_of_recurrent/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LulaDV", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_68owejm8", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1637641909, "domain": "self.primaryimmune", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/primaryimmune/comments/r04wsz/selective_iga_deficiency/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r04wsz", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/primaryimmune/comments/r04wsz/selective_iga_deficiency/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1637641919, "score": 1, "selftext": "I know this is the second post about a new Selective IgA Deficiency diagnoses in this sub, so please forgive me.

immunocompromised and 3rd shot.**\n\nAbout 44% of breakthrough infections are immunocompromised people.\n\nThat's why a group of independent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention experts at a Thursday [July 22nd] meeting largely voiced support for allowing immunocompromised people to talk to their doctors about getting a third shot, a booster, that could increase their antibody response to vaccines.\n\n**Data presented at the meeting said a booster shot could increase antibodies in an immunocompromised person by up to 50%.**\n\nBut the advisory committee *didn't make a formal recommendation*, saying more data was needed and, **ultimately, regulatory allowance from the Food and Drug Administration.** [this is 2+ months out]**\n\nPatients who are severely immunocompromised may produce replication-competent virus beyond 20 days after symptom onset or, for those who were asymptomatic throughout their infection, the date of their first positive viral test. Consultation with infectious diseases specialists is recommended.Jun 2, 2021\n\n(BTW, not in this article but others. The vaccines currently do not protect against Long Covid which can be acquired during breakthrough or asymtomatic.\u00a0 Dysatonomia is prevalent in long covid and is hitting women at 50% greater chance and a scarily higher percent among 6-15 yo that catch COVID. I have Dysautonomia secondary to another medical condition, and THIS IS NOT A DISORDER TO TAKE LIGHTLY)\n\nI still act as if I am unvaccinated (you can get a spike protein from labcorp to check antibody response)\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cdc-advisory-committee-voices-support-immunocompromised-people-boosters/story?id=79001113\u00a0\n\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/564421-cdc-panel-weighs-whether-to-recommend-boosters-for-immunocompromised\n\n**I am getting my third dose of Phizer through my family doctor**\n(first 2 were through the state mass vaccination).  Prior to this coming out they had set up a to have a vaccine (delivery?) company come to their office Aug 6th and set up a vaccine clinic (they do this for flu too)\n\nMy immunologist works for Duke and they DID NOT give ANY vaccines not make individual recommendations.  Just a 'duke policy statement' when I asked 3 weeks ago.\nMajor hospitals are doing a CYA by not giving vaccines in case problems arise later so the don't get sued.\n\n**Prior to the above CDC position,  my PCP agreed to give a 3rd shot if I wrote a \"Will not hold liable\" statement for my record.**", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "primaryimmune", "subreddit_id": "t5_32tl9", "subreddit_subscribers": 402, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "CDC advisory committee voices support for immunocompromised people getting boosters (July 22, 2021).

I just wanted to share my experience getting my first covid vaccine this past week.\n\nBackground info: IgG subclass deficiency, get Hyqvia sub-q every three weeks. I had a regular appointment in December with the doctor who oversees this treatment, and we discussed the vaccine then. He gave me a letter to bring with me when I got the vaccine. We thought it might be needed to prove I am high-risk.\n\nI went for my appointment Wednesday. They asked several question upon intake at the vaccine center I went to. One of the questions was something like \"Have you received anything with plasma in the last ninety days?\". So, since I am always honest with medical people, I told them yes. WELL. They were not familiar with subcutaneous immunoglobulin, and they had a few others come over and they grilled me about my condition and the exact nature of my plasma therapy. I had to explain in full, glorious detail what a Primary Immune Deficiency is, what it means for me medically, what the sub-q is, and that I will get it every three weeks for the rest of my life. I finished up with, \"I discussed the vaccine with my supervising physician in December, and I have a letter here from him saying I should have the vaccine.\" I pulled the letter out of my purse and handed it over.\n\nThey eventually decided it was okay for me to have the vaccine, but I would have to wait around longer than the standard 15 minutes afterwards, just to be on the safe side. I had blocked out my entire afternoon for this, so I was fine with that decision. I got the vaccine, waited my full time they wanted me, and left.\n\nAs for side effects, my arm felt like I had been punched for about 24 hours afterwards, but my mobility was better than it was when I got my last tetanus shot. I also, starting when I woke up Thursday morning, was utterly exhausted. The exhaustion lasted until Friday evening. It is now Saturday morning and I feel fine. Based on this and what others have told me about side effects from the second shot, I am planning on taking a sick day from work the day after my second one.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "primaryimmune", "subreddit_id": "t5_32tl9", "subreddit_subscribers": 347, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Covid vaccine experience", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/primaryimmune/comments/l8pjck/covid_vaccine_experience/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Digitallychallenged", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_iwm0v", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1611982720, "domain": "discord.gg", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/primaryimmune/comments/l8eagy/discord_for_pi/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l8eagy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/primaryimmune/comments/l8eagy/discord_for_pi/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "link", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "ACh9MGXDFbyd75olyncSz7Z_BbgNzXooYGUNKM1tumA", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/HIiPiorxnL8N1l5IbAZhdapd6Kzwo7OCN13IoBlxm8A.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2033e2a60ccf80dc10d7d9a4b61d7c821d2567c", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/HIiPiorxnL8N1l5IbAZhdapd6Kzwo7OCN13IoBlxm8A.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9f7f16874b619dce8702ca3de6d166d9d03a1ed", "width": 216}], "source": {"height": 256, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/HIiPiorxnL8N1l5IbAZhdapd6Kzwo7OCN13IoBlxm8A.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e092a97743a93106860d66eb816f392f59fcdb49", "width": 256}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1611982731, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "primaryimmune", "subreddit_id": "t5_32tl9", "subreddit_subscribers": 346, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Discord for Pi", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://discord.gg/ThkqqRN", "url_overridden_by_dest": "https://discord.gg/ThkqqRN"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "StrikingWatercress35", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7ynee8x3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1611933848, "domain": "self.primaryimmune", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/primaryimmune/comments/l7v7wq/fed_up/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l7v7wq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/primaryimmune/comments/l7v7wq/fed_up/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1611933859, "score": 1, "selftext": "My immunologist suspects the I have a PI and I am fed up with how many tests they are ordering.

Even after the vaccine I\u2019ve been still constantly getting sick and it\u2019s gotten significantly worse since I had my gallbladder removed this past October. In the past two months I\u2019ve been sick like 5 times now. It\u2019s like I\u2019m sick for a week, fine for a week and then sick again. And it\u2019s starting to really piss off my boss because every time I get sick I have to get tested for covid and have to miss work while waiting for results (I work in a daycare).\n\nIs it worth going back to an immunologist and if so is there anything they can do for me? I feel like it\u2019s extra hard right now because most doctors in my area won\u2019t see you if you are showing any symptoms. I just had to get tested again because I was sick during our winter break and never got tested and just stayed home to be safe but felt fine once I went back to work but then realized I had no sense of smell. I feel like my boss thinks I\u2019m just trying to get out of work but I\u2019m really not. In a normal year I would just hop myself up on medication and go to work.
