Anticonvulsant drugs failed to achieve complete control of his convulsions.

This heterogeneous group of diseases includes serious or fatal neurological presentations such as Leigh syndrome and there are very limited evidence-based treatment options available. Here we describe that cell membrane-permeable prodrugs of the complex II substrate succinate increase ATP-linked mitochondrial respiration in CI-deficient human blood cells, fibroblasts and heart fibres. Lactate accumulation in platelets due to rotenone-induced CI inhibition is reversed and rotenone-induced increase in lactate:pyruvate ratio in white blood cells is alleviated. Metabolomic analyses demonstrate delivery and metabolism of [13C]succinate. In Leigh syndrome patient fibroblasts, with a recessive NDUFS2 mutation, respiration and spare respiratory capacity are increased by prodrug administration. We conclude that prodrug-delivered succinate bypasses CI and supports electron transport, membrane potential and ATP production. This strategy offers a potential future therapy for metabolic decompensation due to mitochondrial CI dysfunction.\n\nhttp://chemicalland21.com/industrialchem/organic/SUCCINIC%20ACID.htm\n\nSuccinic acid is available on ebay, amazon, and if you do some googling on other websites also ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mito", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wwei", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Succinic acid treats MELAS, Leigh syndrome, mitochondrial diseases", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/7ha4oq/succinic_acid_treats_melas_leigh_syndrome/"}, {"author": "josuecarvalho", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1509927045, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/7b1g62/fui_parado_na_blitz_com_xj_6_nao_deixei_levar_a/", "id": "7b1g62", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/mito/comments/7b1g62/fui_parado_na_blitz_com_xj_6_nao_deixei_levar_a/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "vNLeqrb6zfc-No8rNijsV9YinfHDV0OR-3d-4jtALS4", "resolutions": [{"height": 144, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/2HXpmmvnNCDmdRtcY-DRJyLf-OpIIxJMGXEPxAHDAwg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=9925d958e68d921958c2cc738c7efa63", "width": 108}, {"height": 288, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/2HXpmmvnNCDmdRtcY-DRJyLf-OpIIxJMGXEPxAHDAwg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=e3ac3e4a2371432f20f9218214607448", "width": 216}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/2HXpmmvnNCDmdRtcY-DRJyLf-OpIIxJMGXEPxAHDAwg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=f867800cc00da746c8b41857887b474b", "width": 320}, {"height": 853, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/2HXpmmvnNCDmdRtcY-DRJyLf-OpIIxJMGXEPxAHDAwg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=854d01ec5c578026a030bac544b01981", "width": 640}, {"height": 1280, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/2HXpmmvnNCDmdRtcY-DRJyLf-OpIIxJMGXEPxAHDAwg.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=d4eb017d7d175e0a173405c361b37cee", "width": 960}], "source": {"height": 1280, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/2HXpmmvnNCDmdRtcY-DRJyLf-OpIIxJMGXEPxAHDAwg.jpg?s=15f936c7e6552ec6e95d16a8ac43086b", "width": 960}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1510009360, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mito", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wwei", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jaboQt2OEdawSJPFjFZMGsPoRKquEnbyDz1RYSmyV0s.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Fui parado na blitz com xj 6 nao deixei levar a moto?", "url": "https://i.redd.it/dof43s0sy8wz.jpg"}, {"author": "Forevernevergiveup", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1507703448, "domain": "self.mito", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/75n9s9/any_specialists_for_mito_that_also_exam_adults/", "id": "75n9s9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/mito/comments/75n9s9/any_specialists_for_mito_that_also_exam_adults/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1507783607, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello,\nThank you for taking your time to read this and answer my questions. I really appreciate it! I've been looking for some type of specialist that could rule out, or confirm the possibility of mito. However a majority of places I see when looking up doctors is mainly pediatric. I am a 20 year old female. If anyone knows of any in or close to Missouri they would suggest I'd be very grateful.\n\nI have had issues with various symptoms that previous doctors can't seem to connect together because some of them are all over the place. I have seen neurologists, done a spine and brain MRI, eeg, ncv, and emg. yet they can't find answers for my symptoms on any of those tests. I am also on the autistic spectrum however I think I could be possibly considered Atypical as I don't show every trait of it but I was still diagnosed with it. \n\nMy symptoms involve Headaches, pain, heat flashes and sometimes I'll get really cold too (when nobody else is feeling that way), I find myself having issues being in the heat for too long, it makes me miserable. I feel as if my muscles in the back are getting kind of tensed up. I don't know how to describe it though. If I get really cold then my body aches. I get cramping in the legs especially at night or morning. I get irritable bowel issues and acid reflux along with vomiting. Sometimes I will get sick just a few minutes after eating. That doesn't happen to often but it has. When I was younger I failed to gain much weight. I didn't want to eat much but even when I ate well I didn't gain too much weight, I have some extra weight on my belly now but that's due to having elevated level of a hormone (DHEA)  I am going to another doctor to look into that. Even with that though I noticed I don't gain weight too much in my arms and legs. I got glasses when I was younger and over time I have noticed I can't see far or close well anymore, both are blurry. Before I could see close pretty well. I've had my eyes checked out and was told it's just a matter of my eyes not focusing. I get really tired muscles other than cramping and they'll do a twitchy spasm type of sensation  in various regions of my leg and especially my feet. my eyelid twitches sometimes and the other day I did feel a weird kind of light spasm in one of my cheeks. I get tired easily doing things, my legs feel like they ran a marathon after going up the stairs. Which aren't even that long at all. \nI went to a podiatrist for feet related pains too and she said I had a so far mild case of hammer toes and my ankles turn in so when I stand my ankle tips inward although just like hammer toes at moment it's mild.\nBoth my parents and another medical professional I see think that it would be worth getting it checked out.\nIf you can suggest anybody in Missouri or nearby that would see adult patients that would be helpful. \nAlso if you think that perhaps there are other things I could check to rule out that sound similar in symptoms please let me know. Keeping in mind though, all those tests I mentioned I did with Neurologists.

Will it help reduce my migraine and/or hearing loss?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mito", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wwei", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How much do supplements help?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/73trz0/how_much_do_supplements_help/"}, {"author": "73888234234", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1503168858, "domain": "self.mito", "edited": 1503169373, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/6uqud0/probably_not_mito_but_puzzled_and_so_annoyed/", "id": "6uqud0", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/mito/comments/6uqud0/probably_not_mito_but_puzzled_and_so_annoyed/", "retrieved_on": 1503263510, "score": 2, "selftext": "Been dealing with a couple of problems for most of my life and wonder if they are related and if I should push my gp for further testing:\n\n1. frequent crashing. With that I mean I could have a big breakfast and go for a walk in the park. After just over an hour my energy is up and I end up with symptoms that people associate with proper hypoglycemia. My sugar is absolutely normal though. If I crash then I crash the next day at the same time again even if I just sit around and eat in time. The later in the day it gets the smaller of risk of crashing. Hence I do all sport and other activities in the evening. If I do strength training those crashes vanish completely within a few days and stay away for weeks more months to come. It's as if strength training causes more cells related to energy production or utilisation to form, which then die off with a normal life span if I stop working out for some reason. I still get hungry fairly quickly though.\n\n2. I cannot walk uphill and/or run properly. My legs get superheavy after a few steps and I breathe heavily as if there's not enough oxygen in the air. When walking uphill I need to stop after 100-200 steps for a few seconds and then I feel fine again. Rinse and repeat. All the cardio, strength training, core exercises, etc have not changed anything at all. I feel my energy drain when I run over a tiny speed bump that I can cross in 1-2 steps! Been trying to run longer/faster for years now without success. just exchanging a lightbulb overhead or doing something with stretched out arms might cause extreme muscle weakness in my arms that might last for days. As such, doing pushups against a wall is more difficult for me than trying to do any on the ground. However, I've been experimenting with gels lately and am all of a sudden able to run faster and longer than ever before, heavy legs gone. I climbed up 700m of elevation with gels and only needed two short stops at the steepest part instead of dozens of stops. Looks like my body needs this big pack of sugar (or any of the electrolytes in it) to provide me with the energy I need. \n\n3. Every now and then after a very hard cardio session I wake up at night being out of breath. It feels like there's less oxygen in the air. This stays present for 2-3 weeks and it worst at nights. It's not an obstruction, not panic. Airways are free. Often an urge to exhale and kussmaul breathing, hyperventilation or a slightly elevated heartrate (accidental double thyroid medication dose) seems to give temporary improvement. Mg citrate or Ca citrate seem to help against this within 60-90 minutes. As those don't work as an antacid I guess it's not a silent reflux problem.\n\n4. I can gain and lose weight like any other normal person. If I overeat I gain. If I'm in a crash phase I might gain some weight though to prevent crashes and from being constantly hungry. My BMR seems to be quite a bit higher than calculators suggest. Thus if I want to lose half a pound per week then I might actually lose a pound or more, using myfitnesspal and weighing and logging accurately. I can only lose weight though if I add strength training due to being constantly hungry and crashing otherwise. \n\nBlood tests show up as normal apart from a slightly lower albumin. Lung function test and xray is normal. ECG normal. I'm having a heart sono and will be seeing a respiratory specialist soon but I also doubt it's this. Somehow it all seems to be related to some 'metabolic' issues considering I get hungry so quickly, and that I don't seem to be pulling much energy out of fatty or protein-rich food but a big dose of sugar from a gel seems to help. It certainly doesn't seem to be a progressive issue or it progresses so slowly that I don't notice it. \n\nDoes this sound familiar to any of you?

the deal:\n\n\nI've had serious symptoms for 5+ years. After all the tests, misdiagnoses, bullshit, etc, I found a very knowledgeable neuromuscular specialist. He ran an EMG, and is all but certain I have a mitochondrial disease. I am inclined to agree, as my current symptoms check out; and we have eliminated just about everything else. \nHe orders a muscle biopsy to confirm. I check that out, confirm that it is covered by insurance, and have the procedure run. We are told we will have results in two weeks.\n\n\nFast forward, I get a call from my neurologist's office explaining I need to sign a consent form from a lab. Here's where I get a nasty surprise. The tests required might not be covered, making me liable for $3,000+ dollars if it isn't covered and they run the test. It is unlikely that my insurance will cover genetic testing, though I am still in the process of finding out whether or not they will.\n\n\nHere lies the dilemma. What do I do? Tell them not to run the test, after going through a very painful, very expensive, very invasive procedure? Here's what I want to ask:\n\n\nWhat are my options here? Are there any organizations who will help me pay for the testing? How would you come at this bill? Has anyone been through this?\n\n\n I am only 19 years old, a novice when it comes to handling these things. I am stuck and discouraged and looking for help.

So, here I am.\n\nFirst, I'll start off with summing up the issues I've had in the past (or still have), that I think might fit a mito-related illness.\n\n* Stiffness\n   * Even came out of the womb stiff (doctors weren't able to measure me correctly and eventually guessed my length).\n   * Never been able to reach my toes; on good days I can reach just below the knee.\n   * After higher-level activity, I'm often so stiff, I can barely walk up the stairs.\n* Fatigue/sickness\n   * Since I was about 7, I've had periods of around two weeks where I was fatigued, nauseous and had headaches. When I was 13, these periods ended.\n   * At 14 I became very fatigued at all times. Eventually, at 17 I've been diagnosed with ME/CFS. I've had cognitive behavioural therapy and have been less fatigued since.\n\nBut... The muscle issues have gotten worse since then (where they had to slowly fade since they were said to be related to the ME/CFS)\n\n* Muscles (from now on, everything seems to progress and get worse over time)\n   * Acidification of the muscles at higher level activity since I was about 14 (noticeable).\n   * Feeling of 'ants crawling in my leg' after medium level activity (vary's, sometimes after walking for an hour, sometimes after 15 minutes)\n   * Muscle cramps\n   * Muscle trembles at random moments (also without any activity), mostly in my legs, sometimes in my fingers.\n   * Loose off strength after activity (for example, not being able to hold the dog (around 50 pounds/25 kilo's) after he attacks another dog. I have enough strength to hold his attack, but I'm exhausted and can't handle the slightest pull on the leash afterwards)\n   * The overall feeling of not being able to gain strength. No matter how often I train, I get stuck at this one point and just can't train further.\n\nMy dad has about the same issues ('just' more severe) at 59. The difference is that he has had a few diagnoses over the past years and the doctors blame those diagnoses for his health complaints. But when he went to see a retired neurologist who makes ultrasounds of the muscles, he saw that his muscles looked like they are affected by a myopathy-disease. So my dad went to a specialist who said that the neurologist was talking nonsense (and that you aren't able to see it with ultrasound). He did take some blood after letting my dad walk up one staircase to check his acid-levels and concluded that it wasn't myopathy  (on hindsight, we think this might have been obvious since my dad isn't able to walk up one staircase at such a pace he feels any acidification). We felt very defeated because the symptoms seemed to line up so perfectly with ours and now we were told it couldn't be it.\n\nNow, a few years later, I'm taking it upon me to go back to the doctors. After seeing some stuff online about misdiagnosis and still suffering from the same issues and still getting worse, I'm done (again) and want answers. Looking back, I'm getting angrier and angrier at the doctors for not looking at the fact that father and daughter are having the same symptoms. For me to feel like I'm overreacting and just have to train more (so done with that).\n\nI've had my first appointment at my (new) GP, who isn't taking me very seriously. I've been sent to let my bloodwork\u200b test for any deficiencies, which we (both my dad and I) have had checked so many times now. I've never had any deficiencies, my dad has had some and they've focussed on that so he hasn't been referred to any specialist (they just said: 'oh, you have got a vitamin D deficiency, that explains it! Try vitamins for half a year!' And half a year later he had another deficiency (B12, B6, magnesium, vitamin K, he's had them all)). I know I shouldn't compare with my dad, but it just doesn't help my frustration...\n\nWhat might help are insights from people who've had similar issues/know what to ask/look for.

I'm wondering if anyone here thinks that my symptoms could point to a mitochondrial disease of some kind. I'm in my early thirties and have been experiencing the following since I was about 20 or so:\n\n\\- Weird symptoms in the days or weeks following exercise - I experience heart palpitations, an overall feeling of weakness through my body, light headedness and like I might faint, although I never have, and shortness of breath.\n\n\\- Muscle weakness to some muscles - For example I'll often pull muscles in my legs just from the weight of the blanket in bed. This weakness doesn't happen to all my muscles however.\n\nAm at the end of my tether trying to find out what/if something is wrong with me. I'm scared to exercise now and want to know what is happening.

While this isn't anything to be bothered by, it can still prove to be a difficult transition to accept. At least, that was the case for me.

It's not worth it to pull out the chair. (I also had hangups about using the store scooters).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then we went to Disney World, where I used my chair for the first time. And my perspective on the chair did a 180. Contrary to what I thought would happen, I gained more independence. I realized that I wasn't obsessing over the park map looking for the most efficient route. I could enjoy the day with my family. I didn't have to constantly rest. I wasn't grumpy and over-stimulated from pain. No seizures induced by exhaustion (that happened last time). I was still laid up afterwards, but it was only for one day instead of three.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I use my chair whenever I can. I always thought I hated shopping.

One [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180326161004.htm)  found that on average, patients saw more than eight different physicians prior to getting a diagnosis. More than half of the participants reported being misdiagnosed, and of these, nearly one-third were misdiagnosed more than once. \n\nThis was definitely the case for me. I first presented symptoms when I was 14 years old, but wasn't diagnosed until I was 19.  I went through myriads of tests, nearly all of which came back normal (because they weren't running the right tests!).   \n I *definitely* saw more that eight doctors, and was misdiagnosed with Fibromyalgia. Other doctors insinuated that my pain was psychosomatic. \n\nI was finally diagnosed when my neurologist asked a colleague to conduct an EMG. I was surprised to hear that it came back abnormal, as nothing else ever had. Metabolic panels came back abnormal as well. Although the muscle biopsy came back negative for the most common mitochondrial diseases, I was diagnosed with primary mitochondrial myopathy based on my existing symptoms and test results.  My doctors were sure of it.\n\nAlthough I wasn't happy to discover that my condition was incurable, I felt immense relief to finally have a name for it. More importantly, my pain was validated. I finally knew that it wasn't in my head. I honestly think that was the most important realization I got from being diagnosed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what about you?

I've never posted here so by way of background, my son has a non-definitive diagnosis of \"probable suspected mitochondrial dysfunction,\" woo hoo for uncertainties.  I chose not to pursue definitive diagnosis due to the invasiveness of the muscle biopsy and the expense and lack of finality of the genetic tests, but based on presentation and an experimental buccal swab test then in clinical trial, the doctor thought it very likely he had something going on.  She thought it was OK to delay pursuing definitive diagnosis because his clinical presentation did not seem to be super-urgent.  However, it is extremely odd living without knowing for sure, and this has led me to occasionally not fully manage him based on an assumption that he needs that.  \n\n\nLately he's been sick the past couple of days, though, and my husband and I noticed something kind of strange.  and that is, that he keeps spiking a fever (up to 102 a couple of times), but then after eating, it falls back down by a couple of degrees!  \n\n\nI thought maybe this was just an odd coincidence, but truly I've never seen anyone's fever go up and down so many times in a single day without any fever reducing medicine.  he has not had tylenol, ibuprofen, aspirin, or anything like that.  So it's been bugging me a little bit.  \n\n\nOnly just now did I suddenly wonder:  could this be a mito thing??   Google has failed me here, so I looked for a reddit and here you are!  \n\n\nI would be very grateful to hear whether anyone here is familiar with this kind of connection with eating and fever levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mito", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wwei", "subreddit_subscribers": 155, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "When you're sick, does eating reduce your fever??", "updated_utc": 1556143219, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/bgmcb9/when_youre_sick_does_eating_reduce_your_fever/"}, {"author": "v1asfc", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_19e87ujt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1555506511, "domain": "self.mito", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/be7ls1/how_to_avoid_heavy_steps_while_walking_with_mito/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "be7ls1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/mito/comments/be7ls1/how_to_avoid_heavy_steps_while_walking_with_mito/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1555506513, "score": 2, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mito", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wwei", "subreddit_subscribers": 155, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to avoid heavy steps while walking with mito?

We often don\u2019t want to throw them away, for fear that they might be important at a later date. But even when organized by year, massive amounts of records do the average patient very little good, and are too tedious for physicians to comb through. It\u2019s important to keep you or your loved one\u2019s medical records, but organization and simplification is key. And so, here are three steps to accomplish those objectives.\n1.\tSort\nFirst, organize everything by year. Then, for each year, organize by type of information: test result, clinic note, medical record, hospital stay, etc. Further sort those categories by month, chronologically. As you do this, take out any summary pages. Make copies of those pages, and store them separately. They can be passed on to new doctors, and provide a great snapshot of the issue at that time, and simplify years of medical history.\nOnce you have everything sorted, make two piles:\n 1) summary letters and lab tests results \n2) everything else (in chronological order). \nDepending on how large pile #2 is, you may only be able to store your summary letters in your medical binder. If that is the case, store everything else in a box, organized by year and month, or symptoms, or doctor. Whatever works best for you.\n2.\tConsolidate\nYour goal here should be to consolidate the paperwork into as little as possible while providing a snapshot of you/your loved one\u2019s history of illness from diagnosis to current date. A hard-copy medical binder is helpful and recommended when travelling to appointments. However, you should also scan the content of your medical binder to a computer or USB drive for safe keeping.\n3.\tPrioritize and Summarize\nNow you\u2019re ready to put your binder together! Both a hard copy and a scanned digital copy are ideal. Additionally, put the electronic version online so that you can access in case of emergency. Google Docs or an e-mail to yourself are both easy options.\nContents of the Medical Binder (Physical and Virtual)\nSections One and Two: Basic Information\nThe first page of your medical binder should be a contact list that includes contact information for all of your physicians. You should also list three emergency contacts. The second section should include a copy of your/your loved one\u2019s innsurace card.\nSection Three: Medications\nThe third section of your binder should include a list of medications that is kept up to date at all times. Include the name of each medication, vitamin or supplement, the specific dosage, and the prescribing doctor\u2019s name. If your medication is compounded, you should request from the compounding pharmacist a list of all the medication in the compound, as well as dosage and formulation (ex: 200 mg / 5 ml)\nSection Four: Diagnosis\nPlace the most recent and most comprehensive letter from a physician that summarizes your/your loved one\u2019s history and diagnosis at the front of this section, followed by summary reports from the diagnostic lab/physician that made the diagnosis. If you are still in the process of obtaining a diagnosis, ask for copies of test orders from your physician so that tests are not duplicated.\nSection Five: Emergency Protocols\nThis section should contain any emergency protocols or medical letters. Most Mito patients need at least an emergency room letter and an anesthesia precautions protocol. Protocol samples, templates, and letters can be found at http://mitoaction.org and http://umdf.org\nSection Six: Notes from Specialists\nPlace the most recent copies of clinic notes from your specialist in this section. Remember, you\u2019re working toward a snapshot, so a summary or follow-up letter is enough. You may want to order this section by physician name, or by body system (cardiology, neurology, etc.)\nSection Seven: Hospitilizations\nAt the end of each hospital stay, the doctor who sees you or your loved one on the day you go home will write a \u201cdischarge summary\u201d that offers an overview of the reason for the hospitalization and outlines the recommended next steps. Orgaize your hospital discharge summaries by date. Do not include routine lab test results, consult notes, test orders, etc. Do include the name of the doctors who took care of you.\n\nI know it\u2019s a lot. But having everything in one place during an emergency, or even during a routine doctor\u2019s visit, is an invaluable asset in our fight.\n-Mighty\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mito", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wwei", "subreddit_subscribers": 134, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Building your medical binder", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/al1er7/building_your_medical_binder/"}, {"author": "v1asfc", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_19e87ujt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1547047762, "domain": "self.mito", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/ae7vja/can_they_detect_mito_at_defense_forces_medical/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ae7vja", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/mito/comments/ae7vja/can_they_detect_mito_at_defense_forces_medical/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1547047764, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mito", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wwei", "subreddit_subscribers": 134, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can they detect mito at defense forces medical examination?

Exercise intolerance is a hallmark characteristic of Mito. Mito patients are typically unable to withstand intense physical activity. Even VERY low-impact or small amounts of exercise can leave you feeling \u201cwiped out\u201d. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t give us a pass to be couch potatoes. Turns out, a sedentary lifestyle may actually NOT be keeping your mitochondria functioning at their best. The idea of exercise training as a treatment for Mito began after numerous research studies found beneficial effects of exercise on healthy mitochondrial. However, the question remained: How will exercise impact Mito patients?\n\nThe results are encouraging. Groups of Mito patients who participated in 12 to 14 weeks of regular exercise experienced an overall benefit as a result of the increased activity. Exercising patients demonstrated a higher base-line, less deconditioning (loss of muscle tone and aerobic ability), and a better overall quality of life. \n\nHowever, if you have Mito, it\u2019s still hard work. REALLY hard work! In fact, \u201cexercise\u201d for Mito patients is NOT the same as \u201cexercise\u201d that other gym-goers engage in. Exercise here means consistent activity that can improve your overall baseline and includes walking, paddling around in a pool, stretching, and light resistance exercises. \n\nNonetheless, the idea of exercising as well as the exercise itself is really tough for many Mito patients. Be smart, but don\u2019t give up. The key to exercising with Mito is to start slowly and be realistic about how much you can tolerate while slowly increasing the intensity and duration of the activity.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel that you can manage getting started yourself, ask your doctor about physical therapy. My neurologist sent me to PT after my left side started becoming weaker than my right, and it was eye-opening. I realized not only how weak I truly was, but also that I am capable of regular, moderate exercise. In fact, after two months of therapy, I am no longer a fall risk, and can walk half a mile without stopping on my good days!\n\nWhat about you?

(detailed)**\n\nL-Carnitine helps break down fat from the food we eat by transporting fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane before the Krebs cycle begins. Most of a person\u2019s carnitine comes from diet, though supplementation of L-Carninte for patients with Mito is common.\n\n**L-Carnitine and Mito**\n\nPhysicians recommend L-Carnitine as a supplement in the Mito cocktail in order to boost \u201cfree\u201d carnitine in the cells, with the goal of improving energy production, and increasing muscle tone and strength.\n\nAlthough L-Carnitine is a common amino acid supplement, there are no studies that demonstrate evidence of the benefit of carnitine for patients with mitochondrial disease. Despite this, levocarnitine has been one of the mainstay treatments for Mito patients. It is often prescribed as an IV solution during hospitalizations. Similarly, some patients find that doubling their L-Carnitine intake during an illness helps them feel stronger and recover more quickly.\n\n**Dosage**\n\n*Child  -* 10\u2013100 mg/kg/day (by mouth or IV), divided into three doses\n\n*Adult -* 100\u20131000 mg/kg/day (by mouth or IV), divided into three doses\n\n**Possible side effects**\n\nSome patients cannot tolerate L-Carnitine due to stomach upset. If you or a loved one experience this, make sure you are taking the dose with food; and consider speaking with your doctor about lowering the dosage.\n\nMost patients complain of a fishy odor in the urine or from the sweat glands. The odor is caused by the natural breakdown of the carnitine in the digestive system.\n\nL-Carnitine should be **used with caution in patients who have a long-chain fatty acid oxidation defect**, as there have been reports of cardiac rhythm disturbances in these patients.\n\n**NOTE: ALWAYS consult with your doctor before taking any medications, including vitamins and supplements, especially if you have mitochondrial disease. It\u2019s not smart for anyone to self-prescribe their Mito cocktail!**\n\nUntil next time,\n\nMighty\n\nSource: *Living Well with Mitochondrial Disease*, Cristy Balcells, 2012\n\n(Part 1: CoQ10 located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/8tdd0r/the_mito_cocktail_what_is_it_and_what_does_it_do/)) ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mito", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wwei", "subreddit_subscribers": 103, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Mito Cocktail: What is it, and what does it do?

my life. \n\nI'm sure you all know the process of getting answers is grueling and frustrating. An endocrinologist, just in one appointment, suggested that my symptoms are perhaps just \"autism as an adult\" and pushed for psychiatric help. It was weird. \n\nI've been looking for a new therapist anyway but my physical symptoms don't always correlate to when I'm depressed or extra anxious. It'd be different if she said \"get psychiatric help bc chronic illness is hard mentally\"; but what she suggested was it's symptoms from psychiatric problems. \n\nAnyway, my cardiologist was way better and I'm on a wait list for autonomic testing, and my current working diagnosis is chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nThe only thing is, isn't cfs just diagnosed if it's nothing else? If, after this testing, it's just cfs, should I just accept that and not look further? I'm just a bit nervous bc misdiagnoses can sometimes have consequences and treatments are different for every condition. \n\nI want to be *sure*, but I fear to make suggestions of what to test for, because I am tired of doctors suggesting it's mental (only 2 have, but after the first I didn't go to the doctor for nearly a year bc of how affected I was, and it *caused* anxiety, even though I was mentally okay besides brain fog and vision problems otherwise and frustration from my body feeling terrible).\n\nWhile neurologist pretty much sent me away without testing, said I had migraines in the past, and had no idea what I was talking about in terms of vision problems (related to not being able to focus vision/vision  when symptoms are severe/hard time seeing why night bc the lights disorient when driving, so barely driving anymore), and didn't want to investigate that. I asked him, and he literally shrugged. \n\nSo... idk, what would y'all do?

The normal QC process can detect mutated mtDNA genes during fission as all mito genes are critical and thus the mito membrane potential goes to zero if just one is defective. Greatly magnifying fission and fusion with supplements will aid that process. But there is another source of mitochondrial damage that isn\u2019t so easily eliminated \u2014 epigenetic damage. Like nDNA, mtDNA also picks up aberrant methylation with age. This methylation degrades ATP production, but the QC process doesn\u2019t catch it unless the problem is addressed at a critical time, like during biogenesis. If a mitochondrion with one loop of methylated mtDNA runs out of enzymes while involved with replication, then membrane potential may dip to zero and it will get labeled for recycling. Thanks to methylation, it won\u2019t have as much enzyme reserves as other mitochondria, so it will be preferentially targeted. Also, biogenesis is the best time to demethylate mtDNA as methyltransferase can\u2019t operate while there is only one strand.\n&gt; \n&gt; Until recently, mtDNA wasn\u2019t even known to have methylation, and researchers are still confused as to why it is there. Some speak of mtDNA hypermethylation like it is bad while normal methylation has some purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; See, for instance: [Hypermethylation of mitochondrial DNA in vascular smooth muscle cells impairs cell contractility](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-020-2240-7 \"External link\")\n&gt; \n&gt; I don\u2019t agree. I say all mtDNA methylation is bad. Methylated mtDNA mooches enzymes off other mtDNA, and because they don\u2019t produce as much ATP they don\u2019t produce as much ROS, and thus have a survival advantage as they are less prone to mutation. Eventually the cell will become full of moochers and result in fatigue and many other problems of aging.\n&gt; \n&gt; So I say get rid of them all, mutations and methylation alike.\n&gt; \n&gt; ## **The new protocol:**\n&gt; \n&gt; This new procedure is much simplified. It requires only two doses, Mito1 and Mito2, which are alternated on a daily basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Mito1 (fission)**\n&gt; \n&gt; - NAM+R, 1 g of each\n&gt; \n&gt; - AKG, 1 g\n&gt; \n&gt; - PQQ, 20 mg\n&gt; \n&gt; **Mito2 (fusion)**\n&gt; \n&gt; - GMS, 1 g\n&gt; \n&gt; - AKG, 1 g\n&gt; \n&gt; - PQQ, 20 mg\n&gt; \n&gt; NAM+R (nicotinamide plus ribose) is a fission promoter, GMS (glycerol monostearate) is a fusion promoter, AKG (alpha-ketoglutarate) is a demethylase promoter, and PQQ is a biogenesis promoter. All of these are fast acting.\n&gt; \n&gt; ## **A two week experiment using reps to failure:**\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm water was sufficient to dissolve everything, but the PQQ was taken in a capsule to insure that the other ingredients got a slight head start (probably unnecessary).\n&gt; \n&gt; Mito1 and Mito2 were taken on alternating days. Each dose was taken in the evening and reps of dumbbell curls to failure counted first thing in the morning \u2014 five or six hours after dosing \u2014 using the same arm.\n&gt; \n&gt; My hypothesis was that the number of reps would reflect mito damage. With mito fusion, enzymes are shared, thus ATP production and reps would be maximum. With fission, methylated (or otherwise damaged) mtDNA produce less ATP and reps would be minimum. The difference would reflect average damage, and if the treatment worked, the difference should decline. If all damage was removed, then the difference should go to zero.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which in fact it did. See the plot below. The y-axis shows the reps and % difference, while the x-axis shows days. The curve labeled baseline is without any treatment, and likely reflects the normal intermediate situation with mito morphology in a dynamic state. It is stable at 16 reps. The upper fusion curve is relatively flat and higher than baseline as expected, while the lower fission curve is lower than baseline, but rises to meet the fusion curve after about two weeks, and stays there. Thus the percent difference goes to zero.\n&gt; \n&gt; ##**Results:**\n&gt; \n&gt; Improvement in running endurance, reduced hunger, and reduced need for hypertension medication.\n&gt;\n&gt;Chart: https://www.longecity.org/forum/uploads/monthly_02_2021/post-19769-0-46392000-1613569420.png\n\n---\n\n# Progress Reports\n\n\n**Papadako**\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-62\n \n \n&gt; \n&gt; I have just finished my 5th cycle with the new protocol and I feel various positive effects in my clarity, strength and stamina (although I am not doing the suggested monitoring process with the early exercises).\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; What I have noticed the most though is the improvements in my sleep. The last few months I am having a really heavy schedule that limits my sleep to only 5-6 hours, which a rather limited amount of sleep and makes getting out of bed difficult. But with the protocol I feel much stronger in the morning even with only 5-6 hours of sleep. Since I am monitoring my sleep with an oura ring I am currently seeing some of the best values that I've ever had. A deep sleep of almost 3 hours, lower resting HR value of 41 and HRV of average 121ms and max around 170ms. By the way I am 40 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Turnbuckle**\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-58#entry903440\n\n&gt;Improvement in running endurance, reduced hunger, and reduced need for hypertension medication.\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=817426\n\n&gt; I've been doing this for about ten weeks and so far I'm quite happy with the results in the gym. I'm of social security age now and I'm getting the results I got twenty years ago with about one tenth the effort. And that's what I intended from the beginning--to take control of natural mito processes and accelerate them. I expect to use this another couple of months or until I get where I want to be, and then use it intermittently as required. So far I'd say that this beats C60 by a good measure. C60 does improve mito function immediately (particularly if you have damaged mitochondria) and better mito function improves cellular health. But C60 doesn't do QC on mitochondria like this does, so this is more likely to produce true and long lasting age reversal.\n\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-63\n\n&gt;More than a month has passed since my original experiment detailed in post #1739, and I occasionally check the reps, which has risen from 23 at the end of the experiment to 25 with no further treatment. A couple of days ago I decided to try a cycle as previously described with Vitamin C added at 1 gram. I didn't wait overnight as I did before, just 2-3 hours, and found that the fission reps shot up to 30. The next cycle with fusion plus C, it fell back to 25. So suddenly I had significantly higher reps (and presumably ATP) during fission. In addition, running was much easier.\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; I'm convinced that the C combined with the boost of NAD via NAM made the difference (and not primarily the variation of the timeframe), as C is known to increase ATP production in acute hypoxia, which is the situation in the biceps when working a dumbbell to failure. See, for instance--\n&gt; \n\n**jgkyker**\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=867688\n\n\n\n&gt;It has been about 2 weeks since my last update. I now have about 95%+ mobility in my left wrist. So, to summarize, it seemed like I was making little to no progress healing my wrist sprain until I began to experiment with this fission/fusion cycle. Prior to this, I seemed to consistently re-injure my sprain either while sleeping or just doing various activities. Even when I stopped jiu jitsu for 2 weeks, I did not seem to make much progress in my wrist injury. I was occasionally wearing a wrist guard.\n\n**stephen_b**\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=827778\n\n\n\n&gt;Result: nice and easily noticeable improvements on the treadmill. Very solid feeling, and about 5 bpm lower heart rate than an earlier exercise session at the same workout level. I have a long run scheduled for Saturday, where I should really be able to put it to the test.\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=898556\n\n&gt;After 11 cycles, I noticed an all time low for my resting heart rate (the suggestion for that is to measure right before falling asleep or right when waking up). It was in the mid 60s but now is around 51 bpm.\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=903647\n\n&gt;Anecdotal report. I did the original mitochondrial protocol for 15 cycles. I got to the point where the niacinamide/d-ribose combination had no subjective effect on me.\n\n&gt;I have done one fusion and one fission cycle using the updated protocol. I experienced a strong reaction to the fission day (the same low energy I had at the start of the original protocol), so I guess there is some demethylation needed there.\n\n**mitomutant**\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=885099\n\n\n&gt; One week into the simplified protocol (pqq/NAM+Ribose on alternate days).\n&gt; \n&gt; Noting better endurance at the gym (HIIT) and improved vitality, but at higher doses (NAM (2g) + Ribose (2g)) I feel light headed and slightly nauseated.\n&gt;\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=894882\n\n&gt; \n&gt; -   Peak performance (p.e. end of heavy bag round) at about the same level, maybe slightly better.\n&gt; -   Total performance, that is, the ability to keep performance at a high level during the whole training: noticeable improvement\n&gt; -   Recovery between rounds: Pretty amazing improvement.\n&gt; -   Recovery between workouts: Big improvement as well. Here, it is strange that I wake up feeling exhausted, but after an hour or so, I\n&gt; feel just fine. Before starting this protocol, the reverse was the\n&gt; norm: I would wake up refreshed and then, I would feel exhausted.\n&gt; -   No aches or tiredness, which were usual before starting this protocol.\n\n **Biotochandron**\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=887696\n\n&gt; As a sufferer from FQAD (\"Fluoroquinolone-associated disability\") I use TB's protocol to heal my severe mitochondrial damage. FQAD patients suffer from a severe (and irreversible), disabling multisymptom profile involving peripheral neuropathy, tendinopathy, joint pain, muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction and other symptoms after prescribed antimicrobial fluoroquinolone treatment. Some scientists (Golomb et al.) call it an exposure-induced mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy.\n&gt; \n&gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; This protocol is a godsend and ticket out of hell. I am hopeful that I will be a lot better in less than a year and finally achieve full healing which was unimaginable until this protocol.\n\n**Empiricus**\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=904873\n\n&gt;Benefits: Loss of abdominal fat and likely some muscle gain. My appetite, lower than usual through most of the experiment, returned in its last few days. In spite of some weight loss (around 1 kg) I'm not getting any comments about looking \"too thin\" or unhealthy (which usually happens when I lose weight). My running endurance seems to have increased. I've noticed an improvement in the quality of my sleep. A chronic cough I've had since the fall disappeared towards the end of the protocol. A scar on my leg is less noticeable. When I go in the sun I seem to be burning less.\n\n\n**PampaGuy**\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=904881\n\n&gt;Been on protocol now for 20 cycles. 74 yo., probably a lot of damage. Tried old protocol could not stay on it. Was so wiped out on fission days that I gave it up even though working. New much easier. I sleep better especially on fission days. Stay asleep for 5-6 hours without waking. More success going back to sleep. I measure progress on number of steps that I average in a week and they have been going up. Using AAKG 4,000 mg 1 hour before taking rest. I take fiber powder, and started adding GMS to the powder. Powder helps suspend GMS in the water. GMS very waxy. One person's experience.\n\n**JPY**\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=907069\n\n&gt;I just wanted to add an experience report on the new protocol. I did the previous one for around a year in 2019 to help recover from a post-viral fatigue syndrome. I saw very good results, returning to around 90-95% of my (self-assessed) pre-morbid state. I thought I would go on to reach 100% but it never quite happened. In particular, I still tended to feel washed and sleepy after exercise.\n\n&gt;I followed the new protocol as laid out by Turnbuckle, with the exception of using Prostaphane (sulforaphane) instead of GMS as a fusion promoter since it agrees with me better. You can see my results for the dumbbell test in the attached chart (using a 3kg weight). I started with a significant gap between the two days which converged around 20 cycles (40 days) at a higher strength level. So it appears that there was some lingering mitochondrial damage over-and-above what I had been able to remove using the previous protocol.\n\n&gt;In terms of results, I am now feeling a lot better after exercise and am able to push myself more without suffering a backlash after. I am also stronger and have a general sense of greater resilience (despite having a newborn and lacking in sleep). I would therefore conclude that the protocol works and is an upgrade on the previous one.\n\n---\n\n# More Background\n\nIts a very long thread here are some choice bits:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-1\n\n&gt; **Purpose:**  to increase mito fission or fusion for specific goals\n&gt; \n&gt; **Background:**  The average cell contains some one thousand mitochondria, each which contains several identical loops of mtDNA. These mitochondria are in a dynamic flux of fission and fusion, which serves to scramble the mtDNA and other mito components. This is important in maintaining a healthy population.\n&gt; \n&gt; See:  [Mechanisms of Mitochondrial Fission and Fusion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3660830/ \"External link\")  and  [Nicotinamide-induced Mitophagy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3365962/ \"External link\")\n&gt; \n&gt; **Supplements for fission:**  These are NAD+ precursors, and appear to be effective in this sequence: niacin &lt; nicotinamide &lt; NR &lt; (nicotinamide + ribose)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Supplement for fusion:**  C18:0 \u2014 stearic acid.\n&gt; \n&gt; See:  [Regulation of mitochondrial morphology and function by Stearoylation of TfR1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4561519/ \"External link\")  \u2014 \u201cWe find that animal cells are poised to respond to both increases and decreases in C18:0 levels, with increased C18:0 dietary intake boosting mitochondrial fusion in vivo.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; **Small mitochondria**  are less efficient and any problem with the mtDNA genes can be detected by the cell via the membrane potential, which marks the mitochondrion for mitophagy. Thus pushing the balance of fission and fusion in the direction of fission can clean up the population of mitochondria, and can be also used for enhancing exercise.\n&gt; \n&gt; See my thread  [Exercise Like a Girl](http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/93915-exercise-like-a-girl-a-protocol/)  for a method of combining fission with exercise to both improve the efficiency of exercise and improve the population of mitochondria.  _(For some reason this thread is locked, and even I can\u2019t post to it. So anyone wanting to discuss that here is welcome to do so._)\n&gt; \n&gt; **Large mitochondria**  are more efficient. I\u2019ve notice that using supplements that push mitochondria to smaller size don't work well with C60 (and in fact can be terrible) thus I wondered if pushing it in the other direction might make C60 more effective. I\u2019ve tried this a few times, using C60 (in MCT oil: 1-2 mg C60 and a like amount of hydroxytyrosol), and it does seem to be more effective when combined with several grams of stearic acid. At least, I\u2019m seeing hair regrowth that I haven\u2019t seen since I first tried C60 in olive oil five years ago.\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/107277-mitochondrial-dysfunction-energy-metabolism/?p=881884\n\n&gt; **Regarding Turnbuckle's protocol:** To put it simply, Turnbuckle's protocol takes our body's normal process of mitochondrial quality control and amplifies it greatly. The protocol does this by forcing the mitochondria into alternating states of fission and fusion. Normally in our bodies our mitochondria are alternating between fission and fusion at different times. Turnbuckle's protocol forces large numbers of mitochondria into extreme fission and extreme fusion all at once. If you have defective mitochondria, give turnbuckle's protocol a try, but start carefully. You will likely feel very tired during the fission stage of the protocol. If you feel tired, that is a sign that your have some defective mitochondria. You can progress through multiple cycles of the protocol until you dont feel much from the fission part. When that happens, you will know that most of your defective mitochondria have been replaced with new mitochondria. Hopefully you will feel better at this point. However, if you have some other health issue that remains unfixed, such as hypothyroidism or a methylation defect, you may continue to feel some symptoms and you may gradually build up defective mitochondria over time. You can always take turnbuckle's mitochondria protocol again throughout your life to clear out defective mitochondria.\n\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-46#entry870740\n\n&gt; I'm reposting this from post 977, as I left off some info that those who come across this from my profile page will not know. Like the purpose of this protocol, and how to take stearic acid.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Purpose:**  The average cell contains some one thousand mitochondria, each which contains several identical loops of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). With aging or with drug use (like statins), loops of mtDNA develop mutations more rapidly and cells become less efficient at removing them. Even one mutation is sufficient to shut down ATP production if this loop is alone in the mitochondria. Thus this protocol fissions all mitochondria to the minimum size containing one loop by increasing the NAD+/NADH ratio. At this maximum level of fission, cells can easily identify and remove those defective loops by the process of mitophagy. These are then replaced via biogenesis, whereby mitochondria are fused with stearic acid, and new mtDNA loops are produced using PQQ and the remaining mitochondrial mtDNA as templates. If you have a large portion of defective mtDNA*, many cycles of this 5-day protocol will be needed. You can use it once a week, or space it out as desired.\n&gt; \n&gt; * The proportion of defective mtDNA in a cell can go up to 100%, in which case the damage cannot be reversed.\n&gt; \n\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-63\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I've found intermittent fasting, with some caloric restriction, makes fission days vastly more effective, with half the dose of nicotinamide riboside (600 mg) I was previously using. I fast the day before, and the day of fission, eating two small meals from noon-6.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=884502\n\n&gt; &gt; Turnbuckle, why aren't you using NMN in your protocols?\n&gt; \n&gt; I always look for the least expensive and most available ingredients. I know that N+R works, and 4g of N+R costs under fifty cents while while 4g of NMN costs about $25 -- 50 times more. So it's an easy decision.\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=888383\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Turnbuckle,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe you had spoken about this but I cannot find it in the thread. How old do you think one has to be in order to notice a significant difference as a result of such a protocol?\n&gt; \n&gt; The indication is mitochondrial insufficiency, not age. One way to quickly tell if you might benefit is to take N+R. If you get a strong reaction to it--like weakness in the gym--then you may have substantial damaged mitochondria. To correct it, cells must have some good mitochondria (mtDNA loops), as this protocol is only a means of expanding the good population.\n&gt; \n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-55\n\n&gt;  Increasing fission will definitely reduce athletic performance if you have a lot of defective mtDNA. The reason is that multiple strands of defective mtDNA in a mitochondrion cover for one another, if the same genes are not defective. With only one loop of mtDNA in a mitochondrion, only one defective gene will shut down ATP production. Also, if you produce a constant state of fission, your mito numbers will drop, reducing performance.\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=901274\n\n&gt; US Patent application 20200054061:   [Methods and compositions for rapidly decreasing epigenetic age and restoration of more youthful function](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200054061A1/ \"External link\")\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Mentions many of the same things in this thread, like stearic acid, sulforaphane, PQQ, NR, C60, etc.\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=903827\n\n&gt;&gt; I am surprised there is no mention of carnitine in this protocol at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many things that help mitochondrial function, but are not useful here. The object of this protocol is not to coddle mitochondria, but to expose mutated and methylated mtDNA and get rid of them by a combination of mitophagy and demethylation. It's a boot camp for mitochondria, not a nursing home. See post [1739](https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=903440) for details.\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=899721\n\n\n&gt;   \n&gt; 2) Partially related, a great portion of the structure and function of mitochondria comes from proteins encoded by nuclear DNA. Are there any variations on this protocol to repair mito-related nDNA that have been damaged or mutated? I would assume the quantity of such nDNA damage would also be related to the amount of ROS produced during ATP production.\n\n&gt;While most of the genes encoding for mitochondria reside in the nDNA, the 37 genes in the mtDNA are all essential for ATP production. Since they are constantly exposed to a maelstrom of free radicals, they are damaged more frequently. The mitochondrial genes in the nucleus are far better protected, and like other genes in nDNA, are more subject to epimutations than mutations to the underlying DNA code. Epimutations impact all tissue types to varying degrees, and are hypothesized to be a primary driver of aging. Getting rid of them with stem cells is the subject of another thread -- [Stem cell self-renewal with C60](https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/100363-stem-cell-self-renewal-with-c60/), whereby stem cell pools are restored to more youthful levels to replaced old somatic cells with high levels of epigenetic damage.\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=903476\n\n&gt;&gt; Very interesting. Are you now using an AKG salt rather than arginine-AKG?\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Since we know AKG can reduce epigenetic age on its own, are you going to drop your stem cell stimulus protocol for a while and see what epigenetic age you get from just using the above?\n\n&gt;No, I didn't use a salt. Not that salts or other AKG derivatives wouldn't work, but I wanted the fastest acting form for this trial, as I had only one shot at it. And while AKG might be short acting, I saw that as perfect.\n\n&gt;And no, I don't believe AKG or its derivatives will prove that useful when used alone.\n\n&gt;Adding AKG or AAKG to my SC protocol almost doubled my epigenetic age result, which is now two decades below chronological. This didn't require constant dosing, only during the protocol. And increasing the pools of stem cells is far more useful than what AKG alone can do, which is likely reducing the epigenetic age of TACs -- the rapidly dividing intermediates between SCs (in at least some organs) and somatic cells. So while no treatment is permanent -- as aging marches on when you stop -- intervening at that intermediate level cannot be expected to be the most long lasting. When AKG is used during SC proliferation, however, the result will be much longer lasting, as SCs are a step above TACs in the cellular hierarchy. And as SC pools are magnified, so will the epigenetic effects of demethylase.\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=903560\n\n&gt;The old protocol is no longer needed. With the new protocol, mutated mtDNA will be removed first just as in the old one, as their membrane potential will zero out first, before the epimutated. It was my expectation that if epimutations were not eliminated, the experimental curves might never intersect. But they did.\n\n&gt;Results will vary according to your damage level. If you have a lot of damage, it could take a lot longer. If you have none, you will see no difference between fission and fusion. To know when you're done, keeping track of it numerically will work better than vague subjective feelings.\n\n&gt;As for AKG, I used the  [simplesa liquid](https://www.amazon.com/SIMPLESA-NUTRITION-Ketoglutarate-Supplement-Absorbing/dp/B08L71L27M/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=simplesa+akg&amp;qid=1613828088&amp;sr=8-2 \"External link\")  for the greatest bioavailability. You could use powder too, of course, though I suggest dissolving it first. For the experiment I left the PQQ in caps and took everything else in water. Taking a few grams of AAKG an hour before would also be an option. I was looking for a unitary dose, but what's the worst that could happen if you don't get that part right? It just won't work as well, I expect. And if you are monitoring your progress numerically, you will see it.\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=903874\n\n&gt;&gt; Thanks! Yeah, I'm on Keto diet and so I've easily been eating 500 gram of fatty cut of meats (chicken, beef) for dinner. Looks like 500g of chicken has 1.5gram of stearic acid, and 500gram of beef has 5grams of stearic acid. Enough to override fission, it seems! Going forward, I'm just gonna fast on fission days! Plus a tablespoon of coconut oil seems to be adding another 0.2 grams of stearic acid.\n\n&gt;That is an unrecognized downside of keto diets, that a constant high intake of stearic acid will suppress fission and mito QC.\n\nhttps://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;p=903560\n\n&gt;As for AKG, I used the [simplesa liquid](https://www.amazon.com/SIMPLESA-NUTRITION-Ketoglutarate-Supplement-Absorbing/dp/B08L71L27M/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=simplesa+akg&amp;qid=1613828088&amp;sr=8-2 \"External link\") for the greatest bioavailability.

The normal QC process can detect mutated mtDNA genes during fission as all mito genes are critical and thus the mito membrane potential goes to zero if just one is defective. Greatly magnifying fission and fusion with supplements will aid that process. But there is another source of mitochondrial damage that isn\u2019t so easily eliminated \u2014 epigenetic damage. Like nDNA, mtDNA also picks up aberrant methylation with age. This methylation degrades ATP production, but the QC process doesn\u2019t catch it unless the problem is addressed at a critical time, like during biogenesis. If a mitochondrion with one loop of methylated mtDNA runs out of enzymes while involved with replication, then membrane potential may dip to zero and it will get labeled for recycling. Thanks to methylation, it won\u2019t have as much enzyme reserves as other mitochondria, so it will be preferentially targeted. Also, biogenesis is the best time to demethylate mtDNA as methyltransferase can\u2019t operate while there is only one strand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until recently, mtDNA wasn\u2019t even known to have methylation, and researchers are still confused as to why it is there. Some speak of mtDNA hypermethylation like it is bad while normal methylation has some purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See, for instance: &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-020-2240-7\" title=\"External link\"&gt;Hypermethylation of mitochondrial DNA in vascular smooth muscle cells impairs cell contractility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t agree. I say all mtDNA methylation is bad. Methylated mtDNA mooches enzymes off other mtDNA, and because they don\u2019t produce as much ATP they don\u2019t produce as much ROS, and thus have a survival advantage as they are less prone to mutation. Eventually the cell will become full of moochers and result in fatigue and many other problems of aging.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I say get rid of them all, mutations and methylation alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new protocol:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This new procedure is much simplified. It requires only two doses, Mito1 and Mito2, which are alternated on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mito1 (fission)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAM+R, 1 g of each&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AKG, 1 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PQQ, 20 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mito2 (fusion)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GMS, 1 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AKG, 1 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;PQQ, 20 mg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NAM+R (nicotinamide plus ribose) is a fission promoter, GMS (glycerol monostearate) is a fusion promoter, AKG (alpha-ketoglutarate) is a demethylase promoter, and PQQ is a biogenesis promoter. All of these are fast acting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A two week experiment using reps to failure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Warm water was sufficient to dissolve everything, but the PQQ was taken in a capsule to insure that the other ingredients got a slight head start (probably unnecessary).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mito1 and Mito2 were taken on alternating days. Each dose was taken in the evening and reps of dumbbell curls to failure counted first thing in the morning \u2014 five or six hours after dosing \u2014 using the same arm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My hypothesis was that the number of reps would reflect mito damage. With mito fusion, enzymes are shared, thus ATP production and reps would be maximum. With fission, methylated (or otherwise damaged) mtDNA produce less ATP and reps would be minimum. The difference would reflect average damage, and if the treatment worked, the difference should decline. If all damage was removed, then the difference should go to zero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which in fact it did. See the plot below. The y-axis shows the reps and % difference, while the x-axis shows days. The curve labeled baseline is without any treatment, and likely reflects the normal intermediate situation with mito morphology in a dynamic state. It is stable at 16 reps. The upper fusion curve is relatively flat and higher than baseline as expected, while the lower fission curve is lower than baseline, but rises to meet the fusion curve after about two weeks, and stays there. Thus the percent difference goes to zero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Improvement in running endurance, reduced hunger, and reduced need for hypertension medication.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chart: &lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/uploads/monthly_02_2021/post-19769-0-46392000-1613569420.png\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/uploads/monthly_02_2021/post-19769-0-46392000-1613569420.png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Progress Reports&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Papadako&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-62\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have just finished my 5th cycle with the new protocol and I feel various positive effects in my clarity, strength and stamina (although I am not doing the suggested monitoring process with the early exercises).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What I have noticed the most though is the improvements in my sleep. The last few months I am having a really heavy schedule that limits my sleep to only 5-6 hours, which a rather limited amount of sleep and makes getting out of bed difficult. But with the protocol I feel much stronger in the morning even with only 5-6 hours of sleep. Since I am monitoring my sleep with an oura ring I am currently seeing some of the best values that I&amp;#39;ve ever had. A deep sleep of almost 3 hours, lower resting HR value of 41 and HRV of average 121ms and max around 170ms.

I&amp;#39;m of social security age now and I&amp;#39;m getting the results I got twenty years ago with about one tenth the effort. And that&amp;#39;s what I intended from the beginning--to take control of natural mito processes and accelerate them. I expect to use this another couple of months or until I get where I want to be, and then use it intermittently as required. So far I&amp;#39;d say that this beats C60 by a good measure. C60 does improve mito function immediately (particularly if you have damaged mitochondria) and better mito function improves cellular health. But C60 doesn&amp;#39;t do QC on mitochondria like this does, so this is more likely to produce true and long lasting age reversal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-63\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More than a month has passed since my original experiment detailed in post #1739, and I occasionally check the reps, which has risen from 23 at the end of the experiment to 25 with no further treatment. A couple of days ago I decided to try a cycle as previously described with Vitamin C added at 1 gram. I didn&amp;#39;t wait overnight as I did before, just 2-3 hours, and found that the fission reps shot up to 30. The next cycle with fusion plus C, it fell back to 25. So suddenly I had significantly higher reps (and presumably ATP) during fission. In addition, running was much easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m convinced that the C combined with the boost of NAD via NAM made the difference (and not primarily the variation of the timeframe), as C is known to increase ATP production in acute hypoxia, which is the situation in the biceps when working a dumbbell to failure. See, for instance--&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jgkyker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=867688\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=867688&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It has been about 2 weeks since my last update. I now have about 95%+ mobility in my left wrist. So, to summarize, it seemed like I was making little to no progress healing my wrist sprain until I began to experiment with this fission/fusion cycle. Prior to this, I seemed to consistently re-injure my sprain either while sleeping or just doing various activities. Even when I stopped jiu jitsu for 2 weeks, I did not seem to make much progress in my wrist injury. I was occasionally wearing a wrist guard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stephen_b&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=827778\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=827778&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Result: nice and easily noticeable improvements on the treadmill. Very solid feeling, and about 5 bpm lower heart rate than an earlier exercise session at the same workout level. I have a long run scheduled for Saturday, where I should really be able to put it to the test.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=898556\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=898556&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After 11 cycles, I noticed an all time low for my resting heart rate (the suggestion for that is to measure right before falling asleep or right when waking up). It was in the mid 60s but now is around 51 bpm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=903647\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=903647&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal report. I did the original mitochondrial protocol for 15 cycles. I got to the point where the niacinamide/d-ribose combination had no subjective effect on me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have done one fusion and one fission cycle using the updated protocol. I experienced a strong reaction to the fission day (the same low energy I had at the start of the original protocol), so I guess there is some demethylation needed there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mitomutant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=885099\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=885099&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One week into the simplified protocol (pqq/NAM+Ribose on alternate days).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Noting better endurance at the gym (HIIT) and improved vitality, but at higher doses (NAM (2g) + Ribose (2g)) I feel light headed and slightly nauseated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=894882\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=894882&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Peak performance (p.e. end of heavy bag round) at about the same level, maybe slightly better.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Total performance, that is, the ability to keep performance at a high level during the whole training: noticeable improvement&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Recovery between rounds: Pretty amazing improvement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  Recovery between workouts: Big improvement as well. Here, it is strange that I wake up feeling exhausted, but after an hour or so, I\nfeel just fine. Before starting this protocol, the reverse was the\nnorm: I would wake up refreshed and then, I would feel exhausted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  No aches or tiredness, which were usual before starting this protocol.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biotochandron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=887696\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=887696&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a sufferer from FQAD (&amp;quot;Fluoroquinolone-associated disability&amp;quot;) I use TB&amp;#39;s protocol to heal my severe mitochondrial damage. FQAD patients suffer from a severe (and irreversible), disabling multisymptom profile involving peripheral neuropathy, tendinopathy, joint pain, muscle weakness, autonomic dysfunction and other symptoms after prescribed antimicrobial fluoroquinolone treatment. Some scientists (Golomb et al.) call it an exposure-induced mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This protocol is a godsend and ticket out of hell. I am hopeful that I will be a lot better in less than a year and finally achieve full healing which was unimaginable until this protocol.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empiricus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=904873\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=904873&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Benefits: Loss of abdominal fat and likely some muscle gain. My appetite, lower than usual through most of the experiment, returned in its last few days. In spite of some weight loss (around 1 kg) I&amp;#39;m not getting any comments about looking &amp;quot;too thin&amp;quot; or unhealthy (which usually happens when I lose weight). My running endurance seems to have increased. I&amp;#39;ve noticed an improvement in the quality of my sleep. A chronic cough I&amp;#39;ve had since the fall disappeared towards the end of the protocol. A scar on my leg is less noticeable. When I go in the sun I seem to be burning less.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PampaGuy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=904881\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=904881&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Been on protocol now for 20 cycles. 74 yo., probably a lot of damage. Tried old protocol could not stay on it. Was so wiped out on fission days that I gave it up even though working. New much easier. I sleep better especially on fission days. Stay asleep for 5-6 hours without waking. More success going back to sleep. I measure progress on number of steps that I average in a week and they have been going up. Using AAKG 4,000 mg 1 hour before taking rest. I take fiber powder, and started adding GMS to the powder. Powder helps suspend GMS in the water. GMS very waxy. One person&amp;#39;s experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JPY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=907069\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=907069&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to add an experience report on the new protocol. I did the previous one for around a year in 2019 to help recover from a post-viral fatigue syndrome. I saw very good results, returning to around 90-95% of my (self-assessed) pre-morbid state. I thought I would go on to reach 100% but it never quite happened. In particular, I still tended to feel washed and sleepy after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I followed the new protocol as laid out by Turnbuckle, with the exception of using Prostaphane (sulforaphane) instead of GMS as a fusion promoter since it agrees with me better. You can see my results for the dumbbell test in the attached chart (using a 3kg weight). I started with a significant gap between the two days which converged around 20 cycles (40 days) at a higher strength level. So it appears that there was some lingering mitochondrial damage over-and-above what I had been able to remove using the previous protocol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of results, I am now feeling a lot better after exercise and am able to push myself more without suffering a backlash after. I am also stronger and have a general sense of greater resilience (despite having a newborn and lacking in sleep). I would therefore conclude that the protocol works and is an upgrade on the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;More Background&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its a very long thread here are some choice bits:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-1\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt;  to increase mito fission or fusion for specific goals&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt;  The average cell contains some one thousand mitochondria, each which contains several identical loops of mtDNA. These mitochondria are in a dynamic flux of fission and fusion, which serves to scramble the mtDNA and other mito components. This is important in maintaining a healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See:  &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3660830/\" title=\"External link\"&gt;Mechanisms of Mitochondrial Fission and Fusion&lt;/a&gt;  and  &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3365962/\" title=\"External link\"&gt;Nicotinamide-induced Mitophagy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplements for fission:&lt;/strong&gt;  These are NAD+ precursors, and appear to be effective in this sequence: niacin &amp;lt; nicotinamide &amp;lt; NR &amp;lt; (nicotinamide + ribose)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplement for fusion:&lt;/strong&gt;  C18:0 \u2014 stearic acid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See:  &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4561519/\" title=\"External link\"&gt;Regulation of mitochondrial morphology and function by Stearoylation of TfR1&lt;/a&gt;  \u2014 \u201cWe find that animal cells are poised to respond to both increases and decreases in C18:0 levels, with increased C18:0 dietary intake boosting mitochondrial fusion in vivo.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small mitochondria&lt;/strong&gt;  are less efficient and any problem with the mtDNA genes can be detected by the cell via the membrane potential, which marks the mitochondrion for mitophagy. Thus pushing the balance of fission and fusion in the direction of fission can clean up the population of mitochondria, and can be also used for enhancing exercise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See my thread  &lt;a href=\"http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/93915-exercise-like-a-girl-a-protocol/\"&gt;Exercise Like a Girl&lt;/a&gt;  for a method of combining fission with exercise to both improve the efficiency of exercise and improve the population of mitochondria.  &lt;em&gt;(For some reason this thread is locked, and even I can\u2019t post to it. So anyone wanting to discuss that here is welcome to do so.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large mitochondria&lt;/strong&gt;  are more efficient. I\u2019ve notice that using supplements that push mitochondria to smaller size don&amp;#39;t work well with C60 (and in fact can be terrible) thus I wondered if pushing it in the other direction might make C60 more effective. I\u2019ve tried this a few times, using C60 (in MCT oil: 1-2 mg C60 and a like amount of hydroxytyrosol), and it does seem to be more effective when combined with several grams of stearic acid. At least, I\u2019m seeing hair regrowth that I haven\u2019t seen since I first tried C60 in olive oil five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/107277-mitochondrial-dysfunction-energy-metabolism/?p=881884\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/107277-mitochondrial-dysfunction-energy-metabolism/?p=881884&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regarding Turnbuckle&amp;#39;s protocol:&lt;/strong&gt; To put it simply, Turnbuckle&amp;#39;s protocol takes our body&amp;#39;s normal process of mitochondrial quality control and amplifies it greatly. The protocol does this by forcing the mitochondria into alternating states of fission and fusion. Normally in our bodies our mitochondria are alternating between fission and fusion at different times. Turnbuckle&amp;#39;s protocol forces large numbers of mitochondria into extreme fission and extreme fusion all at once. If you have defective mitochondria, give turnbuckle&amp;#39;s protocol a try, but start carefully. You will likely feel very tired during the fission stage of the protocol. If you feel tired, that is a sign that your have some defective mitochondria. You can progress through multiple cycles of the protocol until you dont feel much from the fission part. When that happens, you will know that most of your defective mitochondria have been replaced with new mitochondria. Hopefully you will feel better at this point. However, if you have some other health issue that remains unfixed, such as hypothyroidism or a methylation defect, you may continue to feel some symptoms and you may gradually build up defective mitochondria over time. You can always take turnbuckle&amp;#39;s mitochondria protocol again throughout your life to clear out defective mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-46#entry870740\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-46#entry870740&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reposting this from post 977, as I left off some info that those who come across this from my profile page will not know. Like the purpose of this protocol, and how to take stearic acid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt;  The average cell contains some one thousand mitochondria, each which contains several identical loops of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). With aging or with drug use (like statins), loops of mtDNA develop mutations more rapidly and cells become less efficient at removing them. Even one mutation is sufficient to shut down ATP production if this loop is alone in the mitochondria. Thus this protocol fissions all mitochondria to the minimum size containing one loop by increasing the NAD+/NADH ratio. At this maximum level of fission, cells can easily identify and remove those defective loops by the process of mitophagy. These are then replaced via biogenesis, whereby mitochondria are fused with stearic acid, and new mtDNA loops are produced using PQQ and the remaining mitochondrial mtDNA as templates. If you have a large portion of defective mtDNA*, many cycles of this 5-day protocol will be needed. You can use it once a week, or space it out as desired.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The proportion of defective mtDNA in a cell can go up to 100%, in which case the damage cannot be reversed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-63\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found intermittent fasting, with some caloric restriction, makes fission days vastly more effective, with half the dose of nicotinamide riboside (600 mg) I was previously using. I fast the day before, and the day of fission, eating two small meals from noon-6.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=884502\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=884502&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Turnbuckle, why aren&amp;#39;t you using NMN in your protocols?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I always look for the least expensive and most available ingredients. I know that N+R works, and 4g of N+R costs under fifty cents while while 4g of NMN costs about $25 -- 50 times more. So it&amp;#39;s an easy decision.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=888383\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=888383&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Turnbuckle,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe you had spoken about this but I cannot find it in the thread. How old do you think one has to be in order to notice a significant difference as a result of such a protocol?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The indication is mitochondrial insufficiency, not age. One way to quickly tell if you might benefit is to take N+R. If you get a strong reaction to it--like weakness in the gym--then you may have substantial damaged mitochondria. To correct it, cells must have some good mitochondria (mtDNA loops), as this protocol is only a means of expanding the good population.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-55\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/page-55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Increasing fission will definitely reduce athletic performance if you have a lot of defective mtDNA. The reason is that multiple strands of defective mtDNA in a mitochondrion cover for one another, if the same genes are not defective. With only one loop of mtDNA in a mitochondrion, only one defective gene will shut down ATP production. Also, if you produce a constant state of fission, your mito numbers will drop, reducing performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=901274\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=901274&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;US Patent application 20200054061:   &lt;a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200054061A1/\" title=\"External link\"&gt;Methods and compositions for rapidly decreasing epigenetic age and restoration of more youthful function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mentions many of the same things in this thread, like stearic acid, sulforaphane, PQQ, NR, C60, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=903827\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=903827&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am surprised there is no mention of carnitine in this protocol at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are many things that help mitochondrial function, but are not useful here. The object of this protocol is not to coddle mitochondria, but to expose mutated and methylated mtDNA and get rid of them by a combination of mitophagy and demethylation. It&amp;#39;s a boot camp for mitochondria, not a nursing home.

Are there any variations on this protocol to repair mito-related nDNA that have been damaged or mutated? I would assume the quantity of such nDNA damage would also be related to the amount of ROS produced during ATP production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While most of the genes encoding for mitochondria reside in the nDNA, the 37 genes in the mtDNA are all essential for ATP production. Since they are constantly exposed to a maelstrom of free radicals, they are damaged more frequently. The mitochondrial genes in the nucleus are far better protected, and like other genes in nDNA, are more subject to epimutations than mutations to the underlying DNA code. Epimutations impact all tissue types to varying degrees, and are hypothesized to be a primary driver of aging. Getting rid of them with stem cells is the subject of another thread -- &lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/100363-stem-cell-self-renewal-with-c60/\"&gt;Stem cell self-renewal with C60&lt;/a&gt;, whereby stem cell pools are restored to more youthful levels to replaced old somatic cells with high levels of epigenetic damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=903476\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=903476&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Very interesting. Are you now using an AKG salt rather than arginine-AKG?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since we know AKG can reduce epigenetic age on its own, are you going to drop your stem cell stimulus protocol for a while and see what epigenetic age you get from just using the above?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No, I didn&amp;#39;t use a salt. Not that salts or other AKG derivatives wouldn&amp;#39;t work, but I wanted the fastest acting form for this trial, as I had only one shot at it. And while AKG might be short acting, I saw that as perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And no, I don&amp;#39;t believe AKG or its derivatives will prove that useful when used alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adding AKG or AAKG to my SC protocol almost doubled my epigenetic age result, which is now two decades below chronological. This didn&amp;#39;t require constant dosing, only during the protocol. And increasing the pools of stem cells is far more useful than what AKG alone can do, which is likely reducing the epigenetic age of TACs -- the rapidly dividing intermediates between SCs (in at least some organs) and somatic cells. So while no treatment is permanent -- as aging marches on when you stop -- intervening at that intermediate level cannot be expected to be the most long lasting. When AKG is used during SC proliferation, however, the result will be much longer lasting, as SCs are a step above TACs in the cellular hierarchy. And as SC pools are magnified, so will the epigenetic effects of demethylase.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=903560\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=903560&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The old protocol is no longer needed. With the new protocol, mutated mtDNA will be removed first just as in the old one, as their membrane potential will zero out first, before the epimutated. It was my expectation that if epimutations were not eliminated, the experimental curves might never intersect. But they did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Results will vary according to your damage level. If you have a lot of damage, it could take a lot longer. If you have none, you will see no difference between fission and fusion. To know when you&amp;#39;re done, keeping track of it numerically will work better than vague subjective feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for AKG, I used the  &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SIMPLESA-NUTRITION-Ketoglutarate-Supplement-Absorbing/dp/B08L71L27M/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=simplesa+akg&amp;amp;qid=1613828088&amp;amp;sr=8-2\" title=\"External link\"&gt;simplesa liquid&lt;/a&gt;  for the greatest bioavailability. You could use powder too, of course, though I suggest dissolving it first. For the experiment I left the PQQ in caps and took everything else in water. Taking a few grams of AAKG an hour before would also be an option. I was looking for a unitary dose, but what&amp;#39;s the worst that could happen if you don&amp;#39;t get that part right? It just won&amp;#39;t work as well, I expect. And if you are monitoring your progress numerically, you will see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=903874\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=903874&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks! Yeah, I&amp;#39;m on Keto diet and so I&amp;#39;ve easily been eating 500 gram of fatty cut of meats (chicken, beef) for dinner. Looks like 500g of chicken has 1.5gram of stearic acid, and 500gram of beef has 5grams of stearic acid. Enough to override fission, it seems! Going forward, I&amp;#39;m just gonna fast on fission days! Plus a tablespoon of coconut oil seems to be adding another 0.2 grams of stearic acid.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is an unrecognized downside of keto diets, that a constant high intake of stearic acid will suppress fission and mito QC.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=903560\"&gt;https://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/94224-manipulating-mitochondrial-dynamics/?view=findpost&amp;amp;p=903560&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As for AKG, I used the &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SIMPLESA-NUTRITION-Ketoglutarate-Supplement-Absorbing/dp/B08L71L27M/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=simplesa+akg&amp;amp;qid=1613828088&amp;amp;sr=8-2\" title=\"External link\"&gt;simplesa liquid&lt;/a&gt; for the greatest bioavailability.

The only brand I could find of AKG in Poland is this (&lt;a href=\"https://pl.iherb.com/pr/kirkman-labs-alpha-ketoglutaric-acid-300-mg-100-capsules/58317\" title=\"External link\"&gt;Kirkman Alpha Ketoglutric Acid 300mg&lt;/a&gt;  + 20mg of Calcium AKG + 10mg of Magnesium AKG). Would this do? If not, I&amp;#39;d have to see how to import from the USA. Ever since I moved to Europe (last month), finding supplements has been a pain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is spelled  &lt;strong&gt;Ketoglutaric&lt;/strong&gt; Acid not Ketoglutarate though. And description says, it is a buffered product. If it is the same thing, I&amp;#39;d take empty out the capsule and take this with water. Capsule might add extra few minutes to digestion speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://pl.iherb.com/pr/kirkman-labs-alpha-ketoglutaric-acid-300-mg-100-capsules/58317\" title=\"External link\"&gt;https://pl.iherb.com...-capsules/58317&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is the same thing: AKG=Alpha Ketoglutarate=Ketoglutaric acid = 2-oxoglutaric acid. This Kirkman product is good for our purposes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit":

"selftext": "So I have been seeing a geneticist who was testing me for aldosterone genetic disorders. They all came back in the clear. She brought up testing for mitochondrial diseases and something else, but was worried I may not get an answer and it\u2019s expensive. \n\nBackground\n\nAs a child I had three things I feel like fit into mito. I couldn\u2019t crawl and had to go to PT. I also had speech delays where I was in speech therapy from kindergarten to 8th grade, both developmental delays. As a young teenager I started having a lot of issues with constipation. At 19 I was diagnosed with severe constipation/gastroparesis. \n\nAs a young adult 18-now (26) I have had some of the following odd symptoms. I have poor temperature regulation and I do not sweat (mom is the same way). Postural hypotension where I briefly loose vision at times (mom also had while being a kid/teen). And I continue to have constipation issues. \n\nI used to play softball as a kid, and now I do more weight lifting and exercise. I get more fatigued then my husband during any exercise and am much sorer than he is for long periods of time. I have trouble saying I am exercise intolerant because I can still do normal day to day activities and feel like maybe I\u2019m just out of shape vs activity intolerance.

Glad I found a somewhat active mito community here, because I'm suspecting that I may be dealing with something in this vein.\n\nI've been trying to do a more strict keto diet for a number of reasons. One of which is that carbohydrates give me vascular problems; another is that they give me SIBO (small intestine bacteria overgrowth) flares. When last I left off with carbs I was eating just under 100g/day low-glycemic carb and taking a lot of cayenne with it to help with both the vascular problems and the SIBO flares. Now I'm much closer to 40g/day at most.\n\nI notice that if I let my Acetyl-L-Carnitine supplements (500-1000mg/day) slip for several days on this keto diet I start to have serious problems. I feel weak, I barely feel like myself, I feel like I have to chug salt water, and so on. Reintroducing Acetyl-L-Carnitine supplements corrects these problem. Now, if I only supplement Acetyl-L-Carnitine on keto for a while, then I end up with something that feels like adrenal fatigue. When I get in this state caffeine only makes my body hurt, I get this weird full-body malaise/nausea, and again I barely feel like myself. I find that supplementing vitamin B5 then corrects this problem, I lose the malaise and become energetic again, but then if I take too much B5 -- which is stupidly easy to do for me for some reason, I have to try to take it in 5mg increments and hit the brakes as soon as I'm at my limit -- I become dizzy and disoriented, and I have to lay off the ALCAR and the B5 for at least the rest of the day.\n\nI can't tell y'all how many ATP precursor supplements I've taken, had amazing results at first, and then hit this wall of dizziness and disorientation. Forget CoQ10, I can only take 10mg of ubiquinol before I get dizzy. Creatine is the same way: I took it religiously daily, and it gave me energy and clarity, and suddenly it started making me so disoriented I felt like I might have to crawl the next time I had do anything around the house.\n\nThese problems do seem to be exacerbated by the keto diet. I have more-than-minor problems with strenuous physical activity on this diet, and while the carnitine really helps, it definitely doesn't keep me from hitting walls. What I'm concerned about is, if I have metabolic bottlenecks where fat metabolism is concerned, what kind of toxic weirdness might be building up in those metabolic pathways? Is that part of what's contributing to the dizziness and disorientation, especially after periods where I feel fantastic and energetic after starting some CoA/ATP precursor? I really hope I'm not putting myself in danger or poisoning myself because my metabolism just can't handle living on fat alone.\n\nI think I'm going to reintroduce more low-glycemic carb for a while, just to be safe. I've been trying to figure out an optimal diet/supplement plan for a while, just because I've always had physical and cognitive problems that have contributed to a lot of tragedy in my life.

I'm waiting to do a more extensive sleep study and a Tilt table test. They also drew blood in case I showed up positive for an autoimmune disease this time around. If the tests come back normal it's back for more testing. \n\nPersonally I have been very up and down. The symptoms fluctuate a lot day-to-day. I felt almost normal one day and exerted myself only to pay for it later that evening. I've been charting the last 4 weeks of symptoms and I can't find obvious triggers for certain symptoms (migraines, nausea) whereas my limit for physical exertion depends on how \"hard\" I go (usually 2 hours of light exertion makes me crash). \n\nI appreciate everyone's support here and thank you for letting me vent.

rare 3640 A&gt;G mutation and all have a high level of it. We only found out 3 years ago when my cousin (29f) experienced multi organ failure when she got to 37 weeks pregnant. She and the baby survived but she has not been the same since, and last year it got triggered in her mom (my Aunt, 51f, who I am extremely close to) who suddenly had a MELAS episode (major stroke symptoms in occipital lobe) after being totally healthy until then. Since then she (my Aunt) has had another 2 milder MELAS episodes, seizures, and is now totally debilitated. She is cognitively ok but can barely walk and has almost no energy. We aren't sure how much of that is due to mito progression or the diazapam (to help prevent seizures) but we are kind of at our wit's end. Does anyone have a similar experience? We are in the UK and being looked after by the wonderful teams in Oxford and Newcastle (who are treating her with l-arginine and Q10 which have their own crappy side effects) and we know that since its so rare they don't have any prior experience to go by, but we are wondering if perhaps people in other countries might have some experience/new treatment options. I'm aware that probably there's nothing we can do and we just have to make the most of the totally unknown amount of time we have left with her but we want to try everything we can, just in case.

Im new here! I've got unspecified mito diagnosed. I also have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (definitely have both- my family has EDS). After my surgeries Ive had a steep decline in cognitive function. Memory, focus, attention, ect all downhill. Im a college student full-time. I have to stay full time to keep my scholarship. My worst fear and nightmare is having to drop out. Im taking 20 credit hours and its way too much but Im not sure which class I should drop (talking to my advisor tomorrow). It sounds like an awful idea obviously in hindsight, but when I signed up it was before my surgery and I was doing fine with 18 credit hrs.\n\nIn August, I had my ear tubes replaced under anesthesia. They used a single dose of propofol for the 20 min surgery. In October I underwent two small surgeries to place a neurostimulator due to my bladder being in complete failure- 0% function according to tests. I really struggled after this surgery. I ended up having two incomplete classes at the end of the semester which I have to make up by June. \n\nAnd 2021 fucked me over pretty badly. I got norovirus (which led to a decline), had a severe back injury due to a fall, and then last week I had surgery to repair my rectocele (prolapse of the wall between the vagina and rectum) and to fix my pelvic floor prolapse. Thing is... surgery went great on paper. Took under 4hrs, I was stable, they followed mito protocols, and Im healing up really nicely at home with my six tiny abdominal incisions. Problem is, despite not taking any pain meds (or anything else that can alter your cognition) for two whole days, I cant do anything. Im struggling to write this. I have to stop and read what I just typed. I tried getting onto my online class and got stuck and just cried. Im a tech person, its what Im studying. My brain is just jumbled and Im terrified. College graduation is my dream. After so many dreams have been crushed due to being sick, I cant lose this one too. I dont know how Ill complete any work. I cant even play video games like i used to, Ive gotten worse. The only time i have some amount of focus is when Im typing. But then i have to stop every 30 seconds and read things back.\n\nI just needed to vent really. But i also want to know if anyone else has gotten back cognitive function that they \"lost\" due to a stessor like surgery, an injury or the flu. Also my doctors started me on stimulants again (Ive been dxd ADHD since i was very young) and it has had almost no effect except giving me a bit more physical enegery. so i can do two rounds of PT exercises a day. Also prevents me from taking naps which I have no idea if thats good or bad.\n\nSorry this is probably all jumbled and random and doesn't make any sense but Id appreciate some support", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mito", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wwei", "subreddit_subscribers": 270, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cognitive decline- 4 surgeries in 8 mo", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/lwoxw1/cognitive_decline_4_surgeries_in_8_mo/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "burntcucumbers", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7vfm0qav", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1614056922, "domain": "self.mito", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/lq9xsl/is_it_worth_getting_an_official_diagnosis/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lq9xsl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/mito/comments/lq9xsl/is_it_worth_getting_an_official_diagnosis/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1614219819, "score": 3, "selftext": "Sorry this is a long post. Okay so me, my mom, and my sister all have similar health issues(heart issues, GI problems, muscle pain, etc) we have never known why. What led me to think it could be mito related is I have struggled with episodes of severe intractable vomiting since I was a young child, and soon after started getting migraines too. A few years ago I was diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome. My GI doctor said it was a syndrome often associated with mitochondrial disease and recommended I start mito supplements. He had me start high doses of L-carnitine, CoQ10, and Vitamin B2. Within a month or two my symptoms improved significantly, not 100% but enough that I still take all those supplements daily. I saw a geneticist(not a mito specialist but all my insurance would cover near me) \n6 months or so ago and he tested my carnitine levels. He said because they were average levels  nothing would probably show up on genome testing and didn\u2019t order it. I take high doses of carnitine twice a day though so I\u2019m not surprised it was normal. He said I probably have mito issues cause the supplements help me but did not officially diagnose me. Is there any reason to get more testing for a possible official diagnosis? Ideally I\u2019d like to have answers for me and the other women in my family struggling, but if it won\u2019t really change much, I\u2019m okay with it just being suspected. Yeah I still have a lot of symptoms but as long as my GI issues remain less frequent I\u2019m grateful.

Prior to middle school I had been an extremely active child, participating in multiple sports and constantly running and playing outdoors. By high school I was having very obvious endurance issues and chose to quit daily sports as it was simply too much to ask of my body at that point.\n\nI'm now in my early 30s, and while my symptoms aren't nearly as bad as some of yours, it's largely because of medication (Adderall, propranolol, trazodone, antihistamines) and careful attention to my diet (adequate salt and nutrient intake, CoQ10 and vitamins, etc.) and my activity level. I live in the mountains and try to stay as active as possible, but I can only tolerate occasional short, easy hikes and  downhill skiing. Some days it's incredibly difficult to complete even simple tasks. Almost every day, walking up even a flight or two of stairs leaves me breathless with chest pains and my leg muscles feeling like they're on fire.\n\nMy family history strongly suggests maternally inherited mitochondrial disease, but it's been very difficult to pinpoint. My grandmother had some form of progressive musuclar dystrophy that caused her to lose the ability to swallow and walk, and died in her early 70s. Maternal aunt 1 had a progressive neurological and bone wasting disorder that was never able to be identified prior to her death, also in her early 70s. Maternal aunt 2 has had a slew of random lifelong health issues so long it would warrant a whole separate post, but they strongly suggest mitochondrial issues. In her late 60s, out of the blue, her digestive system almost completely shut down, with multiple sites of paralysis and inability to tolerate even small, bland meals. My grandmother had a muscle biopsy which showed changes that suggested mitochondrial disease, and maternal aunt 2 had a muscle biopsy which showed \"damaged ribosomes\" which was assumed to be caused by some sort of mitochondrial or metabolic disease, but that's all I know.\n\nI had a muscle biopsy at the age of 16, and it came back negative for ragged red fibers or morphological changes in the mitochondria. The only thing that seemed out of the ordinary at that time was that my citrate synthase level was abnormally low, despite my being a very active athlete at the time.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has had a similar family history or diagnostic experience. For a number of years I discounted the possibility of mitochondrial disease due to the negative biopsy, but now I'm beginning to question that. I'm strongly considering seeking diagnostic testing again, but I'm not even sure where to begin. Any advice or shared stories would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mito", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wwei", "subreddit_subscribers": 257, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Questions about Diagnosis", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/l78d9d/questions_about_diagnosis/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "carlyg92", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4p916dqa", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1611616380, "domain": "self.mito", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/l509xg/new_here/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l509xg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#7193ff", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Advice Request"}], "link_flair_template_id": "04bc75d0-7733-11e8-835e-0ef626a84c2a", "link_flair_text": "Advice Request", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/mito/comments/l509xg/new_here/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1611616391, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys \nI have pots and CFS and am getting tested for a lot \nI requested mito testing because my muscles are stiff a lot of the time, fatigue is a bitch and the way I go through food but am always miserable is so weird to me. \nAnyone deal also with spleen issues?

Asked me all kinds of questions, and said \"that's really fascinating, I mean not that you have a debilitating muscle disease, but...\" (which I thought was hilarious and agreed with him that the science behind it is interesting). It was so refreshing to have a medical professional be so engaged and looking to learn about it. I ended up giving him info for the mitoaction.org website, and he said he'd look into it. \n\nIt's just really nice when doctors actually know what your rare disease, instead of having to explain it to them.

I'm able to breathe, but it feels like the oxygen isn't going anywhere. A few days later I get what feels like neuropathy in my lower leg and lower arm that gets more extensive over the next few days. It's primarily in the left side of my body. So now I have pain/coldness/clamp-like feeling at the original spots, and mild tingling in thigh, torso and face, only left. As good as nothing on hands and feet. It literally stops at wrist and ankle! First time round it took nearly a year to heal completelt. The shortness of breath at night is just mild now, but the neurological problems will likely get a bit worse still until everything stops. Btw, I tried not sitting up in bed when this happened a few days ago. Kind of like: Ok, lets see if I faint. Which brought on the neurological problem: my limbs, especially on the left side again started to hurt so badly and it felt like they were bursting within a short moment that I had to sit up. Right. Won't be doing that again.\n\nHeart and lungs are ok. An angiogram of both showed no problems even at night while I had this shortness of breath. I'm happy to admit that it's anxiety, but I'm not scared of this and fall asleep, and re-fall asleep without problems. And I'm not sure if one would have neurological pain for months after a few days of odd panic attacks.

Women, Europe, 40s. I finally, after more than 6 years of trying I had an appointment with an internal medicine doc this Thursday. He listened, did a blood test. And FINALLY a blood gas test. Turns out I had a mild lactic acidosis, that fully developed  a few hours later. pH 7.31, lactic acid 5.1mmol/l, bicarbonate somewhere between 20-15 (might have been an air bubble in the capillary tube or something else wrong. The pH should be reliable though). From maybe overexercising a bit too much on Monday (felt a bit on the edge of fine/sick again) and cycling 2km to hospital on Thursday - which thus made me properly sick! Meh!\n\n* So I've been getting these for the past 6.5 years, since the first time I started doing cardio exercise. Always when cardio is a bit more strenuous than planned. Always characterized by low bicarbonate, and magnesium, maybe low potassium. Never had a blood gas test even though I did end up in hospital often enough. Always get a rebound when I move a tiny bit once I feel better with yet another period of compensatory breathing. Which is great if you have a job or need to do groceries. \n\n* Since at least teens I get crashes that feel like very low blood sugar, or hitting the wall. They happen when I'm walking 3km to my gp before breakfast, when one of my endless meals is delayed a bit, when there's a bit more protein and fat in my dinner at the cost of carbs. Carbs! I need enough carbs, otherwise I crash. I also crash when I walk/stroll for more than two hours or work for more than two hours, or run for more than 80 minutes. That's the max. Which is 10km (it's super slow running). So i guess I'm hitting the wall from depleted glycogen. \n\n* oh yeah, and exercise. I remember as a 3-4 year old being sad about easter egg or treasure hunts in the village as I had no chance of finding anything. I could not run: legs get super heavy and hurt, breathing like crazy but my body still wants more. Feels like my muscles say: Oxygen? No idea what to do with that. And so a mountain hike consists of 50-300 steps up slope, literally fighting for every step, very short pause where I immediately feel better again, and then the next 50-300 steps all the way to the top. I'm thick, thus I still do this. Running feels the same, but less extreme. As long as i run slowly I might be lucky to make it to where my energy runs out. It still feels like I'm just at or above the anaerobic threshold. Oh, after 6 years of running I still can't run faster at all above. I might manage 12 minutes, just enough for yet another very sad cooper test from which I can estimate a VO2 max of around 25-28, but not longer. 'Normal' people can extend the distance and do tempo runs for 10km. \n\nSo, is there anything that feels familiar to you? For me it feels like my body is running mostly on glycogen, hence the bonking, and at least some part of it of that on anaerobic energy, especially with mild exercise. I might be totally wrong through! I'm not sure how far testing is possible here. Medical system is rather shitty and aimed at not finding out what's wrong and then patching people back together.

I am 33, was diagnosed at Emory via biopsy at age 7. For me, currently, MM has not been particularly life limiting yet. I am weak (especially upper body) and have \"bad hand days\" where opening toothpaste or turning door handles is hard. I have a mild familial tremor that is likely unrelated. When I was younger my symptoms were much more severe and I would collapse or lose control of my arms and legs regularly. I have been to every specialist known to man and after puberty I became more stable. \n\nI last saw a specialist 9 years ago in my town (Gainesville, Florida - UFHealth/Shands) and while he was pleasant, the visit was a bit rushed, dominated by my mom (advocating for me is a big part of her identity even when not always helpful) and the big takeaway was \"You seem fine. Take the mito cocktail. Exercise very moderately but consistently\" and I had some comprehensive bloodwork that came back \"normal\" - according to a voicemail from the clinic. There was no need for a followup visit at the time. \n\nI am still pretty stable, but now 9 years later I have some questions about how MM patients are aging and wanting more answers than I got last time. I am anxious about progression and what new information and research has been done on MM specifically. I am going to try to see a specialist this year and I want to be as prepared as I can and use that time well. In the meantime, are there people I can call at UMDF with broad information about adults with MM? I also just want to know anecdotally what life is like for other people with MM since data only tells me so much (and I have never met or talked with anyone with MM). I want to be prepared for the future and more understanding of this disease. Would the UMDF \"Ambassador\" program be of any assistance?

in the Mitochondrial Disease Community Registry (MDCR). This is a chance to give your input about online resources for genetic inheritance (or how a condition is passed through families) and genetic testing of mitochondrial disease.\n\nMany of us use the Internet to learn about mitochondrial diseases. For many patients and their families, the internet is the one of the first places they turned when they heard about the possibility of a mitochondrial disease. Online resources made for the mitochondrial disease community are not always easy to read and understand. They may lack information that matters to patients and their families. This is especially true of materials about genetic inheritance and genetic testing.\n\nThe goal of this study is to assess online resources for patients and their families about how mitochondrial diseases are passed through families and the options for genetic testing. Researchers are interested to learn from members and their experiences using online resources. A survey will be used to achieve this goal. Your participation may help improve current resources and/or add new education tools. Please consider participating. Your input is important for increasing awareness and improving care for mitochondrial disease.\n\nParticipation in this study is voluntary and the survey should take less than 20 minutes to complete.\n\nHow can I participate?\n\nYou must be enrolled in the Mitochondrial Disease Community Registry (MDCR) to participate. The study survey will be distributed to member through the registry. To learn more about the MDCR or to enroll, please click the following link. http://www.umdf.org/registry/ Once enrolled, you will be asked to complete an initial survey that captures diagnostic and demographic information as well as opinions on the MDCR and how it should be used in the future. After completing this survey, you can view details about the study survey.\n\nWhat is the MDCR?\n\nThe MDCR is a patient centered registry. The purpose of this registry is to collect patient-centric health data that will be utilized to develop treatments, identify new symptoms, and provide information to researchers that seek to study mitochondrial disease. Caregivers and family members of those affected, whether they themselves are affected or not, are also encouraged to register and contribute to the community. Please also consider registering even if you are already part of another database. Each registry has its own unique utility, and MDCR has been built in a flexible way to assure appropriate sharing of data with other registry efforts.\n\nThe MDCR is different from other registries because members have total control of their information. Based on your privacy settings, you can decide who can see your information in an anonymous way (no means of identifying who you are), 2) who can analyze your anonymous data and lastly, 3) who can reach out to you via the registry if you are interested in participating in a relevant research study or clinical trial. Every registrant is in full control of their privacy settings, and can change them at any time.

I tried to condense it down as much as I could. \n\nI've been trying to figure out what's been going on with me for about 10 years now (I'm about 30). I'm the oldest of 10 kids, I'd say about 6/10 of us are affected by whatever is going on in some capacity. A couple have a bunch of gastro issues, growth hormone deficiency, one has had seizures, fatigue and muscle pain is common across everyone. I'm pretty much the only one that has good health insurance right now and can afford to pursue additional testing which may or may not pan out. \n\nI got WGS done a couple years ago through Veritas Genetics. I was hoping there would be a slam dunk buried in there. Two things did come back on it, one on the ASL gene for Argininosuccinate Lyase Deficiency and one on the NDUFB3 gene for Mitochondrial Complex I Deficiency. The problem is I'm heterozygous on both of those. I was able to get an appointment with the medical genetics program at Brigham &amp; Women's. They reviewed my case and did think there was probably some kind of genetic linkage there, given my family history. They were mostly focused on the ASL mutation though. They did order some blood work, along with testing targeting the ASL gene through Invitae along with chromosomal microarray testing. The Invitae testing confirmed the het mutation on the ASL gene but didn't turn up anything additional. The microarray didn't turn up any significant CNV or large deletions. The only interesting thing that came back on the blood test was that my carnitine levels were slightly low (Total: 31 umol/L ref: 34-86, Free: 24 umol/L ref:25-60, EST/FREE = .3 Ref .1-1.0) They didn't seem to think it was indicative of anything though. I floated the idea of checking into the mitochondrial side of things, however they didn't think that was worth checking at this stage. After that we discussed potential future follow-ups to see review my case in the event that new information comes out of research in the future. (This was last year). \n\nThis past June I did get a referral from my  PCP based on the recommendation from one of the doctors at Brigham, to the neuro-muscular dept at Dartmouth. The doctor there performed  EMG/NCS testing which came back normal. I mentioned the carnitine test results and he remarked that I didn't have a lot of muscle so it probably wasn't abnormal that it was a little low (I'm very thin, can't build muscle to save my life). \n\nWhile reading some research papers I came across the concept of buccal swab based testing for mitochondrial   respiratory chain enzyme function. I was able to get my PCP to order me a test kit from mitoswab. It is a lab developed test and something I'd consider semi-experimental. The studies look promising but I've been only able to find limited data. Does anyone have any experience with it? Results are in the table below. \n\n|Activity name|Value \\*|\\^Normal Range \\^(mean \u00b1SD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Total Buccal Protein yield (micrograms)|628||\n|Citrate Synthase \u00a7|22.06 (182%)|4.4 \u2013 22 (12.1 \u00b15.1)|\n|RC-IV (RC-IV/CS) \u00b6|0.542 (175%)|0.15 -- 0.6 (0.31 \u00b10.1)|\n|RC-I (RC-I/CS) \u00b6|2.7 (40%)|3.4 -- 11.9 (6.8 \u00b12.0)|\n|RC-II (activity/CS) \u00b6|0.033 (17%)|0.03 -- 0.35 (0.194 \u00b10.08)|\n|RC-II+III (activity/CS) \u00b6|&lt; (5%)|0.032 \u2013 0.152 (0.092 \u00b10.03)|\n\n\u00a7: Activity value as nanomoles/min/mg buccal protein\n\n\u00b6: Presented as ratio of the corresponding RC activity to CS activity\n\n\\*: Number in parenthesis indicates the percent of control mean activity.\n\n\\^: Based on published data.\n\nI'm trying to figure out where to go from here. Is it worth trying to get into a mitochondrial specialist at this point? Do I have enough potentially pointing in that direction?

The goal of this study is to better inform healthcare providers and those involved in deciding the legal status of this therapy from the family perspective, as well as being a source of information for other families who might consider this therapy in the future.\n\nI intend to contact the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation (UMDF) to request that they share my study with its membership, but in order to collect the best data it's recommended that I conduct a pre-test with 3 to 4 people from a related target population. This pre-test would involve reading a short survey and interview guide for clarity and flow, as well as suggesting any additional questions that might be of use. \n\nI would very much appreciate your participation in this pre-test.

I also have weird electrical sensations all over my scalp, and my symptoms get worse at certain parts of the day, like my brain just feels like it shuts down for hours at a time. I eventually connected it to food, like I'd get worse after eating. A few months later I started falling asleep after meals, and now I fall asleep after every meal unless I am on my feet. I made sure it was food by fasting. My brain doesn't really work in general but I don't fall asleep if I don't eat. It seems regardless of what I do I feel a lot better right after waking up, and right before I go to sleep. And recently, and I'm not sure if this is medication related, but I've been having subtle issues with balance, like I'll be getting out of a car and lose my balance. I got pretty extensive metabolic testing a few years ago that found a riboflavin deficiency where my riboflavin levels were barely detectable despite no other vitamin deficiencies, and later testing found low free carnitine but the recommendation was just to eat more red meat or something. This is going to sound stupid but I took the riboflavin for a month, got a test and my blood levels were high but my symptoms weren't improving, and got frustrated and just stopped taking it and looked for other answers. In my defense I was having pretty severe anxiety about finding a treatment and couldn't really think objectively about it. Recently after finding out about how riboflavin deficiency can lead to pretty severe symptoms in these specific mitochondrial diseases, I started taking it again. Should I just keep taking the riboflavin along with some other mito supplements to help it do its job (I was thinking CoQ10 or MitoQ and some carnitine) or would it make sense to see a mitochondrial disease specialist? I've gotten my whole genome seq. but the automated analysis thing didn't show up any nuclear DNA mutations, and I was talking to some guy on the internet who only turned up a that I'm heterozygous for an MCAD variant, which was interesting because it's responsive to riboflavin but I don't have the symptoms and I'm a carrier anyway. I don't know if this is relevant but 23andMe said my mitochondrial haplotype is J1C3, and wikipedia said that J1C is associated with reduced oxidative phosphorylation that is associated with an increased risk of LHON. I know I don't have LHON but it was interesting because it's responsive to riboflavin. Also, I know this is probably unlikely but has anyone heard of a similar situation?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "mito", "subreddit_id": "t5_2wwei", "subreddit_subscribers": 178, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is this mitochondrial disease?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567261544, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mito/comments/cxhmz1/is_this_mitochondrial_disease/"}]
