sub existed :) I'll tell my story on how I've come to control my piriformis syndrome and related issues in hopes it may help someone someday.\n\nMy problem began when I was about 10. I jumped off a high dive and landed weird, the muscle started hurting, I believed I had 'hurt my leg.' It was rather painful for a week or two and then faded away. I thought it was over. It wasn't. The pain would randomly come back and last anywhere from a day to 2-3 weeks. I saw doctors and specialists and was told I had sciatica. Went through some physical therapy at 14 which helped a little, but not much. All the professionals had a different idea of what was going on and would tell me somewhat conflicting things. Flash forward to my freshman year in college. I had an episode. At this point I was used to the fact that these things happened from time to time, I had learned to cope. This time was different. It didn't go away in a couple of weeks, it just got worse and worse. I think it was exacerbated by having to get around a decently sized university campus everyday, giving me little ability to take it easy as I usually would prefer to do. It got so bad that at one point my dad had to help me out of the car and practically carry me inside. I took to only walking with a cane which helped tremendously. In this time I saw doctors, and tried maybe 5 different chiropractors. Eventually I was lucky enough to find a chiropractor who really clicked with my issue, she realized after a while that the issue was spiraling so much that chiropractic adjustments could no longer help. The pain, inflammation and stiffness was preventing her from making even slight adjustments. She recommended a really great physical therapy place. The physical therapist was able to identify my condition as piriformis syndrome and helped tremendously to get the problem under control. After a few months I was able to walk without a cane for the most part and the pain was no longer debilitating. At the same time as this was going on, my mom had been working with her rheumatologist to get her arthritis under control. She had been in chronic pain for decades which doctors were unable to diagnose. At some point her doctor finally recommended she get tested for arthritis. Working with her rheumatologist she was finally able to control her pain. She had casually brought up what I was going through to her own rheumatologist. It must have raised a huge red flag immediately because he said I needed to get into his office for testing asap. I did. Surprise surprise, I have an aggressive form of degenerative rheumatoid arthritis called ankylosing spondylitis. The arthritis aggravated by and combined with the piriformis syndrome had snowballed out of control. X-rays revealed that the disease had ravaged my hips where I was lacking cartilage seriously. I am now taking Humira for my arthritis which has done an excellent job of keeping my condition in check. I happily have not taken a single dose of ibuprofen to combat piriformis pain in nearly two years. No major episodes, very little pain. I regularly get maintenance adjustments at my chiropractor to keep me aligned which I believe plays a big part in this success. \n\nIt's amazing to me that not a single doctor, chiropractor or physical therapist who treated me had ever even considered arthritis as a possibility. It took my moms rheumatologist who had never seen or met me to suggest testing. \n\nTLDR; Found the right chiropractor, found the right physical therapist, found out I have arthritis. Consider asking your doctor about arthritis, because they may not consider it.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "openpiriformis", "subreddit_id": "t5_39uls", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How

"selftext": "So I will put a TL;DR at the bottom of the post for those who don't want the background information. \n\n\n**Background:** So I am 23 years old and a pretty tall guy. Back in high school, my junior year, I started suffering from this really bad pain in my lower butt and upper thigh when sitting all day. Standing, walking, laying, or reclined didn't bother it, but sitting really did. For the longest time I thought I just had tight hamstrings, so I would regularly stretch them. This would offer some slight relief, but really not much. This went on through the rest of high-school and my four years of undergrad. Fastforward to about 5 months ago while doing my masters degree and doing the CPA exam, so lots of sitting and lots of pain. I came across something about Piriformis syndrome that matched my symptoms exactly. I began foam rolling, doing various piriformis stretches (pigeon pose, figure four, ninety-ninety). Never before had I felt a stretch like these and became very clear to me that my right piriformis in particular was far too tight. These stretches helped tremendously, and would relieve the pain for about 4 or 5 hours, and then it would return until I did them again. Well I finally found a routine that put the nail in the coffin. I am now working a typical office job with lots of sitting, and there is no pain. Every night before I go to bed, I do a routine called the \"Limber 11\" which is a series of hip mobility exercises. Two of the excercise really hit the piriformis well, and the other do an excellent job with stretching and activating the glutes and other hip flexors. I'm not sure why this has worked so well, the only thing I can figure is that doing things like pigeon pose stretched only the piriformis, while this routine has helped me to hit both the piriformis and relax the rest of my hip muscles as well. Below I have linked a video that explains the routine, as well as a set of gifs so that once you are familar with the routine you can just pull up the gif more as a reminder of what to do instead of always pulling up the video. I do recommend watching the video at least once because there is some valuable information.

This has happened to me before. Looked up all the advice that people give you, tried a bunch of things, but the pain persisted. \n\nRandomly, I tried putting my foot up on a bench and leaning into my knee to take the pressure off my hip. I noticed that it felt pretty good, and activated my glutes and quads more than my hips. \n\nThen, when I was sitting down and feeling some pain, I leaned my chest down to my thighs, and that seemed to feel good as well.\n\nSince it felt good, I kept doing it, just a few repetitions here and there throughout the day. After a few days, I finally got a full night's sleep, because the pain was drastically reduced. A week later, I don't really feel any pain. \n\nCausality is a hard thing to prove, but whether or not it actually helped, it certainly didn't hurt! I can only hypothesize that it stretched and strengthened all the right muscle groups needed to help the piriformis fulfill its proper function.\n\nHere are the *exact* exercises I am doing, if you are curious to try:\n\nLunge variation - Start: Front foot elevated on platform about knee height or slightly higher, with the knee bent at 90 degrees. Rear foot balanced on the toes on the ground, slightly behind the body. Movement: Keeping most of your weight on the front leg, with your back leg used for balance, let\nthe front knee bend until the thigh is touching the calf, or as far as your flexibility allows. The front knee will travel in front of your toes. Then push through your front leg to straighten your knee past the starting point, until your knee is completely extended,  and your back heel is on the ground. Return to starting point and repeat.\n\nGood morning variation - Start. Sitting upright on a bench or a chair with feet planted on the floor and knees at around 90 degrees. Movement: Keeping the back straight the entire way, lower your chest down to your knees or as far a your flexibility allows, then return to the starting position and repeat.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "openpiriformis", "subreddit_id": "t5_39uls", "subreddit_subscribers": 503, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Elevated front foot lunges and seated good mornings may have helped eliminate my pain", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/nqnpbn/elevated_front_foot_lunges_and_seated_good/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "meembeam78", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qyhrtq0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1622354092, "domain": "self.openpiriformis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/no4n0k/back_locks_up/", "gildings": {}, "id": "no4n0k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/openpiriformis/comments/no4n0k/back_locks_up/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1622354103, "score": 1, "selftext": "Does anyone else's back lock up prior to pain being really bad?

For the last 2 months I\u2019ve been dealing with so\nMuch pain in the left side of my butt cheek down to my knee. The pain started out of the blue and I thought it\u2019d get better. I was starting to really worry cause despite taking ibuprofen the pain would come back. \n\nIt\u2019s so bad in the morning I can barely put my left foot down. After I walk around the house it gets better but not 100%.  I then started seeing a physical therapist who told me it seems like it\u2019s piriformis syndrome that attacks the sciatica nerve. \n\nIt\u2019s been over a month seeing him and it\u2019s not getting better despite me exercising and doing the stretches. I\u2019m started to get down and depressed cause the pain is really affecting my day to day. I tried everything...bought a standing desk, pillow between legs at night, etc to no avail. \n\nMy PT never told me to go see a doctor or anything but now I\u2019m\nWondering if I should. I\u2019m a hypochondriac and worry I have something really bad. I asked a couple of Friends who say it sounds like a muscle/joint issue that takes a while advised not going to a doctor. \n\nAt this point I\u2019d like to hear your feedback since I found this group. Anyone had this pain for that long? Is this \u201cnormal\u201d or should I be worried something serious is happening? The pain is really bad when I wake up and gets bad again later at night or if I sit in the car for a long time or sit down for a while.

I am wondering if PS contributed to it.  Below is my story and my thesis, please let me know your thoughts.\n\nI am an early 40s athletic male and have been avid road cyclist for the past 15 years. Early last year, I started suffering from pain in my upper RIGHT buttocks. I had a variety of spinal MRIs, and all looked find other than a \"mild\" bulge at L4-L5. A few months after the butt pain started, I experienced the following: some pain / numbness in the sole of my LEFT foot, paresthesia in my LEFT shin, then suddenly pain in my LEFT quadricep which wouldn't release when I was standing.  Soon after that I started getting bilateral calf twitching.  I tried general lower back PT, stretching and cortisone shots in my piriformis, to no avail.  Also, I began experiencing numbness in my outer RIGHT  quad when laying flat.\n\nThis all scared my quite a bit, especially when the calf twitching started, and I saw a variety of neurologists and got EMGs and NCSs. Everything was unremarkable, but the calf twitching was picked up by EMG and attributed to lumbar radiculopathy even though there was nothing in the MRI to suggest it.\n\nEventually I grew comfortable that nothing major neurological was going on, but I continued to pursue piriformis syndrome for a variety of reasons: 1) a FAIR test EMG / NCS showed slowing in the signal when piriformis was tense, 2) I realized I had a wobble in my riding and limited range of motion on the right and 3) several massage therapists and PT people told my my piriformis was really tighter and 4) that's where the pain was. Also, not of the traditional spine / herniation tests like the straight leg raise test or the slump test elicited any response. Everyone assured me that I could keep on riding. So I rode a lot this summer.\n\nThis past August, the pain in my butt got intense and I also started to experience pain in my RIGHT heel / lateral foot.  Thorough examination by a podiatrist including with MRI showed nothing wrong in the foot.\n\nI began to construct a theory that piriformis muscles were both tight, particularly on the RIGHT.  I believe this was compressing my S1 nerve, causing the heel / lateral foot pain and the bilateral calf twitching (tibial nerve). I also think the extremely tight RIGHT piriformis was compressing the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve when I would lie on my back, causing the RIGHT quad area to go numb. Separately, I noted above that my LEFT quad would hurt and that it does not release when standing (it just stays in an activated position). It does however release when I sit or lay down, or when I rotate my hips forward. I suspect that my extremely tight RIGHT piriformis was pulling on my sacrum and rotating it such that in a normal standing position, the LEFT quad couldn't release.\n\nFast forward to this past week. I have been doing twice a week PT of my right piriformis - lots of deep painful massage, stretching, exercises.  One day I suddenly started to experience very sharp pain in my LEFT heel when bending over, or doing a straight leg test or a slump test. Interestingly no radiation down the leg.  I once again have had the foot looked at and it checks out fine.  This is a pretty clear sign of a herniation unfortunately (quite concerning to me).  Interestingly my RIGHT quad suddenly no longer goes numb when I lie on my back.  My theory is that my RIGHT piriformis, in exerting a torque onto my sacrum, contributed to my disc or lumbar disc suddenly herniating.  This herniation released some pressure, allowing some more space for the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve under the piriformis muscle.  I note that I just had an MRI of the lumbar spine one month ago and it was consistent with prior ones (mild L4-L5 bulge only).  Do you all think this thesis holds any water?   \n\nI'm partially basing in this on the attached article which talks of sacral rotation from a tight piriformis. I am afraid that my numerous doctors inability to diagnose and treat my piriformis tightness has led to this herniation.\n\n [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4720759/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4720759/)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "openpiriformis", "subreddit_id": "t5_39uls", "subreddit_subscribers": 365, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can Piriformis Syndrome contribute to disc herniation?

I'll start at the beginning:\n\nAt the beginning of september, I broke my fibula in my left leg close to my ankle in an unfortunate slip&amp;fall in a parking garage. I got a cast and surgery and (thankfully!) my left leg is doing just fine right now. I can put a good amount of weight on it and it's hardly giving me any problems at all. \n\nA few weeks in, a small pain/stiffness started to arise in my right leg/butt. It was pretty minor and I thought nothing of it at the time. I thought it was due to how I was sitting and using the 'good' leg and it would go away on it's own once I was able to use my broken leg again. \n\nThat happened, and I can now walk on both legs with my weight pretty much equally distributed. However, the pain has not gone away and has only become worse over the last 3 weeks or so. Both the GP and the physical therapist agree that it is probably the piriformis being overworked due to the uneven strain that I put on it the last few months. I have an ultrasound scheduled for monday where they will check to make sure and I'm currently on a pretty wild cocktail of painkillers which seem to do very little to nothing. \n\nI can hardly sit and when I do sit I cant sit on both buttocks equally if that makes sense. Walking and standing is something I can do very limited and while I do that my back is bent in the weirdest shape because my body is trying desperately to take weight off the painful leg (not the broken leg mind you). I fear this will cause even more issues down the line. \n\nThe only thing I can quite comfortably do is lay down, either on my back with a pillow underneath my knees or on my stomach (though that doesn't feel very pleasant due to the still limited range of motion in my broken leg). But getting up is the real pain, and that can easily take up to 30 minutes to an hour. It's a process that has put me in tears of desperation more than once. \n\nI've tried gentle stretching, and some exercises to help strengthen the area, but all it seems to do is irritate it more. Is there anything else I can do to get some relief and/or recovery from this? \n\nThanks for reading all of this :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "openpiriformis", "subreddit_id": "t5_39uls", "subreddit_subscribers": 358, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tips &amp; advice regarding (possible) piriformis syndrome?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/k2mweh/tips_advice_regarding_possible_piriformis_syndrome/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bra1ndrops", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ll0vs", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605670322, "domain": "self.openpiriformis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/jw8beo/short_piriformis_syndrome/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jw8beo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/openpiriformis/comments/jw8beo/short_piriformis_syndrome/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1605692801, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hi! \n\nEdit: female, 5\u20193\u201d, 160 pounds \n\nI was recently diagnosed with Short Piriformis Syndrome which I\u2019m told is less common than Long Piriformis Syndrome.

It started when I was 16/17ish and it came and went in flares. I threw it off as muscle pain since it would come and go. I saw a doctor when I was 19 and she basically said I had sciatica and told met go do physical therapy. That never helped and I basically sucked it up and just dealt with the pain when it hurt for another 3 years. Fast forward to this year, I decided to mention it to a new doctor of mine and they said they will refer me to a sports doctor/specialist but wanted to an ultrasound/xray. Did those, and the xray came back fine but the ultrasound had a ton of inflammation in that area. She scrapped the sports doctor/specialist and referred me to a rheumatologist who diagnosed me with an autoimmune disease called Ankylosing Spondylitis. I had to have an MRI+Blood tests done to confirm it and they both came back positive. I hope none of you have this disease as it has no cure and can lead to spinal disability/deformity if not treated but I just wanted to share in case someone else might have the same disease I have and not know it thinking they have piriformis. When my doctor referred me to a rheumatologist I first thought, wow what a waste of time.. its a muscle issue I dont need a rheumatologist, I need a muscle specialist. But funny enough, when I mentioned piriformis to the rheumatologist he said hes heard \"piriformis syndrome\" so many times that hes lost count. And he said its sad because many people go on thinking its a muscle issue while incurring long-term damage and disease progression.

Hoping someone has insight.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Sciatica", "subreddit_id": "t5_2vbe1", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Sciatica", "subreddit_subscribers": 6619, "subreddit_type": "public", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Sciatic symptoms on and off for 2 years, starting to lose hope, advice appreciated", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "ups": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/comments/hy8bak/sciatic_symptoms_on_and_off_for_2_years_starting/", "user_reports": [], "view_count": null, "visited": false, "whitelist_status": null, "wls": null}], "domain": "self.Sciatica", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/hywpih/sciatic_symptoms_on_and_off_for_2_years_starting/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hywpih", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/openpiriformis/comments/hywpih/sciatic_symptoms_on_and_off_for_2_years_starting/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1595871023, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "openpiriformis", "subreddit_id": "t5_39uls", "subreddit_subscribers": 290, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Sciatic symptoms on and off for 2 years, starting to lose hope, advice appreciated", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "/r/Sciatica/comments/hy8bak/sciatic_symptoms_on_and_off_for_2_years_starting/", "url_overridden_by_dest": "/r/Sciatica/comments/hy8bak/sciatic_symptoms_on_and_off_for_2_years_starting/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ActIII03", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_rb494", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595298439, "domain": "self.openpiriformis", "edited": 1595348758, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/huz51t/fixed_my_piriformis_syndrome_discomfort_via_these/", "gildings": {}, "id": "huz51t", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/openpiriformis/comments/huz51t/fixed_my_piriformis_syndrome_discomfort_via_these/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "pKl3sE9ayQu-pZsobciFi4c4s7UcB2UMM0UTdrmqGDY", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/aeHs7AupgtmVI2NePM7DSlpMisvQTGdh6XnHSobJX3M.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85cbc01ea6dd57722ca161c5fd745b902be1197c", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/aeHs7AupgtmVI2NePM7DSlpMisvQTGdh6XnHSobJX3M.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a91fd1d9c33c5e2dfdc723d6c4257d4a30ef9e2a", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/aeHs7AupgtmVI2NePM7DSlpMisvQTGdh6XnHSobJX3M.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e15150dd3c372383115cc70b7bbe000e916d5014", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 420, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/aeHs7AupgtmVI2NePM7DSlpMisvQTGdh6XnHSobJX3M.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9e72af463247d72190910072941859b26dfdb13f", "width": 420}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1595369670, "score": 5, "selftext": "Hello,\n\nCredit goes to u/aussieoz124's post on Anterior Pelvic tilt (APT). My Piriformis syndrome resulted from mainly from a weak core but was especially cased by APT. I am very quad dominant and have a weak posterior chain which results in radiating pain. I also run, bike, and sit down alot when programming. These three activities caused me to have a considerable amount of tilt. Doing these exercises reduced the tilt which has reduced my discomfort by 80-90%. I will get straight to the point. This link has the pdf with the exercises:\n\n[https://github.com/ActIII03/Anterior-Pelvic-Tilt-APT-Mobility](https://github.com/ActIII03/Anterior-Pelvic-Tilt-APT-Mobility)\n\nDo the exercises 2-3 times a day for as long as you can. Piriformis Syn. is a life long battle and goes undiagnosed for a lot because of the Sciatic pain. My discomfort has reduce dramatically and I no longer worry about radiating pain going down my leg. If you want to add or update the pdf, I have a LaTeX file in the repo just for that. I will review pull requests whenever I have time. I'm super busy with School and work. Any questions, just comment below or PM me. Share this document and the word on APT. Also, I am not medical expert so do take my post with a grain of salt. It's not the end-all-be-all solution.

He had a previous herniated disc years ago, so his docs are focusing on his spine for the source of his sciatica, and unfortunately his pain is getting debilitating. He only has one kidney, so he has to be careful what kind of anti-inflammatories he takes so he mostly just \"deals\" with it. Anyway, I wanted to run some of his symptoms by you guys to see if these are things you experienced as well. So hopefully he can focus his efforts a little better towards relief.\n\nHe's a truck driver in his \"retirement\", so long hours sitting which I read can be a cause. He says when he gets out of the truck and slides across a point in his glute he gets a very sharp pain that radiates down his leg. He also has experienced atrophy on the affected side, and constipation. Chiropractic work gave him temporary relief but only for an hour or so. He got a steroid shot which also helped for a bit, but not long term. \n\nI recently suggested it may be Piriformis Syndrome and he looked up stretches and treatments on YouTube. But no idea if it has given him any relief yet.\n\nAnyway, thanks for any input you may have!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "openpiriformis", "subreddit_id": "t5_39uls", "subreddit_subscribers": 270, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Trying to Narrow a Diagnosis", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/hg37uw/trying_to_narrow_a_diagnosis/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "rdglsd3", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6qdg4anb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1592123451, "domain": "self.openpiriformis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/h8pzwt/3_months_and_doesnt_seem_to_be_healing/", "gildings": {}, "id": "h8pzwt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/openpiriformis/comments/h8pzwt/3_months_and_doesnt_seem_to_be_healing/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1592123453, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've been seeing a myotherapist to help treat my piriformis.

Turns out I also have a herniated disc. The way I found out? \n\nAs the physical therapy \"massage\" is about to end and I'm staring at the ceiling as the doctor is pulling on my legs and performing several stretches, I ask \"Hey, do you have a lot of Piriformis patients?\". The doctor: \"Yeah, actually its becoming more and more popular now with people that practice sports.\" \n\nMe: \"Have you noticed any flexibility issues with your other patients?\" \n\nDoc: \"Yeah, flexibility usually decreases right away for people with piriformis, but you don't seem to have any problems with that\" , says that as he pulls my lower body in one direction and the upper into the opposite direction diagonally...\n\nMe: \"Uhm, let me show you.\" \n\nThe doc lets go of my body, I set myself up in a straight laying position, face up, and I begin by raising my right leg upwards without bending my knee, it reaches to about his chin level ( I am laying on a massage table, so I am around his waist level). Then I go to do the same with my left leg (piriformis one) and it barely reaches his chest area while spasming and shaking while I feel lots of pain in my piriformis area. \n\nDoc: \"Uhh, that's not something caused by Piriformis\"\n\nMe: \"Ooh, so then what is it? (Confused AF) \n\nThe doctor goes on to perform the lasegue test, basically pushing and applying force at the end of my left leg(piriformis one) and beggining of waist area. He does that for a brief 45 seconds and tells me to try lifting my leg up again. \n\nI lift my leg up and its a MASSIVE difference. \n\nDoc looks at me, and he says sorry, not the best news for Christmas, but you have a herniated disc. You need to get a magnetic resonance done so we can see how bad it is. \n\nSo here I am, holiday season, can't get anything done in terms of booking a magnetic resonance scanner as no one is working and I have no idea on how to even deal with this.\n\nTold my parents about it, they were shocked at first and they probably are now, but they are not making it look like its a big deal so I don't panic and think about it all the time as there is nothing to do but sit and wait for 2020 to roll around and getting a magnetic resonance booked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason why I took time to write all this is for any other people who might have this issue and who can relate to go investigate it as disc hernia is not a joke. In some cases it can lead to paralysis, in others it could be solved easily. \n\nTake care of your body everyone, as you only get one per life! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMerry Christmas everyone and have a nice new decade!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "openpiriformis", "subreddit_id": "t5_39uls", "subreddit_subscribers": 195, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Pirifromis but more...", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/efg44o/pirifromis_but_more/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MuteMouse", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6w5oa", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575788662, "domain": "self.openpiriformis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/e7qq3e/piriformis_surgery_in_houston/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e7qq3e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/openpiriformis/comments/e7qq3e/piriformis_surgery_in_houston/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575788662, "score": 1, "selftext": "Anyone know any any surgeons that can do piriformis nerve decompression surgery?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "openpiriformis", "subreddit_id": "t5_39uls", "subreddit_subscribers": 191, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Piriformis Surgery in Houston", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/e7qq3e/piriformis_surgery_in_houston/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "cjohns716", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_pk7a9t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573146431, "domain": "self.openpiriformis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/dt0njf/is_this_piriformis_syndrome/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dt0njf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/openpiriformis/comments/dt0njf/is_this_piriformis_syndrome/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573146432, "score": 1, "selftext": "HI all,\n\nWanting to get some info from some more experienced people. Lately, been having sharp, shooting pain in my right buttock when doing certain exercises. Told a PT friend of mine about it and he gave me some stretches. In doing some more reading, I keep seeing that the piriformis muscle can be either long or short. If long, stretching is not the answer. So trying to get some clarification on how to diagnose.\n\nI get the pain most frequently when doing side squats, left leg out and bending knee, with right leg straight to the side. Pain comes when standing back up. It feels like my glute is helping to pull my body back up, in tandem with my left leg. I get close to the top and it like seizes up and I have sharp pain directly in from the right gluteus maximus.\n\nI've also felt it (though less painful and intense) when doing leg curls on a physio ball. Laying on back, ankles on ball, and curl it up to my butt. \n\nThe biggest thing I\"ve seen to test long vs short (or tight vs loose) is to do a standing overhead squat. If your knees turn in, probably loose/ long. If your knees turn out, short/ tight. I haven't had a chance to do this yet, but in general, I struggle to keep my knees out when squatting so I'm leaning towards loose. \n\nAnyone have any insight? If mine is loose, what can I do to strengthen?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "openpiriformis", "subreddit_id": "t5_39uls", "subreddit_subscribers": 181, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is this piriformis syndrome?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/dt0njf/is_this_piriformis_syndrome/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NICESfyn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_10lwgf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571617943, "domain": "self.openpiriformis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/openpiriformis/comments/dksiws/having_a_constant_deep_pain_in_my_right_butt_that/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dksiws", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/openpiriformis/comments/dksiws/having_a_constant_deep_pain_in_my_right_butt_that/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571617944, "score": 3, "selftext": "It's only bearable when I'm lying down.

I've tried every stretch I could find online, but most of them made the pain WORSE. \n\nMost stretches for piriformis syndrome focus on stretching the area that hurts. \n\nWhat actually helped me is stretching the opposite area: the quadriceps muscles (these are at the front of the leg above the knee). You can lift stretch the muscles by lifting your foot and grabbing your foot/ankle with the hand on the same side and holding your foot so the leg stays in the bent position. Stretch both legs. \n\nWhen I first started doing this, it was difficult to grab my foot. You might be able to do this lying on your side if you can't do it standing (stretching the leg that's on top as you lie on your side). Be gentle and go really slow, and if it hurts, stop. \n\nIt's not a miracle, and it took a few days to really get better, but I can walk much further now before it starts to hurt again.
