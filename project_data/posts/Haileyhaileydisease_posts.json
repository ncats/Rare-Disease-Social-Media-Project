My mom, grandma, 2 great uncles, and great grandfather suffer from HHD. I made it to 33 at least and got many more years than my grandma and mom before having my first rash or outbreak. \n\nA few months ago I had one small spot in my armpit but it cleared up very quick maybe a week or 2 and I have one on the back of my neck now. I'm having a hard time finding any reference pictures of someone with my skin tone (I'm half black). I'm wondering if there is a more active group to join somewhere or if anyone here has had any experience with someone Black or even a POC that has dealt with HHD? Everyone we have ever communicated with that has it was Caucasian. I also recently read about 2 people who claimed to be cured through melatonin shots that cause your skin to tan. I'm thinking my natural ability to tan easily and darker skin tone may be an advantage with this battle. \n\nThanks in advance for any replies and I hope you are all doing well.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Haileyhaileydisease", "subreddit_id": "t5_26uoc4", "subreddit_subscribers": 33, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is there an active community for HHD?

I'm about 5 years in to having 'this thing' and about a year into realising it's obviously the hereditary thing that most of my dad's side of the family suffer with... Right now it's just on my groin, and I'm just praying it's not gonna spread (despite knowing that's almost definitely going to happen).\n\nI've done some scouting here and around, tried a number of things that have at least not hindered me, and ridden off some good advice picked up from my family. Thought it'd be great to share and see what else people have had successes with. Please jump in with any of your experiences and current bits. When it comes to pills and creams, would be helpful to know where you're based as some may be sold under different brand names or just inaccessible. For the record, I'm based in London, UK.\n\nMy go to things from a pharmacy:\n\n\\- [Timodine](https://www.dokteronline.com/en/timodine): it's a mild steroid &amp; antifungal cream, so I really use it in emergencies. Gotta keep it in the fridge. If my skin is really troublesome and starts to get a bit 'yeasty' (if you know what I mean), a bit of that applied just once or twice tends to do the trick. Gotta be real careful with steroid creams for a wealth of reasons, but the impact here outweighs the risks, as far as I'm concerned. I've had a small tube for over 3 months. You can get it prescribed in the UK - that link has it for \u00a340, but honestly I'd even say that's worth the relief.\n\n\\- [Betadine Dry Powder 25mg/g topical spray](https://www.chemist.co.uk/betadine-dry-powder-25mg-g-topical-spray-100ml.html): if I feel I'm getting breaks in the skin and it's a bit moist on its own accord, I use this sparingly and it tends to help. My dad has a hard time getting his hands on it, even as a 40 year sufferer, so it's gold dust but really worth hunting for.\n\n\\- [Hibiscrub](https://www.medisupplies.co.uk/Hand-Hygiene/Alcohol-Based-Hand-Sanitisers/Hibiscrub-Antimicrobial-Skin-Cleanser?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=product_feed_or_listings&amp;pl=STD&amp;ccv=Y&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw8IaGBhCHARIsAGIRRYqcYMP6IoGNS1UVe7r7bD43aeOw9nQigv4pSXLg5ekFF3fe1Fz95c8aAhYUEALw_wcB): this is super accessible gold (in the UK at least). It's a medical grade disinfectant which I spray onto my skin every time I have a shower, leaving it to sit for a few mins whilst the shower warms up. I also use this on the (kinda) impetigo I get under my facial hair which also keeps that at bay and means I don't have to resort to antibiotics to clear it up. I think you can even get it from the vets. I dilute this 1 part to 3 parts water and have it in a spray bottle in my shower. My dad also recommends using a makeup remover wipe (just plain cotton wool) and dabbing it on neat.\n\n\\- [Dermol](https://www.pharmica.co.uk/skincare/eczema/dermol-500/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8IaGBhCHARIsAGIRRYotJUtg7enZcGbEWpI_6brGkz7K4daZPDna3mqMk9f8KX2-9pkswgAaAmpSEALw_wcB): This is the second half of my daily shower duo, which I use instead of any soap. It was also recommended as an answer to keep the impetigo (which I always bloody have) at bay. I use it on my face and all over.\n\n\\-  [Fexofanadine](https://www.travelpharm.com/online-consultations-c166/hay-fever-treatment-c1828/fexofenadine-120mg-tablets-p14443): This is an absolute godsend. You know when your skin starts itching/burning like mad, and you just know you're gonna scratch the hell out of it and then suffer the consequences for the next few days. Enter Fexofanadine. It's the strongest antihistamine that you can get prescribed in the UK, typically for hayfever, but it works a treat. Gone are the nights of gritting my teeth, close to tears. Used to take it every morning, but now I just have it on hand when I need it.\n\nFollowing a few bits of advice from reddit, too, I keep the following pills stocked and take them basically every day: Multivitamins, Vitamin K2 (100mcg) + D3 (4,000iu), L-Lysine (1,000mg), Multibiotics (45 billion bacteria). It's hard to say about the impact, but I'm not turning any possibilities away at this point.\n\nI did, for a time, put a thick emulsifying ointment on every morning after my shower (Ovelle), but I feel like it kept the wounds moist and open, so really did me no favours, but perhaps I just need to figure out when's the best time to utilise that.\n\nHMU if you can't access any of this stuff and I'll go out of my way to help a fellow Pemphigang member. I've pulled out all the big guns here, so I'm really hoping there's some golden nuggets of information in this tiny, tiny community of unfortunate bastards \u270c\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Haileyhaileydisease", "subreddit_id": "t5_26uoc4", "subreddit_subscribers": 29, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Potions, lotions and supplements", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Haileyhaileydisease/comments/nx0n66/potions_lotions_and_supplements/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bzdu", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_93ixd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1620026995, "domain": "self.Haileyhaileydisease", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Haileyhaileydisease/comments/n3qeil/discussion_what_clothing_do_you_find_helps_manage/", "gildings": {}, "id": "n3qeil", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Haileyhaileydisease/comments/n3qeil/discussion_what_clothing_do_you_find_helps_manage/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1620027006, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm keen to understand more about what kind of loose-fitting clothing might work best, as there is nothing I've found specifically designed with H-H in mind.\n\nDoes anyone regularly wear ultralight sports gear?

I was hoping this subreddit would be active. But anyway I have looked around the internet and have been having a hard time finding communities dealing with hailey hailey disease. The shitty yahoo group they have is so awful and unorganized it\u2019s tough to find any information.\n\nI have been dealing with this disease since I was 17.  I found out it\u2019s name when I was 25, and until then it was a complete mystery. All I knew was that my mother and grandmother had it. And over time it has definitely changed and moved to different areas. Before it would be a slight rash on my neck at 17-20, then I started get horrible just open sores underneath my arm Pitts that would take weeks to heal. And now that I am entering my early 30s, it has begun to develope around my groin area and fuck it\u2019s painful.\n\nI have been athlete all my life, lots of running and general fitness, and movement training,  trained in boxing and mma, and just lived a generally overall healthy lifestyle. \n\nBut now I have been out of training for weeks. I could push through my under arm sores, but the groin area just makes it impossible to even walk let alone run or do deep stretches without feeling like my skin is ripping apart.\n\nI found out early on that the best methods to reduce hailey hailey disease is\n\n1) clean/healthy diet\n2) lots of water\n3) Mitchell clear gel underarm\n4) vitamin D 5000iu, vitamin k2 90-180mcg, and 400mg magnesium chloride ( tough to get now)\n\n5) low stress, heat, and friction\n\nUnfortunetly I love to train and workout, and it\u2019s a real bummer not being able to throw kicks or run miles or even roll around without having my neck get fucked up.\n\nI have seen how bad this gets with ppl that are older, some of the google images are just scary as fuck. Especially with the old man that has his entire skin on his groin falling off.\n\nIt\u2019s deff not as bad as some skin conditions out there depending on how well you take care of yourself. But it\u2019s in line with draiers disease and others.\n\nI hope more people make it to this subreddit and spread their knowledge to help others live a more fulfilling life.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Haileyhaileydisease", "subreddit_id": "t5_26uoc4", "subreddit_subscribers": 8, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Started when I was 17", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Haileyhaileydisease/comments/hsjdkj/started_when_i_was_17/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Ajenkins626", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gtz8l", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571463522, "domain": "self.Haileyhaileydisease", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Haileyhaileydisease/comments/djzl41/haileyhailey_disease_discussion_has_been_created/", "gildings": {}, "id": "djzl41", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Haileyhaileydisease/comments/djzl41/haileyhailey_disease_discussion_has_been_created/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571463525, "score": 1, "selftext": "Discussion about Hailey-Hailey Disease, also know as Chronic Benign Familial Pemphigus.
