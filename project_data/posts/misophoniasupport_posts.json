Hell, there is one who will facetime his wife while on his lunch break, so he smacks his lips and talks for the whole hour. I'm actually getting frustrated just typing this out.\n\n  Not saying it's strictly a race/culture thing, that's not my intended meaning. My dad is a white guy and he can't chew quietly to save his life. I've even explained to him how uncomfortable it makes me, but he just makes fun of me and does it louder. I wear hearing aids, and if he notices me turn down the volume or turn on my noise filter setting, he just intentionally chews louder to make sure I can hear it. If I take them out, I can't talk to my mother (we don't sign). Do you think it would be out of line to make sure I eat in a room separate from him for every meal? \n\n(For the record, I am in my early 20s, and I will be moving out soon, but I just can't stand him anymore.

Like, why the fuck do people listen to this and decide it's ASMR? I have a family member who I have to eat with, and they have NO CLUE how to chew with their fucking mouth closed.  At night I have trouble sleeping because either the TV downstairs is a notch too loud, someone is snoring ever so slightly, or even that I'm imagining noise inside my head, which really pisses me off. My neighbors will start mowing their lawns ON THE WEEKENDS as early as SEVEN AM a lot of the time, and the only person I know with Misophonia is my dad, who has a much more mild case and learned to tune it out very easily, or so it seems. So, I can't really explain it to someone IRL who will genuinely understand and be able to give me advice, because I've talked to him and while he's my father and I trust him, I don't want to burden him anymore or have a mini breakdown. I can't sleep without earplugs, and every time I eat with more than one person, I will literally press down on whichever ear is clpsest to the loudest chewer, and fold up my earlobe, which I know is unhealthy and sometimes I do this and press down too hard on multiple occasions and it will start to hurt when I'm not holding down. This has only happened a few times, luckily. Occasionallly, there are points when I already have a layer of stress and I will break down crying as soon as I'm alone in my room or whatever after I've been triggered by one of these noises. I know I have to learn to live with it, but I only developed this about a year ago, so it still feels hard to cope with. I don't need any advice on this post if you notice it and want to help, I'll just look in other parts of the subreddit. Thank you for creating a place where people can express their emotions without being laughed at or told 'it's all in your head,' which has never happened to me, but only because I figure that it's my problem and these people can't help the way they breath or eat and generally run their life. The worst part is, I know someone with severe depression and I know of illnesses and disabilities that involve chronic pain, so I feel *guilty* that this is something I whine to my self about all the time.

Noise-wise everything has been a lot better than my last place except for one thing: my downstairs neighbor (directly below me) plays loud music at random times of the day. Sunday morning it started around 7 am. Tonight it's been off and on (but mostly on) for the past 4 hours. It's now 11 pm. It also happens during my work hours (working from home), during meetings, you name it. The genres vary but it doesn't even matter what the music is. It's the reverberating bass that I can feel through my floors and at the back of my skull.\n\nHere's what I've done so far:\n\n1. White noise, music with earphones, turning my vacuum on - nothing completely blocks out the bass, except for playing white noise in my earphones really loudly, but that gives me a headache. I also soundproofed my door but it doesn't help because much of the noise comes through the floor.\n2. Left a note asking them to turn the volume down, politely worded.\n3. Knocked on the door, two separate times. No answer. The second time I could hear him saying \"yeah, you go away\" as I was walking back up the stairs. So I came back down and asked him to please turn the music down through the door. No reply. I shouted back, \"too scared to open the door, huh?\" (not proud of that one...). Not sure if he heard that.\n4. This one I'm also not proud of. I stomped and banged on the floor. He banged on the ceiling back at me. I banged on the floor back at him and yelled \"turn the music down please!\" I'm not a yeller so not sure if it carried through the floor.\n\nI don't want to disturb my neighbors, and as you can see this is getting really out of hand. I live alone so getting in confrontations with strange men is a really bad idea (I do NOT have violent urges - my emotions tend to turn inwards. I'm just worried about this stranger getting angry at me). My dog has a lot of anxiety and now whenever the music starts he hides - I think he can sense my emotions even if I don't do anything but stick my headphones on. Honestly, my dog is the one keeping me from losing it completely during these episodes because he needs me to be calm.\n\nI don't want to call the cops or call 311 because they might send the cops (I'm in NYC). I was thinking my next step could be to call my landlord tomorrow. I don't want to sound like a crazy person. I'm not totally sure what good calling the landlord would do, though. What can I say for them to take me seriously?\n\nI can't live like this. I don't know what it's like to not have misophonia so I don't know how a normal person would react or if they would be able to ignore the noise. I think a normal person would at least be annoyed enough to speak up but definitely wouldn't have a meltdown like me. I also feel like this guy now knows his music pisses me off so he's doing it even more.\n\nAnyone else have a situation like this before?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2106, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help: Loud repetitive music.

I've always had misophonia (I don't like loud noises or chewing), but it was manageable. Now, I think because of constant exposure to noise, things that I'd be able to handle I no longer can. I feel so bad, my mum and sister were having an innocent conversation at the kitchen table and I had to leave the room because the sound of them talking sounded SO LOUD to me. Like they're trying to get Siri to transcribe everything they say, that's what it sounds like. \n\nI'm scared. If I can't handle people literally talking, how am I going to live a normal life?\n\nEverything is really just building up. My Dad is my biggest trigger because he has anger issues and slams doors, yells, chews with his mouth open, screams at TV, etc. He also breaks and drops a lot of things out of carelessness and it's just very hard to live with. Yesterday, though, I was in the living room with my sister and we were talking at a normal volume and he shoved his fingers into his ear, sighed really loudly, and started slamming his hands on the table. Turns out he was reading the newspaper and we were bothering him...despite the fact that he has an office, his bedroom, and an upstairs room that's lovely and quiet. My point is that when he yells and carries on and we complain, he says we should go elsewhere because it's the \"family room\", but when we have a conversation, it's suddenly \"his house\" and we aren't allowed to talk unless it's in our bedrooms with the door closed. It just feels really hypocritical. I feel so unwanted and like i'm not supposed to exist, or not welcome here (even though I know he loves me, and my Mum is great and I know she wants me there). \n\nANYWAY, im so so sorry for this long rant, but I'm basically just so scared that I'm going to turn into my dad. I hate the feeling of being unwelcome in my own home and I don't want my future roommate/husband/kids to ever feel like that. But if people having a conversation makes me need to leave the room because my head starts to hurt from the noise, how am I going to do that? \n\nYou're all welcome to vent in the comments, just get it all out LOL.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2075, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm becoming a horrible person", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jhmfs6/im_becoming_a_horrible_person/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bitchstix6", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5yww6f33", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1603589705, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jhl0rc/your_earbuds_the_second_you_need_them_to_avoid_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jhl0rc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffb000", "link_flair_css_class": "memes", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "599aa532-3f82-11e9-a9e0-0e7dd40beff6", "link_flair_text": "Memes", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jhl0rc/your_earbuds_the_second_you_need_them_to_avoid_a/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "gpv2j7VARiarpxqbUX4da6kdk7_atYT-zcVca2Jh24w", "resolutions": [{"height": 143, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/bfrjm4lz95v51.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ba66471630605b9a6c955cf6e2c067b3e10ca31", "width": 108}, {"height": 287, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/bfrjm4lz95v51.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8160509178f0f1914f53bec3c4f797024979b2f7", "width": 216}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/bfrjm4lz95v51.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e047588bebc4abed3f004a4f4f76a87bea02e323", "width": 320}, {"height": 853, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/bfrjm4lz95v51.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a6eb24eaff66091a56b985dca74d0efe373771b", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 853, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/bfrjm4lz95v51.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f238f39cdbc7240ccc87f282f90b3a6eb72d7ab1", "width": 640}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1603589716, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2075, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/qQcABSFEAoLCQVc4VnwwUNzD7AKx4bC1GIiWKRtPE6I.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Your earbuds the second you need them to avoid a trigger.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/bfrjm4lz95v51.jpg", "url_overridden_by_dest": "https://i.redd.it/bfrjm4lz95v51.jpg", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bitchstix6", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5yww6f33", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1603565080, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jhe8gp/my_brother_was_chewing_gum_downstairs_and_i_could/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jhe8gp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "6c5b5cda-3f77-11e9-9e70-0eeb6e9bf338", "link_flair_text": "Trigger Warning", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jhe8gp/my_brother_was_chewing_gum_downstairs_and_i_could/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1603565091, "score": 1, "selftext": "There was smacking.

I\u2019ve screwed up many interviews because of it- lost a job because of it- been looked at like a weirdo- girls wouldn\u2019t date me- and been generally ruined because of it.\n\nEvery time I would hear a sniffing noise among other verbal triggers I would twitch. It would get worse the more I would hear the triggers and the more I would twitch the more people would sniff and say the verbal triggers that trigger me. \n\nI was concerned for my future and thought I would never progress in life... That was until I found propranolol.\n\nI heard about propranolol on Reddit. And it seemed to fit my problem.\n\nNow ever since I have been taking propranolol - as needed- not all the time like an SSRI or neuroleptic- I rarely twitch. \n\nI was so happy about the propranolol that I have over a years worth supply now- it\u2019s that effective.\n\n\nPropranolol is a beta blocker- blocking the beta adrenergic receptors.\nEssentially propranolol blocks the fight and flight response. If you get scared you don\u2019t have the body reaction to adrenaline. You just feel relaxed. You don\u2019t feel the flighty scared anxious feeling in your body- you just feel relaxed and calm.\n\nIn times when I would normally be twitching a lot I don\u2019t twitch or feel nervous. I would say I twitch now maybe 1/25 times the amount I normally would.\n\nPropranolol is a heart medication for high blood pressure, but is used off label for anxiety, and tremors. It\u2019s actually a performance drug used by standup comedians, performers, and musicians.\n\nThere are websites online that have doctors that can diagnose you.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of weird how well it works. I thought I was hopeless and was considering getting a neuroleptic as these are often prescribed for Tourette\u2019s... But I do not want something to take all the time- just something as needed during social situations.

The most upsetting sounds to me come from people chewing, gulping, and slurping. My mother used to mock me about it and embarrass me over it because she loves to chew gum. I used to have the hardest time in school because the alphabetical seating arrangement always had me seated in front of a girl who would always smack and chew gum behind me. I suffered through it because I was too afraid of being mocked for saying anything. My family is the worst about eating loudly, to the point other people without Misophonia have mentioned it to me. Most of my life has been spent with me missing out because the only way I could tolerate being around my family was to try and damage my hearing with loud music or just leave and eat my food alone, fat away from the table. I'm now approaching 29 and i still live at home because of financial reasons, but I still have to basically confine myself to my room at all times. Last night things came to a head when I was trying to have dinner with the family as my sister is in for her birthday, I immediately couldn't hold back from making a remark about how loudly they gulp their drinks and I got yelled at for it being a \"me problem that i make an everyone else problem\". I tried to calm down and explain Misophonia is an actual condition and though Im not diagnosed I feel it's explains alot for me. My sister just told me to get therapy and they shunned me for the rest of the night. I don't have insurance and I can't even afford proper treatment for a condition i have with my eyes so that I can see normally and they think I can just go to a therapist at will. Today I was just sitting at the table drinking coffee while everyone slept. I dont know how to convey how much I just want to sit at an actual table sometimes and I can explain my room is under ground with no windows, so sometimes I just long to be near day light. My sister came down and immediately started eating food loudly across from me so I retreated back to my hole. My emotional response was just haywire as i started crying and beating my own head and face. I tried calming down the self mutilation response by flicking a hair band into my arm repeatedly but that only resulted in the hair band breaking and making my emotional response that much more volitial. Im sure my response today is just a breaking point of years of trying to get my family to just bd considerate of me (for example they still don't knock before entering my room or think of my feelings when it comes to leaving me out of pretty much everything they do together). My mother even works with special needs children and knows how to care for those with Sensory Processing Disorders but for some reason I'm just a selfish problem child. I'm more or less venting here because I have never spoken out about this and the self harm concerns me. I try to meditate and do yoga already and I've had a cat for 7 years now so the licking noises are annoying but I've learned to calmly react to it by letting him out or distracting him with toys if the sound becomes over whelming.

This is just from what my experiences and thoughts about misophonia, but I hope it helps.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, the people you live with might not believe you. Or, maybe they just dont understand how bad it is. I know that a lot of people here live with their parents, and I also know what worked in terms of getting my parents to listen to me, so heres some advice. (Dont take anything here like a treatment/professional device, I am decidedly NOT a psychologist)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Dont mock their eating sounds - This isnt just not helpful to you, it also makes them super self-concious. They cant change it. You can ask them to stop, and get away. Also, this might contribute to them not believing you for some reason or another. They might do it to spite you.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. Try to show them proof that misophonia is real - My parents pretty much believed me immediately, but definitely didnt do all that much to help. However, I see a lot of people here complain that the people they live with refuse to acknowledge it as a psychological thing, instead saying \"Oh, that's just a phase\", or \"They just want the attention\". Show them articles about it. Show them what it does to you. Show them that this isnt just some harmless thing, and that it isnt just being upset. This does psychological damage and should NOT be taken lightly.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Be nice about it - I saw a whole lot of change in how my family reacted when I stopped mocking their mouth sounds and started asking them to stop/wait before they eat so I can get away.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. Wear earbuds around the house - This is the biggest thing. I basically never leave my room without them. Its unfortunate because I enjoy listening to people talking and knowing whats going on, but otherwise I risk insanity. I prefer not knowing whats going on. Get a good pair of earbuds and bring them around with you. If you carry them in your pocket, get a case for them or they WILL break, and quickly too.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5. Talk about it - You might need to sit down with them and tell them about how it makes YOU feel. I know its hard, I could not and still can not describe exactly what it feels like. But for most people its like a fight or flight thing. You go full panic mode. Also, talk to them about how with most people more exposure = more misophonia. The more youre exposed the worse it gets. This is why exposure therapy, something Ive seen a whole lot of peoples parents want to do, DOES NOT WORK IN MOST PEOPLE. Avoidance is the best bet we have for now.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6. Just know that some people are crazy or want to watch the world burn - There is a good chance none of thia will work if the people you live with are crazy. Im always open to have a discussion with you about it, if you just want to vent or want to find a way to get them to listen. Some people just wont believe you, others do it purposefully to annoy you, and if they dont listen, your only option is to get out of there as soon as possible while avoiding them as much as possible.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7. Remember us - We are all here to support you. My circumstances are good. Ive got people who support me, places to go to escape, and ways to block out noise. But some people dont have all that, and I want to help. So does most everyone else here.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope this helps with something. Again if you want someone to vent to/some advice Im happy to help.

I said yes, and tried to explain that I'm very observant/sensitive to chewing sounds and she told me she had never heard someone say that before, and called me \"crazy.\" The chewing editor did nothing to change how he chews. I don't know what my next step should be. I feel like if I go to our supervisor she will embarrass me and make fun of me for being difficult (we have a blunt sense of humor in the office,) or if she takes it seriously the chewing editor is someone who already has trouble with people who view things differently than him, and with change, and I don't think he'd understand. I do put in headphones when he chews but it's not always an option, plus my headphones are uncomfortable and I'm having a lot of trouble choosing new ones.

After all this new flat has very thick walls and many belong to owners instead of renters.  \n\nAlas now half a year later I've developed the same triggers to my upstairs neighbour, who I've had to ask several times to turn his TV down since I can just listen along. With the other flat on his (top) floor being unoccupied he started to take more liberties. The end result is that he's turned it down, but he's seemingly ramped up all other noise, and I can tell he's very unhappy about being asked to do this. \n\nFrom the moment I wake up, I dread hearing him wake up. He doesn't seem to leave for work every day anymore either. I'm trying out various methods to see what blocks or distracts the best. But there is the constant anticipation that a sound will get through, and that the fight or flight will kick in. I'm worried that by running the radio he'll hear it and do the same but louder, even though my radio isn't even audible on the other side of my flat (his still resounds all the way down to our hallway). For every sound I do hear, I wonder if it is him. I'm trying to reserve my earplugs for sleep, and my noise cancelling headset as an escape / timeout tool. While working from home has been a blessing in other ways, it's horrible that it's now backfired in this way. \n\nThe funniest thing of it all is that I'm actually glad they are working in the commercial units downstairs. All of Saturday they were running jackhammers to break out the floors and while it was extremely loud, for those hours there was absolutely nothing else getting through and I felt quite at ease.

So I experience misophonia with sounds that I regularly experience, so most of my triggers are with my family. The main one is chewing, which makes meals together unbearable. I can usually mask their sounds by constantly chewing fast, which means I have to eat fast and finish my meal quickly, leaving me exposed to unmasked sounds for the remainder of the meal. I try to escape this by leaving early, and this doesn't sit well with my parents. I try to tell them their eating triggers me but they brush it off. It all came to a head today when it got so bad I tried to leave, and my dad forbid me from going to my room. I tried to stand over at the sink, explaining that their chewing really upsets me, and my dad shouted at me saying I'm rude and criticising how I eat fast, looking down (seeing them chew is another trigger) and bolting off to my room. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do? Should I save myself the torture and risk my dad's anger by trying to leave meals quickly; or should I grit it out to appease him? It really is torture, and I don't know how to explain to them how bad it is.

Sounds that are accompanied by vibration, or sounds that are vibration (if that makes any sense) bother me the most. Another important information is that I think that the fact that they happen randomly, without any patern, also bothers me. They can make a sound, then it can take 5 seconds for another one, or 5 minutes, or 10. And they are not the same, and somehow that bothers me as well.\n\nI have always had noise sensitivity, like, I've had it for years, but most noises weren't persistent and I didn't have to coexist with them. Now I do and it's getting really hard to keep it cool. It seems that it intensified now, during the pandemic, because there were a lot of people changing stuff in their apartment and for some months there were hammering and drilling sounds, so maybe that's why I developed a strong reaction to that kind of noise.\n\nI recently went to a doctor which diagnosed my misophonia. She prescribed me a muscular relaxant and passed me a treatment, which is to have some relaxation moments, using relaxing music, being aware of my breathing, minding my physical reaction. She told me about Tom Dozier and his discoveries, which she summarized to me as \"if you control your body reaction, then the emotional reaction doesn't follow\". She told me to relax for some minutes and then play the annoying sounds for some time so that I can practice controlling my reaction.\n\nWhat I've been doing: I try to do some relaxing moments, listening to nature sounds, like of a river, or of wind on trees, which seem to calm me, then I focus on my breathing, on releasing the tension on my muscles (neck and belly mostly), and on making my ear relax (sometimes it's up and I don't even notice). Then I either use a video on Youtube with sounds which resembles the annoying sounds or I try to play my recordings (which aren't too good, because my cellphone doesn't capture the sounds too well).\n\nAlso some of the noise wakes me up (even tho I use foam in my ears to block the sound. I tried sleeping with my fan on (to filter the sounds), but it didn't work that well, however I only tried once.\n\nThis treatment, which is like a \"desensitization\", has been helpful - before that I'd have some really intense heart beating and I got stressed in seconds, it was terrible, I'd get immediatelly stressed up and I wouldn't be able to focus on anything else. However, it still gets me sometimes.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had to deal with this kind of sound and how you managed to cope, and if what I'm doing is a good way to go, or if I should change something. Thank you.\n\nTL;DR: my neighbors make a lot of noise through the day and the vibrating ones specially discomfort me. My doctor recommended me having relaxing moments and then replaying the sounds to \"desensitize\" to them. I'm wondering if there is anything else I can do and if I'm on a good path to cope with it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 1907, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Coping with neighbor noises during the pandemic", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/inz0n2/coping_with_neighbor_noises_during_the_pandemic/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "catvangogh", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7hfmgnv9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1599436916, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/inwzkr/i_hate_living_in_an_apartment/", "gildings": {}, "id": "inwzkr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/inwzkr/i_hate_living_in_an_apartment/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1599436927, "score": 1, "selftext": "The person above me is driving me insane.

Founded by Jennifer Jo Brout in 2008 and led by Dr. Zach Rosenthal, research conducted within this program investigates the relationship between auditory over-responsivity/misophonia, emotions, cognition and behavior.\nPrevious studies from this program have examined the effects of meclizine on pre-pulse inhibition (Levin et al., 2014) and the relationship between sensory over-responsivity and emotions in adult psychopathology (Rosenthal et al., 2011; Rosenthal et al., in press).\nIn addition to research, we are dedicated to developing, evaluating, and establishing best practices for providers working with patients who report having misophonia. The approach we are developing is multi-disciplinary and is done in tandem with patients and their families. The self-help component to this approach is a practical combination of proactive coping skills designed to help individuals identify aversive stimuli, and learn different ways to help calm the physiological and emotional over-arousal associated with that stimuli. The program also seeks to help individuals reevaluate and change ways of thinking about aversive stimuli that may act to acerbate.  The program teaches how to help calm the physiological and emotional responses to these aversive stimuli. Updates about this program will be posted periodically.\nDonate To Help Research\nCurrent Studies\nSensory Processing and Mental Health Study\nSome people respond to sensory cues in their daily environments differently than others. Problem with processing sensory information (e.g., getting angry when hearing certain sounds) can be associated with various behavioral health problems.\nThis study was funded by the Wallace Research Foundation and is no longer active. The study examines the relationship between self-reported responses to sensory cues (during childhood and adulthood) and various mental health problems.\nGeneralization of Emotion Regulation\nThis is a study about the ways in which people cope with emotional distress in their lives. We will be looking at ways to understand how to help people calm down easier after they become emotionally distressed. We are interested in how to do this both inside the clinic and also outside in the real world.\nInvestigating Antihistamine Treatment to Reduce Sensory Over-responsiveness \nHistamine, in addition to being a chemical that controls nasal and stomach acid secretions and itch responses also serves as a transmitter between neurons in the brain. We have found that brain histamine systems play important roles in sensory responsivity. In preclinical studies we have shown that a certain type of antihistamine treatment can help reverse sensory gating impairments. In an initial clinical study with people who have difficulty modulating their sensory responsiveness, antihistamine treatment improved sensory screening without producing sedation. This initial study was in people with general sensory over-responsiveness.\n________________________________________\nThe Polyvagal Theory \u2013 Stephen Porges\nPolyvagal Theory makes predictions based on acoustic properties. The Polyvagal Theory proposes that subjective responses to sounds are initially (before associative learning) based on two features of the acoustic signal: pitch and variation in pitch. The theory articulates that for mammals there is a frequency band of perceptual advantage in which social communication occurs. It is within this frequency band that acoustic \u201csafety\u201d cues are conveyed.\nConsistent with the theory, safety is signaled when the pitch of the acoustic signal is modulated within this band. Thus, a monotone within this band is not sufficient to signal safety. Moreover, the theory proposes that low frequency monotone sounds (e.g., dog\u2019s bark, lion\u2019s roar, large truck, and thunder) are inherent signals of predator and high frequency monotone sounds are inherent signals of pain and danger (e.g., shrill cries of babies or someone who is being injured).\n\nwww.dukescience.org", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Research - The Sensory Processing and Emotion Regulation Program \u2013 Duke University", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/5mr8hv/research_the_sensory_processing_and_emotion/"}, {"author": "Imperceptions", "author_created_utc": 1462900879, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_xtzby", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1483888127, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/5mr8cr/research_the_polyvagal_theory_stephen_porges/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5mr8cr", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/5mr8cr/research_the_polyvagal_theory_stephen_porges/", "retrieved_on": 1489413324, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Polyvagal Theory makes predictions based on acoustic properties.

A PDF version is available here: http://misophoniainternational.com/accommodation-letter-template/acco-letter-template/\n\nTHIS LETTER IS FOR A SAMPLE ONLY. IT CANNOT BE USED ON ITS OWN, WITHOUT A DOCTOR RE-WRITING.\n\nIf you are unsure if your doctor will provide a letter, and would like advice, please contact Jennifer.\n\nExplanation of Disorder\nThe term Misophonia literally means \u201chatred of sound. Rather, they have highly aversive reactions to specific patterned-based sounds, and some are also over-responsive to visual stimuli.\nIndividuals with these kinds of auditory and visual over-responsivity (similar to what has been known as Sensory Processing Disorder, subtype, SOR) have demonstrated autonomic arousal and decreased habituation in neuroscience and physiologic studies since 1999. What does this mean for [Name Omitted]?\nWhen [Name Omitted] encounters everyday auditory (and visual stimuli) that most people would not notice, her brain misperceives, or processes this stimuli as though it were dangerous. As a result, she experiences physiological arousal up to and including what we all know of as the flight/flight reaction. This is not something that is within [Name Omitted]\u2019s control, and is part of an involuntary autonomic nervous system response. This happens in milliseconds without conscious mediation.\nAs such, sufferers, feel bombarded by both noise and visual stimuli. Once this bombardment occurs [Name Omitted] may feel a variety of physical discomforts such as nausea, dizziness, as well as what one might describe as increasing mental and physical tension and a more subjective need to \u201cflee\u201d (or more simply stated) leave the place in which offending stimuli exists. Again, this is a fight/flight reaction that is beyond [Name Omitted]\u2019 control. If she is unable to \u201cflee\u201d or leave the environment in order to get away from the aversive stimuli, her adrenaline level continues to elevate, and other hormonal and physiological changes related to the fight/flight response occur, culminating in what many people describe as experience, \u201ca severe anxiety attack\u201d, \u201crage\u201d, or \u201cpanic\u201d.\nIn addition, 15 years of research on individuals with Sensory Over-Responsivity has also shown a deficit in habituation. That is, once the fight/flight system is set off, the part of the nervous system that is normally activated in order to put the \u201cbrakes\u201d on fight/flight does not act efficiently. Thus, for [Name Omitted], normal everyday sensory stimuli is overloading and causes her to become severely dysregulated, but also the way her particular nervous system works disables her ability to calm down.\nUnfortunately, it is impossible to predict what auditory or other sensory stimuli might cause reactivity. Often the stimuli vary, and change over time. In addition, levels of reactivity may vary from day to day and in association with stress, rest and other daily living factors. To date, there is no cure for this condition. Occupational Therapy has helped in regard to some elements of Sensory Processing Disorder. However, there is as of yet no treatment for auditory of visual over-responsivity, or most certainly not for the condition now described as Misophonia.\nAs such, it is extraordinarily difficult for people with this condition to lead functional lives. The problem is not simply one of dealing with the continually overloaded and dysregulated system. The problem extends to the toll this takes on one\u2019s body. Individuals with this problem often become extremely tired, or conversely develop sleep difficulty. They may also suffer from depression because this is a difficult condition with which to live, with no treatment and little understanding within even the medical community as of yet.\nThere are times that exposing oneself to an environment full of sensory stimuli is both physically and psychologically overwhelming to the extent that recent research describes many sufferers living very isolated lives, and others often feeling the need to stay at home where they can control the sounds and light levels (for example).\nBoth SPD/SOR research and the new Misophonia research both suggest that severity of the disorder runs on a continuum, with some people experiencing it as much more severe than others and with possible variations throughout the lifespan.\nAt this point in time there are no validated severity measures from which a doctor can determine an individuals\u2019 level of life impairment or functioning, and most sufferers (as well as psychologists) are using practical daily living skills and management plans to try to assist until further research on the etiology and treatment of this disorder is developed.\n\nRecommendations\n[Name Omitted]  should to take quizzes and tests in a room separate from others. This will allow her to minimize sensory stimuli to which she may react.\n[Name Omitted]  should be allowed to leave the classroom for small breaks when needed.

As of now, there is no official consensus on what exactly causes the disorder. Though it was coined in 2001 by Jastreboff and Jastreboff there has been little research published under the disorder\u2019s current name.\n\nResearchers such as Joseph E. LeDoux and Stephen Porges have been researching auditory over-responsivity. However, the name of the disorder matters little since researchers are more focused on what\u2019s going on inside the brain and body and not merely perceived notions and sweeping generalizations.\n\nMany that sufferer from misophonia struggle with similar symptoms. Commonly, tapping, whistling, chewing, and other repetitive sounds cause this severe reaction. Though the disorder manifests with aversions to sights and sounds, many are proposing that its cause is physiological and not psychological.\n\nwhat is misophonia?There are currently no experts on Misophonia and no one doctor or researcher can claim that they have all the answers. This is also true of treatments and coping methods. Before trying a treatment please ensure that you are aware that new disorders not only carry a lack of treatment but also a risk. If you are trying experimental treatments please be wary. If you feel uncomfortable with your treatment provider, do not hesitate to refrain from continuing.\n\nAs of now, much of the research must be geared toward preliminary findings. The first steps to understanding Misophonia comes from academic and ethically conducted research that will lay the groundwork for future studies and findings. The IMRN works vehemently to ensure that several angles of research are being explored. We are not committed to one theory over another. Our focus on research is about the journey. As research changes and develops, so will our ideas on the disorder.\n\nThere seems to be an overlap between SPD SOR (Sensory Processing Disorder; Sub-set Sensory Over Responsivity) and Misophonia. However, this overlap is entirely based on symptoms. Whether or not the two are related remains to be seen. Though, due to the close over-lap, Lucy Miller of the SPD Foundation has joined the IMRN advisory board to help facilitate research to see if the two may in-fact be related. If this is true, this explains the similarities between misophonics, autistics, Aspergers patients, as well as other disorders.\n\nThe cause of Misophonia is secondary right now to its impact on the lives of sufferers. As a magazine and news site we hope to connect sufferers with their researchers. Since there is no official cure it is important that we act as shoulders and support systems for each other. Together we can ask for answers. The IMRN (www.misophonia-research.com) does not believe that one researchers proposals are more important than another. Though we may currently be fundraising for one lab this does not mean that we are not exploring all avenues. A cross-disciplinary approach is our best case scenario when it comes to finding answers. This means that audiologists, neurologists, psychologists, and several professionals are the key to finding answers. When asking \u2018what is misophonia?\u2019 we must realize that it is through working together that we find the greatest answers.

I believe this is in part because of being homeschooled by her in a very toxic home encironment for much of my childhood. I couldn't escape her or her noises. These days she knows full well what my condition is and still takes every opportunity to poke fun at it. Say we're visiting as a family and she decides to start snacking while talking, I'll try to quietly walk away without drawing too much attention to it. She'll then outright laugh at me and \"joke\" about how I can't handle her chewing. This happens literally every time we eat together, to the point that my whole family knows about my miso and makes fun of it. It makes me miserable, and I think the lack of empathy and respect has actually made my miso worse. To be clear, my misophonia shouldn't be someone else's problem. But when I try to cope the only way I can, I don't appreciate being made fun of for it. It's exhausting. No one in my family really seems to take the condition seriously at all, and family dinners feel like minefields. I think this has actually made my miso worse. I find myself triggered more and more by the sight of chewing, which makes my job hard to cope with because my job allows people to eat at their desks, and even with headphones in, I'm still constantly working around triggers. I'm just so tired of this, but it seems like there's nothing more I can do. Nobody seems to understand just how miserable misophonia can be unless they have it themselves.

My triggers are: chewing, tounge movement, swallowing, breathing, and anything else people do. I didn't use to be this way and know that as a kid sounds didn't bother me. My parents understand that something is wrong with me, but they aren't the best and dealing with it. They'll usually tell me to go to my room if they start eating any time other than dinner time. And my brothers voice is actually another trigger for me in a weird way. \n\nBut that's fine, it's like he'll being with them but I could have dealt with that. But then I think I started to get worse. I don't know if anyone else has this happen to them or even if it's normal. But around a month to three months ago I started to hear myself when I was eating and drinking, or when my stomach made noises. And I started to trigger myself. I'm worried where this might take me and if it will affect my eating. Slowly I've started to drive myself insane and it's hell. \n\nThere isn't much I do to calm down and I get into a lot of fights because of noise. But one thing that does seem to work to calm me down are strangely enough certain noises. I've found out that noises that are random and inconsistent become triggers and noises that constant calm me down. When I get angry I try to stick my watch in my ear to hear the second hand tick, and that sometimes does the trick. And when it rains I just listen to it and I don't even notice chewing even if someone's next to me. Things like that give me hope that some day someone will figure out what to do next with this strange issue, because right now no one cares about misophonia.\n\nIf you have any tips please tell me, or if you have anti-triggers.

I've noticed since moving in 2 years ago that he subconsciously has a picking habit. He's constantly picking his fingernails, biting his fingernails (he even bites them OFF and chews on them sometimes), picking his feet/toenails, picking any bits of skin he can find... the list goes on. I'm *pretty* sure it's not an anxious thing btw, I think he's just fidgety. It mostly seems to be when we're watching movies but he has been known to do it in bed, whilst sitting at his computer, driving.. everywhere!\n\nAnyway, the picking of nails/skin makes a HORRIBLE \"clicking\" noise that drives me absolutely insane. I try SO hard to be reasonable and calm and I try to ignore it. However, the longer it goes on the more irrationally angry I seem to feel. There have been a couple of occasions I've snapped \"Will you please stop that?!\" at him. He'll stop for all of 5 minutes, but then before I know it, he's doing it again... argh! I've told him about Misophonia and he seems to not take it seriously.\n\nI'm trying to help him, for both my sanity and the sake of his skin/fingers/toes, but I'm not sure what to do. Anyone else get triggered by the sound of nail biting etc. or is it just me?

I am a person who hates others period. I don't enjoy socializing, mostly because of the risks of being triggered. She shows me bunny photos, lets me squeeze her hands, and honestly deals with my yelling and bad mood. \n\nThe other day we went to see ROCKETMAN, and let me tell you, great movie. But, freaking old people eating like cows and making me want to kill myself. But, what I did was stepped out before anything started on the screen ( I still heard the sounds outside ) and debated whether or not to go back to my friend. My phone died so my music that usually  helped me was out of question. My friend came back and we argued about it, and how bringing me to a movie was a terrible idea. But, because she was tired and the seats in our theater were fancy ASF I decided to just deal with it. I slapped on my headphones and slumped in my chair. \n\nI ended up taking my headphones off about a half hour later and the sound of the movie and music was so loud it was amazing. I didn't hear the old women chew ( she couldn't help it, I know ) and I enjoyed it! My friend and I were singing adn I was so thankful that she was there and she talked me into seeing the movie and honestly I always feel bad for doing this to her, she is amazing and I am a crummy friend most times. \n\nThings like this makes me was to start scratching my wrists until they bleed. It's been what, a year? Roughly almost since I've last broke a pencil and started to do my type of cutting so I could calm down. I promised her that I wouldn't do it.  I promised my ex that I wouldn't do it. I promised the few people in my life that cares about my Misophonia that I wouldn't do it. \n\nSO, to all of you who are crying to sleep, or want to give up, don't. It's not worth it. Find a friend that will be what my friend is to me. And if you can't, then message me. I would love to be that friend to you. \n\nI'm going into my third year of high school. It's going to suck, I know that. But, with her, and this chatroom I feel so much better about the upcoming year. \n\nThank you ! \n\n\\- MarinaWasMaria", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 494, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Somewhat Good News", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561523434, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/c52gt0/somewhat_good_news/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "meeshcellaneous", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_aovgouw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1561419967, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/c4ydyl/misophonia_getting_worse_as_i_become_more_aware/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c4ydyl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#33cc33", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "5b931b10-4038-11e9-9f72-0e3f9e09b804", "link_flair_text": "Support", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/c4ydyl/misophonia_getting_worse_as_i_become_more_aware/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1561419968, "score": 12, "selftext": "I recently (about a year ago) found out about misophonia.

I am prescribed fluoxotine but I haven't been taking it to be honest and I want to but I can't get refils unless I see my psychiatrist, and since I can't make every appointment I dont want to start the medication and then fall off track because I can't see her to get a refil if that makes any sense. My trigger sounds are throat clearing and coughing and I can't stand seeing people lick their lips on top of other sounds I don't like and etc. I would say all this started when I was around 7 or so sometime after my mom died. Everyone I live with coughs religiously and I guess they make an effort not to but it bothers me they do it at all and honestly the sounds piss me off most when coming from them. Even the throatclearing in tv and movies trigger me. I can't help this stomping and hitting my head and screaming outbursts and sometimes I can't help but burst in tears because I feel trapped. My family doesnt understand me no matter how much they say they do, sometimes they say shit like they dont care and that theyre not gonna \"choke for me\" when I'm not asking them to, I'm just asking them to not do it so much around me, they act like its something I do to act out and I can't help but get suicidal thoughts from it all. Idk how I'll go on in my adult life with this and it's something I've expressed concern for to my therapist but idk sometimes it feels like its getting worse sometimes it feels like its getting better. I honestly don't think I'll make it to adulthood, I fight this everyday, its exhausting. and on top of it all I have other shit going on, school is in the dump for me, missed almost all of 10th grade. have been pretty much flunking school since 5th grade. moms dead. havent seen my dad in almost a year and if he were to show up idek if I'd wanna continue a relationship with him anymore. relationship with my grandparents is iffy and when theyre gone I have nothing because I'm not really close with anyone else in my huge family. I don't wanna be in a psych ward or a home I just feel like moving out could do alot for me but my psychiatrist said I can't because of my mental state or something. and my therapist said I'd need to be able to support myself. and even with all this I dont even know if I'd be able to get emancipated with this. Itll be seen as a classic case of I wanna move out because I dont like my parents. Which isnt why for me. I think having someone to talk to who can relate to me would help alot. Someone who has this condition or something that impacts them everyday.

So. Much. Upwards of 3 times a day, he has what I call \u201csneeze attacks\u201d that seem to go on forever. This is coupled with constant sniffling and snorting to clear his nose. \n\nHe also smokes weed (which is obviously fine) and it makes him cough a *lot*. It\u2019s infuriating. He is also an avid coffee-slurper.\n\nHe also had ADHD and I believe this is what causes him to make these odd ear-piercing, spine-tingling, skin-crawling sounds at random. From random yells to shrieks to snorts to things I am probably forgetting, if he\u2019s bored or stagnant for too long, he starts making these odd sounds that trigger me beyond belief. It seems like they\u2019re related to his ADHD because this category of sounds is entirely removed from his sneezing/coughing/snorting, etc.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about this many times before. We\u2019ve had countless discussions about my misophonia and his respiratory issues that cause his sneezing, coughing, sniffling and snorting, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Nothing changes, truthfully I don\u2019t think anything can possibly change because half of the noises he makes aren\u2019t even his fault or under his control! \n\nI feel wickedly guilty for getting so frustrated with the noises - I know it\u2019s the sounds and not him and I have to constantly remind myself of that. I have desperately tried to control my irritability and I know he\u2019s tried to change or stop making the sounds he *can* control. \n\nI love him so much, and I don\u2019t want misophonia to control my enjoyment of life. I mean, obviously he isn\u2019t the only person in the world that triggers me! *Sounds* trigger me, not people! I don\u2019t want misophonia to become a personality trait of mine.\n\nI\u2019m not even really looking for advice, though I\u2019d consider it if it were offered.

I don't have an issue with anyone else, but him. He is the most disgusting person I have ever met, and I know that my reaction to his sounds make me feel this way, but that's how I feel. When he's not eating, he is constantly moaning, groaning, sighing, or coughing. Seriously, this man cannot move without making some  noise that somehow must short out my rational brain because I feel irrationally angry whenever he moans, sighs or makes another irritating noise. He\u2019s not old enough to be in pain when he moves, I think, sarcastically of courseD that every movement he makes must just feel so good he just has to vocalize his pleasure. Right now he's asleep on the couch but every minute or so he'll moan, it drives me up the GD wall. He\u2019ll be walking and just start moaning or sighing, but that\u2019s not it. He\u2019s a terrible eater. He chews gum like a cow, and can\u2019t keep his mouth closed for the life of him. He does that smacking thing when he opens his mouth to take another disgusting bite, I don\u2019t even know how to describe it. I can hear him eating chocolate from across the room. How someone can eat chocolate loud enough to hear across the room, I don\u2019t know, but he manages. It sounds like white people having sex when he eats. He\u2019ll burp loudly and exclaim \u201cahhh, that felt good.\u201d Like thanks, didn\u2019t need to know that, but that\u2019s not the end of it. I sleep down the hall and whenever he gets into his bed he makes the loudest moaning/exclamation of pleasure when he lays down. I can literally hear him moaning from down the hall in my own room with the door closed. He\u2019ll tell my mom \u201coh yea my back cracked, that felt so good\u201d and moan some more. If you were to record this man, no video, just the audio and patch it over a porno, you wouldn\u2019t know the difference. I swear to god he\u2019s the most irritating human being to ever exist. No one else bothers me, but he can be in another room and moan like a cow having an aneurysm and I\u2019ll lose my freaking marbles.

absolute hell for someone like me. Classmates make annoying sounds in every lesson, and most of the time I'm struggling to stay calm. I have low self-esteem, which basically means I hate myself, and I hate having to interact with people older than me. I hate having the attention on me, and I hate how some of the teachers act towards the class. I hate my classmates and people who aren't even in my classes. I just basically hate school in general, because it's the place that gives me the most stress and it causes the most panic attacks for me.\n\nSometimes, the panic attacks are caused by my surroundings. It can be the work I have to do which I don't understand, or it can be how bad the teacher is, or it can be how my classmates feel like acting on the day. It can be the thoughts racing in my head, it can be the self-doubt I have, it can be having to do something I'm massively uncomfortable with like a specific task. In general, I stress over anything and everything, and it's pretty crap because of how frequently I cry in class and nobody really knows how to fix me.\n\nFor the past few days (maybe a week or two), I've noticed that my misophonia has been causing me more problems than everything else. I've had strong feelings of anger towards specific noises for two years, but back then it wasn't as bad as it was now. Back then, it was just a few noises that would irritate me, and when I'd tell person to stop, they did. Back then, I didn't feel like murdering the person who was making the sounds. Back then, I didn't end up in tears once every week. \n\nNow, however, it's just been getting worse and worse. Classmates would make these noises that I hate having to listen to, and when I'd ask them to stop, they would still continue. One of my friends does it a lot when I'm sitting next to her, and even she has continued doing it when I tried to make her stop. And the fact that they do movements that freak me out doesn't help either. I hate having to watch them do these things that irritate me so much, just because they're in my field of view and they don't bother listening to me. It's gotten to the point where it completely overwhelms me, and I break down crying. \n\nI have a temporary solution to hearing these noises, and I think others will have the same thing or something similar: music. Whenever I can, I plug my earphones into my ears and play music on my phone - I've collected a lot over a few months. A lot of it is helpful at blocking out the surrounding noise, and most of the time it helps me relax when things become too much. My friends, though, think I shouldn't use my earphones every day or that I should at least turn my volume down as I play my music pretty loudly. I can't just do that. The songs I listen to are really special, I guess.\n\nThe reason why I call it a temporary solution is because I was informed that listening to music actually makes misophonia worse. A quick Google search will direct you to hearingcenterdallas.com, where they state, \"Blocking out sound actually makes the misophonia worse. The trigger sounds become much more intrusive - perhaps even more trigger sounds develop - and earplugs are worn more frequently.\" Knowing this, I don't really know if I should continue using music as a way to cope. The sounds, as I've mentioned before, have actually became worse, and I think this is the reason why.\n\nI've explained this to my father. He's told me that I definitely need help with what I'm going through, and has recommended that I should get noise-cancelling headphones. My mother, however, thinks otherwise, and believes that they would be unnecessary. She has more power than my father, and so the decision is up to her. She refuses to buy them for me. Honestly, I think the headphones would actually help me more, as I've worn them before and I really do think they could help me in my situation. Hell, I might even get permission to wear them in class if it ever gets to that. She doesn't want me to have them though, and I don't know why, so I'm still going to suffer anyway.\n\nSo, ultimately, I have no way out of this situation. If I keep using music as a way to deal with it, it'll just keep getting worse and worse. If I keep having to deal with the sounds, I'm gonna have to prepare myself for many more crying sessions. I know that if this keeps going, I'm going to start being afraid of the people around me and be even more afraid of school itself. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 452, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It's getting really bad, and I need some sort of solution to deal with it", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1558058301, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/bp2169/its_getting_really_bad_and_i_need_some_sort_of/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "redandbluenights", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_10zz06", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1557763517, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/bo5e8f/nail_clipping_in_a_public_space_wtf/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bo5e8f", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/bo5e8f/nail_clipping_in_a_public_space_wtf/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1557763519, "score": 12, "selftext": "So.. nail clipping is a HUGE trigger for me. For some reason, at the nail salon, maybe because I'm prepared and I understand the reasoning, and it seems \"clean\" there, it doesn't bother me as much- but it's pretty much banned in my house (I clip my nails, my husband's and my son's by request.)\n\nSo last night, I'm at the BOWLING ALLEY of all places, and this guy, two lanes over (it's pretty empty- no one was between our lanes)- just whips out nail clippers and starts clipping his nails STANDING AT THE BALL RETURN- letting them just fly and land wherever- I was INSANELY enraged. \n\nNormally, I try to pretend that I'm normal. If someone is whistling - I sure as hell don't flip out on them, and if I can't help but react, Ill attribute it to a \"migraine coming on\" or something someone might relate to and understand. \n\nBut there was no pretending on this one- my hands FLEW to cover my ears,my husband looked at me funny, my eyes darted with panic towards the cause, and he immediately saw it too. \n\nHe was just standing there; -Noise - NOISE-  noise-\n\nAnd I couldn't help it; out loud (plenty loud enough to be heard over the ball returns and music) I shouted \"Ew! Who the FUCK does that in public- what are they- animals?!\" \n\nAnd while he continued to laugh with his wife and clip his nails, standing right there, I got more and more irate (and louder).

floor creaking but if i walk over where it is, it doesn't change or stop if i move. it sounds more like a hard tap on wood. \n\nit also sometimes sounds like it moves: i stand where i think its coming from and then it makes the sound again but from a different place. sometimes i cant hear it but most times i can. also its not consistent and the time between taps varies and it drives me crazy. i cant sleep at night and i usually end up falling asleep due to exhaustion.\n\nthe only time i can wear headphones or earplugs is on weekends since i have school and i will most definitely oversleep my alarms. when i try to show the sound to anyone else, the sound stops and they deem it as nothing. whenever i try to record it, the microphone cant pick it up. i also noticed that i can hear it only at night (very convenient).\n\ni'm starting to think its just a figment of my imagination or some tool to haunt me. i get nervous before bed and i pray i cant hear the sounds.\n\ni dont think anyone can

I think it's probably misophonia related though because it gives me a lot of anxiety and makes me feel trapped and suffocated.

I\u2019ve shown them articles about Misophonia being a legit neurological condition, but they don\u2019t seem to acknowledge. \n\nPlease excuse any faults in my language.

So as the title says, I've created /r/hatredofsound after a discussion theorizing (and in all likelihood) that the mod of this sub is likely an alt account for one of the main sub's mods. Obviously, for people trying to escape the self admitted increasing dictatorial nature of the main sub this is troublesome.\n\nAs I explain in the creation post over at the new sub, I named it the 'hatred of sound' because I didn't want the sub to have a name that made it feel secondary to the larger sub. \n\nAll cards on the table, I've created the sub, am currently the owner/moderator or whatever and also am one of two subscribers. Great sales pitch, right? I also have no moderating experience. As such, while I'm doing some research on the matter if the sub gains even a little traction I'll want to either hand over the sub or take on a fellow moderator or two.\n\nSo, there's a new sub for people who want the post-able content to be more varied. What now?\nWell, really, I just hope it gains subscribers and begins to act in a way similar to how the larger sub did, perhaps 6 months ago. \n\nAdditionally, it is entirely possible that the mod team of /r/misophonia comes around and reverses in the least the latest changes to the sub. This would be ideal even if it meant sticking around with the same moderators because then there would be no splitting of the userbase, although this seems unlikely. \n\nThat'll about do it, I think. If you have any concerns, criticisms or anything else feel free to leave it here or on the sub linked. \n\nHere's a link to the post containing the discussion I referenced. Look for my parent comment and it spurs on from there in multiple directions and I have no doubt that it will continue to do so over the next day or two. \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/axg0ns/given_that_rmisophonia_no_longer_welcomes/ \n\nThanks.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 283, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Created /r/hatredofsound due to this sub being likely being owned by a /r/misophonia mod", "updated_utc": 1554005698, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/axl9ac/created_rhatredofsound_due_to_this_sub_being/"}, {"author": "Legit_Sewer_Review", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1ltxcak6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1551763671, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/axhg0w/anyone_tried_paxil_to_help_with_symptoms/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "axhg0w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/axhg0w/anyone_tried_paxil_to_help_with_symptoms/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1551763671, "score": 5, "selftext": "I've been on it about a month and my moods have been fluctuating wildly the past few days, I guess 'cause it's not stabilized in my system yet?

I have really bad sound sensitivity, usually I can handle it but when it\u2019s time to wind down and sleep I just snap. So for the past few days I\u2019ve hardly been sleeping because of sound sensitivity. Anyway, yesterday I was going to take a nap, positive that I could sleep and continue enjoying the holidays but my sisters wouldn\u2019t leave the room and go to one of our friends hotel rooms just temporarily so I could try sleeping, just the thought of hearing the keyboard of my sisters computer (she was playing minecraft) aggressively click, and my other sister who was outside coming inside letting the light in and making a bang noise with the door drove me crazy and pushed me over the edge. I tried asking so many times if they could just please leave but they refused. In my fit of rage and to avoid yelling at them I texted my mum that I wanted to leave. So today I\u2019m leaving very soon and I\u2019m crying because I just really don\u2019t want to go. The problem is I can\u2019t handle sleeping in the same room (it\u2019s a room with 2 double beds with 4 people in it) with my mum because she\u2019s one of my worst triggers. She\u2019s the opposite to me, enragingly loud, she\u2019s also a smoker so she\u2019s constantly leaving the room, opening and closing the door with a bang. And because she\u2019s an adult she only sleeps 4-7 hours a night, she\u2019s snores, sleep talks and sleep walks. Which means I\u2019m up late to her snoring and up early because she doesn\u2019t sleep. \n\nI just feel like I\u2019m crazy, and my mum makes me feel crazy too, whenever I\u2019ve told her about this she tells me to \u201cjust sleep\u201d or tells me that maybe I only need 6 hours a night because she does\u2014 but when I have 6 hours my muscles feel weak and my head heavy and foggy and I feel so irritated.

I was pretty discouraged about it and extremely worried about my future.\n\nI have just finished my first week of student teaching. I haven't had so few triggers happen in my life since before my misophonia developed. I'm not sure exactly why, though I have theories. It could be the proximity between myself and the students (they're further away and I'm not caught in the middle of a big group like I was as a student), the greater control I feel in a teaching position, or because my mind is too worried about teaching to be bothered by anything else (I'm still getting my feet wet in all of this, haha). But I feel so calm compared to how I usually am. In my seminar class where I'm a student again, I was ready to lose my mind over someone's throat clearing (seriously, every 30 seconds??). But when I'm in front of the classroom, it's completely different.\n\nJust wanted to share a positive, hopeful experience, because I know full well that they are far and few when it comes to this disorder. I can't say how this will go in the future, especially as more research starts to come out about misophonia. But for now, I think all will be okay. To any future teachers out there afraid to come back to one of the settings where their disorder hit them the worst, you might just have nothing to worry about after all. :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 3375, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Teaching with Misophonia", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/s65alt/teaching_with_misophonia/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "babybeluga77", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5cqm7jqj", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642425808, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/s63y92/s2_euphoria/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s63y92", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "6c5b5cda-3f77-11e9-9e70-0eeb6e9bf338", "link_flair_text": "Trigger Warning", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/s63y92/s2_euphoria/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642425819, "score": 1, "selftext": "hi friends this is for my babes out there,,the new episode of euphoria that came out last night has soo many triggers in the first half, like the \u201ccommon\u201d ones if yk what i mean. \n\nwhen fez and sweeney are in the kitchen together just fricken mute it okay \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\n\nbut for real have ur volume control on standby the entire ep for real. stay strong soldiers. \n\ncan we talk about how every new indie show or movie includes like hella m**** noises for no reason? ughhhhh what is thatttt", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 3375, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "s2 euphoria", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/s63y92/s2_euphoria/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Drephemonte", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3o3r9h40", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642404698, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/s5y5zk/dealing_with_dorm_parties/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s5y5zk", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#33cc33", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "5b931b10-4038-11e9-9f72-0e3f9e09b804", "link_flair_text": "Support / Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/s5y5zk/dealing_with_dorm_parties/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642404708, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm a freshman college student living in a dorm.

I'm always having to go to school wearing ear plugs or earphones to block out noises so I can study, but that's usually not enough for me, and I'm left feeling exhausted and anxious whenever I come home\n\nHome isn't very trigger-proof either. I always have to put up with my dad sniffling or laughing, or my mom having loud phone calls with her sister. I have a white noise machine in my room which helps, but I really just want silence sometimes instead of constant white noise.\n\nI'm feeling more and more miserable every day, and even more desperate to talk to someone about this. But neither of my parents even know what misophonia is. I know they're both sympathetic people and they would probably understand my situation, but I'm still afraid to talk to them about it.\n\nI've read too many horror stories on this subreddit, \"My mom intentionally triggers me\" this, \"my dad makes fun of me for my misophonia\" that, I'm just so scared of that happening to me.\n\nBy directly telling my parents about my misophonia, I'm making myself vulnerable, they *could* use it against me. I know for sure they wouldn't, but I keep thinking \"what if\"\n\nI don't know how to approach them about it either. I'm thinking of starting by talking to my mom about it since she's the \"easy one to talk to\" and trying to see if I can maybe talk to someone or at least help weaken my misophonia. I'm not going to ask her to downright stop making trigger noises, I know that's unreasonable to ask of her, because I'm not as quiet as I'd like to think I am. That'd just be hypocritical and controlling.\n\nThinking of all the possibilities that could happen is making me anxious, what if she doesn't believe misophonia is real? What if she thinks I just need to \"learn to tune out noises\"? What if she gets angry at me for being agitated about the noises they make?\n\nBut the biggest thing I worry about is making a fool of myself. What if I look stupid for trying to explain misophonia to her, and make it sound like I'm crazy? What if she thinks the articles and research about misophonia are silly?\n\nOr what if nothing happens afterwards? She just forgets about the whole talk, and I'm completely out of people to talk to?

I would love to fall asleep that quickly but I've got to do breathing exercises and counting and relaxation techniques. By the time I'm even close to relaxed he's started snoring so loudly the bed vibrates. He's always like \"oh just wake me up babe\" and I do but it makes me more and more angry. When I do finally fall asleep it's hours after I'm meant to and when he's stopped snoring briefly. Then the next day I start work from home at 6.45am and he gets up for work about that time too so he'll be in the kitchen (where my desk is) clinking dishes, moving stuff, getting ready etc and it's just so loud and sometimes makes me really jumpy so then I'm feeling anxious and angry. Then when he comes home at 5:10 he'll start his dinner or he'll do the dishes and more clinking and moving stuff and just noises and by this point I'm exhausted, haven't finished work yet (I finish at 6.45pm) I'm tired bc I didn't sleep well, working all day and now all these noises are happening and I try my hardest just to be chill but I end up flipping out so often, he'll then remind me that I shouldn't have moved my desk to the kitchen from the bedroom.

My main triggers are swallows and chewing sounds. I've had my dog Biscuit since I was 12 years old. He's a Maltese.\n\nFor 13 years, I never had any misophonia triggers or issues with Biscuit. He's always been such a sweet dog and I've babied him ever since he was a puppy. I was over the moon to get a dog, for more than a decade we did nearly everything together. He's 15 now.\n\nThe problem is that ever since my husband and I had a baby 2 years ago, every single one of Biscuit's sounds now triggers my misophonia very badly. His licking, smacking, eating his food, drinking water, even the sound of his claws on the floor. I noticed this change immediately when I brought my son home from the hospital after birth (I'm guessing it was brought on by the dramatic hormonal shift of giving birth). I was very conflicted and confused because his sounds had never bothered me before. It's so bad, we're talking full-blown misophonia anguish. I have used my usual coping tools of having white noise/fan going in the house, periodically wearing my noise-canceling headphones, practicing mindfulness, deep breathing, etc. I did my best to be kind to him and to myself. This all helped to some degree, but the problem never went away.\n\nFor the past 2 years, I've found it extremely difficult to get close to him, pet him, snuggle, etc. I guess my mind and body are perceiving him as a threat because of his noises. I've forced myself to snuggle him and give him plenty of pets, because he's just a dog and of course it's not his fault that he makes natural dog sounds. He deserves love and affection. I've done my best to keep our relationship like it was before my son was born, but if I'm being honest, for the last 2 years my dog has mostly been a major source of stress.\n\nFast forward to now, I'm 6 months pregnant with our second child. I find myself getting more and more annoyed and angry at Biscuit for all of his noises. I've had some of the worst misophonia experiences of my life with this dog. I feel so conflicted, because even though I love my dog, I don't think I'll ever have a good relationship with him again. Sometimes it gets so bad, I fantasize about giving the dog away and finding him a new home. I've never hurt my dog before, and I never will, but I've definitely imagined it many times after he makes a noise, and I don't feel comfortable with that. It's very difficult to not hate myself for this issue. I feel like my dog deserves an owner who doesn't have to force themselves to be sweet and affectionate to him.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel like I can't give him away this late in his life. He's 15 now, which is the average life expectancy for his breed. He already has cataracts and arthritis. He can't hear or smell very well anymore, either (although he can still run around).

I don't know where it originated or how it came into my life, but my first real experience misophonia was in eighth grade, when I began to cry in the middle of a test because everyone around me was sniffling. Sniffling was my first trigger, and still my biggest one.\n\nI absolutely dread going to school every day. On the surface, I'm an excellent student. I get straight A's, I take advanced courses, I always turn in my work on time, and I get along with everybody. But in reality, I'm feel like an anxious, caffeine-addicted mess who cannot function in a classroom without ear plugs and Bluetooth earphones blasting white noise into my brain.\n\nI have to deal with the constant threat of sniffling sounds all day, the only time I have total silence is night time. But since I have to wake up at 5:20 in the freakin' morning, god forbid I stay up past 10:30 if I want to feel at least a little rested.\n\nI've been feeling cranky and irritable every day, each day more than the last. It has gotten to the point where I begin to despise specific people who dare to sniffle in my presence. I just feel like I'm tanking through every day at school, just to relax for a few hours before the cycle repeats itself over and over.\n\nI feel absolutely helpless with this situation, nothing I'm doing seems to be working. I've tried exposing myself to triggers, hiding from triggers, associating triggers with happy thoughts, labelling my feelings, repeatedly telling myself my brain is only messing with me, reading articles about misophonia, avoiding the subject of misophonia completely, exercising, eating healthier, cutting caffeine, drinking even more caffeine... I'm done trying. Everything is just getting worse.\n\nAnd what's left after being triggered minute after minute is a dreadful feeling. The thought that I'm going to have to deal with this constant agonizing feeling every day until I die. The thought that the rest of my life is going to be filled with hundreds of earplugs and white noise. The thought that I'm forever going to be held back in life because my brain decided \"sniffing and chewing = bad\". The thought that I will never be able to do normal things, like go to the movies, or eat at a quiet restaurant.\n\nAnd the sickening fact that misophonia controls my life.\n\nI have no idea who to talk to about this. My dad has absolutely no idea I have these problems, my mom doesn't know how misophonia works at all (which I understand), I'm not close enough to both of my friends to talk to about my emotional problems, and I don't know whether I should talk to my guidance counselor or not (Let alone know what their name is)\n\nAnd asking for a therapist is obviously going to freak out my parents, and possibly anger them. I don't want them to feel like they did something wrong. I'm especially worried about upsetting my dad, he'd feel devastated if I went up to him and requested to talk to someone.\n\nMy life would be perfect if I didn't have misophonia.

He is nowadays playing many hours almost every day and that really makes me suffer. I am scared to come home from school because my brother is probably already at home playing and making loud sounds.

But due to this shitty condition, I am so scared to enter the place where I live in and it shouldn't go this way.\n\nBut my parents don't understand my situation properly. They just keep saying stupid shit like \"just ignore it\" and think that I can just stop panicing about my brother playing if I get used to the sounds that he is making. They really think that it's just that easy! Then they will get mad at me when I can't do my home chores properly because that's just really hard for me if there's a big trigger. This illness has caused many conflicts in my family.\n\nI am so tired of this. This has been continuing for 4 years and I'm not sure if I can stand it at all anymore. When my brother is playing and the triggers are eating me alive, I sometimes think of something irreversible. And when my brother stops playing, I get sad and mad that I am thinking of doing such a thing.\n\nIt's also really sad that my brother has to get his own part from this evil thing. I've said many rude things to him countless times and I wonder how it's affecting him.\n\nSometimes there are periods when my brother doesn't play that much and I notice that my life quality and mental health improves a lot. My self-esteem gets a bit higher, I am generally happier and my OCD symptoms decrease. But now once again it's a period when my brother plays almost every day for many hours and it's affecting to many other factories of my life.

I know its impossible to make absolutely zero sounds while eating; I don't get irritated by sounds that can't be avoided, like the inevitable clinks and scrapes of utensil usage and the crunchiness/wetness of foods INSIDE the mouth. Its when basic habits like eating with your mouth closed are ignored do I get agitated. It takes zero effort to eat with your mouth closed (assuming you aren't suffering from nasal or dental issues). I also don't understand smacking your lips while chewing, I've tried it and found it highly unenjoyable and tiring. It gets to me when the sounds are excessive and loud; you can clink and scrape utensils loudly and normally. You can crunch and chew loudly and normally. You can slurp and gulp loudly and normally. I'd like to think table manners do exist. But when I see so many comments of \"its my condition and my responsibility, the other person is not responsible for the sounds they're making\" I struggle knowing what to do. Is it wrong to expect the most basic table manners from family members? Is it unreasonable to expect people to have some form of consideration for those around them?

Luckily it's been rather mild though. Starting from when I was a toddler, my primary trigger was hearing my dad or brother have a case of the hiccups, and some other family members less intensely trigger the reaction too, but hardly any strangers, except sometimes if they remind me of my dad or brother. It would often make me scream and cry, and it would make me (unknowingly) sexually aroused even as a young child as well, and it still is my worst trigger. I remember once when I was like 8 years old hitting my younger brother because I was so angry. My parents and I just assumed I was being unreasonable and a jerk, because I didn't know what misophonia was, all I knew was that I couldn't stop these reactions, even if I really wanted to.\n\nHowever, I also had a mild obsession with hiccups as well, and would think about them frequently. When I got older, as a young teen, I would (shamefully) look up non-sexual videos of people, both men and women (I'm a het female), hiccupping, because I actually would find it pleasuring in an odd way and masturbate to it, sometimes for hours on end, and it became like a twisted fetish. I would not feel angry while masturbating to these videos, but would feel angry if I would feel my relatives would hiccup. However, my response to this trigger has become less intense over time, because instead of feeling enraged, I instead feel moderately irritated or annoyed and I usually just leave the room or if I can't I pretend like it's not happening me and that I'm a ghost observing. However, I always experience physical sexual arousal still, even when unwanted, even when I just think about hiccups. I wonder if spending hours masturbating to these videos sort of lessened my reaction somewhat, or it's just because I grew older.\n\nHowever, my other primary trigger as a child (which also I still have) was hearing my younger brother and occasionally other relatives chew loudly, which started a couple of years after my primary trigger (hiccups) and it still intensely bothered me, although not as much as hiccups. I have never felt aroused by hearing chewing, however my reaction to hearing loud chewing as lessened over the years as well, although it can still occasionally be activated. However, I don't eat meals with my family as much as I used to. For instance, sometimes my mom brings carrots into the car for my brother and her to eat, and I find it intensely annoying, although not to the point of screaming.\n\nHowever, as a teenager I developed more triggers, albeit more mild, and I think I still occasionally develop more triggers. For instance, hearing my dad dry cough or sniff, gasp, or burp, or speak in a lower voice like he needs to burp irritates me, which makes me feel sad because I know he can't control these things and when I get annoyed he thinks it's because I'm mad at him. My grandpa earns a similar reaction whenever I visit and he does these things as well, which makes me even sadder because he's old and doesn't have much time left on this earth, and I feel like a dick having a negative reaction to these things. However, they don't know that I hate these things, and I don't want to tell them because it is manageable for me, just annoying, and I don't want to make them feel bad.\n\nHowever I'm pretty sure my family doesn't know what misophonia is. Once when I was alone with my dad he told me he noticed that I get pissed off when he makes certain sounds, and he speculated that it could be Asperger's Syndrome, probably because of family history of autism in my extended family, and because I am and was socially awkward with literally no friends as a child and teenager and because he doesn't know what misophonia is. I'm pretty sure I'm not autistic, just socially awkward and a jerk, although maybe I'm slightly ADHD (or just undisciplined), because I've read up on the symptoms of autism and the only stuff that applies to me is surface level stuff like being an overly emotional socially awkward introverted loner with intense hobbies, unknowingly pacing around when bored (possible ADHD), and being physically clumsy and uncoordinated, likely because I still walk on my toes as an adult due to having hereditary flat foot, which I had a surgery which gave my feet slight arches as a child. Autistic people have a hard time being empathetic and reading other people's emotions, however I can usually tell how other people feel and I just don't care anymore, however I was extremely empathetic as a child and remember crying whenever other children would cry. They also have sensory processing issues, which I also don't have, which can easily be confused with misophonia. Misophonia is frequently confused with other disorders.\n\nThe point is my family members don't know what misophonia is, however while my reaction to triggers has lessened over time I have more triggers now.

Lol\u2026 I\u2019ve had this issue for a long time. It started when I was about 8 years old. I had to share a bedroom with my 2 younger brothers. They either breathed really loud or snored. It would keep me awake at night, unable to fall asleep. I would get so angry at them because my younger brothers were such loud children in general. Whatever they did, it had to be obnoxious and loud. When they played together, it was just chaotic noise and I was never able to escape the noise as a kid. I remember thinking to myself that I can\u2019t even get peace and quiet at night, im forced to push through their snoring. I would try to make my own earplugs by shoving toilet paper in my ears. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn\u2019t. It was rough times as a kid!\n\nNow that I am a full adult, I am having issues sleeping in the same bed as my boyfriend. We currently sleep in separate bedrooms because of it. He falls asleep so quick, I don\u2019t have time to fall asleep before he does. It usually takes me about 1 hour to fall asleep unfortunately (due to the typical depression and stress). \n\nI\u2019m frustrated bc I want to be able to sleep with my boyfriend and enjoy the intimacy of sharing a bed with someone you love. I\u2019ve tried pushing through it but it\u2019s hard. It comes to the point that foam earplugs don\u2019t work anymore, I can still hear him snore clearly. I did some research about that and apparently your ears can get used to the earplug which makes your hearing work harder to hear noises. It\u2019s bad guys.

It caused me stress and annoyance for many years but recently (past year or two) it's gotten much worse, with the genital arousal symptom showing up. \n\nI get triggered by my family, especially parents. I believe it has something to do with some relationship issues with my parents that have gotten worse. The triggers make me extremely angry (combining with the repressed anger from other issues), annoyed, etc. It's not as bad around friends/strangers, as I don't have any bad experiences with them. I don't know why that happens, but that's how it is.\n\nSo back on the unwanted arousal, I think it's been around for several months, getting worse and worse. I realized what it was a few weeks ago (although I wouldn't accept it at first). This symptom is absolutely horrible since it makes me feel extremely violated.

I won\u2019t share my specific triggers unless asked because, in my experience, triggers have the potential to be \u201ccontagious\u201d to others with the condition, but suffice it to say I have many, many triggers (both audio AND visual) from many different sources and all with varying intensity.\n\nI have tried everything under the sun to ease the hold misophonia has had on my life, from CBT to brainspotting to special hearing aids (prescribed to me by an audiologist who specializes in the condition). NOTHING has worked. In fact, every year I pick up new triggers.\n\nA couple of months ago, my counselor started talking to me about \u201cfeeling my feelings.\u201d It wasn\u2019t in the context of my misophonia, but I very cautiously decided to try this method out on it. I say cautiously because I have always tried to avoid thinking/talking about my misophonia (at the suggestion of my audiologist). When I do think or talk about it, I become even more hyper aware of my triggers than I would have been otherwise.\n\nThe gist of \u201cfeeling your feelings\u201d is that \u201cwhat you resist will persist\u201d and \u201cwhat you embrace will fade away.\u201d If you sit with uncomfortable feelings and pay attention to how they affect your body (e.g. is your heart rate and/or breathing faster, do you feel tension in any of your muscles, do you have butterflies in your stomach), then your brain will start to realize that you are not in danger and will stop sounding the alarm when specific situations (in this case, triggers) occur. If you run away from the emotion (physically or mentally), you reinforce the reaction, essentially proving your brain right (that you are in danger).\n\nHere\u2019s what I did to \u201cfeel my feelings\u201d about my misophonia.\n\n(1) I laid down in a dark room, closed my eyes, and played \u201cbiolateral\u201d music by David Grande (from Spotify) in my headphones (headphones are a must!) at a very low volume. This music is used in brainspotting. It engages your vagus nerve, relaxing you and allowing you to access deeper areas of your brain.\n\n(2) I visualized a specific time in my childhood where I experienced the first trigger I can remember and allowed myself to feel the negative and very uncomfortable emotions related to it without pushing it away. It might sound silly, but at times I had to imagine myself on a bucking bronco. My brain was trying so hard to push it away, but I held on tight and embraced the negative feelings. \n\n(3) I observed my body to see how the emotion was affecting me physically. I noticed my breathing was shallow, my jaw was clenched, and I felt tension in my hands, feet and forehead.\n\n(4) I then labeled the emotions I was feeling. I was *angry* at my mom for both making the sound AND for getting angry at me because she didn\u2019t understand why the sound was bothering me so much. I felt intense *guilt* for getting so mad over \u201cnothing.\u201d I felt *embarrassed* for reacting so strongly and *confused* because I didn\u2019t understand why I felt that way. I also came to realize that when I first experienced this trigger as a child, I was *scared*. This was a surprise to me. I recognized that the noise initially startled me (it\u2019s not a sound that you would expect to elicit fear; I think it was because it was a bit loud and sudden), but my mom got mad at me for my reaction instead of \u201cprotecting\u201d me by showing care and compassion and helping me to realize that I was safe. Of course none of us understood what was going on back then, so I don\u2019t blame my parents. However, during this exercise, I felt *anger* about this too, so I allowed myself to feel it fully. \n\nAs I labeled each of these emotions, I allowed myself to fully and completely feel each one and frequently checked back in with my body to observe how they were affecting me physically.\n\nAt times throughout the process, I did try to think about the emotions objectively (e.g., I felt anger at my mom for making the sound, but why? She wasn\u2019t doing it on purpose, and lots of people, myself included, make that sound). This part helped me but it wasn\u2019t necessary.\n\n(5) I repeated steps 2-4 until I literally felt a weight lift from me. I hesitate to admit that because I wouldn\u2019t have believed I could have felt a physical release like that had I not experienced it first hand. Since that first time, I stop when I don\u2019t feel negative emotions anymore. \n\nAfter this first experience, the trigger that I focused on was no longer a trigger. I was absolutely SHOCKED and decided to try it with my other triggers.\n\nI do want to point out that the first time I did this, it took a while (about an hour) and was exhausting. It has gotten much easier the more I\u2019ve done it. \n\nSince that first time, all I have had to do to tackle most of my triggers is embrace my negative feelings when I hear the trigger. I don\u2019t leave the room when I hear the sound. In fact, I will sometimes move closer to the source. I may label the feeling and notice how my body feels while it\u2019s happening (this was more important early on), but the key for me has been fully embracing my negative feelings by holding onto it like a bucking bronco and not letting myself flee when the fight or flight kicks in. I haven\u2019t been using the biolateral music when I experience a trigger in real time. \n\nI have also found it helpful to think about the sound objectively and be curious about the sound. Be warned, I will give an example with an actual trigger in the next sentence to illustrate my point. When I hear barking, I wonder what the dog is barking at. Is it playing? Does it see a person or another dog walking down the street? Is it something the dog heard or smelled? Is it trying to protect its family? Is it scared? You get the point.\n\nEVERY trigger I have tried this on is gone. It has truly been my magic bullet. \n\nSome triggers have disappeared after only doing this exercise once. It has taken a few times and greater effort for my some of my more intense triggers, but each time it gets easier. For the more intense triggers, I start by doing the full exercise as outlined in the numbered steps above and simply imagine the trigger or play an audio clip of it. \n\nI still notice many of my triggers, and sometimes I feel my body physically react to it (like I\u2019m startled for a split second) until my rational brain comes online a moment later, and I realize I\u2019m safe. Most of the time when this happens, I don\u2019t feel any negative emotions, whereas before I would\u2019ve felt intense anger or disgust. Occasionally, I feel some residual anger, but I just embrace it and it disappears.\n\nThe exercise is so simple and easy, I wish I had known about it years ago. However, I have found it challenging to do when I hear more than one trigger at once or when I\u2019m mad at the person making the sound for an unrelated reason. \n\nAs a final note, \u201cfeeling my feelings\u201d has completely changed my life and not just because of how it has helped me with misophonia. I have used it for pretty much any negative emotion I have. I\u2019ve used it to completely resolve negative emotions resulting from past experiences/traumas. I also use it when I\u2019m nervous or anxious about something that I have to deal with in the future. I use the \u201ccringe test\u201d as my therapist likes to call it. Any time I cringe about a situation, memory, etc., I know it\u2019s time to feel my feelings about it.\n\nFeeling my feelings has COMPLETELY changed my life for the better. I\u2019m still pinching myself.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, I want to tell you that I really hope this can help you too. You are 100% lovable and worthy.

I have become one of their biggest triggers, as we spend a great deal of time together, but in the past we have been able to manage their responses. They have an assortment of headphones and earplugs and they sleep in a separate room from me so they can retreat there when they are overstimulated. I try to avoid as many of their trigger sounds as possible and if I slip up my partner will remind me and I'll try not to repeat the sound. \n\nOver the last year and a half I've noticed that their misophonia has significantly worsened to the point that now just the sound of my voice is triggering to them. At first it was certain mouth sounds, like 'f', 's', 'sh', 'ch', and 'th' words (i have a little lisp leftover from when i had braces). But now it seems we can hardly have a conversation for more than 10 minutes without them becoming a little short with me or slamming drawers or cupboards closed a little too hard before they finally retreat to their room to get some silence. \n\nI am now considering some form of speech therapy so that my voice will be less triggering to them. However I am also becoming concerned about the health of our relationship in regards to how triggering I am for my partner. If my sounds are their biggest trigger, then are we really compatible with each other? Or will we simply need to be flexible in regards to managing their triggers and coping mechanisms as a couple?\n\nI dont want anyone to think that I'm trying to jump ship because my partner's triggers have become more complicated to manage. I love my partner dearly and i am not afraid of the hard work required to adapt to their needs as their misophonia changes; however, i wouldnt want them to remain in a relationship that causes them daily distress. \n\nHas anyone else dealt with similar relationship issues?

They have even joined a misophonia parent support group. I don't know if that group allows for misophonics to educate parents/friends/spouses/et cetera about misophonia as opposed to relying on non misophonic \"experts\". My dad was talking with me a few days ago and told me he is doing everything he can and reading up a lot on what I might be going through because he and my mom truly do want to help me. When I told him that it's not something that can be cured through exposure therapy (as exposure therapy is something the therapist I dropped told me is the only verified treatment to treat misophonia) he got lightly defensive and said, \"No, nope. That's not true. I'm not forcing you to take it, but that statement is not true\". \n\nThe reason I brought up exposure therapy is because I am still in a a sad slump because I had to drop her. While she was nice and wanted to help me, she was not interested in finding a different way other than exposure therapy (which I still declined we I first spoke with her) and the stuff we already were doing that certainly wasn't improving my situation. Also because it was my dad that found her for me and I didn't know if he was okay with the reason I dropped her. I am wondering if my parents are going to the wrong resource for helping me with my misophonia if this is the mentality they are keeping. Am I in the wrong or are they in the wrong? I would assume if they really want to get a better understanding of misophonia, they would go to the people who actually have it and not people who do not suffer from it.

Im filled constantly with anger and frustration and I have no way to let it out. I want to hit people so badly until they stop making the noise, but obviously I can't do that so instead I'm always biting my arms and scratching my neck. My family doesn't like it when I do this, but it's the only way I feel less angry. I hate it. So instead I punch the nearest object that will do the least damage, my family also doesn't want me to do this. So I try venting to my family when I hear someone making a trigger noise, for example: \"I hate jerks who blast their music right next our house, they're such assholes\",now I know I sound mean but when I'm angry I just don't care, I just want someone to agree with me so I don't feel crazy even if they lie to agree. Instead they make me feel like I'm in the wrong by saying \" Oh! Don't say that! They're not doing anything bad.\", I know that wasn't their intention but it still makes me feel worse.\n\nSo I can't hurt myself, I can't complain, I obviously can't hurt others (after all they are technically innocent no matter how much they piss me off) , so what can I do? I ask my family and I get \"Just ignore it\". YOU THINK I HAVEN'T FUCKING TRIED THAT. I can't ignore it I don't know why but I can't! So I just bottle everything up until I explode, and when I do explode I'm told not to bottle up my feelings. Its like I can't win no matter what I do I can't take it anymore! Im told by my family that they understand me BUT THEY DON'T. They don't have to feel burning anger every day, they don't have to fight the urge to hurt someone just because they're tapping their fingers, they don't have to talk themselves down from commiting suicide just so they don't have to suffer another damn day of emotional pain. They don't understand, and there's a good chance they never will.\n\nI do sympathize with them though because I know it's not easy having to hear me tell them to stop making certain sounds all the damn time. And they get scared whenever I go out because they don't know if I'll have a breakdown or not. But I now know that they will never I understand exactly what I'm going through. My coping methods will never make sense to them. And for now I have no one personal I can confide to.\n\nI can't live the rest of my life like this, I'm either gonna off myself first or end up in an institute. I've tried therapy, medication, sound cancelling headphones, meditation, aromatherapy, exposure, etc. etc. Nothing works. I can't take it anymore.

I find if I am triggered by a sound I get an overwhelming wave of feeling sick, my whole body tenses up. I struggle really badly with trigger noises when I am trying to concentrate - and it's been kinda of ruining my life. I'll be trying to do any task (texting, a test, reading, playing a game, watch a movie) high or low stress, and just anything that is an unexpected or hated noise drives something sharp right into my brain and I just want to yell and cry and do anything to make it stop. I've only had these symptoms with my misophonia crop up in the last 2 years and and currently awaiting to see a phycologist because it's starting to really affect my life. I used to be an otherwise happy person with a few noises I knew would annoy me but I found them manageable, now it just feels like any noise except talking and music (though even some voices are triggering, like deep or high pitched.) This makes my job hard as I work with tech and walk in customer support so I have to listen to noise and chatter all day - I mostly just suck it up and have a midday cry in the bathroom.\n\nI would really like any advice from others in this community, about management, about medication, about anything. I feel quite alone and scared. I don't want to feel like this anymore, I want to be able to hear my friends laugh without cringing and instinctively covering my ears. Not get mad when someone drops a fork or a car revs outside. Not fly into a rage when I'm trying to watch a movie and the floorboards creak when someone gets up to go to the bathroom. I try so hard to not get angry but trying to hold it in makes me sometimes hit my head because I get overwhelmed. My partner gets really sad when I do this and it breaks my heart because I dont want to make anyone upset over me. No one at work knows about this because I am still waiting for an diagnosis, and also I just find it hard to explain.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 3267, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Misophonia and Motion sickness? also looking for general advice", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/rhm6fj/misophonia_and_motion_sickness_also_looking_for/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "goingtothecircus", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_kokp81r", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1639590539, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/rh4uh9/dreading_being_around_family_during_the_holidays/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rh4uh9", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "6c5b5cda-3f77-11e9-9e70-0eeb6e9bf338", "link_flair_text": "Trigger Warning", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/rh4uh9/dreading_being_around_family_during_the_holidays/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1639590550, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a young relative who has picked up a throat clearing/cough tic and it is very frequent.

My brother was practicing his guitar in the room directly below me. I knew I had a problem but I didn't know it had a name yet. I was seen as an unsupportive, and controlling asshole who couldn't take the fact that my brother was talented at something. I told him to move somewhere else with it (He was playing acoustic), I was met with \"go back to your work\" and \"you're fine\". After 10 minutes I couldn't take it anymore and in a misophonic rage, screamed at him to move into the basement with all the better sound quality down there. I was met with my mom screaming that he can play guitar whenever the fuck he wants and to get over myself. I blame her for my guitar Misophonia getting worse because I was playing my music in my headphones at dangerous levels and could still hear it.\n\nOnto the main event, I went to a the doctor for a well visit and a flu shot. In the waiting room, they give everyone over 12 a depression survey. I answered 11/27 on the checklist but answered strongly in one area (feeling bad about myself and feeling like a failure to those closest to me.) That was enough to qualify me for mild depression. The doctor told my mom about it and all was well healthwise. On the car ride, she was telling me that it must be linked to my time on the computer, and that I need to give it a rest. She questioned me about the strong question and I told her that she holds me to such a high standard academically that if I score an 80% on something, I feel like I failed. I also told her that the root cause was the fact that every single time I bring up Misophonia in the house, I get nothing but shit for it. She tells me that she has never been adverse to it and totally respects that I have this condition. I almost laughed in her face because of the story above, and that she has told me that I'm fighting a losing battle. She then went on a rant about how I owe my dad for keeping a roof over my head and feeding me and that the least I could do was to respect him doing his favorite thing in the world (guitar). She told me the classic hypothetical \"How would you like it if your dad told you not to run your 3d printer while he's home and that he can't take it even though it's a fun hobby of yours?\" First of all, my printer only sounds like a fan with the occasional mechanical whirr. If anything, the paper printer generates more of that noise. Second, 3d prints take a long time. Depending on size and settings, it could be anywhere from 2-22 hours. I personally hate it when they target my hobbies to validate them not accommodating my issues. My mom then went on a whole spiel that I have a deep seated need for control. She said that I tell people not to eat (I only tell people to chew like people, not wolves) and tell people not to play guitar (I tell them to play with headphones in or play the acoustic guitar in the basement) She says that I only deal in extremes. I don't. In fact, I might be the only one compromising. She has repeatedly told me that she will not be controlled by my issue and in her awful words \"I recognize that you have a problem, but I will not tiptoe around you. I won't be controlled by you.\" I then told her that my dad gives me annoyed looks, yells at me, and even tries to make light or fun of my condition. He is not in the slightest bit understanding, and that needed to change 6 months ago.\n\nShe finally recognized that I was crying my eyes out and tried to make me feel better by saying generic things you say to an inconsolable person. You know, the things like \"It's ok\" \"don't cry\" \"cheer up\" and the crown jewel \"It's not your fault\" She said that she will try to be more considerate towards my Misophonia ant tell dad to try to be more understanding and considerate.\n\nAt least with a serious mental illness like depression, maybe they will take that more seriously.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 3243, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Am I being controlling?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/rdqojf/am_i_being_controlling/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Karmapoliceasleep", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_f4rfph0s", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1639119680, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/rd2ubz/peanut_brittle_season/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rd2ubz", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#b209d6", "link_flair_css_class": "venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "9420fff0-4011-11e9-bb6e-0eef35d07208", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/rd2ubz/peanut_brittle_season/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1639119690, "score": 1, "selftext": "My father in law makes peanut brittle every year for the holidays, like 20 1gallon bags of it.

I could hear her from the farthest part of the house. It makes my blood fucking boil. And then my dad, who's *a lot* quieter (thanks for not being a pain in the ass, Dad), does it like 10 times in a row within a couple seconds. Ya know what I mean? So it's fuckin torture because I have to hear it about 10 times and each time I want to break my cereal bowl.\n\nBut oddly enough, my misophonia is very selective.

I'm not sure, there's not a lot of info I can find on it and I don't want to be offensive) and they still don't get it. They wonder why I'm in my room 99% of the time I'm home. They think I have a problem with them, or that I hate them. I'm tired of reiterating, so I just make up some random bullshit now.\n\nI have to get up and just go to my room if things get unbearable.

The **Sonys** have much nicer bonus features, very very convenient, and I find the earcups more comfortable.  However, the headband part becomes extremely uncomfortable for long wear (which is what I need to do, cuz I wear these to keep sane during work).  On top of that, the noise cancellation isn't even that strong, or at least not in the ways I need it to be.  The **Bose QCs** noise cancellation works better for the sounds that I need cancelled out (coughing, chewing, creaky printer), and the headband stays more comfortable for longer.  Even once it does get uncomfortable, it doesn't cause the same type of ache the Sonys do, on my head anyway.  The control features are way less exciting, but my main concern is misophonia, which means the superior comfort and noise cancelling are the winning factors for me.  I will be returning the Sonys.\n\nAlso, for anyone like me who'd never worn noise cancelling headphones before, know upfront that there's a feeling associated with it, not unlike how your ears feel in the pressure of an airplane.

It's not extreme snoring (my grandfather had sleep apnea and this sounds **nothing** like it), but it's enough to trigger me and keep me from sleeping. This past week, we have been unable to sleep in the same bed, and have had to take turns on the couch every night. So not only does one or both of us have to wake up in the middle of the night, whoever is on the couch does not get comfy nor great sleep. At this point, we are looking into sending him to a sleep specialist just to double check that he doesn't have sleep apnea, because, misophonia or not, we'd need to treat that anyway.\n\n  \nWhat we've tried to help the situation:\n\n* Earplugs, both foam and those silicone putty ones. The foam put too much pressure inside my ears (I have small-ish ears) and aggravate my tinnitus. The silicone ones get covered in lint and catch in my hair. And neither really blocks the noise. My ears just focus on it and keep trying to hear it once snoring is heard. (I don't get why my brain does that.)\n* Wedge pillow. Husband likes to sleep on his side too, so he winds up sliding down to the bottom of the wedge, which means that when he rolls onto his back, it's pretty much doing nothing. He snores when he sleeps on his side, too, so it doesn't make too much of a difference either way.\n* Music. Works great as long as the radio station is broadcasting. The local classical and jazz stations both go off air between 1am and 5am, when the snoring is the worst. \n* Humidifier. Doesn't seem to affect his snoring.\n* White noise. This works fine in the summer, when we can blast a box fan, but the summer air could also be a factor. I tried running a reasonably loud fan at a low speed last night and it did not drown him out. White noise apps aren't loud enough either.\n\nWhat recommendations do you have? As a full disclosure, we live in the arid Rocky Mountains, but when we lived on the east coast, things weren't as bad. At the time, he also weighed less (he's a little overweight now and the pandemic isn't helping) and wasn't taking sleep meds (now prescribed to him).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 3217, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spouse Snoring.

It's because going to work involves a lot of mental effort to keep my misophonia and anxiety in balance. When I leave my apartment and get into an Uber, my brain starts into fight-or-flight mode. I am hypervigilant of when I will hear my next trigger. I am tensing my muscles unknowingly from the adrenaline being pumped out by my adrenal glands. My misophonia causes my body to feel it is in a constant state of danger because leaving my home equals entering a world of triggers that I cannot control. When I go to work I am hyper-aware and waiting for when my co-workers or customers make a trigger. I have to bear down on my body so I don't startle or jump and cause people to feel uncomfortable around me. The constant tension causes lots of headaches and shortness of breath. I am in a panic state for 9 hours a day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I come home, my nerves are shot. My body exhausted like it just came back from battle (from being in a permanent state of fight-or-flight). My brain is fried. All I want to do is binge eat junk food and go to bed. I want to forget about the stressful feelings I endured for the day. Going out or seeing family is the last thing I want to do. As a result I feel like I am not truly \"living\" my best life. I am not thriving. I feel unhealthy and stressed all of the time. My misophonia is in my mind every single minute as is the feeling of not being safe or comforted. My only escape is sleep, provided I don't have a dream about my triggers (which has happened before).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dream of a life where I don't have to face my worst fears everyday. There is no cure for misophonia. I am never going to get over the sounds that shake me. I long to either have a full-time work at home job or be a stay at home mother. I don't want to have to be away from home and deal with triggers all day. I just want to feel safe. I'm so jealous of people who get to stay at home all day and don't have to feel the things I feel. I can't say things like this to the people in my real life because I know they aren't going to understand, and get pissed and offended at me. It is a constant battle to stay sane. Misophonia has caused me to want to end my life a couple of times, and I am so afraid of that getting worse as I get older. I feel so out of control in my life, like I have no control over what happens to me. It's the scariest feeling. I hang on to what makes me feel safe so hard , and a lot of it is bad for me/sinful. Binge eating, compulsive spending, masturbation, sexual fantasy, romantic fantasy, cussing, acting out--all of these things give me a feeling of control I rarely feel. For once *I* can make myself feel a certain way, for once *I* can forget about misophonia and the effects it has on my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I've figured it out.

The sound of them licking themselves makes my skin crawl and it literally makes me cringe. It's a physical reaction. They wake me up at night with their licking and I have to chase them out of the room. The worst part is, I haven't always had misophonia. I developed it when I was pregnant with my first child, and my husband thought I was making it up. It subsided after my son's birth, but it came back when I became pregnant again, and though I gave birth 3 months ago, it hasn't left this time. It's worse than ever. I feel really bad because my cats must think I suddenly don't love them anymore.

I am *so* fed up with misophonia. It has caused me to turn down a job promotion that would have been so good for me, all because I just can't handle working full-time at the office. Due to anxiety and miso I can only handle working there 3 days a week and I clean houses on the side (easier on the miso because I can move around and not deal with people too much)\n\nI wish I could work from home so bad. I am so jealous of people who were able to switch to WFM since the pandemic. I understand for a lot of people especially those with children it has been difficult but I would do absolutely anything to be able to work from home and not have to be on edge all day just because someone is coughing. If I could take the promotion and work from home full-time, I would have no problem taking the job. Bar none. No questions asked. But because my dumb brain can't filter sounds correctly and sees coughing as a threat I am unable to function and be comfortable in a traditional work setting. \n\nEveryone thinks I am a bum who doesn't want to work. Work is not the issue, it is the fact I am not comfortable there. I either need an office to myself with a door or the option to work at home, and at my company I can do neither. I have asked numerous times and we just don't have the infrastructure for it. It's a small ma and pa company. \n\nI envy my stay at home mom friends who don't have to go to work and can stay in the comfort of home with their babies. I would love to be a stay at home mom because I love to keep a house and take care of people. I just feel so trapped with the way my life is structured right now. I feel like I have no control and everyday is a threat. I'm always on edge and I rarely feel relaxed.

It\u2019s always been a me issue. Stop plugging your ears, eat slower, why are you yelling, you\u2019re being rude. Just relax, calm down, it\u2019s just in your head. It\u2019s exhausting. \n\n\nI\u2019ve expressed my distress and frustration with them quite a bit, but I only get anger and annoyance back. My mom did finally buy me ear plugs that I\u2019m allowed to wear at church because she was embarrassed that I wouldn\u2019t stop plugging my ears. Otherwise, they continue to joke about how I act around trigger sounds and be angry with me over things I can\u2019t really control. Zero attempts on their part for accommodation, empathy, or any kind of help, and I\u2019ve learned to stop asking.\n\n\nA couple of days ago, though, my dad (a family doctor) asked me out of the blue about when I hear eating noises, how do I feel? Do I feel stress, anxiety, distress, anger? I said yes on all counts. I have told them that before, but whatever. He went on to say that he had a patient come in complaining of this, and that it was causing him a lot of problems with his family and it was extremely upsetting for him. My dad, being the good doctor that he is, went on to research it. One of his residents did some in depth research herself. Some pharmacists weighed in. My dad told me \u201cThere\u2019s a name for that you know,\u201d and I said \u201cYeah, misophonia.\u201d I have told them that before. The guy got prescribed antidepressants as apparently the unofficial research team heard that it could help. The patient also is in some kind of therapy now.\n\n\nDamn, Dad. Maybe it\u2019s not just me. Maybe I could benefit from therapy, do you think so now? Do you believe me now? I told him, I knew it wasn\u2019t just me.\n\n\nMy mom of course had to weigh in after I said that. \u201cWell not just me either! Oh but don\u2019t worry, it gets better as you get older. You\u2019re fine.\u201d Thanks, mom. Excellent input, awesome. Fuck. She doesn\u2019t have misophonia, or else she\u2019d have killed my dad by now, or maybe she\u2019d be a little more aware of her CONSTANT trigger noises. She says to me often that \u201ceveryone finds eating noises a little annoying.\u201d No, Mom, I don\u2019t find them annoying, I want to physically hurt someone when I hear them. Finding noises a little annoying doesn\u2019t mean you have misophonia, either.\n\n\nBut maybe it\u2019s a step. My dad will undoubtedly keep seeing this patient and see him either struggle or improve. Hopefully he will take me more seriously as time goes on.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2614, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Maybe some progress into FINALLY gaining support from my family?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/n60zw5/maybe_some_progress_into_finally_gaining_support/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "RyoAsukasTits", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_btakxpvp", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1620245907, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/n5phtq/im_seriously_at_my_limit/", "gildings": {}, "id": "n5phtq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "6c5b5cda-3f77-11e9-9e70-0eeb6e9bf338", "link_flair_text": "Trigger Warning", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/n5phtq/im_seriously_at_my_limit/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1620245918, "score": 1, "selftext": "Im a 15 year old girl, went to therapy for misophonia and I have a psychologist.

I've had misophonia for years and like most other people, not really sure where it stemmed from.

He's so understanding when it comes to mental health etc so I thought he would under this.. but no.\n\nHe basically said I'm \"making him self conscious\" about his eating... Which I found quite upsetting because if anything, I'm the one that's self conscious and I'm the one with the 'issue'. I miss out on parts of films/TV shows because I have to leave the room for 15 minutes when he brings out a packet of crisps.\n\nAm I being rude leaving the room/putting in earphones everytime I'm triggered? Is there a way I can make him understand more? Would it be unreasonable for me to ask him to stop buying certain foods just to benefit me?

Hearing about it, I thought \"Oh yes, I have this condition, everything matches, did not know it was a thing\" but it had always been mild, and therefore bearable. I had a lot of triggers, but never any hard reactions to any of them, just an annoyance at worst. By mild, I mean that I have always been able to internalize my reactions to those triggers.  \n\n\nUntil recently. My baby girl just turned 3 months old, and for now a month, she does what babies do, she sucks her hands. This triggers me madly. By madly I mean that now I sometimes no longer can internalize my reactions. Although, I have enough control to not react unless my baby's in a safe place and to make things 100% clear: I am absolutely not afraid to do her any harm.  \n\n\nBut it sometimes impacts the quality of the time I am spending with her, and I am afraid she might \"read\" the annoyance on my face sometimes and that, this, could also, on the long run, impact my relationship with her.  \n\n\nSo I started to have a deeper look at what misophonia is, how it works etc ... and what kind of coping mechanisms work. I found out that:  \n\n\n\\- Exercise is good to help. Which I already found out by myself a few weeks ago. So, this is going on (not why I am posting).  \n\\- Sharing and talking about it also does help. And that's why I am posting here:  \n\n\nDid anybody ever had similar experiences with his/her own baby and want to talk about it, and the way it's been dealt with?   \n\n\nI would like to go deeper into describing what specifically triggers me when I am with my baby, but only with directly concerned people. I think I wrote enough here for now!  \n\n\nThank you all,", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2604, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My baby is my main trigger, I want to talk about it.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/n3rox3/my_baby_is_my_main_trigger_i_want_to_talk_about_it/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "nightshadealexis", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_axcanjxc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1619999232, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/n3j1r0/do_i_even_have_misophonia/", "gildings": {}, "id": "n3j1r0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#0079d3", "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b30b2d4e-4103-11e9-88ff-0ef3b569a21a", "link_flair_text": "Discussion / Question", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/n3j1r0/do_i_even_have_misophonia/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1619999242, "score": 1, "selftext": "Before I start telling others, i want to make sure that I actually have misophonia.

I have no idea why my first trigger happened, but it just did. I was sitting on the couch next to my dad, and he made this exhale breathing sound, and I was like, \"wow thats annoying shut up\", but I didn't actually tell him to shut up, it was just in my head. Every day from then on, my misophonia has gotten worse. I've tried every coping mechanism, but my misophonia ends up getting worse. My misophonia also pairs up with certain smells too. But lately it's gotten so bad, that I can't stand my own breathing. I end up smacking and punching and biting myself when I just can't take it. Anybody in my position would kill themselves however they can, I'm sure of it. I don't try, because there is something inside me that thinks I can get over this misophonia and OCD that I have. Its also because I already tried to kill myself a few months before I felt my first version of misophonia, and the hospital I went to traumatized me. Because it's my own breathing that agitates me, I can't wear headphones(If anything that would make it worse because It makes it so that I only hear my own breathing), I try mindfulness, but mindfulness isn't helping me get better as I just get worse, It only helps temporarily. These sounds started with my parents, and the breathing sounds they make, and with my dad, it's also tapping sounds he makes, and humming etc., and I'm starting to get affected by those sounds with people other than my parents, as well as my own body. I have severe obsessive thoughts to add to misophonia. I have been in therapy for years with 6 different therapists, and 2 or 3 psychiatrists. The psychiatrist I am with now is great, she is the one that suggested it was misophonia. I just started seeing my 7th therapist, and it seems like she's a good fit. I am that one nice guy. I will never tell you to stop doing something. My parents know about my misophonia and I've told them what sounds they make annoy me, but I tell them not to worry about it because it is my problem. I hate being the person to tell you to stop doing something because of my weird disorder, and I never will.

It's not as loud as other dogs but it still somehow takes more than headphones and the television to block it out. It gives me anxiety and it keeps me on edge all the time. It triggers my misophonia more than anything else and it sends me into a very violent rage. I haven't ever attacked anyone or anything but I have had incredibly violent thoughts. It makes me feel guilty that I think about harming the dog daily. Dogs don't have morals so therefore it doesn't know the stress it causes. (Dont worry people, I won't hurt it even though it's slowly killing my mental health.) It's really likely to be lonely because the neighbours leave it home alone all day but it even barks nonstop when they are home which means they probably lock it in a room or crate.\n\nEither way, it causes me to spiral into a state of unimaginable rage and anxiety that lasts all day and a lot of times, all night and my parents don't understand it because it doesn't bother them. I needed a place to vent so I came here and I hope at least a couple of you will understand though I don't know how many other people with misophonia have triggers that are from a noise an animal makes. I will likely have to put up with this nonstop barking for the rest of high school because nobody else I know cares. As if school wasn't stressful enough, I have to come home every day to nonstop barking and wake up every weekend to barking and go to bed while hearing barking. It makes it very hard to function normally and I hardly remember the feeling of calmness because of the barking.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk and I wish you all a very silent and peaceful day/night.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2573, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dog next door is driving me to insanity", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/mt2ybx/dog_next_door_is_driving_me_to_insanity/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "psychespice", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_eeape", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1618688000, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/msxed9/my_partner_is_upset_because_he_thinks_im/", "gildings": {}, "id": "msxed9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/msxed9/my_partner_is_upset_because_he_thinks_im/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1618688011, "score": 1, "selftext": "He doesn't understand; he thinks I'm specifically criticizing him.

Whenever I listen to, and sometimes read poetry, and listen to  some rap (At least what I have listened to and read) I feel  uncomfortable, repulsed, and I feel the need to find a way to mute the  poetry (such as leaving the room or taking off my headphones during a  Zoom meeting). I can't remember when I started feeling this way exactly,  but I do know that this is something that has popped up over the years.  I am not sure if this is misophonia at work, but what I have felt seems  similar to what I have read about misophonia. I am perfectly fine with  listen to music and reading the lyrics, I actually enjoy listening and  singing along to songs that I enjoy. However when it comes to poetry,  and some rap, I find the opposite to be true.\n\nNow  to my question, is what I described something that has happened to  others who have been diagnosed with misophonia? Or has anyone else  experienced what I have or something similar? I have tried searching  online, but I haven't found anything that matches what I have  experienced.

If I do, it's likely a milder form of it, however. \n\nI was diagnosed with anxiety, and I've sought help for it. I'm a lot better than I used to be. But certain sounds and the sights associated with them have always really bothered me to the point of annoyance or mild panic. The sounds in question are usually loud chewing, clicking/grinding teeth, or knuckles cracking. Sometimes, especially when there are other sounds, I can manage it. I don't like it, but it's not really panic-inducing. I can stand the noises when they come from me. But when it's quiet and those sounds are one of the only things I can hear, or when I'm forced to endure or stare at it happening, the reactions happen. I realized that some of what happens overlaps with what happens when my anxiety ramps up. The longer I'm exposed to a noise, the more panicked and desperate to get away from it I get.\n\nI tried saying something as a child when my parents or sister would chew really loudly or with their mouths open, but I was taught that I was just being rude and had to put up with it no matter how it bothered me. I try so hard to ignore, drown out the noises, or remove myself from the area, but I won't let myself say anything about it because I don't want to be rude or inconvenience anyone by asking them to stop. Besides, they'd probably just think I'm weird. \n\nI want to talk to my therapist about this, but I'm worried that I'll just get dismissed because it's not an official disorder or something and it's (kind of) a self-diagnosis.

I was even thinking of throwing myself down the stairwell balcony so I could break my legs and get some type out of school. I was in so much pain from people eating snacks that I jabbed pencils into my arm and cut up my arm with pencils to try to distract myself from the noise. My mom let me become cyberschooled.\n\nI hated cyberschool. The work was extremely difficult and I had 12 hours of schoolwork a day. The instructions were always very unclear, and even though I spent so much time on this stuff, I was learning nothing. \n\nI was crying so hard every night and wanted so badly to kill myself. My mom let me become \u201cunschooled\u201d. I was just trying to get to the point where I wouldn\u2019t want to die every hour of the day. As soon as I was getting better, my mom started freaking out that I was going to be taken back to public school because I was doing nothing. I ended up passing that year because I guess the evaluator felt bad for me? (That was 8th grade) \n\nFor 9th grade, we got all these paper booklet curriculums. The cheapest ones were some crappy Christian curriculum. The English was extremely difficult. I was always the worst at reading in my class, even though I was in the gifted program back when I was in public school. The grammar was very advanced and I was very lost. The math curriculum was horrible. All it did was make me memorize long phrases that I didn\u2019t understand and I didn\u2019t know how to do any equations. The science and social studies was ok but really boring. Stress always makes my misophonia way worse. To avoid feeling suicidal, I would just skip schoolwork for the entire day. Not wanting to die felt good, so I would just skip the entire day again. And again. And again. And then I had half the school year left to do and only two months to do it in. So I would create insane schedules where I\u2019d do 18 hours of work a day. I\u2019d wake up at 4:00am and start, then get very confused and quit. It was the covid year, so everyone got a pass. \n\nNow it\u2019s 10th grade (currently) and I\u2019m doing the journaling method. I just do 40 minutes a day per subject for 180 days. I use no curriculum. Just learning from the internet sources and books. It was amazing. But my mom keeps freaking out. I had to do giant projects 5 months ago, apparently. She never told me about this, ever. I have to show all this stuff I did. I am in the strictest homeschool laws state, so I have to make a portfolio for the high school end of the year evaluation. So I look up how to make a homeschool portfolio in my state. I find a video where this lady helps her daughter in 9th grade make this beautiful complex portfolio. She\u2019s doing all these curriculums with no problem. She\u2019s able to write complicated essays and read lots of books, she\u2019s showing growth and improvement in math, being able to do more complicated problems over time. \n\nI\u2019m crying over this. I tried so hard to learn and do curriculums and I just can\u2019t. It stressed me out so much. My triggers are so bad around human noises that I can barely talk to my mom more than a few sentences a day. I can\u2019t have a tutor or cyberschool videos. I have to read curriculums but I never understand. I\u2019m in 10th grade and never finished a single curriculum. It\u2019s my 3rd year attempting geometry and I still don\u2019t understand.

Trigger warning ahead, friends.\n\nMy misophonia has been worsening over the past 2 years to the point I don\u2019t really leave my house anymore unless I absolutely need to. My main trigger is low frequency noise, so subwoofers are a waking nightmare for me.\n\nToday, I went out to eat with friends since we haven\u2019t had a chance to hang out for awhile. We walked into the place, music is playing and the subwoofer is cranked up. My heart immediately sank but I tried to endure it and tried not letting my friends know I was upset. I sat with one ear plugged as the pulsating beat rang through my head and I tried so hard to push the noise out. My friend noticed I was increasingly getting upset and asked if it was too loud. Bless my friend\u2019s heart for being concerned, and she\u2019s one of the few people in my life who knows and believes I have misophonia, by the way.\n\nI kept saying I was fine until I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and started crying at the table and ran to the bathroom. \n\nI got to sit in a bathroom stall crying and meditating until I could get my breathing under control. When my friend came in to check on me, she told me they were already getting our food to go and gave me the keys to the car. Bless this woman so much.\n\nToday was a sobering experience though, reminding me I don\u2019t get to have a normal life. I don\u2019t get to go out with friends anymore, and I hate I have no control over this. I felt so bad and felt like I was inconveniencing my friends. Today sucked.

I'm closer to the girl as she is in the same sort of carreer path as me, and also yeah she's a girl so there's that. The guy is sweet too.  \nOne thing is that we live in quite an old house. The furnishing looks like it's been done by a 7 year old and the doors do not at all shut the whole way.  \n\n\nTo the point. When they have sex I can hear EVERYTHING. I think for anyone who hears their roomies having sex would feel uncomfortable and put the music louder. But really, I feel my skin crawl. I immediately get sad and insanely anxious. Like I want to run away from my home. I got some loop earbuds and sound proof headphones which I IMMEDIATELY put on when I feel the slightest chance they could get going. It just feels painful all over. Just like with triggers nonetheless.  \n\n\nTheire not even that loud. But they f\\*ck quiite a lot. Not to mention that he's poly and brings home some girl now and then(not that often thank god). They are aware that I can hear it as my stupid boyfriend blurted it out to them without my permission(and i told him off for it haha). And it's not like I don't want them to have sex! I'm quite sex positive, although my libidos really low. I mean yeah it could be I get triggered because I had a very conservative upbringing. But I also feel like I have working so hard to get pass that. And it just hit me one day, and I don't know why I haven't thought of it before: It might as well be misophonia trigger?(BTW I dont get triggered watching porn!?)  \n\n\nAnd yeah I will totally just pop my headphones on forever... \n\nBut really it's made me super anxious about  being home with them. Whenever I hear a small noise that could indicate sex, even if it isnt sex - I just feel myself going into this weird zone of \"Oh my god no theire gonna have sex nooo i have to get my headphones!\" And Its suuuuper stressful and not a good situation for me...   \n\n\nThe guy is also THE LOUDEST person eating in the entire world. I haven't told him I have misophonia. There's just NO WAY I'm telling him. I don't know why, but now I feel like now the time when I should have said something has passed. Whenever I see him with food I either leave or put my loops on.&gt;! He slurps and smacks, eats with open mouth, licks his fingers louder than anyone I've ever met.!&lt; It's insane. And no one else seems to mind???? which I know as asked both my boyfriend and his girlfriend. I even told him that he's a loud, but I can't get myself to ask him to lower it.... just thinking about it makes my back crawl and punch a hole in the wall...  \n\n\nI've been moving around way too many times the two last years..

I sleep like 4-5 broken hours a night because the sound travels so much. There are neighbours upstairs that walk around on creaky floors between 3-4:30 am, a neighbour downstairs who chain smokes and coughs (it's a muffled quiet cough and quiet/muffled voices are one of my triggers), a third neighbour who is hard of hearing and lets his alarm go in the early mornings, and now there's a flat, dull, repetitive thumping noise coming from the walls that stops and starts without reason.\n\nI use a white noise machine and sometimes a white noise app on top of it. But I can still hear all those noises. I wear foam drugstore earplugs when I really have to but they are so uncomfortable that sometimes in my sleep I remove them. Also, they don't totally block out the noises, even with the white noise going. And when I can hear my own heartbeat and internal noises it can also keep me awake. \n\nI'm seriously at a loss and feeling so hopeless. I can't afford to move again and was lucky to find a place where I can afford to live alone. But I guess I don't feel like I actually live alone, with all this noise pollution. \n\nCan anyone recommend ear plugs that you can sleep in if you're a stomach and side sleeper?

started around the age of 9 and I'm almost 18.  it has always been bad, ruined my relationship with my family. now, I can't stand going to school and people in general. I can't even watch my favourite YouTubers and tv shows! I just get bothered by every single noise and I point it out more often now. things that never really bothered by now make me want to snap my neck because of how bad it got. I go to a vocational school and I am on track to get my dream job. the problem is, I cannot stand hearing anyone at this point. seeing certain people makes me panic on the inside because I know they annoy me. I really want to work with people (as a psychologist) but I can't if don't want to listen. I am thinking of seeing an audiologist but my parents downplay the severity of and barely think misophonia a thing. they are supposed to help reduce the anxiety and stuff and help remove you from places you get triggered but the problem is I can because of my school. it's full-time and I'm on track for a bright future but the certification I am going to get there requires me to talk to people. (also, my parents would flip if I wanted to leave my school and won't allow me to do online school. they are really expecting me to go to college and I want to continue my education after hs but I know I won't be able to handle it.) I told my doctor about it a couple of months ago and he never heard about it. another problem: there are no audiologists that handle misophonia cases near me. the closest that I found is two hours away. Does anyone know any audiologists that can meet online and don't charge a ridiculous amount? my insurance isn't that great so they most likely won't help pay for the sessions. if you made it this far,

thought \"i don't like this sound\" and flinched. i started noticing more and more sounds i didn't like and reacted every time. i suppose i thought this would alert the creator of said sounds and stop the noises. the teachers started asking what was wrong and i didn't like that sort of attention (even tho that's what i wanted) so i usually didn't say what it was. or if i did, then i said it wasn't a big deal.\n\ni got put together with other kids with learning difficulties into one \"special needs\" class so every one of my classmates and teachers constantly make noises that trigger me. like cracking bones, drawing, lip smacking, whispering, breathing next to me like a goddamn vacuum cleaner, throwing a desk across the room and then walking to the door like an elephant to go to the bathroom in the middle of every class. not to mention that the windows are right in front of me and the light comes straight into my eyes. i live in sensory hell.\n\nat first i thought i could control my reactions and that flinching is my conscious decision so i decided to stop. unfortunately it was too late and i couldn't control my body anymore. it's gotten worse every week since then.\n\ni can't sit with my family to eat without the radio on. at least my mom is respectful to me and has agreed to eat separately which makes me sad because i know she loves spending time with me but she's so triggering all the time, even when she's not eating. my dad however, smacks his lips on purpose and then gets mad when i flinch or try to distance myself.\n\ni try to not tell people when i am uncomfortable (but still am very visibly uncomfortable) because it's not that bad, i can suffer in silence for others convince, not a big deal. but they still ask, i suppose becouse they feel sorry for me. sometimes i don't explain, sometimes i have to, and if i do, they either ignore it completely and continue their activities as usual or try to trigger me even more.\n\ni went and talked to a therapist about it and her advise was to just \"get used to it, you cant escape and you cant tell every single person not to make any noise around you\". so i tried \"getting used to it\" like i had been before that and that resulted it pain and even worse reactions. \n\nnow im in 12th grade and usually by lunch im very stressed and angry. i feel like everyone in my class hates me for flinching and moving around all the time. \n\nhaving moved out has definitely helped becouse now at least at home i have control over most sounds exept the construction work going on across the street. but being constantly stressed and not being able to socialize without some annoying noise that humans make going on.\n\nso in conclusion my symptoms are not as bad as most people have described on this sub and might not even be real. do i have misophonia? am i still faking it? is it something else? if someone with real misophonia could tell me what's going on, that'd be great.\n\n\n\ntl;dr:  i developed unpleasant physical reactions to certain sounds out of nowhere and now i don't know if it's misophonia or not.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit":

coming to terms with the fact that I have misophonia. I have one sound that drives me insane, and it's the sound of my dog licking his paws. Something about that atrocious repetitive noise (I also can't handle someone chewing gum with their mouth open for the similar sound, but it's less of a trigger).\n\nBut at this point, I've grown up with dogs my whole life, and I currently live alone with just this one dog. He licks his paws a fair amount, but he's learned that I go insane when he does it -- so I usually just poke him or give a 'shh' or get his attention in any way and it works after a sec, but in times when he didn't stop immediately, I have gone into full screaming fits that I felt horrible for a minute later. I love my dog very much, and he's a spoiled brat, he's okay, no worries there. Nowadays he usually stops once I've poked him once or twice, and if he doesn't, I'll just excuse myself to my room and close the door (still raging, but at least no screaming fits lately, I've been better at managing that).\n\nI've been wanting to get a cat, but I've never really lived with one. My family has been notorious for having dogs only. Anyone out there who has had both dogs and cats, can let me know what your opinion is on which animal is more triggering to have? Because I feel like cats are usually more silent with their licking, and maybe I could get desensitised to it, but they also might do it a lot more often, and I'm worried I won't be able to handle a full day of stressing -- rather than a dog who only does it a handful of times a day. And would a cat be able to learn that I don't like their grooming like my dog eventually learned (at least in the sense that he responds to me poking him and knows to stop)?\n\nAny advice appreciated, thank you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 3117, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Strong aversion to my dog grooming.

We live in a 2 bedroom townhome, my dad and mother each with a room and me in the downstairs living room area that is right next to the kitchen. This irritates me to begin with because everyone knows how triggered I get hearing eating, so why put me of all people down there? I asked very kindly in the beginning please do not eat in the kitchen. Please. I do not have a door so I cannot shut myself out, please respect this one boundary and understand I would never ask if I had a door to close. \n\nMy dad initially tried in the beginning but over the past few months I have had to ask several times, \u201cdo you mind eating that upstairs?\u201d And each time he claims he forgot which is a *damn* lie. My entire family has known for 10+ years how triggered I feel around it. I feel deep down he doesn\u2019t like me telling him what to do so eating downstairs is his way of saying, \u201cI do what I want\u201d. It\u2019s really upsetting because I\u2019ve asked so many times very nicely and he continues to do it. He tried to hide it but I always know when he\u2019s doing it and it\u2019s just upsetting he can\u2019t wait 30 seconds to walk up the stairs to eat when he knows it triggers me. I understand it\u2019s my issue that it triggers me but seriously it\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve asked for and he does it anyway at least once a day. I am close to tears because it\u2019s just so disrespectful to me. Am I overreacting? \n\nI\u2019ve already made arrangements to move out November 8th for both unrelated and related reasons but I needed to vent. My dad and I already have a strained relationship because of unrelated reasons, but this just proves to me how he doesn\u2019t care about my feelings. \n\nI cried to my mom about it because she asked what\u2019s wrong and she was like ohhh I\u2019m sorry and I get it, she\u2019s not the one who\u2019s doing it, but it sorta irritates me that she doesn\u2019t stand up for me.

"selftext": "Hello, I (14M) have crippling misophonia (as do most on this sub). My main triggers are chewing, guitar, and this iPad app my brother has. for this story, the guitar trigger rears its ugly head. So, I start running a big 3d print (extremely important). The cardinal rule of 3d printing is watch the first 2 layers, or else the print will fail. While that happens my dad and little brother (51 and 10 respectively) start on the acoustic guitars. Instantly, I tell my little brother to stop or quiet down. FYI I can't tell my dad to stop because he will have my head on a pike. They obviously didn't take it well and my dad told me these exact words, \"Hey, your 3d Printer drives me crazy, I'm going to play guitar to cover it up.\" He did not say that from a place of truth, he said it mockingly and callously. Like when someone tells you a joke when they're angry. Also, my old printer sounded like a fax machine, so I could sort of understand what he was saying if he was talking about that one that my friend has now. But my current one sounds borderline silent, the only thing you hear on it is the fan and slight whirring. He's basically saying he has a problem with all fans, but targeted one of my hobbies in a mocking manner to make a point. and it made me sick. I proceeded to lose my fucking mind in the bathroom. Once I emerged from the shitter, I went back to check on the print. It failed. When I went to calibrate and troubleshoot, they started back up again. I once again, told them to stop, quiet down, or move somewhere else. My dad yelled at me and told me I can't control my brother and that he will not walk on eggshells around me. My dad went to the bathroom and in a fit of sobbing and rage I somehow managed to utter the words \"Please.....stop................Please, man......stop\" It's times like this that make me feel like both an inconvenience and a controlling asshole. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells to not have my parents scold me for having this. Between my other, severely Autistic brother chewing his food like a goddamn horse, and the other one playing guitar, I try to tell the player to stop (the chewer won't understand, too many syllables), and he listens, it's the parents getting mad on his behalf and telling him to almost negate this problem that I'm extremely depressed about.\n\nI went up to take a shower, but the chewer was having his teeth brushed. I went to the player's room where my mom was laying with him (standard procedure for him or else he can't sleep). She wanted to show me a facebook post she saw and asked why I was moping during my response. I told her what happened. She was pretty sympathetic at first. She was telling me that he doesn't and will never understand what I'm going through. But then the conversation took a turn. She then went into saying that I'm fighting a losing battle and will become a hermit if I \"let it affect me so much\". Straight Bullshit. She denied the inconvenience part, but still held up the belief that I'm controlling and I'm trying to control people. She said that she never saw the player with a guitar in his hands without me yelling at him to stop. This is partly true. Whenever there isn't an important practice or a 1 on 1 lesson, I pretty much tell him to stop and only yell if it gets too bad. I went back into a fit of crying and tried to tell her my perspective. I told her how it felt and how I tell him this to preserve my own sanity. She also upheld my dad's point saying that I was targeting one of his hobbies, but that's insane. I was telling them that they could move somewhere else and they proceeded to tear me down to make a point about me being an asshole.

But it's literally because he eats so loud and just refuses to do anything about it. I'll sit by him at the table with headphones on AND music playing and I can still hear him just as loud. And when I get angry he yells at me. The noise I hate the most is like clinking glass.

for just under 1.5 years. I\u2019m coming to the decision these past couple months that I need to draw a line here. I\u2019m in medical billing for an orthopedic/surgical practice. We\u2019re a 4-person department that handles a wide array of things (not just traditional billing things) for the 8 doctors working here. The workload is demanding and stressful, even when not being triggered. My workload was significantly increased in November and even after multiple reassurances from my manager that I\u2019d be taken care of financially, I was given no raise or bonus in December (I'm not surprised, just disappointed). \n\nMy closest coworkers ultimately refuse to respect the one request I\u2019ve repeatedly made to not trigger me all workweek long. I don\u2019t take their actions personally, they\u2019re mostly good people I guess, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to continue working 40 hours a week in an environment where I am triggered this frequently (everyday guaranteed, usually several times a day). \n\nI\u2019m pretty ready to resign within the next month or so. I want to focus on a serious effort to get better more than anything. Idk what that means yet, I\u2019ve tried working with several doctors over the last 3 years. But my parents are pretty supportive of my decision and I do have money saved up for the time being. I think getting better starts with bowing out of this fairly intense, unaccommodating work situation. My misophonia is the worst it\u2019s ever been and I don\u2019t want to go on like this. \n\nDo these sound like reasonable actions to take? Any advice or personal experience from a similar situation? I\u2019m just very tired of this place, I dread work all night and weekend long, and I\u2019m nervous. This is the second job I\u2019ve had to step away from since February 2018 and is possibly \u201ctemporary career suicide\u201d as someone else put it, but I don\u2019t totally believe that. I guess I\u2019d like to hear that I\u2019m making healthy, logical choices towards a more sustainable future or what I could be doing better.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 1145, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for some guidance with quitting my job", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/f90go4/looking_for_some_guidance_with_quitting_my_job/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "thatdograscal", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1m3ero9w", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582554777, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/f8s1d1/me_when_the_person_sitting_next_to_me_starts/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f8s1d1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffb000", "link_flair_css_class": "memes", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "599aa532-3f82-11e9-a9e0-0e7dd40beff6", "link_flair_text": "Memes", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/f8s1d1/me_when_the_person_sitting_next_to_me_starts/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1582554779, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 1145, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Me when the person sitting next to me starts chewing gum", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/l810dmwbuvi41.gif"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "vallyallyum", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_15wr6bol", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582477914, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/f8cbiv/tv_noises/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f8cbiv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/f8cbiv/tv_noises/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1582477915, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi, I've never posted here before.

I mean, even to people who don't struggle with Misophonia don't want to hear that shit. I also can't stand shushing sounds, and for some reason every fan show I watch needs to include them for some reason. It's gotten to the point I can barely have the TV on. It makes me lash out and cry. I'm disabled physically so I'm home most days, and it would suck having to sit in complete silence all day. Like, I want to write some open letter to Hollywood telling then to knock it the fuck off. Obviously that's not a solution because no one gives a shit about us. I just feel like I'm about to bust.

I tried to deal with it because I wanted to see my grandma (she was out of the room for a scan) and eventually put my earphones in blasting music. Aunt kept clearing her throat, asked her if I gave her a drink if it would help stop that and she said yes. Later a few hours pass, grandma came back in her room, we ate some food, etc and she gets moved to a different floor. We all come to see her and guess what? Heres my fucking uncle literally clearing his throat every few seconds. And I got so annoyed, triggered for lack of a better word (no word can explain how irritated this makes me) to the point where I had to leave my grandma and go home because he wouldn\u2019t fucking stop clearing his throat. Then as I\u2019m saying bye to my grandma, he has the nerve to flag me for being too loud while he\u2019s on the phone, I wanted to do something, bash his head in, push him out the window idk.

But at the same time I sometimes feel like I\u2019m acting entitled for preferring if family members that see me struggle with this daily could try and not make those sounds or suppress them a little bit. My neck hurts because I\u2019ve been kind of snapping my neck back in a way (it\u2019s something I do when I hear my trigger sounds over and over) Doesnt matter what I hit or bash my head into or how much I burst into tears because Im still gonna have this bullshit condition. It gets to the point where I have violent thoughts towards my uncle (sometimes other ppl) sometimes myself I see a psychiatrist and etc but they have no experience with misophonia.

The quality of your English or the meaningfulness of your submission doesn't have an effect on your chances to win - it's random.\n\nAlso, be prepared to be patient with us while we work through this process. We won't tolerate any abuse or impatient people, we'll just disqualify and potentially ban you. \n\n# What's the catch?\n\nHere's are the guidelines and information you need to know before you enter.\n\n* We're going to be fulfilling orders through [Amazon.ca](https://Amazon.ca) or [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com). Sorry to those outside of North America.\n* We'll be using the amazon wishlist system to purchase the item and ship to you. This is to protect your privacy and ours. ***HOWEVER:***  **Amazon discloses your first name, last name, state/province, and city. Your full address details are kept private.** The information that is disclosed is only seen when we place the order. This information will only be seen briefly by the moderators of r/misophoniasupport. We also do not care for this information or keep track of this in any way - we're just letting you know how Amazon's process works. Because we will be using Amazon for this, you must have a valid Amazon account with a shipping address. We will walk the winner through setting up an Amazon wishlist with the correct pair of headphones.\n* Your Reddit account ***must be at least 30 days old as of the draw date.*** This restriction is important to creating a fair and equal raffle. We want to do this now and again in the future; if you fall short of the 30 day restriction, make an account now and you can enter the next one.\n* The mods of r/misophoniasupport or any similar subreddits can't enter the draw.\n\n# Why TaoTronics?\n\nThe moderators of r/misophoniasupport aren't wealthy by any stretch of the imagination. We have our own bills and family to take care of in real life. TaoTronics offers superb functionality at a fair price. If the winner wants a different model that is at or below the same price, we'll consider the change.\n\n# Let us know what you think\n\nShould we do this again sometime? Should we give away something else? Let us know through modmail or in your entry comment.\n\nIf you are interested in offering a couple dollars of financial support to help us distribute more or even better headphones next time around, drop the mods a message.

This is gonna be long.\n\nI've been living with my bf in our own flat for almost 7 years. At the start, I just didn't like chewing noises, like a lot of people (and I didn't know misophonia exists). For 3 years, it was just a bit of my upstairs neighbor walking like an elephant on the wooden floor, so I was annoyed but not much else.\n\nFast forward to 3 years, a new downstairs neighbor appears (Yeah, I'm in some kind of noise sandwich between two noisy neighbors). She started partying last summer, outside, so it was pretty much impossible to sleep because her friends just talk SO LOUDLY and shout. (A guy ACROSS the street told them to shut up, so... Yeah. Pretty loud.)\n\nI, of course, asked my landlord if there's something that can be done to shut that neighbor up. The HOA gets involved and sends her two letters (one in September, another one in October because she started being noisy again).\n\nSo, from the start of summer last year to last night, it was pure hell. I discovered misophonia, and that my trigger is (among other things) muffled voices. Guess who had stopped partying but started just talking loudly? Downstairs neighbor. Of course. At around 11pm, or even midnight. Sometimes 1am. I started getting anxious just thinking of getting to bed. Still anxious now. For the whole day.\n\nBUT. Everything could have been just... Idk. Fixed, or something, last night. Because I finally had enough and went to confront her. Turns out she's a nice lady, just oblivious (and not sober when her... Fbw I guess, come). We talked for an hour, exchanged numbers, and decided that if she's being too noisy, I can just tell her. No problem. I'm a bit shy and hate confrontation, but I can do it.\n\nSo, after the talk, I go back to sleep (I think I just kind of passed out, I was so tired and stressed, my brain just shut down)! For two hours. Another friend of her is here (she asked me if I could \"save\" her from him by coming to hers, but I was asleep) and they're loud again. I'm obviously still kind of stressed because of the fact that I actually dared talk to her plus the fact that I'm trying to overcome my misophonia, so I try to sleep. I could finally fall asleep again when her friend left and no noise was heard.\n\nI'm sick of this shit. I'm sick of being scared to go to sleep. I'm sick of my rage against a very nice lady, but at the same time I'm sick of her bullshit. I'm sick of her shit music. I'm sick of having a super light sleep, where my nights are filled with only 10% of deep sleep. I'm exhausted.\n\nWhat happens when I finally get a job and will have to wake up way before noon? I can't sleep for only 3-4 hours. It's gonna kill me, ffs. I just want to be deaf (well, I love music way too much so that's never gonna happen). I just wanna move to an isolated island, with just the noise of the waves and seagulls. Even white noise doesn't help. My stomach is feeling like shit all the time, I just can't continue like that. I thought I had won.\n\nI hope my doctor will be able to help me when I see him on Monday (though I'm not sure misophonia is well known in France). But shit, I shouldn't have to take pills to be able to sleep. I don't wanna take pills, I don't want to take the habit of being able to sleep thanks to some pills. The worst is that my bf isn't really affected by all that (he was when there was the very loud partying, but now... Just voices, nah.) and I feel so lonely when it comes to my misophonia. He knows about it, but doesn't really get it (I won't blame him for that, tbh). Plus, he can fall asleep super fast.\n\nAnyway... Sorry for the long rant.

I had plenty of money working at a record store and I was happy to have a good life. I woke up eager to get moving. I was partying every night, popping pills and smoking dope. It was so easy back then.\n\nBut one day my head started acting up. I started to go insane. Sounds in my head that would normally wouldn\u2019t effect me started making me uncontrollably angry, it would fill tears in my eyes. I don\u2019t know why it happened. My girlfriend said it was probably just some drugs I took that messed up my head and I\u2019ll be fine in the next two hours or so. But hours passed and so did days, every time me and her would sit down to eat I couldn\u2019t take it. I would stand up and go sit in another room. The bird that sung in the morning would wake me up at 5:00 and made me mad making me sleep deprived. When ever someone whispered to me I would freak out. I couldn\u2019t listen to yelling from down the street. I went to the psychologist said it was Misophonia. I would have to live with this forever. I was always mad. ALWAYS. My drug addiction sped up and I started taking deadly amounts while my bank account started heading down. I was slowly going insane. My girlfriend left me and so did half of my friends. I was out of money and no one to help me out. I sold my house and moved onto an apartment. Where I\u2019ll stay for the rest of my life.\n\nI sit here in the dark crying every night. Why me? Why did god pick me to have misophonia? Why did I lose happiness? I have nothing anymore. I wish I could just not wake up. I want to end it. I\u2019m going to. Misophonia is the worst thing to ever exist! I\u2019m not jackson Howard anymore. Im just a loser who sits in his apartment drinking and crying. All because of one little mental disorder, that caused all of this. It took my friends, girlfriend, money and happiness. Now it\u2019ll take my life. I just wish I never lived in the first place.

I eventually just assumed I must have either very good hearing, or a wider range.  Perhaps even, sounds were perceived differently in my head,   than everyone else.  I learned to live with it and hate it.\n\nI have been on Reddit for years, but only recently ran into this sub.  I found that there are plenty of people who may have it worse than me.   So  of course this made me feel better about myself and my misophonia.  I too share the same experiences where people assume I am just whining  or  tell me, \"Just ignore it.\"  But I don't share the incredibly wide  range of triggers as I have read about on this sub.  I realized that  just like  any other disorder, we all experience it differently.  We all  have  different triggers and different reactions.\n\nI feel if you get annoyed or angry that the neighbors dog hasn't stopped barking for 2 hours, that's pretty normal for most people.  If you  feel  like your the only one who hears the guy, standing 200 feet away,   crinkling his plastic water bottle non-stop, and it results with  emotion  and complete distraction, then yes you have a problem, and were  calling  it Misophonia.\n\nRecently my GF  wanted to go-to a pop-up thing for an old TV show.  We went and  it was  just you know, walking around and taking pictures of yourself on  pieces  of the set.  Anyway, we are just getting started when I hear  two women  behind me both chewing gum with their mouths open at the same  time.   They were behind me on my left and right so it was in stereo.   Now I  wasn't actively listening for these sounds.  I was not on the  hunt,  seeking an individual to be upset with.  It just, happens.  The  instant I  hear it my internal voice says, \"Jesus, here we go.  Fuck.   Why.  Why  do they do this.\"\n\nI give my GF the  look and she asks, \"What?\"  I already know she doesn't  notice it, she  doesn't hear it.  I tell her, \"The fucking gum smacking  in stereo  sound.\"  She is immediately turned off to me as she is  irritated by my  frequent complaints about these things.  Including  complaints to her.   These complaints of mine only seem to compound and  it appears as if it's  all I do is complain.\n\nI am the  kind of person who likes it pretty quiet.  I move around the  house like a  ninja.  I step lightly, close cupboards softly, and close  doors using  the handle.  All to minimize the amount of sound I produce.   My  girlfriend is the kind of person who doesn't notice any of these  things.   For someone who instinctively, without thought, naturally  closes doors  without slamming them, I grow frustrated when she doesn't  understand  that I have asked her not to slam the door too many times.   However,  after a few years, she does not slam the front door anymore.\n\nOur most common, nearly daily quarrel, is about eating chips.  For years   now, no matter how much I have complained.  She has no issue walking   into our quiet bedroom, where I am laying, opening a bag of chips,   putting them in her mouth, and crunching down on them just before she   closes her mouth.\n\nThe first thing   that happens is my internal voice says, \"WHAT THE FUCK!  WHAT THE FUCK   IS WRONG WITH THIS WOMEN!\"  My external response is simply a poker face   directed at her, along with a deep breath.  Her response is 50/50.\n\nIt is either an apologetic or hostile response.  Take your pic.  I do not   fly into a rage, immediately.  But if her antagonistic response   continues as I explain that all I want her to do is turn the TV on if   she eats and nothing has changed for years so why can't you just not eat   loud chips in a quiet room, then I grow upset.  In return, she grows   upset, and now we are both fighting because, I am the one who has the   problem and I should learn to control myself.\n\n\"we are both fighting because, I am the one who has the problem and I should learn to control myself.\"\n\nThat doesn't make sense to me, only her, or anyone else that doesn't   understand, I cannot control my response.  If a war vet starts screaming   and hiding under the table because it's the Fourth of July, that makes   sense.  If everyone is pissed off that a baby has been crying for 20   minutes in the movie theater, that's understandable.  If the neighbors   dog is always outside and barks all day, it would make sense that   someone would be upset.  But as soon as I get frustrated or complain   that the editor decided to include the audible sounds of teeth on fork   noises and chewing and smacking during the dinner table scene of a   movie, I am the fucking crazy one.  I get it, it's natural, it's acting,   it's just a scene in a movie, relax dude.  NO!  WHY the fuck is Robert   DeNiro talking with food in his mouth during a movie?  Why do I have  to  listen to him bite the damn fork?  I mean is that audio picked up in  the  mic or did some asshole audio effects person actual pick that from  a  library and add it so it's more natural.  Fuck him.\n\nYet, I really do make good controlling my outward response to these   triggers.  More often than not I will keep it to myself for a very long   time.  Letting it go.  Eventually, if and when I do speak up, I am just   treated like I am a crazy asshole complainer.  They don't know I have   been letting it go for some time now.  Therefore when I am told to let   it go or ignore it, I am even more frustrated because, well, I HAVE  BEEN  IGNORING IT AND LETTING IT GO FOR A FUCKING HOUR.  But now I am  asking  you to please stop sucking your teeth.\n\nFor me it's definitely mouth noises.  Or any noise that comes from your   face.  Together with slammed cabinets and doors.  Loud phone talkers,   and people that walk through life whistling.  People that stomp   everywhere they go.  Mom and dad noises.  If you don't know what mom and   dad noises are, call your mom right now and listen for the strange   noises coming through the phone that are not words.  That's your moms   body making noises.  For me I sometime consider some people, noise   machines.\n\nMy uncle was this way.  Noise noise noise, everywhere he went.  Body noises, mouth noises, breathing noises...\n\nHe would bang and slam around everything he did.  Pots and pans, silverware, bang bang bang, boom boom boom.\n\nI once decided to play a game for a while.  I spent about 2 hours   counting the time between noises.  He was sitting at his desk reading.  I   don't think I counted past 10.\n\nAnyway, rage.\n\nNon of these triggers give me rage except one.   I haven't mentioned it   yet.  My usual feelings are anger and frustration, it's an annoyance to   me.  I feel about biting a fork sounds, the same as a normal person   would feel about a car horn honking outside the house at 3 a.m.  A very,   WHAT THE FUCK ASSHOLE, feeling.\n\nRage.  It comes from yelling.  It comes from screaming.  I don't know if   Misophonia has anything to do with it.  I kind of feel like Misophonia   is common for everyday sounds, you know, like breathing.  I don't know   if it has any significance to my reaction to screaming and yelling.\n\nRage, pure rage.  Almost instantly.  It's as if I took a hit off of a rage pipe and within 2 seconds I see red.\n\nMy heart is racing, heart attack speeds.  My breathing is heavy, jogging speeds.  I am shaking.  I can't help it.\n\nI ask, sometimes I plead with the person, \"For the love of god, please stop screaming.\"\n\nI will begin to repeatedly BEG the person to stop.\n\nThen the yelling and screaming continues.  It gets worse.  It's THE worse.\n\nI am now screaming and yelling too.\n\nYou know what I am screaming?  You know what I am yelling?\n\n\"PLEASE STOP FUCKING SCREAMING!\"  While all I see is red, I can't catch my breath, I can't feel my fingers.\n\nNow   I am scared.  I am ashamed.  I am embarrassed that I lost my control.   I  don't feel good about myself.  I am now completely exhausted inside.\n\nRage\n\nAnyway,   I found this sub and just wanted to write a quick one about myself.    Just to get it off my chest.  I mostly enjoyed reading about other   peoples issues and wanted to share the same.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 941, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Greetings and my own issues.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/elgc42/greetings_and_my_own_issues/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Jacksonhoward0", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2gc7hg4q", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1578414192, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/eldped/misophonia_brings_the_worst_out_of_me/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eldped", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#b209d6", "link_flair_css_class": "venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "9420fff0-4011-11e9-bb6e-0eef35d07208", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/eldped/misophonia_brings_the_worst_out_of_me/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1578414198, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve had misophonia for a long time.

I also took a test which gave the results I expected.\n\nSome minutes later i told some friends in my discord group (which I am not promoting here) about it, but they didn\u2019t help much (except the fact that I\u2019m very insecure of everything and everything I want to say is kept locked inside me until I find an opportunity to let it out, so I feel very well when venting). I told my cousin (I was traveling by car, so when we stopped to eat i told him), but it was the same thing: it didn\u2019t help much.\n\nNow let\u2019s get to the real point - even though I told my friends and cousin about it, I couldn\u2019t have the chance of asking for this kind of help because it would feel kinda weird. So I preferred asking it on Reddit because i feel less weird about it. So. How can i talk to my parents about this? I feel like they will not react well to this, since every time i told my uncle to shut up (from \u201cplease stop making so much noise, I don\u2019t like it\u201d to \u201cshut the **** up, I can\u2019t even eat in peace\u201d) they both (mom and uncle) didn\u2019t react well. \n\nThey are also not very tolerant people (they are a bit homophobic, and sometimes even racist) (and they act like depression, phobias and this kind of stuff is just stupidity) (thanks god I\u2019m not like this), so that makes me feel like they won\u2019t handle with it the way they should. (Btw they are also a bit close-minded and they are to a certain level karens) (and I\u2019m not that old to feel safe confronting them [I\u2019m 13])\n\nSo... Can you help me finding a way to tell them this?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 934, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "So...

I have been panicking everyday about what this could mean for my misophonia and social anxiety, and I am sure most of you understand. \n\nI have a radio on all day when I am at work, it is a volume rather loud for most people but very comfortable for me especially with earplugs (I wear those too but hide them under hair bands). I am worried the new person will complain it is too loud and my boss will force me to keep it off or take it away from me (they have threatened to take it away in the past when I first started working there). \n\nAnother thing is, there will be no walls or barriers to separate us. I have talked to my boss about my concerns with the new person being able to see me eat my lunch and answer the phone (social anxiety) and they said he won't be able to see me past my monitors but I know he can still see me, his desk will be just 5 feet away from mine. I even asked if they could get me a desk shelf-wall thingy and they said no. So I've been panicking over that as well. \n\nI won't list triggers (I know they are not allowed) but I am so worried this person has allergies or some health problem that will cause me to be triggered all day long for 9hrs a day. I work 37 hours a week and 37 hours spent in a constant state of fight-or-flight will make me lose my mental health real quick. I am not looking forward to this AT ALL.\n\nI know the obvious answer is find another job, but the thing is the job I have right now is the best I will ever get with no college degree. I don't have many co-workers and it's with really nice people and the boss loves me. But I can't tell them about my misophionia because I don't think they will understand (they're older people). I can't wear headphones because I have to answer the phone. I have thought about asking if I can find some headphone that takes calls and plays music at the same time.

Only problem I have is that they have four dogs. I am in misophonia hell. Dogs are my biggest trigger because all they do is lick. When everyone sits down and settles in the living room, the dogs all lay down and immediately start to graze on their bodies.   \n\n\nSo, for the majority of my vacation, I've been hiding in the bedroom because I CAN NOT stand being around the dogs and their obsessive licking. All they do is lick themselves. When they aren't licking themselves, they are slurping water. I can't say anything because I know I will get the usual, \" that's what dogs do? How else are they supposed to clean themselves and drink water?\" I think it's so selfish of me to expect these animals to not do these things yet when they do it, I literally want to take the nearest sharp object and ram it into my ear so that I don't have to suffer listening to those awful sounds.   \n\n\nI want to be deaf. This condition is a fucking curse and I want to be deaf. I'm sick of always looking like a crazy person or a dog hater because of my misophonia. I always feel like I have to be silent about my triggers because dogs are sacred and their comfort will always trump mine. I don't hate dogs. I am a huge animal lover and I desperately wish that I could be around them but the sounds they make drive me absolutely insane. I try explaining my condition but I'm met with, \" Everyone hates those sounds but we deal with it. \"  \n\n\nSo now I seem like I'm being a rude, anti social asshole because I feel trapped in this bedroom to avoid the triggering sounds made by the dogs. I can't fucking win.  I want to be out there with the family but my stupid brain has to be wired this way. I'm not choosing to be this way. It's not something that I can just ignore or get over. Even if I put earbuds in and listen to music, I see the dogs head's bobbing up and down as they obsessively go to town on their bodies with their tongues.   \n\n\nI feel so ridiculous getting so bent out of shape about this but it's seriously ruining my holiday and I feel so guilty for not being able to simply ignore it like everyone tells me to.   \n\n\nSo here I am, sad and laying in bed while I listen to my family laugh and have a good time in the other room.

For hours. I've been listening to her daily crap for months. It's driving me absolutely nuts. My 3 hour commute is miso hell. My open office workplace is miso hell. My own home is miso hell. (I also have a roommate that I had nothing to do with, but that's a different story.) I got earplugs because of her, and I'm sick of the discomfort of wearing them. Not to mention that some of the noises are loud enough to seep through the earplugs. I've woken up in a panic multiple weekends thanks to her shit.\n\nWithout exaggerating or being dramatic, her time schedule for the noise is around 4pm to 11pm on weekdays, and around 10am to 11pm on weekends, and it's insane. I think it would drive someone crazy even without miso. I understand that people have to clean, and sometimes, they have to do deep cleaning, but I keep wondering, what the heck is she doing every day?? Is her dog so rowdy that it keeps messing things up? Is she obsessed with deep cleaning? Does she feel the need to redecorate every day? Is she doing airbnb, and would that require daily cleaning / rearrangement? What can a person be doing all day that requires this much noise?\n\nI've only interacted with her very briefly so far. For some reason, she feels the need to assert her dominance immediately by being a condescending, combative asshole, even when saying hello, so I have absolutely zero desire to talk to her. I highly doubt she'd take it graciously.\n\nMy back is so tense I feel like it's going to snap. As per usual, she started at 10 in the morning on this blessed Saturday. It's 9pm and she's still going. I'm through a migraine, 3 hours of being outside, and an exhausting earplug nap. I usually try to drown out her noise by wearing noise cancelling headphones and listening to music, watching videos, or playing with my friends. It does very little, all of those activities are dissatisfying because I can't relax. I can still hear it. I'm usually irritated when I talk to my best friend while we play, and I'm sick of explaining the same story every day. I can tell that they're sick of hearing my complaints, too.\n\nI'm having a hard time not detailing the horrible things I wish on her. I'm so glad I'm moving out in January.\n\nThanks for the opportunity to vent.

Anyway, Here you go: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI HATE loud chewers with a passion, they make my skin crawl, my muscles clench, and my bones crumble. This is especially bad when they're eating something sticky and it sticks to the top of their mouths and they try to swallow it, after which you get this meaty sound.\n\nBut there's something far worse lurking out there in these lands. Because I know a few people who are **loud drinkers**.\n\nOne of these people is a close friend of mine. I went to visit him the other day to play some games, eat dinner and have a few drinks.\n\nNow, this guy is already quite a loud chewer. He can eat cotton candy and make it sound like he's eating an apple made of steel. He does this weird sucking thing when eating something, so it always sound like he's slurping whilst also smacking and chewing at the same time. His chewing can make Lovecraftian Deity's flinch.\n\nI am not really used to it, but I am coming close to ignoring his ~~eating~~ slimy devouring sounds. I was actually kind off looking forward to meeting him again, but unfortunately, hell was about to break loose.\n\nWhen visiting him, he started making a cup of coffee. This would become the cup of coffee that would result in the longest 15 minutes of my life.\n\nWe were playing some video games. The coffee maker stopped making a sound so it must have been ready. I didn't think anything of it yet, I was a bit immersed in the game.\n\nHe came back and put the cup down, the coffee was really, really thick. I don't know what kind of coffee that was but it had the thickness of some potato soup. He had some coffee milk that he put in, the coffee milk was very chunky somehow. I don't know how often he makes coffee but that looked like the most disgusting milk I've ever seen.\n\nHe picked up the cup and put it against his mouth. He started sniffing the brown cup of chunky mud, he had the sniffles so you could hear the loud piggy snores.\n\nHe took the first sip of coffee.\n\nIt's so difficult to describe this first sip. He sucked the coffee into his mouth, still extremely hot, he kept it in for way too long, you could hear it splashing around in his mouth, like a tsunami hitting the ground.\n\nHe's smacking the hot coffee with all his strength. The chunky bits must taste very good because he was chewing them oh so loudly. I don't know how, but he made sure the chunky bits made a crunch when he bit down on them as if he was chewing gravel.\n\nThe sip went down to his throat, and the swallow was like the roar of a thousand Spartans in battle.\n\nAAAAaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmmmm \\*\\***smack... smack.. smack.**\\*\\* *Sniffle sniffle sniffle*\n\nAll this in 15 seconds.\n\nI became light-headed and I had to stop this.\n\nHe was already starting his new sip which was almost a gulp. He did almost the exact same thing but louder. A few seconds into this gulp he grabbed one of those raisin cookie bars. He took a bite out of the bar with the coffee still in his mouth. The sight of the coffee coming out of his mouth and dripping on the raisin bar will haunt me well beyond the grave.\n\nLike Noah's ark in the storm, the cookie was floating around in his mouth. \\*Bite\\* \\*Smack\\* \\*Crunch\\* \\*Gluck\\* \\*Gluck\\* \\*Gluck\\*.\n\nIt didn't even take me a minute to attempt to find a way out of this, I already went to the bathroom a few minutes ago to take a crap so going again would be suspicious, I didn't want to make the situation awkward so I did what I do best. Make a distraction.\n\nWhile he was eating his damn bar and drinking his clunky wasteland excuse for coffee. I plugged in my speakers. I wanted to play some sound as a distraction, and I happened to select the worst one possible.\n\nScatman John's famous hit \"I am a Scatman\".\n\nSo anyway, I started blasting the music. And it helped for about a few seconds until he made another big \\****GULP***\\* that seemed to go over the sound of the music.\n\nHe started singing along.......\n\nWhat was supposed to be:  \nSki-bi dibby dib yo da dub dub Yo da dub dub\n\nCame out like:\n\nSkti-bihhh dibbed-yhhh dib \\*smack\\* yo da \\*heavy breathing\\* dububtthhhmmmm Yo da dubh dubh \\*smack\\* \\*heavy breathing in\\*\n\nI never clicked away from a video so fast in my life, the Greek god Mercury would be impressed with how fast I moved.\n\nI endured 13 minutes more of this, I was constantly looking at his cup and hoping it would be over, only to be disappointed by the clunky white marshmallow like chunks of milk that was still left in his cup.\n\nThose 13 minutes didn't just feel like hell they were hell. Time wasn't fleeting but madness did take its toll. I kept looking at him with eyes of madness. Drinking this loudly should be ~~considered~~ a war crime.\n\nHe asked me what was wrong, I said \"nothing\" and started pretending to play a video game, hypnotized by the sounds of battleships in his mouth.\n\nWhen he finally finished it felt like I had escaped Alcatraz. I was finally free!\n\nI went back to playing video games still mentally scarred by the experience. I think I will forever have nightmares about the experience, and I don't think I can ever drink coffee again. And if I ever come close to experiencing this again, so help me god.\n\nSeriously, loud drinkers are worse than chewers.\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 861, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Loud drinkers worse than loud chewers?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/e9eq3h/loud_drinkers_worse_than_loud_chewers/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AvengeThe90s", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_d4szf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576099399, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/e9dfqh/just_realized_i_i_have_a_noise_trigger/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e9dfqh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/e9dfqh/just_realized_i_i_have_a_noise_trigger/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576099422, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm just now realizing that it's not normal to be incensed at the sound of a basketball bouncing.\n\nI do know what it's from; the kid that lived in the house behind me (they recently moved out) must've thought he was LeBron or something, and from the first nice day of the year til the last nice day of the year, he was out in the backyard bouncing his basketball.\n\nBut I shouldn't feel instant **hate** for some random person I hear bouncing a basketball while walking down the street when I'm out running errands, or passing by the park.

Even if her other hand is involved in another activity. it drives me absolutely CRAZY!!!!!! i have to turn my body away or completely leave the room.\n\nThe worst is when she starts making a \u201cband\u201d out of her body when really feeling a song, and stomps the feet, POUNDS the chest with a fist, and makes noises with mouth. it\u2019s like she was sent straight from\nhell to TORTURE me. \n\ni want to scream and rip my hair out.  but i never say a word and it has serious effects on my mental well being. i just feel like a crazy person and don\u2019t know what to do. i love my friend, she\u2019s great and i enjoy spending time with her. she has no idea of my disorder or maybe that it even exists. \n\nHELP!!!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 782, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Good Friend is an INSANELY high trigger", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/e85v8e/good_friend_is_an_insanely_high_trigger/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "imanonymous987", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2owhdoly", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575523745, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/e6cmc0/i_feel_awful_because_my_dog_triggers_my/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e6cmc0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#33cc33", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "5b931b10-4038-11e9-9f72-0e3f9e09b804", "link_flair_text": "Support", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/e6cmc0/i_feel_awful_because_my_dog_triggers_my/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575523746, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have two dogs but only one of them triggers my misophonia really bad.

It gives me a little bit of hope that there is finally movement on the research front about this horrible disorder. \n\n[Misophonia Convention 2021](https://whova.com/portal/webapp/misop_202110/Agenda)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 3080, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Misophonia Convention 2021 - online!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/q46wk2/misophonia_convention_2021_online/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "chocomancer08", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9vu7ci13", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1633725567, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/q46bih/seeing_a_coworker_chew_gum/", "gildings": {}, "id": "q46bih", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#b209d6", "link_flair_css_class": "venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "9420fff0-4011-11e9-bb6e-0eef35d07208", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/q46bih/seeing_a_coworker_chew_gum/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1633725578, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI have always hated the sound of someone chewing gum, the sound of them talking while chewing gum and seeing them chew gum.\n\nI have been working through this over the past several years and working in a factory helps; that being said, when I have to talk to my teammate and she is is chewing gum or talk to her while she is chewing gum it can be excruciating.

I'm 27 and have had bad misophonia for as long as I can remember. I have a newish job now that could really turn into a career for me, but it's in a small, open office space where I'm constantly facing trigger sounds all day every day and even developing new ones due to prolonged exposure. I am in desperate need of good noise canceling headphones, but am so overwhelmed by all my options. Does anyone else here use noise canceling headphones to specifically help them with their misophonia? What did you choose and why did you choose it? Did it live up to your expectations? Was it worth your money? I'm hoping to buy some for black Friday / cyber Monday and hopefully get an okay deal.\n\n Here's what I'm thinking so far, if it helps guide your recommendations/advice for me...\n\u25aa\ufe0eI know I want over-the-ear headphones so that ppl can always see when I have them on and don't just think I'm ignoring them. \n\u25aa\ufe0eAll day uninterrupted comfort is HIGHLY important.\n\u25aa\ufe0eI do not care if they're wireless or wired. Whichever one will last longer during the work day. (I'm at work for 9 hours and DO NEED to be using them basically the whole time) \n\u25aa\ufe0eObviously the cheaper the better, so long as the quality is still there, but I understand that this can get expensive and am prepared to spend at least a couple hundred dollars, but nothing insane. Like, I'm really not wanting to go over $300, absolutely $400 max. I'm desperate, but I'm can't afford, like, $700 desperate. \n\u25aa\ufe0eIdk if any even do this, but if they have the ability to link with or plug into my office desk phone, that'd be a cool bonus, but it's definitely not a necessity. Even if I can't hear the phone ring, I can see it light up when it rings, so none of that is a true concern. \n\nAny advice, reviews, or recommendations would be so much appreciated.

I was extremely uncomfortable and tried to keep my distance from them and not make it look obvious because I didn't want them to get upset.\n\nThen my oldest niece talked about how she lost her sense of smell last week for a few days and was really scared.

My life was ruined by misophina - it cost me my marriage and very nearly my career.  Sniffing in particular was my kryptonite, chewing sounds, mouth smacking, even keyboard typing caused me instant, intense anxiety and anger.  The usual stuff.  I had literally given up hope after reading and being told countless times that there is no cure.\n\nAfter years of seeing various doctors, psychiatrists, neurologists, taking anti-depressants etc etc I ran some tests on my gut and discovered I had a bad Candida infection - possibly for about 4-5 years.  I'd never heard of Candida before.  I followed nutritionists advice (see 'candida diet') and cleaned up my diet, quit alcohol completely, took probiotics and did whatever I needed to do.  Over a couple of months the misophonia melted away.  The most important thing was quitting refined sugary foods, processed carbs and alcohol.  I noticed a huge difference.  It's been almost 18 months now and I can gladly tolerate any such sound, when I hear them now I smile to myself and thank god.  I used to literally live with earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones in my ears, now I never use avoidance techniques, ever.  \n\nI'm not suggesting everyone with misophonia has Candida - it seems I did though, maybe someone else does too and I really feel like I need to talk about it and share my experience.  This approach only involves a healthy diet, probiotics, cleaning up and healing your gut so really what have you got to lose in trying.

I censored them with spoilers, but be careful anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy initial plan for the PSAT was simple. I go in, I stuff in some earplugs, I work for three hours, and I leave. But earlier this afternoon, after I was given the student guide, I found out that the SAT explicitly bans ear plugs... And now I'm completely lost.\n\nI'm a sophomore in high school who's planning to take the PSAT in just two weeks. I know the PSAT is only \"practice\" and it won't affect me no matter how bad of a score I get, but just the thought of being stuck in a room full of triggers without my precious ear plugs... I'd rather die!\n\nMy main trigger is sniffling. I recently got over my trigger for eating noises, but that process took two years, there's no way I'll be able to get rid of my sniffling trigger in **TWO WEEKS!** The sound of sniffling just drives me up the walls... It's like the Chinese water torture technique, every little sniff only drives me more and more mad, and just when I think it's over, \"&gt;!SNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFF!&lt;**\"** I've never verbally or physically lashed out at anyone in my life, but one day, if my misophonia gets even worse, I might just do that, which scares me.\n\nTo make things worse, I actually want to get a good score on the test once I take the real one, and that's already difficult enough for people without misophonia, I'd have to be a natural born genius to get a good score and get triggered for three hours at the same time!\n\nI've seen some other posts about problems like these, and the comments are mostly suggesting that they get \"disability accommodations\", but I'm going to be honest, that idea makes me extremely uncomfortable. I'm not disabled, self-proclaiming myself as \"disabled\" is utterly insulting towards people with real disabilities. And the only person who knows about my misophonia is my best friend, not even my parents know about it, how am I going to get my hands on a psychiatrist note!?\n\nAnd taking a test without ear plugs is going to be a massive adjustment for me, because I already wear ear plugs during tests in my normal classes. I've done it since freshman year, and I continue to do it today.

I think it started when I was around 12 years old with people breathing, I had a friend with difficulties to breath and I couldn't stand it and I though I was a terrible person because I knew it wasn't her fault. Now I'm 22 and I feel like I can hardly stand anything, I live in a dormitory and I can hear people talking in the corridor and I just want to kill them or jump through the window, I have to put the music in my earbuds so loud that I fear it might ruin my hearing. I had an exam yesterday and I could hear the teacher in the next room talking it was so loud I'm sure everyone was annoyed but I wanted to get out of the room and go see that teacher to tell them shut up so badly. With all that I would say it seems obvious I suffer from misophonia but at the same time I'm wondering if it's just my social anxiety, I can't stand people so it seems fair that I can't stand hearing them ? I'm not even sure sometimes what's triggering me... And when I hear sounds I usually can't stand but recorded, it doesn't do anything to me... \n\nSo I'm not sure where I'm trying to get with all that maybe it's more rant than a question, I just want to know if other people relate to that or their opinion from experience.

I keep finding myself choosing what to do with my time based on other people eating. Whenever I hear my dad start popping popcorn in the microwave, I know I have about 5 minutes to stop whatever I was doing and shut myself in my room with everything I'm going to need for the next half hour, however inconvenient that is.

My mother is a nice person, but she's the biggest source of trigger sounds in my life. I'm at the point now where it's sometimes difficult for me to listen to her speak. She's always been quite overweight, and for some reason I have begun to associate that with the sounds she makes. Now whenever I hear her clearing her throat I find myself thinking, alongside the usual emotional response, \"she sounds like that because she's fat, I never want to be like that, I can't eat, I have to lose weight\". I'm already insecure about my body and get anxious about how much I eat (I'm very much a healthy weight but I am quite scared of gaining weight, which I imagine is partle due to the sometimes crippling health anxiety that permeates my life), so this just adds to it.

Then my mum got her wisdom teeth removed and after that she started chewing a lot more \"disgustingly \" if i may(im not saying mu mum is bad) and while i was still able to tolerate it , it has started to become a major problem in last year. Whenever i see her eating anything my focus instantly goes to her chewing and that really liquidy sound of food getting \"chewed \"(i getting shivers even writing it).Now whenever she eats i have to go to another room and focus on something else really hard or get under a thick blanket and still if if dont keep moving my head to make sounds near my year i can still hear it. Whenever she eats i get really angry and angry to a point where i once punched my own ear so very hard that it hurt for a few days. I become extremely violent when she chews. And now its spreading. When my dad eats he has a habit of snorting and he also chews with mouth open and that also is starting to drive me mad. And at least my sibling stopped doing it but now i hear sounds from even inside her mouth when she eats and i know she cant do anything about it since even i make those sounds when i eat and it still makes me uncomfortable when she does it, i feel like a hypocrite. Is this misophonia?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do i cure it, Im still 16 i dont want to become a psychopathic asshole in my life. And while my parents are supportive they think that im just over reacting and while my dad still tries to control it when i point it at the dining table but he tends to forget it the next day and mum  cant do it cuz she has some jaw problems i dunno...  Also they sometimes get angry if i end up reacting offensively. Is there a way to cure it ? I cant ask them to give me fancy headphones for this. Also i end up saying wrong things sometimes when i am irritated by the sound that hurt them. Like recently when my mum started eating something i visually reacted she asked me to go in another room, i got angry and ended up saying that she deliberately was eating in front of me which was not the case.....

(side note, i get just as angry when i SEE someone biting their nails. it's like my brain still connects it with the sound even if i can't hear it, but it's my biggest trigger of all time. anyone else??) \n\ni'm across from the pool. at first i was like \"wow! this is great, almost like i'm at a hotel! wonderful view!\".....wrong. the sound of kid's screaming at the top of their lungs 24/7 was awful, so i had to have my tv on at all times to keep myself sane. \n\npool's closed now, amazing time to be alive, BUT its still warm out. so my very musical-outdoorsy downstairs neighbors are still enjoying every evening of their life on their balcony SINGINGGGG their favorite songs at the top of their lungs!!!! like please buy a fucking house. i cannot wait for 30 degree weather so everyone goes tf inside \n\nbut the absolute worst....the footsteps upstairs. the first couple months here i don't think anyone lived there, so i remember thinking \"fuck yeah this is so awesome! peace and quiet!\" bc it was one of my concerns (but i didn't want to carry my shit up an extra floor so i opted out, lesson learned-just hire movers to maintain sanity) now there are the heaviest fucking footed people living above me. i hear them when they wake up at the ass crack of dawn and their loud ass dog running around, i hear their fucking laundry machine, i hear the constant hulk stops all afternoon, i hear their shower, i hear it ALL. \n\nit has never been this extreme before, but i've also never been in this living environment before..pretty much 24/7. i think any sort of \"outside\" noise (basically noises that aren't coming from my apartment) is what makes me fucking lose it. i am so irritable now and i cannot escape it. i've started keeping my headphones in all day but i also enjoy watching tv and the tv doesn't block out big foot unfortunately. i went from hating mouth noises to every single possible noise. if i'm out in public or whatever these things don't bother me and then its usually just the mouth/fidgeting noises. but if i'm home, whewwww everything has changed. anyone else in the same boat?\n\nok, rant over. it's really exhausting though and i really hate having to deal with this. it blows my mind that so many people are just completely unbothered by things like this. anyways, i haven't been through many of the posts in here so this is prob asked a ton - but does anyone have any suggestions on how to minimize this? my airpods (older gen) are good, but i have to turn them up a lot to block everything out. aside from that, it's the hardest when watching tv and still having to hear the background noise, i'm not sure if there's any possible way to help that.  \n\n\nany advice or \"i know how you feel\"'s are much appreciated. i'm really glad to know i'm not crazy :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 3006, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "working from home is literally torture. vent &amp; needed advice for the new gal here!!!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/plytxo/working_from_home_is_literally_torture_vent/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "miserable_banana_39", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_c17qipnv", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1631267915, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/plhzae/this_was_torture/", "gildings": {}, "id": "plhzae", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#b209d6", "link_flair_css_class": "venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "9420fff0-4011-11e9-bb6e-0eef35d07208", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/plhzae/this_was_torture/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1631267926, "score": 1, "selftext": "I use yt autoplay.

I lasted just over 5 weeks at the apartment complex... a friend who also lived there recommended it to me due to its double glazed doors and windows (very rare in my country). However, what i didn't notice in the 5 minutes I got to check out the apartment for inspection was that although it was three floors up, it was almost directly above the garage door for the complex and that the walls were razor thin... i could hear every door being slammed, every footstep of every neighbour above and around me and the garage door that screeched like fingernails on a blackboard every 5mins 24 hours a day. \n\nI slept with ear plugs in to no effect. Tried to use my noise cancelling headphones (a godsend) but i can't use them constantly, especially not when sleeping due to a medical issue where i can't sleep on my back. I don't think i slept more than 4hrs a night the whole time i was there and that was with sleeping pills. \n\nI reported the noises to the strata people who claimed they'd never had this issue before (i highly doubt) and that they would investigate... i never heard back. After a while i began to record the noise in preparation to fight with the strata about it. But in the end decided for my own wellbeing to just get out, i requested to break my lease, move back to my old house and pay the rent til they found someone else to rent it which they have, but not for another month. \n\nIt was an expensive experience and taught me a lot, but i know now i am not an apartment person! Friends who also live in apartments came to visit and initially said its just normal apartment noise, until they heard the garage door screeching and the stomping of the person above me, which they said was excessive and that it was just an unfortunate located apartment in the complex and to report it to the strata. At this point I'm just happy to be out of there. I also had constant stress as i got numerous noise complaints from strata for my dog barking (barking at neighbours noises) and also he began to destroy the doors and poop on the carpet. I'm pretty sure they were on the brink of kicking me out due to my dog anyway.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 3002, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Moved to an apartment", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/pktqkr/moved_to_an_apartment/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SickPick1e", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ddexgv02", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1631171360, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/pksspw/my_whole_family_doesnt_understand/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pksspw", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ea0027", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "6c5b5cda-3f77-11e9-9e70-0eeb6e9bf338", "link_flair_text": "Trigger Warning", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/pksspw/my_whole_family_doesnt_understand/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1631171371, "score": 1, "selftext": "I hate... and I mean HATE with a burning rage eating sounds; smacking sounds and anything to do with it.

The biggest trigger of mine is when my dad clears his throat or coughs. It doesn\u2019t sound like any sound a human would make, and I think part of the reason why those sound he makes bothers me so much is because of one time when I was younger, he dragged me across the carpet in our living room and I got a terrible carpet burn from it. I screamed at him to stop because I could feel the friction of the carpet against the bare skin on my back as it ripped a quarter-size area of skin, and I was left in pain with a bloody and raw carpet burn. \n\nI locked myself in my room because I was so scared. I remember my mom would always tell me to call her at work if I ever needed anything, and she would be there for me. She\u2019s a nurse, and at the time she worked nights at the hospital. I was terrified to leave my bedroom to grab a phone to call her and tell her what happened. I was scared my dad would scream at me for bothering my mom at work. \n\nI remember my dad unlocking the door to my bedroom, and I cowered in fear because I had nowhere to run. I was scared he was going to get up in my face and scream at me. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t. He just came to apologize for what he did to me and offered a hug, but I squeezed myself into a ball and whimpered as I turned away. It made me feel bad, but he hurt me. I remember him telling me not to tell mom, but I didn\u2019t listen. \n\nI remember telling her and showing her my back as she gasped in horror.

Despite that, I've been doing art all my life, and I'm now attending an art school. I got a bit used to pencils, mostly from the exposure, but it's still terrible, so I always block out the sound.\n\n\nToday, we got a new art teacher. He seemed alright when we were talking, a bit ignorant, but pretty educated. \n\nWe were supposed to draw a figure with charcoal- which involved a lot of smudging and other horrible noises- and as we had our things prepared, he told us that we \"can't use our headphones\", because it would disrupt us. \n\nI walked up to him, told him I have misophina, I hate the sound of charcoal on paper, and to please let me put on my headphones or I'll go crazy.\n\nHe told me no and to \"not listen to noises, just focus on art\".\n\nI honestly didn't know what to say. Two of my friends vouched for me, told him I've been like that since our first year, but he still told me no.\n\nIt was a bit of a blur after that. People started drawing, I started crying. I was sitting on the floor for a long time, shaking. I managed to find my anxiety meds and swallowed them because I honestly felt terrible.\n\nThe teacher asked me if I'm serious, and what's the disorder called, but I was honestly too busy trying to not run away or stab myself with the nearest pencil to get away from the sound.\n\nEventually, the teacher walked away (after just standing there and watching me for a bit, not saying anything, no apology or offer to have me keep my headphones on), I got up, put my headphones on anyway, and managed to draw something half passable. The teacher acted like nothing happened.\n\n\n\nI don't completely hate my new teacher, he was uneducated, a lot of people are, but I still felt horrible for a long time. I still do. \n\nI honestly want to get a doctor's note for my misophonia, but I don't think I can.

The only times it bothers me is early in the mornings and late at night. I\u2019m a pre light sleeper so I do wake up quite easily when I hear noise. I don\u2019t have a trigger noise/sound in particular, any noise that I find annoying is annoying to me. I\u2019m not sure if that makes sense but like birds chirping won\u2019t usually bother me, although I have had times where I felt like brutally stabbing them. My dad has a habit of vacuuming in the morning and sometimes blasting music. I hate my dad in general so him doing this adds fuel to the fire. Also I live in an asian household so my parents are always loud, I absolutely despise the sound of them talking. (To each other and other asian guest, its so fucking loud I just want to dip myself in lava). \n\nMy brother constantly games day and night, but it doesn\u2019t bother me so much throughout the day. This is because my brain isn\u2019t so much aware of the noise around me. At night when it\u2019s quite, the only fucking thing I can hear is my brothers $300 wireless Logitech mouse pounding on his motherfucking mousepad. This is a sound that triggers me, it is currently 3am and I am sobbing as I write this. I have middle child anger issues too so like I don\u2019t just feel overly irritated,  i feel like I could commit a genocide where I individually go and murder every single citizen in my country. When he finished gaming, he goes in his room and then calls his friends (Another thing that makes extremely frustrated). The sound of muffled talking just irritates me in way I cannot describe, I\u2019d wish he\u2019d just shut the fuck up sometimes. There was this one time he chatted away up until 7am (he had the audacity to take the day off while I went to school that day). I remember getting so angry that I threw something at the wall (our rooms are next to each other). \n\nThese sounds make me very anxious and stressed out, I try to breathe like everyone says but that doesn\u2019t really help. There\u2019s nothing I can really do about it so I just let myself get angry and cry. I can only sleep when it\u2019s dead silent or when I\u2019m in a comfortable environment, so playing music will only stop the stress but won\u2019t help me sleep. \n\nOur state/city has been in lockdown for like a long fucking time now and it\u2019s driving me nuts, like so fucking nuts. Because of this, I haven\u2019t been able to get proper sleep and I end up missing a lot of my morning classes. I think it\u2019s week 7/8 of term 3 now and my teachers keep emailing me, like stfu I think I know by now. It\u2019s taking a huge toll on my education, not my marks but my study habits.

Tonight I put my headphones in and tried to block it out but it did nothing because he's SO loud. So I took them out, and I had always said something about it before, but this time I was more intense with it. I told him I was being 100% serious when I tell him that it literally drives me crazy and that he ALWAYS does this and he told me to just put my headphones in. I told him I did but he's so loud it doesn't matter. Arguing ensued and long story short it didn't end well.

In that time, there have been moments where I've seen her misophonia elicit the kind of rage response that I've read about, but often the sounds have come and gone or she has found ways to block them out (ear plugs, white noise machine, headphones, etc.) We recently moved to a new town and into a large apartment building. We decided to live on the second floor because of our plans to get a new puppy (we did!) but I'm now regretting that decision (the 2nd floor, not the dog). It was mostly fine for the first few weeks, and then yesterday someone(s) moved in directly above us. The sound of their movements is unbearable for her - I can see the physical pain that she is in as they move about. We can't move out - the cost of breaking the lease and moving to a new place is prohibitive for us. \n\n\nI've read all the google articles about supporting a partner/SO with misophonia and at this point they aren't helpful. It's mostly listicles with advice like \"believe them\" and \"don't take it personally\" - I'm already on board with those kinds of things, that's not the problem. I just can't think of a practical way to drown out this particular noise (having TV/music on doesn't help) and I desperately want to support her/make this living situation easier on her because we have the better part of a year left on this lease. \n\n\nAny ideas/thoughts/feedback?

I sometimes just want to grab something and shove it in my ear. ( I  hurt my throat today cuz i was trying to drink water without making a sound) \n\nI know im the one that is being irrational, and I don't  expect them to change just for me ,but they don't even try to understand what im going through.

When I am at my family's for meals, they allow music or I can get up and go to the bathroom for a quick break, but I obviously can't do that in this situation... It also makes it really hard to eat, because it's all I can focus on and I'm so grossed out. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or ideas for how to cope during this?

then got distracted by the dog who wanted to be pet n such\n\nand we were chatting and she gave the dog a big ol smooch and i just died inside like a wet piece of tissue paper crippling to bits.\n\nfigured id just let it go bc hey its only one time and even though im dead inside its not gonna repeat again within this interaction right?\n\nnaw she gives this dog another horrible wet smooch and then im like (internally) fuck it im out. its making me so fucking angry n,,, im trying very hard not to show it.\n\nso i just up and left my room quickly &amp; she noticed that i did it so briskly, and with such urgency, she asked if I was good and I was like \"yup\" trying to keep the interaction short bc I dont wanna be in earshot of her when shes w the dog\n\nand of COURSE the dog follows me bc im goin fast and the dog is like \"oh running???? playtime?????\" and then my sis follows after the dog so im like, big awkward, bc im trying not to make it obvious that im avoiding both of them &amp; im also trying to seem as \"normal\" on the outside as possible (trying to just act like i wasnt just triggered) so im like hhhhhhhhfuck\n\nso eventually dog gets distracted by sis again and i flee to my room at a pace that the dog wont wanna chase me at but omfg.\n\njust,,, internal seething.\n\nive never had a HUGE problem w the sound of ker kissing the dog b4. Like its been annoying before and its like :/ bc I think its weird to kiss ur pets even on the forehead or whatever but thats fine its her descision. but never has the sound set me off that horribly and im :/.\n\nwhy am i like this im just so pissed.\n\ni mean it makes sense. that this would be the natural progression of my misophonia. bc my main triggers are wet mouth sounds and her kissing the dog *is* a *wet mouth sound* but STILL.\n\nannoying as fuck.\n\n She already chews the loudest out of all our family members so I avoid her for that when shes eating- I dont want to have to avoid her more bc she makes more triggers.\n\nBc shes like. a decent person and i dont mind hanging out w her, triggers aside. i actually want to have like. a decent sibling relationship w her and i dont want this to ruin that...\n\ni dont see much of her anyway so avoiding her when around triggers is going to make me see her even less and its just sad...\n\nfuck. i hate this shit.", "send_replies": true,

I\u2019m going through is really misophonia, it sounds like it from what I\u2019ve read but if it isn\u2019t I apologize for posting here. I don\u2019t know how common it is where you live, but in my small European country there is a church in every village, and they all have churchbells that ring extremely loudly at any time of day. Some time ago I moved to a village across the street from a church. It\u2019s churchbells ring every 15 minutes, and they keep going for longer every full hour. And several times a day, sometimes three times, sometimes more (today it was at 7am, 12, 16, 18 and will ring again at 20) it will go on for five to fifteen minutes straight. I live across the street from it.\n\nAt first it didn\u2019t seem to bother me, sometimes it was annoying but I could tune it out. And then I got an ear infection, which made my ears hurt horribly. What made it worse was any at all loud noise. And there is a loud noise around me that I literally can\u2019t shut off or escape or drown out, every fifteen minutes. I was in so much pain almost constantly for around two weeks, it felt like the worst migraine possible with my brain being sawed in half. \n\nI moved away from home for some time last year, but this year I\u2019m back and it\u2019s quarantine so I\u2019m almost always at home, and this sound makes me feel awful. I have so much anxiety. I can sit through it when it\u2019s going on for a couple of seconds, but when it\u2019s going on for five or more minutes multiple times a day I have to stop what I\u2019m doing and I just feel terrible.\n\nI sleep with earplugs in, and this helps me not wake up because of it at seven in the morning. I don\u2019t know what I can do during the day though. I bought noise cancelling headphones yesterday, but it was a faulty pair, and they really aren\u2019t much help with high-frequency noises anyway. I have to turn the volume way up to not hear it, and if I keep doing it literally every day it\u2019s going to be damaging to my ears and that\u2019s the last thing I want. Today I couldn\u2019t finish cooking, I had to stop and run to my room to get headphones cause I didn\u2019t have them on me, and wait it out.

She then started this whole argument about how I should stop feeling that way (which I can\u2019t) and how I should get therapy (which I know won\u2019t really help because we know so little about Misophonia) and I explained that it wouldn\u2019t work very well.

Out of all of the people in my house I would have expected her to understand the most because she said I might have it and she said she did research on it. She makes me so mad. I feel so hopeless and misunderstood. I want her to understand more than anyone else in the house because she\u2019s my sister and I love her and look up to her. I skipped dinner because she wouldn\u2019t stop (which I never do because I love eating dinner with my family). And I\u2019ve been really bitter for the rest of the day which I can\u2019t help.

Then my little sister started getting these huge glasses of water and gulping them as loud as she can. I had a friend over a few days ago and my little sister was watching us play a game and she went to get some water and she came back up and was drinking it in my ear *gulp* *gulp* *crunch* (she was also eating the ice) I yelled at her. Not very loudly and I told her to leave. She glared at me and then stomped downstairs. This week I discovered new triggers (so fun) because my step dad has gained a new habit of always sucking the air between his teeth (if that makes sense) and slurping anything he drinks. He hasn\u2019t noticed how I react to these triggers yet and I know if I say something he\u2019s going to make a huge argument about it and I don\u2019t want that. Then today at dinner my mom started scraping her teeth on her fork (which is my worst trigger and makes me want to scream) and anytime I flinch she normally tries to stop which I\u2019m thankful for but today she had her back turned to me(idk if it was on purpose or not but I think it was) and then my step dad started eating and it was EXTRA loud for some reason today. It got to the point where I had to ask my mom if I could listen to music which I never do because I love eating dinner and talking to my family and hearing about their day (but I hate the triggers).

For me, I HAVE to tell him he's chewing loud, yes ik its rude to tell people that but idgaf. He's chewing loud, so if he wants me to eat with him at the table, he needs to close his fucking mouth.

I'm done eating next to him, every time I try I end up pissing him off, and he tells me to stop telling him. Idk if any of you feel the same way, like if you hear someone chewing loud you have to speak up. \n\nI have had many fights with my family over this shit. Today, I was eating and my dad said \"you don't need to tell me that every time\" and I said \"I actually do tho\" and he fucking told me \"you're not mental, it isn't something you have to do.\" He won't let me eat in my room because of mice, so where tf do I go to eat.  I've tried to use other disorders that he would understand a little better to explain, like OCD or synesthesia, but he tells me it isn't the same. My mom says that if it's neurological she wants to take me to a neurologist sometime, but for now I can't tell them to stop eating loud.\n\nI think they think it's something I can just get over. I get it, I shouldn't tell them they are chewing loud because it's rude. But I literally HAVE to, unless they want me to storm off and avoid them completely. I tried to tell them it isn't my fault I have it, even if it's \"rare\".

This title is long and weird, but I\u2019ll try to explain it.\n\nI\u2019m not good at articulating words, and english isn\u2019t my native language, so forgive me for any mistakes.\n \nFor some context, I\u2019m a 14 year old boy and I\u2019m on the end of my vacation, where I\u2019m staying in my grandparents\u2019 home (winter vacation is only one month long where I live).\n\nSo. In the end of June I came to my grandparents\u2019 home for many reasons, the main of which are that I love being around my grandparents (your average retired grandpa and grandma who lives in the kitchen), and that I hate even thinking about my stepfather (he is the font of most of my triggers).\n\nI spent the whole month of July here, and even though I knew my grandpa would trigger me, I prefer having 2 or 3 triggers instead of 20 or so at home. I\u2019m more of an introvert so I\u2019m really uncomfortable looking at someone\u2019s face and talking about what I feel, so I opted for walking away when he started with his triggering noises (drinking, eating and cleaning teeth)\nThankfully he noticed it and was kind of understanding about it, but he didn\u2019t notice the teeth cleaning trigger, and still does it. I feel like he won\u2019t notice it, and I want to tell him about it but can\u2019t find a not awkward way to do it.\n\nSecond thing is: my mom wants me to return home when my classes start (online classes of course), and I refused (especially because of my stepfather), but she keeps acting up and making drama about it, and saying she \u201cis going to pick me up no matter what\u201d. Yesterday she called me on FaceTime and tried to convince me to return, but I cut her off and told her that she wouldn\u2019t convince me with her lame excuses, and dragged her to end the conversation. Just before I hung up I saw tears in her face. I immediately regretted being rude and still feel really sad remembering but don\u2019t think she would understand that I want to stay here otherwise.\n\nShe knows about my misophonia (my grandparents don\u2019t) and even allowed me to not have meals with them but other than that, she usually blamed ME for being \u201crude\u201d to my stepfather.\n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do in both situations.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 1741, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I don\u2019t know how to tell my grandpa that he triggers me and I don\u2019t want to go back home", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/hxzl21/i_dont_know_how_to_tell_my_grandpa_that_he/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "smorez1126", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5kotssnh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595729106, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/hxyq1x/total_noise_cancelling_earplugs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hxyq1x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/hxyq1x/total_noise_cancelling_earplugs/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1595729117, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello there, fellow Misophonians!

After that he started hacking loogies about 5 - 10 times a day.  I asked him about it and he told me that he's been getting incredible mucus build up and that he has to do that in order to breathe.\n\nOnce lockdown hit that 5 - 10 times day morphed into MULTIPLE TIMES A MINUTE.  And it isn't just a polite \\*AHEM\\* \\*AHEM\\* throat clearing.  The man does it in the most guttural, visceral way imaginable and it's so loud that wearing ear plugs or headphones with music does nothing because I can hear him do it from all the way across the house.  I even heard him doing it from across the street one time.    \n\n\nI've explained to him how grating the sound is, and he initially agreed to try to cut down and find help for his mucus build up problem but since then has simply denied that he does it that often.  It interrupts my train of thought whenever he does it, which is bad enough since I already have severe ADHD.  It screwed me up on my final projects and studies towards the end of my last semester of college because I didn't have the option of going anywhere else due to fucking lockdown.  Nobody wants to come over because of it, and even people I talk to in discord VC have complained about it.  He also does this shit when he's on discord with his friends and even on the phone with his boss / graduate advisor who for whatever reason have not called him about it.   \n\n\nI will be moving out shortly because I cannot take this anymore, and it really has started to push me back into the \"learned helplessness\" state that has screwed my life over multiple times in the past.

doesn\u2019t understand and it drives me nuts. I am 97% sure that I have Misophonia. I have done research and educated myself ever since I was told that I might have it and I\u2019m pretty sure that I do. I started having trigger noises around the age of 12. Some of my trigger noises include chewing, crunching, slurping, and ESPECIALLY the sound of teeth scraping on a fork or plate. It\u2019s very hard eating dinner with my family because they make these noises EVERY SECOND that they can. Anytime I bring this up (which I don\u2019t very often because I know how it\u2019ll end up, I also don\u2019t think that they realize just how much and how hard it is for me to say nothing about it) my mom makes fun of me and one day when I told her to \u201cplease stop\u201d (which is what I always say when I bring it up and I try to do it as polite as possible) she grabbed her fork put it on her teeth and continued to scrape them on it over and over until I ran upstairs with my eyes full of tears because I was so mad. When I bring it up to my step dad (which I try not to do anymore) he\u2019ll start saying things like \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d \u201cwhat\u2019s the problem\u201d or stuff like that and then I\u2019ll tell him that it\u2019s fine and never mind but he continues to make an argument out of it, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t bring it up to him anymore. When I bring it up to my dad he tries to stop which I really appreciate but lately when I bring it up he\u2019s been ignoring me. What probably hurts the most because I look up to her and want her approval so bad is how my sister reacts. When I tell her to please stop she responds by rolling her eyes, yelling at me and telling me how selfish I am. She was the one who brought up the fact that I might have Misophonia to. At dinner I\u2019ll plug my ears and then when my step dad sees me plugging my ears he\u2019ll either ignore it or start an argument with me. Everyone else will ignore it. It\u2019s very hard because I like to have conversations with my family at dinner but it\u2019s really hard when I can\u2019t hear them. Its also hard to eat because I\u2019ll have to time it perfectly. I understand how hard it must be for them but I just wish that they would ATTEMPT to stop or TRY to understand me yet the only person who does is my dad and he is beginning to ignore me about it. Anyway I\u2019m sorry this was so long. I left a lot out but it would be helpful if I could get some advice. Am I being selfish? Am I expecting to much from my family? How do I make them understand? Also is there anyway that you can get diagnosed with Misophonia? I\u2019ve looked it up but I never get an answer so if someone could answer that that would be amazing, again I\u2019m sorry that this was so long but thanks for the advice!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 1724, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I\u2019m new and need advice", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/hqvtsi/im_new_and_need_advice/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "-absinthe_", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3vi2nw0o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594680485, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/hqpnv3/i_want_to_murder_my_family/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hqpnv3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#b209d6", "link_flair_css_class": "venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "9420fff0-4011-11e9-bb6e-0eef35d07208", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/hqpnv3/i_want_to_murder_my_family/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1594680516, "score": 1, "selftext": "Ok not really.

It sounds like a mofo Honda Civic for crying out loud. It makes her look like an arrogant asshole. Even my dad doesn\u2019t like it. Nobody likes it but her!\n\nEven worse, I usually see her every other weekend, and it\u2019s nearly impossible to avoid her. \n\nI need some help.

My poor sister thought I hated her when we were kids because I would run screaming into my bedroom at dinner time because she was \"eating too loud\".  My parents just called me a selfish brat.

These are just things that have happened in the past because of misophonia. Hopefully this doesn\u2019t get removed. (Basically a vent post because I don\u2019t know what to do anymore). Please no harsh comments or threats against me, it doesn\u2019t help things at all. Thanks. This post may get a bit intense, if you\u2019re sensitive to certain things then maybe don\u2019t read. \n\nHearing certain triggers for too long makes me incredibly angry. I\u2019ve posted here before about my triggers, basically the main ones are barking and babies crying but bird noises and mouth sounds also bother me. \n\nUsually I\u2019ll develop a panic attack after awhile, but sometimes I just turn into full on anger and want to OBLITERATE whatever is making the sound. If it\u2019s someone making weird mouth noises then I almost want to scream at them to stop. \n\nIf it\u2019s animal noises, then I become even more enraged. A few years ago I fed my mom\u2019s pet bird to one of her cats because it was so noisy and my brain was actually beginning to shut down. It felt like I wasn\u2019t myself anymore. Her and my dad were really pissed. I told her for months on end how the bird\u2019s constant screaming and squawking was putting me in a 24/7 cycle of distress and depression because I always had to listen to it. She didn\u2019t care. She knew about my hearing issues before she bought the bird, and she still bought it regardless. She knew full well how loud birds are and how it affects me. \n\nOne day I just snapped and that was it. When she found out the cat ate it because of me she was yelling for awhile after that and finally just said \u201cI don\u2019t understand you.\u201d \n\nMy boyfriend at the time broke up with me because he said he was scared of what I did. Said some shit about how psychopaths murder small animals before moving on to humans. Oh great! Now I scare people apparently AND I\u2019m a psychopath on my way to becoming a serial killer. LMAO. Except, what he didn\u2019t realize was that I didn\u2019t kill the animal out of pleasure, I did it out of rage and frustration. I don\u2019t fucking sit here and torture animals for fun. I had no intention of torturing that bird to death. It died instantly. \n\nThere was also a time where my mom\u2019s cat was sitting in the hallway meowing loudly for no reason, constantly. I got so angry and fed up (meowing triggers me) that I grabbed the cat by the shoulders really hard and threw it outside. I didn\u2019t realize in my rage how hard I grabbed it until it started meowing as if it were crying for help and that it was hurt. I instantly started crying really badly and ran into my room. I felt bad and just wanted to end myself because I couldn\u2019t deal with life anymore. I tried overdosing that day on some painkillers but my mom wouldn\u2019t give them to me. She was worried. I just sat in my room and cried. \n\nThere are a number of other instances that happened which I won\u2019t say here. \n\nOver the years I\u2019ve tried to cope, but it hasn\u2019t gotten much better. The next boyfriend broke up with me as well because he couldn\u2019t deal with me anymore. My anxiety and hearing issues ruined the relationship. We were also being emotionally abusive towards eachother. It was a rough break up. It didn\u2019t really affect him, but I was left to figure it out on my own since I had next to no support during the whole thing. Took me over a year to actually begin to get over it. I don\u2019t date anymore or make close friends since no one can really tolerate it once they actually get to know me. I also just can\u2019t do a lot of basic everyday things because of my triggers, so even if I did have friends irl I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything with them. \n\nIt\u2019s really hard because people like me and think I\u2019m friendly, but I can\u2019t explain my misophonia since I\u2019m embarrassed by it. I also fear of being judged for things I\u2019ve done in the past. I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to besides a couple of online friends, but I don\u2019t want to scare them away. I live alone, I work alone, I don\u2019t hang out with anyone or go anywhere irl. It\u2019s a lonely life. \n\nAm I the only one that gets this aggressive when hearing triggers? I know a lot of people get extremely angry when it comes to mouth noises, but for me it\u2019s more so with other triggers. \n\nThis is all just so damn frustrating and it\u2019s ruining my entire fucking life. I feel like an empty shell of a person most days because the constant sense of hopelessness of never being normal is always lingering in the back of my mind. I envy people who can go out and do normal people things everyday. I can\u2019t even go to the damn grocery store or go for a walk without having constant anxiety and sometimes even full blown panic attacks. I just stay indoors constantly, playing instruments and video games because I don\u2019t know what else to do.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 1634, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Does hearing a trigger bring on violent thoughts?

I decided to sit in the middle of my parents who are really disgusting when it comes to eating. Or so I think. And to make things worst we were eating soup.i think is one of the worst foods in the world in terms of triggers. So in an effort to block out the noises I put headphones on and start blaring music. Which didn\u2019t help but it was something I guess. They then proceed to yell saying I\u2019m going to spill the bowl on myself if I don\u2019t turn it off while getting even closer towards me as if we weren\u2019t close enough. They have no idea that misophonia even exists and so when I say please stop and eat your food like a civilised person. They start laughing knowing I haven\u2019t slept in days and I\u2019ve been feeling really anxious with everything that has been going on in the world at the moment.

His tics were mainly nasal sounds and sometimes really aggressive behavior. Luckily during puberty his tourettes got very mild. The only thing that stayed were his nasal sounds. I don't know exactly how to describe them, but it's like sniffling every few seconds.\nOver the years I've gotten used to it and block these sounds out most of the time. But over the holidays, when he was home, he started to clear his throat constantly. Even he suspects it to be a new tic.\nBoth of these sounds trigger my misophonia heavily. Family dinners around the holidays were extremely stressful and I just feel extremely bad.\nI know my brother can't do anything about it. I know very much that he can't stop or suppress it. But I don't know how to deal with it.\nMy brother doesn't know about my misophonia and I'm scared that if I talk to him about it, he will think I'm being inconsiderate. And I also don't think he will take me very seriously and just say I'm being sensitive.\nI don't know what to do because I know that neither his tics, my misophonia or family dinners will stop.

Misophonia adds to this stress because now I have to eat and sleep with someone else - two things I hate the most. \n\nAnyway, I live in a third floor apartment, meaning that I have downstairs neighbors. The floor is creaky and does make some sound when anybody walks. But, I feel like my boyfriend\u2019s walking is so heavy and loud. I\u2019ve asked him to try to be considerate because we have downstairs neighbors, I\u2019ve asked him to stop stomping, I asked him to try to walk softer or quieter. His response is, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being fat\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s just how I walk. I try to be wary of stomping but it\u2019s just how I walk.\u201d \n\nTo see if it was just in my head, I started paying attention to how I walked and what sounds the floor made when I walked. Not as loud. Of course then I was like, ok well I am a bit lighter than him. But I had a friend over who is taller and heavier than my boyfriend and when he was walking around, it wasn\u2019t loud. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.

Whenever I politely tell her to either lower her voice or at least talk without speakerphone on, she either ignores me or tells me to shut up and go away. \n\nI cant put headphones on because I'm afraid of her busting down my door for something. I take walks but it's getting tougher by the day because the weather is dropping to very low temperatures and everything is getting icy and dangerous to walk on. I have no car or no friends to hang out with. \n\nHer loudness triggers me to no end - it feels as though my brain is about to explode, like daggers are digging into my head, and like static is buzzing in my eardrums. It gets to the point where I feel like screaming and banging my head on the wall. My autism also makes these feelings less bearable. \n\nPlease I need some advice or something. I'm 17 and I'm not sure if I'll be moving out when I turn 18 which is this June. She's super drunk and violent right now and she has been loudly talking on speakerphone for the past 6 hours.

"retrieved_on": 1608404736, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello! I thought I'd come in with some experience here, and an honest review, as I haven't seen too many comprehensive ones on here. I'll probably crosspost it, because I think some of these thoughts might have helped me when I was first looking at them.  \nAfter suffering with crippling misophonia, hyperacusis and auditory processing disorder for most of my life, I have to say I was really excited to try these. I got a pair of the originals. I really gave them a good go, but I could really feel them in there and tbh I found it really hard to tolerate them long enough to notice a difference - I have really small ears, and they were hurting me, quite a bit actually. I couldn't really leave them in long enough to notice any difference. So I gave up on them, and didn't think about them again for a while. Was worth a shot, to me.\n\nI didn't think about them again until I saw that they brought out two new versions - a 'mini' version and a 'night' version. I got one of each, as an experiment, as I'm pretty desperate at the minute. Lockdown means everything is super quiet where I live and so even small noises are like gunshots to my ears. They arrived quickly, and well packaged - I am in the UK though, and they are a UK company. They each came with a little bag, and full instructions, really clear.\n\nFirst impressions:\n\nCalmer Night - they are really, really comfortable. They are soft and a bit squishy, like a rubber band, and they took a while to wriggle into place, but that might be because they were the first of the new two that I tried, I'm much more comfortable poking them in now. I wore those outside mostly when I tried them first - it's a really significant memory for me as suddenly, I could hear so much clearer, instead of being overwhelmed by all the background noise. I tried sitting in a pub with my partner to eat - for the first time in a long time, I could really focus on him, and not on the surrounding tables of other people eating. I really, really like them. It's nice to feel a little bit more 'normal'.  \nCalmer Mini - They are definitely much more comfortable to go in, they are super small and once they go in, I can't feel them there and barely need to adjust them, and so the audio experience has been really surreal for me. I'm sat at home right now wearing them, and I am not at all 'triggered' by my usual sounds - my poor boyfriend eating, breathing, listening to music (even with his headphones on) , the phone vibrating or making any noise, or the sounds in a video game. Everything feels nice and chill. I keep having moments where I am looking up and around me, taking everything in. I'm not wrapping my hoodie around my head or cringing from noises. It's going pretty good. Obviously it's only been a couple of days, but I can definitely tell these are working - it was an instant difference to me, unlike the original ones, which I couldn't wear long enough to work out if they helped or not.\n\nSome things to consider:  \nThe fitting of them is everything. I have really small ears and I think my ear canals must be shaped a bit strangely, because no matter how many times I tried to fit them with the instructions, I couldn't make them feel like they weren't going to fall out. I found a technique, and I've not seen anyone else mention it, but when I put them in, I place them in, as per the instructions, but then I use the round, non-grabby end of a pair of tweezers to slot inside the open end of the bud, and very gently push them in, and 'back' towards the back of my head, gently using the side of the tweezers to press against the tragus part of my ear, to slightly 'open' my ear and the Calmer bud can slot in. When that happens, it pops in perfectly. If you've ever used a mooncup, it's an ever so slightly similar sensation :)\n\nWear time - I can't wear them all day. They do ache after quite a while, so not sure if that's something that I will get used to. But for a few hours when I'm sat in the house or at work with surrounding noise, my god, a sanity saviour. I work in film, and being able to sit in the edit with these on under my headphones, is delightful. Just being able to pop them in before I am subject to listening to mic pops and clicks. As an experiment, I tried listening to an ASMR video with them in, something that would previously make me scream or cry.  \nI cried listening to the first one. But only because I could hear new noises that I'd not previously experienced as tolerable. I listened to a couple more.  \nYep, can see why those are a thing. Fun, when it's not horrible!\n\nThe 'ick' factor. After a while, these definitely feel waxy, and occasionally itchy after a super long time. I don't know if it's my system reacting to something new, but you definitely notice a slightly 'squelchier' feeling after a while. Weirdly this is more with the night ones over the mini ones, I wonder if it's because they are softer and maybe rub a bit more. In any case, I have a little pot to put them in after use and clean with water, because I can't just put them back in my head after sitting out with wax on them.\n\nTo summarise:  \nI don't really enjoy not having these in, TBH. I love them. Because of the reasons I mentioned earlier, I'm unable to have them in for all my waking hours (I don't suffer at night) and I really hope I can train my ears to be fine with them in. If I could have surgery to experience life like this, I would. I'm glad to have both the Night and the Mini - I think I'll keep alternating depending on the situation. For example, if I only need to wear them for a short time, I'd go for the mini. I definitely think they are slightly better, possibly because they are firmer, they feel like they are holding their shape better inside my ear and (I know this sounds crazy) tunnelling the right noises into my head.  \nIf I need them in longer, I'd go for the night ones. Still noticeably helping a lot, and I'm hoping the waxiness goes away. I'm nervous about pushing this new wax further into my head but I'm keeping an eye on it, and trying not to use cotton buds - it feels waxy but you can get really obsessed wiping that all away and it's good not to, it's there to protect you.

Matt is just out of high school but he\u2019s already lived through a lot of darkness and pain brought on by his misophonia, having effects on family, friends, school, work, and ultimately culminating in a hospitalization last year to treat his mental health. Matt now has close friends that help him, his family supports him and he is driven to use his pain to help other young people who are also suffering from mental health issues. We even have some good laughs throughout our conversation. I just exchanged messages with Matt last night and he is excited to get his story out and hopes it helps others who may be suffering in silence. \n\nListen to our full conversation anywhere you get podcasts and at   \n[https://misophoniapodcast.com](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmisophoniapodcast.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3yfpsSJQF847YwKdhyH9VpmoSW2M02wqKquNg3SBE4io_-ycQHk53HLds&amp;h=AT0JApvuNPR0oV6ib4Kudi0yfv50fvaZtCpA1cki8tmxc3W-OMcRLPLFDzNLkfs5-k_H9CN4IAFXtWSdq8DHFX6J0HHLCBN_S4WfVIyWCj47RWvGagOn354SHHWys_AHQ5RXQTw&amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;c[0]=AT1Fu9M2OPCp4LZrxLYSyR8Rm9ehL6lbiN54mpw0xmXrIgg2NGsJqzZ1P3JejMT34mbM76oyReqgG8JoAUTzbrMnoklTWNLW3ODFmW0hxCYm9XKHw7pfKi_O35EwLb4a7WJ87a65VCDtX3UZDYeZeQM9_3VLxiIdqbVJzRSVdRSysGantaH0OutHewgOxwjgM6hROTK1qhEBK-Vyv2OpT9NqHPrGwo5rfg)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2228, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "\"Pain is sadly the greatest teacher\" - Matt - S3 Ep11", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/keco9s/pain_is_sadly_the_greatest_teacher_matt_s3_ep11/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "redeyedangell", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8tpxax00", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1608129459, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/keabmx/i_finally_understand_my_mother/", "gildings": {}, "id": "keabmx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/keabmx/i_finally_understand_my_mother/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1608129470, "score": 1, "selftext": "when i was a small child, i lacked manners (as a lot of kids do). i chewed loudly and with my mouth open. this would drive my mom insane... at first she would nicely try to teach me but as a stubborn kid i didn\u2019t understand why i can\u2019t eat the way i want. she would get fed up and eventually loose it. she would yell and take my dinner away from me and send me to my room. maybe her reaction wasn\u2019t the best considering she is a parent, but god. now i understand. as i grew up my Misophonia set in and chewing/slurping sounds fill me with rage!!!

I'm not sure how to do it this time because every time I try to talk to her about it she becomes unresponsive. My parents have become desperate and I want to help her as well because it is beginning to take an emotional toll on them.\n\nI have explained what it is to my parents but they still don't quite understand the concept completely and would end up confused when she would lash out on them or avoid/ignore them. Over time this resulted in her wearing earbuds 100% of the time with her music in full blast and never acknowledging their existence (which is another concern of theirs).\n\nSimply put, I want help to figure out an effective way to bring it up and offer her options in a way that she doesn't feel too \"attacked\".

Since I was in kindergarten, loud music annoyed me a lot and I didn't use to participate in anything involving singing with the other kids (but I guess that a big part of that was that I was socially anxious, though I started crying and covering my ears because I hated the volume of the damn songs). Anyway, that got better for years, but about six years ago I started to hate my parents' voices because even if they didn't speak loud, any humming or talking or laughing wouldn't let me sleep. It started to get worse and worse. It gives me palpitations. I can stand almost any other noise (I hate some repetitive noises and the sounds of some letters, but not as badly as this, maybe because usually when people eat, they are done an hour later or less, or because I get to get away from those sounds, but I can get tf out of my house) but their voices. The thing is that I think that because of all the stress they've put on me for years, I'm starting to hate other sounds because I just can't rest well so i feel like my ears are more sensitive to sound. It's not that they cause me pain, it's that if I hear them, I just lose focus or can't sleep. I am not sure if this is because I am anxious and sort of depressed and I just need to get away from reality but their voices bring me back, or if it is because I have a problem. All I know is that this is making my life miserable. I haven't slept well in almost a month and I don't know what to do. They don't seem to understand that even if they don't speak loudly, what I need is silence (well, i can't tell. Them to shut up) and I also hate the stupid TV noise even if it's not loud. Or their music. Or them distracting me from anything. I don't hate my parents. I have a great relationship with my mother and with my dad it's usually bad but rn is alright. It's just that I can't stand how their talking or their music or TV even if at a low volume disrupts my whole life. They think I'm being difficult, but I swear this makes me sick.

I've always been overly sensitive to repetitive noises (car alarms, smoke alarms, clocks ticking etc.) to the point that they sometimes give me a physiological reaction. I'll tense up or my heart will race, along with an emotional response where I just get distressed and upset. However, since the pandemic started and I've been confined to my home most of the time with my roommate, my sensitivity has expanded to include noises that people make.\n\nMy roommate is objectively a noisier person than normal person. She chews with her mouth open and smacks her lips, slurps her tea/coffee and makes sighing sounds after, makes exaggerated long \"chooos\"  after she sneezes, stomps really loudly, blows her nose frequently with a loud vibrating technique that eludes me to how she achieves it, makes this weird long nasally sucking/spitting sound I've never heard before (sometimes while I'm eating), talks on the phone with her friends really loudly and just makes weird laughs/snorts/sing songy voices. You get the point.\n\nWe've been living together for over two years and generally have a pretty good relationship aside from the spring (during first lockdown) we got pretty testy with each other. In addition to her initial reluctance to take covid seriously and us having different cleanliness standards, I think the core issue was that her noises and habits were starting to trigger frustration and eventually resentment in me. Normally I'm the type of person who likes to be straight forward and upfront with people when there's conflict, but how do you tell someone that you generally respect and get along with that their seemingly innocuous mannerisms in their own home are causing you serious mental anguish.\n\nWith winter approaching and a second lockdown just announced in my area, I'm starting to lose it again. Living on my own is not an option as I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world and am trying to save for my own new home while paying off my student debt. Aside from her noisy habits this is generally an ideal living situation.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience or advice with how to approach this issue with someone you're close to without upsetting them? Or should I just work on ways to cope with it on my own since I'm overly sensitive?\n\nThank you in advance", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2174, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Coping During Lockdown with a Loud Roommate (advice/rant)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jyzowo/coping_during_lockdown_with_a_loud_roommate/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "METALLlCA", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_10trvx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606033332, "domain": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jysaqb/i_dont_know_how_to_meme_but_i_thought_of_this/", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jysaqb/i_dont_know_how_to_meme_but_i_thought_of_this/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jysaqb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": true, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffb000", "link_flair_css_class": "memes", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "599aa532-3f82-11e9-a9e0-0e7dd40beff6", "link_flair_text": "Memes", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jysaqb/i_dont_know_how_to_meme_but_i_thought_of_this/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "hosted:video", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "l2n5ZF7UTp8JxFL2JOh_BmCwTD-3Vod2_uBDXrMCHX0", "resolutions": [{"height": 56, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/LbPnw1YV5y2SnfW3hdOYk108fyS2D8CNjcE8mE-kBCA.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74484f4b49493463584758411f7a06375051a6e0", "width": 108}, {"height": 112, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/LbPnw1YV5y2SnfW3hdOYk108fyS2D8CNjcE8mE-kBCA.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65a1dfb92a09cdb35d1d6ac859c1f5e98dcdffe6", "width": 216}, {"height": 166, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/LbPnw1YV5y2SnfW3hdOYk108fyS2D8CNjcE8mE-kBCA.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1580ceb967100d281ef7c1b7f9453ec7024e8109", "width": 320}, {"height": 332, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/LbPnw1YV5y2SnfW3hdOYk108fyS2D8CNjcE8mE-kBCA.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58584b9c99fcec372ec489d8b0b91d1453cbd5e0", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 332, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/LbPnw1YV5y2SnfW3hdOYk108fyS2D8CNjcE8mE-kBCA.png?format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2b489174e9a37bb82cd3b382d7c76d6cb77cb9e", "width": 640}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1606033343, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2171, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WwRzQoLdVIYJ-YWLER5hfoN4DP0Hty4GgM1GIhj5aUM.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 72, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "I don\u2019t know how to meme, but I thought of this scene today when my wife handed me her earbuds to console me while out dining at a Tex-Mex restaurant.

I never noticed it for 18 years of living with her, and it doesn\u2019t even bother me all the time.

I\u2019ve only let it get the best of me twice in the past 5 months, once I just had to get up and go to my room and close the door and put music on, and once I said something to her like \u201cwhy do you keep sniffing over and over?\u201d to which she had a negative reaction. Recently, school has been stressful and along with that the noise has started driving me crazy too. Is there anything you guys can recommend or that I can do to try and cope with it?

My dad clears his throat and it\u2019s so fucking obnoxious!! It doesn\u2019t even sound like a human clearing their throat, it sounds like some kind of animal!! And every time I\u2019m in an area where I can hear it he clears his throat! I truly don\u2019t think he cares about the amount of pain it causes me and that I\u2019ve wanted to kill myself because of it. He\u2019s extremely insensitive to it and tells *me* to be nice to *him* when my own fucking brain is going haywire and I freak out. Misophonia is a physical condition with the brain that not I or anyone else with this condition can help. It destroys relationships and makes life absolutely  miserable. I have a dentist appointment in a couple of weeks and I have to go there with my dad and I\u2019m fucking terrified. I hate being triggered. I am so scared to even be near my dad and I\u2019m freaking out about having to be in a car with him where he\u2019ll clear his throat and then play the victim. I can\u2019t fucking help it, and I would give anything to not have this life destroying condition. I cannot stress enough what I would give to not have misophonia. My dad has accused me of faking it, despite the fact that I have a recorded diagnosis. I have tried so hard to not let certain sounds bother me.

I've been having kind of a hard week, and feeling frustrated with my living situation. I was wondering if anyone would have any stories to share to give me a little bit of a boost/hope. Here's a little about me:\n\nI'm 31F, been living with my parents ever since undergrad for the past \\~ 10 years. I'm very thankful to them for their support, and at the same time I've been hoping to move out in the last couple of years to have personal space. However, I have OCD which made it challenging, and misophonia is a relatively new issue for me, probably brought on by stress from work in the last \\~ 2 years. With the arrival of COVID my OCD symptoms got pretty severe, however I was able to go through a residential treatment program, and significantly improved. Funny enough, and as to be expected with misophonia, the sounds that triggered me at home (loud eating/door slamming etc) did not bother me at the residential treatment. But anyway, which brings me to today. I'm working on getting a job, but meanwhile I'm at home most of the time. I've been struggling to get out of bed, in part to not wanting to be around my parents and hear triggering noises. My father's chronic coughing sends me into rage/disgust. My mother is an early riser and so I hear her moving around the apartment starting from \\~7am, and I'm starting to dread mornings. I keep telling myself that I can work on things step by step and move out in the next year or so, but I'm just feeling stuck right now, both in my brain and at home.\n\nI should mention the things I do that help me are 1 hr walks every day, meditation, and active noise cancelling headphones. Anyway, I just wanted to hear people's successful moving out stories, since I'm not feeling super hopeful right now.

The previous person who I worked with would cough really loud and it would literally jolt me out of my chair. After he ate lunch he would cough every 25 seconds for hours until his food settled.

Everything was perfect for most of the time and I didn't have many triggers while being at home, but recently the sister has bought herself a TV and put it right against the wall (she lives in the room next to me). The bass easily bleeds through the thin walls in the house and most of the time I can hear what the person in the movie is saying. It is really irritating me and causing me to avoid spending time in my room. Sleeping is also a problem, because even though I wear earplugs to bed since I was a child, I can still hear the sound through them and I find myself looking for it even more than normally. I will soon be going back to school which means waking up at 5AM and if I won't be able to sleep because of the damn TV I will be a zombie the next day.\n\nI became obsessed with the sound and convinced myself that it's the worst thing that can ever happen. I began having thoughts that she does this on purpose just to fuck with me, which degraded our relationship even further. I have even began looking for new apartments, even though I really don't want to move and live alone.\n\nI have tried talking to her and told her to lower the volume a few times, but she doesn't really care for it and even when she turns it down, the volume goes back up the next day. We have a weird relationship and I don't think she'd go out of her way for me in this case.\n\nSo, this brings me to the question - if she doesn't want to collaborate, how can I cope with this trigger mentally? Maybe anyone had a similar problem and found ways to deal with it?

I my parents found him through the consular I was exempt from seeing after I aged out of my parent's insurance earlier this year. They will be paying out of pocket for him which shows that they very much want me to get better. I am more than grateful to have them helping me out with this. One thing my parents suggested for me about this consular is that they would like for me to go to group therapy.\n\nThe thing is that my major most misophonic noise trigger is southern accents (which is ironic considering that I live in the south and have my entire life. I would move but I don't know anyone on a personal level who live outside of it that I could use as an emergency contact incase I am in a situation where I would need one) and having to hear them from the people in the group therapy might be more damaging for me than helpful. My dad said that I will have to get used to having to hear the speaking of other people. I wonder if group therapy is something my new consular suggested or that my parents suggested on their own.\n\nMy dad also told me that studies have shown that the more I isolate myself from sound, the more sensitive I can become to it. For example, a massive sporting goods store opened up right outside of the building I live in earlier last month. They have an outdoor track/courtyard area where they play music loud enough that I can still hear it even with my windows closed shut. The noise makes me so stressed that I have sometimes have to wear construction headphones in my own living space. The managers of the building say there is NOTHING they can do about the store playing overly loud music.\n\nAnyways, I told my dad that I have heard that exposing yourself to the sounds that trigger my misphonia could actually do be worse for me. This made my dad rather irate. I probably should have kept that to myself, but I was also having to agree and say okay to a bunch of other things he has said that I don't think are totally true. He told me that I need to \"believe in myself\" and to \"not listen to what all of these other people say\".\n\nTo be honest, I would rather go by the word of people who actually are more educated in misophonia than people who are believing in things just so they can somehow make the bad situation end quicker. The \"believe in myself\" phrase made me think he might have been trying to make be believe I believe in the same thing he does about this or making this situation not seem as complicated as it truly is (somewhat like gaslighting). Maybe he didn't know what to say at that time because he was so angry.\n\nWill group therapy actually be helpful? It would be better if it text chat based as opposed to forcing myself to hear the same things I hear EVERY SINGLE DAY that can bring me to a meltdown. Has anyone else done group therapy as a means to treat misophonia? Is it effective or damaging?

to ignore.\n\nMy dad is one of my biggest triggers. He finally understands a bit about miso, but will still get angry with me at times because of it. Mostly because he thinks that I purposely get triggered by him more than others because I don't like him or something, when, in reality, it's just because he makes the most trigger noises. Spending any time with him gives me so much anxiety because if he does make a trigger noise, I can't tell him because he'll get angry. That's the reason why I spend so much more time with my mom, because she actually stops when I ask her to. But he takes this as another sign that I hate him.\n\nBut none of this is the reason my relationship with him is just awful. At the beginning of this year, he developed a &gt;!cough!&lt; from what was probably bronchitis. That wasn't a huge trigger for me at first, but it quickly became one. I gathered up the courage and finally asked him to please go to the doctor. He was surprisingly nice about it and I thought he would. Nope. This past year my dad got super into being anti-mask and anti-vaxx and this apparently spread to being anti-doctor. In other words, he refused to see a doctor and instead tried to treat it with some vitamin C. Unsurprisingly, this didn't work and he continued with the trigger. At this point, I was probably suffering more than I had ever before in my life. It was constant and never-ending (I share a bedroom wall and he would still &gt;!cough!&lt; in his sleep). It was torture. I couldn't do anything that didn't involve a high volume of white noise. For example, I couldn't watch movies on my TV or have conversations when he was home (which was basically all day). It was honestly one of worst periods of my life. Finally I got the courage to ask again, and was very happy that he didn't yell at me. But once again, he didn't go and nothing changed. \n\nA few months later and the trigger is finally gone, but I just can't forgive him. What he did hurt me so much and he did nothing to stop it. I love him, but I think our relationship has never been weaker. And he's realized. I don't spend time with him ever and don't even really talk to him if I don't have to. But he doesn't know why this happened. He doesn't realize the extent to which he hurt me and I know if I try to tell him why, he'll get defensive and angry at me. It doesn't seem worth it for me to tell him, but I also hate leaving him thinking that I dislike spending time with him because of no good reason.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2875, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My relationship with my dad is awful because of my misophonia", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/opw7qj/my_relationship_with_my_dad_is_awful_because_of/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LazyCrocheter", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5iyb5576", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626875107, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/ooq6sw/my_daughter_may_have_misophonia_looking_for_ways/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ooq6sw", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#33cc33", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "5b931b10-4038-11e9-9f72-0e3f9e09b804", "link_flair_text": "Support / Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/ooq6sw/my_daughter_may_have_misophonia_looking_for_ways/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1626875118, "score": 1, "selftext": "This is my first time posting.

She's always had some noises that bugged her, but over the last few months, it's ramped up for certain sounds (&gt;!metal utensils on plates, chewing!&lt;) . She gets visibly upset, covers her ears, etc. I feel bad for her and I know she feels bad for having this reaction to common sounds. I don't think she's faking it. I'm taking her to see an ENT next month on the advice of her doctor, I guess to rule out any physical issues, and then we'll see what happens.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how to help or support her in the interim. I've bought wooden eating utensils, and she uses plastic ones a lot. She wears headphones a lot (not just for this), and I generally let her wear them during meals, or let her eat in another room, etc. I try to warn her if I'm going to make a noise that will bother her, if I can.\n\nI've been looking for non-ceramic plates that are dishwasher safe, things like that, if anyone can recommend some.

To be able to work and somewhat function I've resorted to wearing headphones most of the time, even while I fall asleep, my doctor says it's not healthy to wear them all the time (which is certainly true, and also english isn't my first language so I'm not sure how this specific doctor is called, sorry about that) but the amount and type of noise its just too much for me and it continues well late into the night, I'm refusing to name any specifics in case someone is triggered, but they're right next to me and quite loud, if anyone is curious I'll put the specific noise here:  &gt;!incessant dog barking!&lt; \n\nI tried explaining this to a couple of doctors, as well as my family and my neighbors, but I don't think any of them believe me, or at least they don't take seriously the amount of stress this is giving me, I don't think I've slept a full night in months.\n\nSo my question is: do you have any advice or personal experience using headphones over long periods of time? \n\nThe doctors told me I shouldn't wear them for more than a couple of hours a day, but that's just not happening. I'm trying to only use them when the noise its at its peak, and then rest my ears for as long as possible until the noise starts again; but sometimes said peak can span over hours, and even the whole night.\n\n In the meantime, I'm looking for a doctor that will actually listen to me, thanks in advance!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2869, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Headphone usage over long periods of time", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/olwwna/headphone_usage_over_long_periods_of_time/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Redowadoer", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ml0fb", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626370661, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/okxrt4/need_emergency_drugs_for_misophonia_now_how_do_i/", "gildings": {}, "id": "okxrt4", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#33cc33", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "5b931b10-4038-11e9-9f72-0e3f9e09b804", "link_flair_text": "Support / Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/okxrt4/need_emergency_drugs_for_misophonia_now_how_do_i/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1626370673, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2862, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need emergency drugs for misophonia NOW!

I don't know who to talk to, and I've exhausted/angered my family enough. \n\nI can't stand shared living noises, like the ones that come with apartments, condos, and townhomes. I used to live in a private home with my parents, and they live in the quietest neighborhood I've ever encountered, which might contribute to my sensitivity to sound. Since moving out for college, I've lived in dorms and apartments. My dorm was generally okay, minus my one neighbor screaming in the middle of the night a few nights a week when playing video games.\n\nThen once I moved into apartments, it just went downhill. I had this very bizarre neighbor in my first apartment that paced back and forth next to our shared wall, causing everything on my side to rumble. On the other side, I had a neighbor who had very enthusiastic sex and left her garbage out in the hall to rot.\n\nMy next apartment was close to the Greek houses near campus, so bad overall. Loud music, heavy-footed upstairs neighbor before I moved to the top floor, crazy parties, etc. I started feeling intense anxiety every time I heard anything in that apartment complex, and management wouldn't help at all.\n\nNow I'm in a condo (not exactly by choice), and I do admit it is much better. It's an older community, so there's a lot of retired people and working professionals. The one neighbor I've met is very sweet, and told me that she never hears anyone. That put my mind at ease, but I'm still boxed in on three sides, so I have three common walls. \n\nThe noise is significantly reduced from my apartments, absolutely. My AC is loud and makes white noise when it's idle so I love it. BUT, any incidental boom? Someone shuts their cabinets too hard, someone lets their front door slam, etc? My heart races. I get so hot, I lose track of whatever I was in the middle of, and I can't think anymore. I live with two cats who are also easy to startle who love to be within my line of sight, so if they heard something and jump, but I didn't? I start looking for the source of noise as I start to panic and my heart races again. As I'm typing this, one of my cats flinched like she heard something and now I'm back to my panic.\n\nI don't know how to relax. I don't really have the option to go see a doctor about getting any medicine prescribed (I'm on my parents' insurance). I recognize that this new place is pretty great in terms of noise-proofing, but I'm still so frequently triggered. It's not unreasonable noise like I was living with before, but my past has basically ruined my present. Does anyone have any suggestions? Breathing or mindfulness exercises? Loud fans that I can keep on?

That's how it works.\n\n\n\"But music instruments are loud! It's normal to hear them on an amp, even the bass, right?\" you're gonna tell me. Thing is, now, he tends to play with the sound as low as possible. And I. Can. Still. Hear it.\n\n\nHe won't wear his headset everytime (\"it's heavy\" he says. Not a me problem, but whatever. I wear my headset everyday, every hour I'm awake, so that I can escape the noise. But whatever.) and clearly thinks I'm a dumbass.\n\n\nTwo years of having to remind him that we can hear him. Two years of \"dum dum dum dum\" with the same note, no variations. I'm at a point where I just wanna shove his bass between his butt cheeks, throw his amp out the window and screw his headset on his head. I know it's mostly because of my misophonia, otherwise hearing a little bit of music like that wouldn't hurt me (stomach cramps, anyone?). And aside from listening to loud music, I don't know what to do. Moving out isn't possible right now, and therapy by exposure clearly does NOT work. Guided mediation... Well, it'll work as long as I have my earphones/headset on.\n\n\nI'm at my wits end, playing against some clich\u00e9 cuntish Parisian (I promise we're not all like him) artist that thinks he's better than you. Even my landlord can't do much at that point since the music isn't technically loud. Right before him I had to confront the other neighbor (downstairs) because she used to party at like 3-5AM. I'm tired. Too tired to even cry out of frustration.

While I don't get even the slightest amount of respect thrown my way. My miso has gotten to the point of tic fits, hitting my ears, and crying full fucking buckets whenever someone chews. I have other triggers that I can semi-drown out with music (Ironic that one of my triggers is guitar and I'm a big metalhead) She alternates between caring about it enough to discuss coping mechanisms (only happened twice) and full fucking chastising me, putting me down, treating me like a mental case, and denying my suffering. She's going on and on about how hard it is to take care of an Autistic child and apparently, constant paranoia and anxiety of whether or not someone will crack open the pantry or refrigerator or play guitar, or if my sibling will go onto his annoying fucking tracing app that goes on full blast isn't suffering, it's me being a \"melodramatic, bossy, insufferable piece of shit\". She's told me that I'll become a reclusive shut-in if I somehow don't \"get cured\". She's like an anti-gay parent that wants to convert their child. It's fucked up. She has actively put me down and chastised me for being this way. To the point to where I feel like a shitty person 24/7. She's been at family gatherings and whenever I walk into a room, she has said, on multiple occasions \"oh, xxxprintmaster42069's here, I'd better starve so he doesn't scream at me to stop eating\" Truly disgusting. She is also punishing me for having mental breakdowns due to miso. She takes away my computer every time my Misophonia gets out of control, and I scream out in agony. She thinks my safe space (my computer) and my miso are connected and whole heartedly believes that I'll be better if I don't have it for a week. FYI, each time she takes away my computer, it's pure hell. I'm Ashiest and if hell exists, this is it for me. Just the constant chewing, my little brother playing guitar, the other one eating while on his app, it's impossible to describe how horrible it is. I must have a mild concussion from banging my head against the walls because I'd rather be dead, deaf, or \"normal\".  I truly feel bad for my brother and his mental disorder cocktail he has going on (Autism, ADHD, OCD, and Bipolar Disorder), but it's hard to feel that way when he has his mouth like that goatse picture with those horrible sounds, I hate it.\n\nI don't have a problem with my little, \"normal\" brother eating because my father has trained some decent manners into his mind. Also, my father is the only other person in my family that I can tolerate. Because unlike my mother and Autistic brother, he has decent manners, he treats my conditions with respect, and is a pretty upstanding guy that doesn't belittle me every second of every day. I've been taking up cooking from him and have found a side interest to mechanical projects and woodworking.\n\nEven though my mother wholeheartedly believes in Autism, she has yet to read anything pertaining to my conditions and show a shred of decency towards me. I have 3/5 people in my immediate circle that I respect, me included. My dad and my brothers are the best and I would do anything for them. My mom is the absolute worst and I can't wait to move away from her bullshit, and I've had severe depression that stemmed from her belittling me and the misophonia. I've lost faith in my mother because she feels like my misophonia and my laptop are connected and she takes it away whenever I have an extreme mental breakdown (which is a lot). She's been brainwashed by Facebook and truly believes it with every fiber of her being. I have long since stopped using her for emotional support when it comes to miso, but she's great when it comes to bullying. I'm a prime target at school because I'm quiet, put earplugs in every time I see gum, listen to music whenever I get the chance, and have a \"fucking idiot retard brother who I need to take after and shut the fuck up\" that one quote messed me up for months and still rings in my head all these years later. So, not only do I have my abusive mother to balme for my depression, paranoia, and anxiety, I also have resident bullies. before you say in the comments, I am financially reliant on my parents, 15, and have no escape places like a nearby park, or a friend's house. I'm in hell and Can't wait to get out as soon as I get accepted into college, and I won't let my mother walk me into the gate.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2832, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I can't take it anymore.

However I never am around my family when they eat. I put on my headset and listen to loud music when they eat, I avoid being around them during that time. I also explicitly told him I don't wanna spend Christmas Eve with the family because of my misophonia, I didn't word it differently, I said exactly that. Suddenly I don't do that in his opinion. \n\nHe also suggested I should visit some psychiatrist, but I told him there is no specialist for misophonia since it's not recognized in DSM-5 and all my previous \"all purpose\" psychiatrists and therapists were not helpful before, since all of them were just trying to brush my problems under a carpet and told me to not worry about stuff. He then told me that I have to find such specialist... Like just what!? How am I supposed to do that when there is no such thing? \n\nAlso he mentioned that my uncle is having his 50th birthday family party this weekend and I am not coming because I am unwilling to change. Like what am I supposed to do!? Just turn off my misophonia!? \n\nLastly during that arguement he started doing mouth sounds, I immediately put fingers in my ears and told him to stop with the mouth sounds. He started yelling at me that he is doing nothing and after that he did it again, I heard it even through the fingers in my ears, I started having tics in my neck like I have a tourette syndrome and started hitting myself with fists in my arms, chest and thighs (yes, this is my actual reaction to trigger sounds, it got that bad over last year). My father just repeated again \"jesus, you really don't wanna change\" and left my room. \n\nI try to be as understandable as possible, I know it is very frustrating to live with such a person as I am. BUT JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, I AM BEING BEATEN FOR DOING ALL I CAN BY NOT BOTHERING ANYONE WITH IT. THEY JUST WON'T STOP COMING TO ME RANTING ABOUT THAT I AM BLOCKING SOUNDS SO I DON'T LITERALLY BEAT MYSELF. \n\n**The actual question:** I don't have a job and I am having trouble even getting invited for an interview for the most simplest lowest-paying jobs possible, therefore I don't have enough money to just move out. I need to explain to my father that I am doing what I can so we can at least coexist in one house.

We kindly waited on my mother because we wanted her to join us. Midway through, she starts biting and picking at her nails noisily. It\u2019s something she does all the time and it droves me up the wall. I asked her to stop, it was no use. She kept at it all through the show. At the very end, say, five minutes left, I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. I calmly turned to her and asked her to PLEASE stop, just take her hands apart for a few minutes. Practically begging her. I told them both that if she didn\u2019t please stop that I was probably going to lose it. I tried to tolerate it the whole time (it ruined the show) and I just couldn\u2019t anymore. So, here\u2019s how it always goes\u2026 instead if simply taking her hands apart for five fucking minutes, she throws a fit and storms off, as if I chased her off. It\u2019s always \u201cyou just hate me!\u201d or \u201cfine if you want me to leave I\u2019ll leave!\u201d And shit like that. My dad always takes her side and tells me that if it was bothering me either a) I should be more tolerant or b) I should have left and watched the show elsewhere. I wanted to be watching the show with my family. Ya see, I\u2019m not really the problem in this equation. I may be neurologically intolerant to noise, but if somebody could have just just acted like a fucking adult and not storm up and twist my words, which she has complete control over, it would have all been fine. This is why she is so miserable to be around. Not only is she a noisy, obnoxious person by nature, but whenever I have a problem with it\u2026 it\u2019s a lose-lose situation because she\u2019ll go and make it ten times worse whether I choose to

They said there was none, and they'd been here 4 years and both working from home since Covid. They had no reason to lie as far as I could tell, they'd given notice with plenty of time so weren't on the hook for finding the next renter.

I guess it's because of the bass. It's happened at 8 am, 8 pm, and afternoon, so seems like anytime goes.\n\nI'm feeling shattered and extremely anxious. I work at home like many of us and I'm extremely sensitive to loud music. Footsteps and doors suck but I find them bearable, it's the music and the anxiety around when it will happen and for how long and how loud, if I have a migraine when it's happening - all of that. It's better if I move to the bedroom, and then my headphones/noise machine/earplugs block it better, but I can't do that all time because of working, not to mention the anxiety it's causing me. I don't even feel able to cope.\n\nI guess at some point I'll have to speak to them, but in the past this has only made the situation worse and caused me more anxiety because of having to see the people when coming and going. I don't want to go through that.\n\nI'm wondering if others have had success in talking to people playing loud music and how you phrased the complaint, and if adding any kind of speaker system to the noise-blocking mix helps, and which one. I only listen to music on the laptop or through headphones, so I don't know anything about speakers, but I can't think of what else to do besides blast something instrumental so I can work/hear myself think/keep the anxiety in check, and if my downstairs neighbor complains then at least we can try to solve it with the upstairs as two instead of only me. I ordered the LectroFan which I think might be louder than my current machine, but I'm not optimistic.\n\nOr does anyone have other techniques that have worked?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2793, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New apartment, upstairs neighbor blasting loud music", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/obmtem/new_apartment_upstairs_neighbor_blasting_loud/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HowIsThatMyProblem", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2mpk5oiv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1625088443, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/ob705r/is_this_misophonia/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ob705r", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/ob705r/is_this_misophonia/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1625088454, "score": 1, "selftext": " Over the last couple of years I've become more and more sensitive to noise. It first started when the apartment below us was being renovated and they were using power tools every day. After they were done, a new couple moved in there and they were constantly stomping and slamming windows. We already had pretty loud neighbours on one side which bothered me a little, but it wasn't too bad. Slowly, all the noises from neighbours became more and more bothersome, to the point that hearing any noise from them made me furious. Then, I started having panic attacks, if I came home after a long day to noises from neighbours. In particular, I couldn't stand the sound of talking and stomping. I became hyperviligant and my SO eventually bought me noise cancelling headphones, because of how upset and hyperfixated I was when I heard specific neighbour noises. We recently moved because I couldn't stand it anymore, but I can sometimes hear noises from neighbours in the new apartment.\n\nIf I hear talking and determine that it's from inside the building I get angry or panicky, sometimes start crying uncontrollably. I'll often ask my SO to go and search for the source of the noise to see if it's a direct neighbour or some noise outside. If it's outside, I mostly ignore it. I walk around with headphones on all the time, regardless what time of day. If I hear talking in the aparment during the day, I even sometimes leave the apartment to escape the negative emotions. I've had extreme social anxiety for several years, where I have issues in spaces that other people would not call crowded, but to me are incredibly crowded. The same thing seems to be happening with noise from neighbours, where my SO has to really strain his ears to even hear the apparently very low mumblings from the apartment above or below us, while to me the voices are unbearable. However, misophonia is often described as hating a specific sound pretty much regardless of the circumstances, but I hate the noise of people talking and stuff specifically in my own apartment, nowhere else.

I told her that I went to the doctor for a general physical check up a couple of weeks ago and the advice they were able to give me for treating misophonia. They told me to stop taking Hydroxyzine and Vyvance as Vyvance could be stimulating my senses and making me fore sensitive to the accents. I forgot the reason they told me to stop taking Hydroxyzine. At the time they were explaining this stuff to me, my mind was already in a whirl because the noises that trigger me could be heard all over that place. They also told me to maintain my Trintellix and that I might need to continue taking Gabapentin for a while, possibly gradually stopping.\n\nVyvance might be very difficult for me to stop taking. Almost five years ago, I stopped taking it for a short while because it was too expensive for me to afford at that time. I was overly lethargic, my muscles became sore, and my attention was weak. I got into a car accident because I didn't notice I was in a wrong lane road in an area I was unfamiliar with. Even with several signs (some with flashing lights around them), my attention was too weak to notice them. If I do not take Vyvance early enough after I wake up, the with draw symptoms come in fast.\n\nThe medications they did recommend for me to take to replace the Vyvance were Latuda and/or Abilify 2 or 5 \"starting dose\". Do these medications sound competent or applicable for misophonia? The reason I bring this up is because my mom told me the effects of medication may not be as effective anymore the longer you take them. I have been taking Vyvance for bout five years now. I do not know if that is long enough for the effects to not be effective anymore. Would taking this change in my medication be something that could help, would it not help, or should I not do this at all?\n\nWhen I was talking to my mom, we were visiting some family and friends of family at the pool that one of them owns. Many of the people there were speaking in southern accents which are my major most trigger. I have always lived in the south and yet, my most intense trigger is those accents. It's a complicated situation. Hearing the accents was pushing me to my breaking point. I was only able to be there for just a little over an hour as opposed to the majority of the day as they were staying. The reason I came is because these people enjoy seeing me, I wanted to visit them, and I wanted to go for a swim. This environment was just too much for me.\n\nI don't know if I still have a legitimate psychiatrist or medicine provider. The I had to stop seeing the one I was given because she has a southern accent and the meetings were making me greatly uncomfortable. the company she is with still wants me to be with them. I still need to get back with them and see if I can do the TTY option they recommended. I used to have a fantastic psychiatrist, but I had to stop seeing her earlier this year because I turned 26, thus aging out of my parent's health insurance.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2780, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Could taking certain medications lessen and/or worsen my Misophonia", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/o8o8q9/could_taking_certain_medications_lessen_andor/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "1seraphius", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_c25w5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1624716402, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/o8bg4q/why_do_some_folks_slam_and_bang_doors_when_there/", "gildings": {}, "id": "o8bg4q", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#b209d6", "link_flair_css_class": "venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "9420fff0-4011-11e9-bb6e-0eef35d07208", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/o8bg4q/why_do_some_folks_slam_and_bang_doors_when_there/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1624716414, "score": 1, "selftext": "How can anyone tolerate bang bang bang bang slam slam , how can anyone be okay with this in a home environment?\n\nCar door, a factory floor or a rare temper tantrum seem reasonable for slamming doors...

I am 26 now and ever since then, the discomfort I get has been growing worse. However, there are times where I am not as irritated as I had been. The sounds still make me upset, but It's not to where I am on the verge of a meltdown or screaming in public. But when it does get that bad, they are what I call \"rough patches\". I will will need to make a scene just to show that I hate hearing those sounds. This can happen even when I wear my construction head phones and ear plugs at the same time. Sometimes, the rough patches will fade off and I will only be mildly angry about hearing the noises. The time length these rough patches last for can vary between a few weeks to several months. I have been currently going though a rough patch. I don't know how long this one will last, but so far, it will be five months by this weekend. I will say that once the patch is over, my irritation will still be worse than it was before the rough patch began.\n\nThis rough patch has most certainly been the most difficult with how much agony and mental pain I go through from hearing the sounds. It's been to where I am almost reclusive. I hardly go out unless it is for work or if it's totally necessary. I am drowning deeper into depression with this current rough patch, too. I am crying more often and feeling far more hopeless and alone. It is getting to where I am hearing the sounds in my head (not as an auditory hallucination, think of it like having a song in your head) and when I do, I will become miserable. My new psychiatrist even had to turn me down because she makes the sound that triggers me. I was going into panic mode having to hear her. It's not a sound she or anyone for that matter can easily stop making, so this was the only choice she had. Because of this, I am yet again on the search for a new provider.\n\nIn my case, the sounds that trigger me the most is something that I am afraid of sharing here because I do not want to offend anyone that uses this sound. I have had to say what it was to people before and when I have, I am met with negative reactions. Even when I am being as compassionate and polite as possible, people will become angry at me and sometimes even ridicule me for being this way. I really wish I could say so here as it would better explain why I am in such agony. The sounds that trigger me are heard EVERYWHERE in public. It has gotten to where I have been downright embarrassing myself with how I react to the sounds and how much agony they put me in. I had to leave the gym after only being there for maybe 10 minuets or less because I got too caught up in my stress and started crying after having to dwell in it. I didn't even get to work out.

I'm new to this subreddit, and posting my own stuff on Reddit in general. Glad this place exists. I'm happy to hear any advice or words of encouragement.\n\nI'm 27 and have had misophonia ever since I can remember. It got worse when I started talking about it to my family at the age of 14. High school was a disaster because I started to notice that several of my teachers spoke in ways that triggered me. Pronouncing \"S\" sounds extra sharp, or just having dry mouth. My otherwise wonderful Latin teacher checked both boxes. I had a permanent pass to leave some of my classes. Nice to have some accommodation in a world that doesn't understand this thing, seriously, but it was humiliating. My grades always suffered.\n\nSomehow I managed to get a decent job where it's been mostly quiet since COVID, as it is usually just me and one other person at the office. But here's the kicker. For at least the past two months, I've had dry mouth all the time. I lose track of how much water I drink every day. I've cut down my caffeine intake. I only drink on the weekends, if I do. I never want to speak because I'm constantly dreading the sound. It's that awful feeling when you know the person next to you is about to start eating loudly, except this is 24/7 and you're the guilty one. I live alone, which should have fixed a lot of things. I can't escape myself.\n\nI sing. I love talking to myself to calm my nerves. I was even going to start experimenting with recording, and now I can barely stand the thought. This is my biggest nightmare, and for the first time I feel like I might actually go insane from the damage this is causing me. I feel like I'm aging rapidly. I feel like I'm getting uglier as a person in so many ways.\n\nI know I need to get to root of this problem. I am a type 2 diabetic (MODY) and I know dry mouth can be a symptom. But this has NEVER been an issue until the past two months. In any case, I'm going to manage my blood sugar to the best of my ability. I'm going to continue to use mouthwash/toothpaste meant for dry mouth. I'm gonna do SOMETHING to try and fix this.\n\nI don't know, guys. I never thought it would get so bad. I come home and I cry each day before working up the strength to lay back and do something that makes me happy. Things that make me happy could potentially trigger me. It's awful. I wish it would stop. I wish I could talk about it with people I love without making them feel helpless for me. I love life in general, but this is ruining it for me more than I ever thought it could.\n\nTL;DR  I have had dry mouth for at least the past two months, and the resulting sound when I speak is one of my worst triggers. I don't know how to fix it.

I wanted to share a bit about my experience, and ways I've learned to cope.\n\nSome of my youngest childhood memories involve my two younger brothers playing with toys in the living room while I tried to read, or even play my own toys. The action sounds they would make (\"Pshh, pshh\", \"Aahhh\", \"Kshhh crash boom\", etc) as they played with figurines or cars would drive me absolutely insane. I was \\~6 years old when it first began really driving me bonkers. I'd throw tantrums, yell at my brothers, lock myself in my room, or scream at my brothers to play with toys quietly. The mouth sounds imitating sound effects felt like they dug straight into the center of my brain and I couldn't focus on anything else. My parents didn't understand, my brothers obviously didn't understand, I didn't understand, and this continued for a while.\n\nThen, the chewing started to drive me crazy around \\~4th grade and the start of middle school. My cousins had just moved in with me, and my older cousin was in high school at the time. I'd come home from school 30 minutes before she would and my every day routine would be to come home, go into my room, lock the door and count the minutes until my cousin came home. Her favorite snack, every day, was a large bowl of cereal that she absolutely chomped on, slurped up, smacked around, and overall seemed to make extra efforts to be as loud as possible while eating. Sometimes I would cry, even if I couldn't hear it but just knowing she was in the other room doing that drove me insane. When i'd tell her it bothered me, of course she found it comical and would then make efforts to taunt me and intentionally smack food at any given occasion.\n\nLater in middle school began the worst part. People started chewing gum, and gum has since come to be the bane of my entire existence. I'd try to tell people in class that gum chewing made me incredibly anxious, enraged and frustrated, but again they found it funny and would chew even more intensely. Every day was a potential nightmare waiting to happen. I'll always remember one day during Junior year when I stepped outside a classroom to prepare for my turn in a debate, then when I stepped back into the room all 35 of my peers were smacking gum and smirking. One of my friends had \"jokingly\" handed out gum to the entire class, and made sure to bring enough gum to do specifically so. \n\nI played baseball in middle/highschool and the chewing tobacco, sunflower seeds and gum were the most difficult aspect of the entire game. On many occasions my team would win a huge game, but somebody would be frantically chowing down on sunflower seeds in the loudest of manners right next to my ear during the post-game team meeting. The whole experience would be ruined.\n\nThere was a period where I stopped eating dinner with my family at the table because I couldn't enjoy myself while they ate. I'd sit outside on the porch steps and eat the meal my Mom would have cooked by myself. The mere smell of mint gives me dreadful anxiety as I know somebody around me might have just pulled out a stick of gum. On a bus, if I even see someone's jaw clench as if a piece of gum might be in their mouth, I begin to panic intensely. \n\nMy response to misophonia is very severe. My heart races, I begin to sweat, my face turns red, I get very very fidgety. I feel as if my blood pressure increases, my thoughts become irrational and unlike my normal self. I've had visions of hurting people when trapped in gum-chewing circumstances for extended periods. I'm typically a very calm, easy going guy and most of my friends couldn't even imagine what I look like angry. But misophonia triggers, specifically gum and food today, make me feel as if I'm the Hulk and I could smash down an infinitesimal number of walls until there are no more gum-chewers left. \n\nI've performed poorly in several very important college courses due to gum chewing during exams or lectures making me not think straight or completely skip class/lecture due to anxiety.  School is not accommodating as it's not in the MSD-5 or whatever psych book they use. If someone offered me 10,000,000$ to sit in a room with someone chewing (not even smacking) gum for 5 minutes, I would scream NO before the question was even finished. Misophonia is on my mind in every single social interaction I ever encounter.\n\nToday I work in business and I get terrible anxiety before every big meeting or pitch. I'm a very confident person and don't have anxiety of speaking or crowds, but I do have an incredible fear that somebody in the crowd or at the table will be chewing gum while I need to talk. How could I possibly ask a respected, noteworthy, influential person that I barely know (and am likely asking for money) to stop chewing their gum, during a high stakes conversation?  My company is small, but once we begin hiring people I might have to implement a no-gum policy in the workplace which may disgruntle employees. It's extremely, extremely, extremely difficult for me to go on dinner or food dates with potential or current partners (or even just friends). Thus, the situation will likely follow me until who-knows-when. Maybe one day I'll become president and I'll take executive action to ban all sales of gum throughout the country. Maybe one day I'll retire on a lake house and nobody will be around to chew gum or smack food for miles. \n\n\\---------------------------\n\nNow on to happier things. The #1 coping method that is effective for me is background noise or music. I have learned to always, always always keep charged noise cancelling ear buds in my pocket whenever I leave the house. I typically try and take my bose QC35 headphones with me, but this is more difficult to carry around and not appropriate for all social situations. Sometimes when I'm with a group of friends I'll pop in one headphone and play music, and this helps calm me down a lot. My other coping method is to simply leave the area where a gum chewer or food smacker is at. My friends know if I ever suddenly bolt to the bathroom, that I'm probably getting triggered and they understand. I've also been taking iron supplements, which are supposedly helpful but I can't really tell any difference. \n\nI've never been able to share the depths of my experience with misophonia, and the whole story through childhood to today as a 24 year old man. The most difficult part throughout all of this is the lack of understanding from people without misophonia. Nobody ever gets how truly, truly traumatic the feeling can be. Nobody understands that the sound of chewing gum or smacking chips feels physiologically very literally painful to me. \n\nIt feels good just to share this here and know there are other people out there, more people than I thought, struggling with similar issues. If you ever need help, have suggestions, or anything, feel free to shoot me a DM. I'll also be watching this sub pretty normally.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers":

At first, people told me this was normal and everyone hated those sounds, but it became a problem when I could not even eat dinner with my own family without having a rage attack. (This is not that big of a problem anymore since we got plastic cutlery) After a while (Now) I'm starting to get more \"triggers\", like eating, breathing, and swallowing? these weren't as bad as the others but it makes me feel a little nauseous. Is it a possibility (if) I have misophonia it's getting worse? Because I read that it could get worse when u get older. I am also unsure where to get medical help and a diagnosis, And if I try to get a psychologist I have to wait like a year. Right now, I would say that my (possible) misophonia is not very severe, but could that change with my age?

We talk all about the most recent results of her work and others researching the neuroscience behind misophonia in a way that is very approachable for non-scientists.

In my last apartment there was a constant thudding that sounded like someone running back and forth, all day and all night. I tried my hardest to find the source of the noise but didn't have any luck. My other neighbours could hear it too but it didn't bother them as much. So I lied to the landlord that I was leaving the country, ended my lease early and moved.\n\nThe next apartment I moved to is where I live now. There's a small playground in front of the apartment, which was quite empty the few times I came to check out the area before I signed the lease. I also never though that I would have an issue with noise coming from a playground and it's also really difficult to find a nice apartment here, which this apartment is. Now the summer has started the playground is full of parents and their kids for around 10 hours a day, from 11am until 9pm. I'm under a lot of stress, constantly waiting for the next high pitch scream, baby cry or loud yell. I find it strange because there's a restaurant below the apartment too but I'm not bothered by the noises of people dining outside at night. I've asked my landlord what I can do to leave this apartment early (I have 9 months left on the lease), or if they have any other empty apartments I could swap to that face another direction, however the response is slow and my patience is wearing thin. I told them the noise is having an impact on my mental health but it's difficult not being able to truly explain how serious this is for me.\n\nThis past year has been so draining on my mental health and a huge learning curve about myself. I knew I had issues with certain noises but I didn't fully understand how serious it was for me until now, hence not making the right decisions when apartment hunting this last year. It started with small problems, like someone whistling in the office or the noises of people eating. Now it feels like it's taken over my life and I won't ever be happy wherever I live. It's all I can seem to talk about with family and friends, I can't concentrate on my work or seem to have any enjoyment. I have anxiety and depression issues too and these seem to flare up by my reactions to these noises, which in turn affects those around me. I just want to be happy and not be bothered by this so much.\n\nAny coping tips for living in a noisy apartment or coming to terms with Misophonia are welcome.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2738, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The most popular playground in the neighbourhood...", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/nv75qi/the_most_popular_playground_in_the_neighbourhood/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Ufoul", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_15wj65", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574253844, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/dz1kok/misophonia_affect_hygiene/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dz1kok", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/dz1kok/misophonia_affect_hygiene/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574253844, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am a gamer, even tho i hate that word I have to use it.

Her bark is very high pitch so maybe that\u2019s why?

I hate that I can\u2019t control this feeling, and I don\u2019t hate the dog either. I just can\u2019t stand the sound of her bark! How do you stop this feeling when you hear certain sounds? I wear ear plugs to bed every night and I can still hear her bark through them! It\u2019s so frustrating! This is not a current problem anymore, however, now that I\u2019ve been waking up very early, but I\u2019d still like to know if there\u2019s a way to cope with the feelings I get from hearing certain noises like this!

There is never a moment of silence in our house and I mean that quite literally. When I get home from work, one roommate is already home with the living room TV blaring. The other one comes home and blasts a podcast from his phone at full volume (never wears headphones). The upstairs bathroom is directly next to our room, and of course the podcast roommate needs to either have his podcast or music blaring during his shower. I try to sleep at night and all I can hear is the TV downstairs, my other roommate's podcast or music, or someone is walking around and slamming doors all hours of the night. I cannot drown out the sound. It's not so bad in the summer because the hum of our room air conditioner helps drown out the other noise. Winter? Forget about it. I've tried airpods (not comfortable to sleep in), white noise apps on my phone, fans, ear plugs. Nothing works. My boyfriend thinks I'm nuts because we'll be in our closed room watching TV and I'll be getting flustered because I can hear things other than our tv that he doesn't even notice or think twice about. \n\nI literally started crying last night because I was so angry that I could hear podcast roomate's podcast OVER our television and my boyfriend went to go ask him to wear headphones for me, which I appreciated because I feel weird confronting people about it.

(Warning-mentions trigger sounds)\n\nMy battle with misophonia began when I was nine years old, and has gotten progressively worse since. The sounds that used to have me in tears give me full-fledged panic attacks now. And seeing as the sounds that trigger me are so common-mainly chewing, sniffing, crinkling of wrappers, blowing of noses, heavy breathing, words with a hard 'a'-that amounts to several severe panic attacks a day. It gets quite annoying, and interferes with my grades as well as my relationships with friends and family. Being a high school student, I have to leave my classes often to avoid a panic attack simply if one of my classmates has a cold or is chewing gum. The issue is, I can only get out of class once per period because I'm too embarrassed to tell my teachers the real reason I'm leaving. I've tried to set up 504 accomodations for myself, but my school's guidance counselor told me that I need a proper diagnosis in order to receive said accomodations.\n\nBecause of this, I've seen several doctors. My pediatrician, a few audiologists, and even an otolaryngologist. None of the above had any previous knowledge of misophonia, and therefore didn't think that they could diagnose me. The only other option they told me I have is to visit a neurologist, but the nearest one is two hours away and neither of my parents have the time or money to set up an appointment with one.\n\nAnd speaking of my parents-they trigger me immensely. More than anyone else. My dad is very respectful about my misophonia most of the time. If he knows that he's triggering me, he'll nearly always walk away or stop making the noise until I leave the room. My mom, however, is a different story. She makes fun of my misophonia all the time, lashes out at me about it, and has no remorse when she gives me panic attacks for her own avoidable sounds. Then, when I confront her about it, she plays the victim card and claims to understand what I'm going through. It's truly draining, and makes me very insecure.\n\nI feel immense guilt about my misophonia as well. When I'm with friends, I often just suffer through it with little to no mention if they're making triggering sounds. A few of my friends are really good at avoiding my trigger sounds, and I'm very grateful for that. However, many of my friends forget or don't bother to try. I don't blame them. I can't expect everyone to tiptoe around me all the time. However, it makes me feel really guilty when I have to ask them to stop for my own sanity. \n\nIs there anything I can do to make these sounds trigger me less? I can't eat dinner with my family anymore. I avoid parties and nights out with friends because I'm worried about hearing my trigger sounds. I can hardly eat without fear that I might be triggering someone with my own eating sounds. It's gotten to the point where I've tried to make myself become deaf. I stay in my room in the dark constantly.

For instance, I have a hard time talking to multiple people who are trying to talk over each other. This gives me a lot of anxiety. Now that I have two children, I have children that try to talk over me or the adults I am having conversations with, or they'll just be making sounds in the background. This used to drive me crazy when I didn't have children, but had friends who had children. The conversations we would have were constantly interrupted with the voices of children and it would just put me in a really bad mindset. Other moms always want to do playdates. I've tried it and it's hell, I don't know how other moms do it, how they can just have a normal and calm conversation with another parent while children are running around them. And sure, who wouldn't think that was annoying, but for me, I go into a deep state of anxiety, and when it's just me and the kids, I turn into a demon.\n\nMy youngest is the worst for me right now, he's always screeching or whining about something, and I just lost it tonight (again) when it came to reading time, he just wouldn't stop whining and wanting things his way and if he's not doing that, he's randomly screeching. There are other times too when I'm trying to teach my oldest something and I can't even get a word in, his voice overpowers mine and I just end up screaming and yelling. Tonight, I screamed for him to 'shut up'. I hate it. What child wants to hear that? But, the reaction is so impulsive, I don't even have time to think before it happens and when it does happen, I feel like the worst person in the world. \n\nWell, here's a little history about me, my mother was a screamer and a loud speaker, and she has noise sensitivity as well, especially while she sleeps. Since my second son was born, I have been screaming too and I am now noticing that my oldest son has a noise sensitivity as well. He even refuses to flush the toilet because it's too loud and gets easily agitated at his little brother's noises, like I do. There's definitely a legacy there.\n\nWhen I think back, I have had fights with people over sounds. My best friend of 25 years and I got into our first and only dispute over him being loud. I just thought he caught me on a bad day, which he did, but it didn't dawn on me that it was me, that I was the problem, I just that he was overall loud and annoying sometimes. \n\nWith relationships, I can't sleep next to anyone. If they make any sounds, I lose it, I can't sleep and I get angry if it's the middle of the night. I had three long term relationships with people who had really bad sleep apnea, they ended up couching it until we split. I mean, wouldn't anyone go nuts over loud snoring?\n\nI also can't stand it when people play their own music. I'm really particular about what music I can handle at certain times. Even if we like the same bands, if I don't want to hear it at that moment, the sound agitates me, it really sounds like noise to me. I always thought that was because I was self-absorbed or something. In childhood, I had a sibling who was a musician and had band practice in the garage almost daily and he loved blasting music. If he couldn't blast music during the day, he would play music while he slept at night and keep the bass on, so the volume would be turned down, but my room next to his still vibrated. \n\nWhen I hear a car door outside, I get anxiety. It reminds me of when my mom would come home from work as a kid. She would come in and yell at me for whatever she was angry about that day. When I hear any sudden sound like a car door slamming, someone honking their horn, something falling on the floor or kids banging against something, I jump and am filled with anxiety and adrenaline. Now I am temperamental and anything can set me off. \n\nLoud dishes drive me crazy. My mother is the loudest dishwasher, she will throw the dishes into the next sink for rinsing, then throw them onto the rack. She will throw flatware into ceramic bowls, and this makes my ear ring and my teeth hurt, my body grows extremely tense and I become temperamental. \n\nAdults having loud conversations drives me NUTS. People trying to be heard with volume is really agitating. \n\nPretty much my whole life has been noisy and I often wish I was deaf or even dead. I'm not suicidal, I would never ever take a life of any kind, not even a bug, but death just seems so peaceful. That isn't going to happen anytime soon because my work here isn't finished yet, so I just wear headphones or earplugs and it is very peaceful there. I just need to remind myself to wear them before I start yelling at my kids again. There are situations where I just can't wear them though, like while I'm teaching my oldest about something, but I decided to wear them during reading time from now on.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2518, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do I have Misophonia?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/m5e73u/do_i_have_misophonia/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "imsensitivebitch", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8igzl6ix", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1615783190, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/m5cve9/do_i_have_misophonia_does_anyone_relate/", "gildings": {}, "id": "m5cve9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/m5cve9/do_i_have_misophonia_does_anyone_relate/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1615783200, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m 16 and I believe I\u2019ve had misophonia since I was 10.

He started pretending to breathe heavily and it nearly caused me to burst into tears. Just this morning my brother started cracking his knuckles (a habit he picked up from kids at school) and every time I ask him to stop he refuses, and proceeds to make every sound possible with his neck or his fingers or his toes and of course my family always jumps to his defense calling me rude, selfish, and dramatic. \n\nDramatic.

Unemployed for a year due to Covid. \n\nThis post is setting aside the life destroying problems brought by sudden long term unemployment due to pandemic, employers and government - ie debt, singleness, lockdown, lack of purpose, anxiety, social anxiety, insomnia, depression, no hope, lost time, destroyed future (&amp; for others, sucidial) \n\nThis post is setting aside the life changing and confidence ruining problems faced by any adult, late twenties and onwards who had already become independent, found long term relationship, social life and carving out career only to have it all removed immediately and live in the childhood bedroom you grew up in.\n\nThis post is setting aside medical issues and inevitable lack of energy - the exhaustion and pain which comes from aging and losing your youth.\n\n\n\nThere are zero opportunities for work where I live. The country here is Northern Ireland with a split bitter government who shut down for 3 yrs destroying any mental health support and destroying jobs. This country has the highest suicide rates in Europe and echoes of terrorism from the Troubles.\n\nI have applied to 10,000 jobs since March last year. I have faced all ghosting, lies, and the usual recruitment hell a job seeker faces. \n\nMy Father is deaf. Every day the noises in this house are abominable - I cannot escape. I am woken up, unable to sleep correctly, constantly on edge, disguised when I have to eat and feel sick, I end up shaking in rage, screaming into a pillow. The rare half hour the house is ever free, instead of attempting to record music (which is impossible when people are home due to constant noise and interruptions) I have now ended up screaming and shouting to vent the anger that has built up for years. \n\nI had built a sound proof room within my room, hoping this would help. But my Father bangs doors, cupboards, stomps, etc etc shouts for me rather than walking to find me and have a normal conversation. \n\nI had one job interview, a work from home role during pandemic. I was so worried and prepared so much for this role, I was hoping to use the soundproof room to show employer I had a great area to work from answering their calls. Had my own laptop, headset, tripod etc ready to go! \n\nRejected from the role, why, because of the fucking noises. Awkward, and horrid, sitting there polite and trying to smile and nod while they awkwardly tell me they can't hire someone who has so much background noise where they live. \n\nSince then I've broken down, completely. Days I won't leave my room until this house is silent. I have become total insomniac as it's the only time I get peace. Am always exhausted and constantly sore. \n\nI am very angry. I am so angry I get migraines from the anger. \n\nI don't want to trigger anyone, but imagine you're woken up self deprived all the time. Imagine as soon as you have peace or a sense of happiness it's ripped away by this ignorant person, this impossible situation.\n\nSocial life is dead. No job, no money, no opportunity, no escape. \n\nThe few women who have been interested, put off because you're living with your parents and even if they get over that my father comes across as rude and uncaring due to deafness and just pretending he hears people. I am sick of repeating every fucking thing. Am tired of being the only one to iniate a conversation. \n\nAnd how the heck does one explain they have missed out on the only employer out of 10,000 applications due to the disgusting noises and loud fucking sounds all day long making life impossible to live, making phone or zoom chats impossible to have. \n\nIt's ruined my life. He has ruined my life. And nobody fucking helps, and nobody fucking even believes in misophonia. I get blamed, so it's all my fault. \n\nIt's my fault I'm woken up by loud sounds all the time. It's my fault employers aren't hiring. It's my fault house prices are too high to move out. It's my fault there is no hope. And it's my fault that I feel bad, so what the fuck does a person do now if they aren't suicidal? \n\nIn my case, lie on the floor every day hoping they all fuck off and I can finally have silence and a few hours to just think and try and plan an escape. \n\nSorry for language and venting.

For almost months or years now its been hard for me to live my life and do my work  i should be doing here at home. When I tend to do my tasks noises such as my dog playing with its toys, barking, or my younger sister being so loud, or anyone near my room where I work or just being around, Tend to REALLY aggravate me and makes me so stress and tense. When i hear car doors closing I get stressed, when its footsteps coming around my room i get irritated. Anytime im completely alone at home i get so happy just knowing that theyll be less noise and I can do my own work but its just so rare. Just now i was watching tv in the family room trying to concentrate till i then hear my mom making a loud noise and my sister being playful and a bit loud with my dog all around me, it then escalated for me to go to my room to the brink of crying because this has been happening to me for months now. I get scared, anxious, stress literally my day becomes so negative that i dont wanna leave my room. I just cant function with the loud noises, but theres only so much i can control really :(, it wasnt till now i googled and realized misophonia that it resonated with me. Past months i just envisioned how much peace id feel if i was in a mountaintop just on my own and no one around. When i hike or bike Im 100% at peace mainly for the fact that all this noise goes away hence also listening to calm music with my headphones. Leaving the house or people around or the noise outside just stresses me and makes me want to be back in my room aswell. Maybe you guys feel the same? What do you guys think on what ive mentioned? If you read this far i REALLY appreciate it! Any feedback would be amazing.

I was going to add this to the original post, but I thought this might be better for anyone waiting for an update. If I need to change something, please let me know!\n\nSo here's my update!\n\nThese things HELP. I bought the mini and night versions, and was able to mostly comfortably sleep with the night ones in. You do need to wear them for long periods of time to notice sound quality differences, but as far as triggers it's pretty instant. Wearing them at night helped me with my fiance's snoring, and wearing the mini's was instant relief from a triggering engine whine. \n\nMostly due to my own idiocy, I haven't used them a lot recently. I forgot them in my purse and forgot about them. But I am going out into the wild, and intend to have them in while I do my grocery shopping tonight! \n\nI do find that my ears ache after a while of having them in, but I have very small ear canals, even small headphones hurt after a while, so that's normal for me. \n\nI think I may need to consider purchasing a few more pairs of mini, they are the most comfortable for me. This way I can keep them strategically placed around the house and will be able to pop them in at a moment's notice.\n\nOther non miso related things I noticed; shipping was faster than I expected! And tracking was provided very quickly. \n\nThe packaging is also mostly paper! This was wonderful to see, instead of more plastic clogging up our oceans! \n\nEach pair of calmer came with a mesh bag for storage, which is super handy. They do offer metal keyrings for storage as well, if you want something sturdier.\n\nThe mini's are actually a little hard to see in your ears! I tried to show my mom, and it took her a second to realize there was something in there. \n\nI would highly recommend that anyone who is able try these. It doesn't remove triggers, at least not for me, but it takes the edge off of them so that rather than going right to rage, I am able to tune out the sound or just treat it with mild annoyance. \n\nNext thing I want to try is called Loop, they deaden sound more than the Calmer does I think, and are intended for sensory issues.

Now I'm 22 and it grew into such a problem that I cannot encounter triggering sounds in public, because I literally look like I have tourette's syndrome, meaning I slap my head with palms and I start having tics in my neck and arms, sometimes even resulting in cramps, sometimes I even punch a wall and I am afraid my bones will not be able to withstand it one day. I am worried that in a few years I will start damaging my body (or even worse somebody else's body). \n\nI don't know what to do about it. I do wear earbuds often at home, however I keep losing my phone and earbuds somewhere at home, therefore I need to get out of my room often searching for these items while also having an incosiderate family that always starts searching for snacks when they see I don't have my earbuds in, so they can annoy me and then act like they are offended. \n\nAlso I cannot always have earbuds in. I am currently unemployed and when I will go to have a job interview, the interviewer might make a triggering sound, I will eventually slap my face, break my nose, it will start bleeding and what will I say? \"Oh, it's just my misophonia hehe, dw\"?

I had most of those symptoms for all of my life. He suggested it could be Asperger\u2019s syndrome, which is a \u201cmild\u201d form of autism, and gave me a medicine called Risperidone. He also suggested I took a neuropsychological test, to be sure that it was Asperger\u2019s or not, and so i did.\nA couple days ago the results came, and it was indeed Asperger\u2019s. The psychiatrist said the symptoms can be reverted.\nI started to have sessions with a comportamental therapist a week ago, and so far it\u2019s going well.\nMy point is that misophonia may be related to autism in some way for you aswell.

I\u2019ve tried telling them like can they stop smacking so much, or cover their mouths correctly, or not lick their fingers, but they just ignore me, or say get over it, or look at me like I\u2019m crazy. I\u2019ve never told them that misophonia is a condition because I feel like they would just say I don\u2019t have it or not take me serious. I just needed to vent here because I\u2019ve been feeling this way for longer than a year but have never been able to talk to anyone about this because no one I know has this feeling. This condition has just given me intense anger at times to just feeling low because I feel like there\u2019s nothing I can do. I\u2019m currently 16 right now and the only thing that would just completely free me from this feeling would be to move out when I\u2019m older. I love my parents and my sister, they are good people, and I\u2019m grateful for my family, but this is just something that bothers me a lot. It felt good to get this off my chest and if anyone could offer some support or give advice that would be greatly appreciated. Please no negative comments and only constructive criticism towards my family, as I love them dearly.

I've told her about some of the heavier things in my life, as well as serious issues like my PTSD. She has been understanding through all of it.

I just haven't told her my triggers. My biggest one is tongue clicking, and a lot of people do it when they speak. My girlfriend does it sometimes, but since I have my earplugs I can cope. The problem comes in when she does it to call her dog or when I hear it on the TV. When I am tired or upset it's harder to use my coping skills, and I have been hiding my outburst from her. When I get triggered I usually punch myself in the head repeatedly until the pain dulls the sound. It's not fun to watch, and it can be very disturbing. When I've been triggered around her I usually \"go to the bathroom\" and find a quiet place to hit myself and cry.

around 8. My grandfather had (still has) an illness that messes with his organs and makes him burp every fucking 3 minutes. I was just annoyed by the sound from thr start, but it got worse and worse to the point where I was banging my head because of the rage.\n\nI was 10 when I found out how there are other people that were like me. I had developed 3 more triggers (chewing a gum, my biggest trigger ever) (that dumb fucking noise of pen clicking) (slurping)\n\nI was so excited, I translated the whole wikipedia page to my parents, which caused them to break my tablet.\n\nLiterally.\n\nBecause oh mEnTaL dIsOrdEr ShItS are the play of the devil. And they did not want me to get influenced by the crazy people on the internet.\n\nI got beat up so fucking hard I never could stand up for myself about my own opinions anymore.\n\nNow these people are treating me so fucking hard you would not believe it. I am not studying? They chew a gum so that I cry my lungs out and be forced to study. I am not tidying up my room? They go through my all fucking triggers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hate them all.\n\nThe thing about my family is that they are all assholes. I live them but they are. They know it has gotten pretty worse and they understand it but they never helped me. What? Don't ever think of psychologists, mAd PeoPlE gO ThErE, aRe YoU maD tOo????\n\nYou are inventing illnessesss!!!!&amp;#\u00a3\u00d7#\u00d7\n\nOmagad i cant peleev you believe all those bulshit on internet!!!\n\nI am so fucking done right now. I tried blocking the sounds but they seem to enjoy me getting mad, and they do these even more on purpose. I have a family that wants me to support them but fails at protecting my sanity. I hate them all. I hope they go through an even worse thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am 15 right now. I developed 6 different triggers. Would you believe me if I said I bit my hand so hard it bleeded to the point where I had to use a bandage because my mom was cutting her nails next door?\n\nI dont know what to do anymore. Reducing the sound does not work since I think about the sound and it echoes in my head. I can tlive a single day without worrying about my mom's gums. I threw them away secretly but she keeps buying. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo my parents, their gums are more important than me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA stranger would laugh, problably you are laughing too and I dont blame you for it. I sound like a crazy dumbass, dont I?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMan, i hate this so fucking much.

It is me and 2 others  working close by in cubicles. The woman behind me constantly snacks, loudly, at her desk and talks with her mouth full. She will do this for hours. The man who sits behind her constantly coughs and clears his throat loudly, though it is because of health conditions. I try to remind myself of this but it is still extremely irritating. \n\nI deal with these issues at home too with my family but it is easier to avoid and escape. My anxiety has been so bad because I constantly deal with these issues at work and at home. I can wear headphones at work but I feel bad constantly having them in, in case my coworkers are trying to ask a question. But I\u2019d rather wear them than hear the food/chewing noises. \n\nI have brought it up before that I have an issue with people eating and making noises while they chew, and the woman\u2019s response was how the other man in our office is worse and that \u201cyou\u2019ll never hear me, I\u2019m quiet\u201d. She chews like a cow. It seems to be a thing with people that eat or chew loud, that they don\u2019t notice it. She was better about it that day but it has obviously returned to normal. \n\nI am brand new at this job, while her, the other man, and my boss have been here at least 10+ years each so I feel very anxious and scared to bring it up and overstep my boundaries but I\u2019m literally so angry at work every day because of this.

If I start getting angry or aggressive about it he just laughs or gets annoyed by it. \n\nThanks", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2413, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need help after Father told me to 'get used to it\"", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/lcfvs2/need_help_after_father_told_me_to_get_used_to_it/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "aulei", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1xrh3udx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1612419146, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/lc99pr/both_of_our_dogs_love_to_lick_themselves_and_its/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lc99pr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#33cc33", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "5b931b10-4038-11e9-9f72-0e3f9e09b804", "link_flair_text": "Support / Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/lc99pr/both_of_our_dogs_love_to_lick_themselves_and_its/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1612636369, "score": 3, "selftext": "We have two dogs, and they lick themselves constantly.

I told him that I was anxious that he was going to be eating, and he immediately put something in his mouth and became upset with me when I got up and tried to remove myself from the situation. \n\nHe's gotten upset with me before for not just walking away from whatever food consumption was happening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI use headphones to go out and have dinner with him when we decide to safely go out to eat. Lately, it's just be too much of a hassle to try and keep the noise cancelling headphones charged all the time. That means sometimes they just don't work like they should. Which means sometimes, I can hear him eating through my music(something I use as a white noise between my ears and the noise.). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of the time, I will simply point out, \"Hi, I have really bad misophonia.\" And it annoys him that I remind him as if he doesn't know, but honestly, I don't know what else to say. Especially not when he asks, \"How can you hear me eating?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've also found out that when my stress level is through the roof, I can actually hallucinate the noise I'm hearing. Which leaves me very little in way of options when I can't do anything to get away. \n\nI've had this issue for 5-6 years now.

Not all the time, occasionally sounds just annoy the crap out of me. Mainly when there is more than one sound at the same time. \n\nExample- whilst cooking dinner. The exhaust fan above the oven was on at full speed, my partner had music going on in the background and my daughter had a \u2018bop it\u2019 toy she was playing with, plus my partner was trying to talk to me over all of this and I just felt like my brain was going to explode. I roughly turn the fan off which the partner put it back on and said that whilst your cooking etc etc . So I went and pulled the plug out of the powerpoint for the music because I just couldn\u2019t handle it. I didn\u2019t even feel I had the patience to just press stop or pause on it. Just the quicker it was gone the better.\n\nAnother example- in the car, partner has his window down, daughter behind me has window down. The radio is playing some rough sounding song. Daughter is singing her own little song and my head is building up, teeth clenching and I\u2019m trying to just focus on one thing, my daughters calm lullaby song because I\u2019m about to lose it. It doesn\u2019t help and I end up turning the music off and telling them to put the windows up. Because my head is starting to throb. \n\nIt seems to happen more around the time of my period, if that means anything. But I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind.  I could go weeks where I don\u2019t seem to notice the sounds but then it\u2019ll regularly happen for a few days and my family will think I\u2019ve lost it. \n\nAm I ok?  Is this something I can see a doctor for? Maybe I need to try to meditate?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2363, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Am I going nuts!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/l18f6c/am_i_going_nuts/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "KiltedFatMan85", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6jwzbd2g", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1611081428, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/l0q1zp/low_voice_at_work_computer_keyboard_clacking/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l0q1zp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/l0q1zp/low_voice_at_work_computer_keyboard_clacking/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1611081884, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am having a very difficult time with a co worker who has a low voice it drives me up a fucking wall and I get sorts of pissed off.

I answer the phone all day so I'm not allowed headphones. I do have a radio on my phone that plays through the computer's speakers thankfully. And I wear earplugs. \n\nMy co-worker has pretty severe acid reflux/allergies in that every time they eat, they have to cough/clear their throat every minute for hours. I'm normally okay with a cough or two, but this is constant coughing -- every 35 seconds , sometimes shorter. I dread lunch time because I know as soon as they finish eating I'm going to have to listen to them cough for the rest of the day. \n\nIt can get pretty loud. It's mucus-y and guttural. And the most embarrassing part is that every time I hear them cough I jump in my seat and it makes my desk move. I know they can see it, and surprisingly haven't said anything. But it's not just that. I'm literally in a state of intense fight-or-flight with heart palpitations, sweaty hands, racing thoughts etc. waiting for the next cough so I can time when the next one will be. I feel like a lab rat being conditioned in a cruel experiment. \n\nIt got so bad a few days ago I had to go to the restroom and take a Xanax from my purse. It helped, which worried me. Because it's not a solution I can take everyday. I'll get addicted to it. \n\n\"Tell them/tell your boss\" \n\n I can't, nor do I want to. What can I tell them? \"Hey I get panic attacks when so-and-so coughs after they eat\" \"I'm allergic to the sound of coughing\" \"I have this rare neurological condition you've never heard of and need you to stuff a sock in your mouth so I don't have to hear you cough all day\" -- that's not practical, and it will only lead the company to think I'm a loon. \n\nI'm trying to get started in finding a way to get into a new career so I can hopefully land a job where I can choose to work from home. Until then I have to endure this because I can't quit this job. It's how I'm keeping everything I have afloat. \n\nFor the record, I have acid reflux/LPR. I cough up mucus after meals too, but I take medicine for it so I don't have to. I have sympathy for my co-worker, but I can't handle being stuck 4ft away having to listen to their dang cough every 15 seconds. What makes it worse is they won't even wear a face mask when sitting at their desk. \n\nI know there's not much advice y'all can give me. But I just wanted to talk about it. It's bothering me big time. I'm scared to go back to work next week. It's like on my days off I can't even enjoy them because I'm thinking about listening to coughing all day when I return. \ud83d\ude1e", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2349, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm losing it at work", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/kz1972/im_losing_it_at_work/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "jessilumpkins", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_dlagmfe", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1610855460, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/kyyq4t/just_ordered_a_couple_pairs_of_calmer_by_flare/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kyyq4t", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2829e1b8-941c-11e9-8e50-0e3610acc80c", "link_flair_text": "Positivity", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/kyyq4t/just_ordered_a_couple_pairs_of_calmer_by_flare/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1610855471, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm really looking forward to trying them!

In my dad's house, I can hear literally everything and it drives me fucking insane. I'm generally a very easygoing and docile person, and I think this is the only place where I feel like I turn into some kind of devil bitch.\n\nMy dad and brother's rooms are absolutely peaceful (and warm!). Mine is ice cold and I can hear every little sound and step. My room is underneath my dad's, and he's a relatively big guy. When he walks, it isn't just creaking. The floorboards sound like they're fucking SNAPPING, like wood splitting. When he tosses and turns the bed creaks so much. And he has trouble sleeping so he's always up at odd hours, I'd say I've memorized what times he gets up, but the fact that he gets up at least 5-10 times in the night means 5-10 times more fucking sound. And he's always leaving the TV on when he sleeps so I hear the mumbling sounds of people talking on the news and on commercials and I want to tear my hair out. It always HAS to be someone with such a deep voice that I think I feel vibrations. He has a coughing issue too, and it's very loud and phlegmy. And I can hear it. I can also hear all of his conversations when he's on the phone and I can hear him open his bathroom door, his toilet flushing, his sink/shower running, when he drops something (seems to always be a GIANT FUCKING BOWL), etc.\n\nAnd I don't know what this means about the house, but when someone opens/shuts a door with a decent amount of strength in any part of the house, my door fucking shakes violently and it sounds like someone is shaking my doorknob. This terrified me the first few times because it reminded me of a burglar/ghost. I'm pretty used to it now, but instead of getting scared I just get pissed even more sometimes.\n\nI love my privacy. But it fucking sucks when it comes with the price of having to hear everybody's business in every corner of the house. I get so annoyed that I just dip back to my mom's, where ironically (apt complex) it's a thousand times quieter. I have to blare white noise, brown noise, green noise and any other color noise to get some sleep at my dad's, and even then it fucking sucks. Because I still don't get enough sleep, I still hear him walking around and shit at 4:27 am or something and the noise doesn't block it out. The noise I play isn't really optimal because I just want fucking 200% silence. I can't study ever here, I can't study with music either btw bc I lose focus.\n\nI don't bother explaining misophonia to anyone for any accommodations because who the hell believes in it lol. But oh my god I fucking hate sounds so much. I get chills all over my body and I start to itch and I fucking LOSE IT.

We actually go over my results from the questionnaire and you can follow along with the chart posted here and in the show notes!\n\nHear the full episode wherever you get podcasts or the website:\n\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-misophonia-podcast/id1487323924\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/6BkNkAQh35gXklPng1Obfi?si=OZiBW5KhSEmEf76Im-mtCA\nWebsite: https://misophoniapodcast.com\n \nLinks:  \nsoundslikemisophonia.com", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2710, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Dr. Jane Gregory (Oxford) on the Misophonia Podcast", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/nllqez/dr_jane_gregory_oxford_on_the_misophonia_podcast/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "CrimsonIslands", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8h2oie6i", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621977360, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/nl08wo/classroom/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nl08wo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#b209d6", "link_flair_css_class": "venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "9420fff0-4011-11e9-bb6e-0eef35d07208", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/nl08wo/classroom/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1621977371, "score": 1, "selftext": "Behind me always sits this girl eating gum, in very annoying way.

I\u2019m struggling with my friend\u2019s throat clearing/coughing. Before we were roommates, I noticed she would sound like she\u2019s coughing up phlegm every time we\u2019d stay somewhere overnight and she was showering. I figured she was just clearing the phlegm out as most people do, so even though it did make me feel crazy, it would be over pretty quickly. As context, it was so loud that once when we stayed at another friend\u2019s house, that friend thought she was throwing up. To me it sounds like she\u2019s trying to clear something out of her throat, though.\n\nNow we live together and are both working from home. She usually has headphones in during the day so our apartment is really quiet most of the day. I wear headphones because I need sounds to be able to focus on work, but also because of the throat sounds now. I think she does need to clear her throat because of mucus but also I think it\u2019s a habit at this point because when she\u2019s distracted, she doesn\u2019t do it as often. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019d never noticed it other than during the morning before we lived together. She does take allergy pills and she said it\u2019s been helping but her throat clearing/coughing hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s like every 10 seconds there\u2019s either a throat clear or an aggressive cough. I know she doesn\u2019t mean it but unless I have headphones in, I\u2019m losing it. \n\nI don\u2019t really think there\u2019s anything I can do, but I just needed to vent. She knows I struggle with eating noises, and she does try to be considerate about that because her boyfriend also struggles with those sounds. I\u2019m so grateful to him for that because he\u2019s the one who told her she had to stop smacking (it used to be with like every bite \ud83d\ude25). The sound of eating chips and popcorn is still grating, but she tries to be quiet so I can\u2019t fault her. \n\nI\u2019m so glad there\u2019s a group for this! And that I\u2019m not just losing my mind and this is all a real thing. My mom still thinks I\u2019m making it up and will smack her gum more if I ask her to stop so I guess we all just have to take it a day at a time.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2708, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Throat clearing/Coughing", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/nkwic9/throat_clearingcoughing/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "miserable_banana_39", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_c17qipnv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621942411, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/nknjwr/i_have_a_strange_way_of_knowing_i_am_very/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nknjwr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#0079d3", "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b30b2d4e-4103-11e9-88ff-0ef3b569a21a", "link_flair_text": "Discussion / Question", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/nknjwr/i_have_a_strange_way_of_knowing_i_am_very/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1621942422, "score": 1, "selftext": "Alright this is going to be wierd.

Mouth noises and the like still bother me, but my main triggers are certain animal noises as well as babies. Dog barking being the worst, crying babies being the second. Meowing, certain birds chirping, and a slew of other things bother me too. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve been telling my mom for years how these sounds affect me and that I cannot be around them at all. She seems as though she understands, but then she goes and does something that entirely contradicts that point. (Example: Brings home a puppy the day after I tell her barking bothers me the most and can make me completely shut down mentally). Then she blames it on \u201cit\u2019s Satan he has a hold on you you have to keep praying or else this will never end\u201d. Guess what, I\u2019ve tried praying countless times for this torture to end, but God doesn\u2019t answer me. So her tactic doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019m not here to debate Christianity, but apparently people have been praying for me for years now and I myself have prayed but it doesn\u2019t change anything. \n\nThe \u201ctherapists\u201d here are useless, I stopped booking appointments with them long ago because it felt as if I were talking to a wall and not someone who was actually trying to understand. There was no progress being made. \n\nI had to move out of my parents house because they kept getting more dogs and cats despite me telling them COUNTLESS upon COUNTLESS times how the noise those animals make bothers me. Hearing a trigger that bad makes me suicidal and prone to self harm, also can lead to intense panic attacks. I think they assume I\u2019m just being over dramatic and am trying to control them. I\u2019ve attempted suicide a couple times because of my triggers, when my mom found out she handed me a bible and was really scared. \n\nI managed to move to a quiet home, but now my mom brings her dog here once in awhile and my sister brings her kitten who meows very loudly when it isn\u2019t given attention 24/7. So now I\u2019m just laying in my room trying to drown out the noise. What they do is they bring a pet over, ditch it inside the house with me, then they all go outside or straight up leave and let the pet sit here and make noise and just expect me to look after it or something? I have absolutely no understanding of their thought process. Her and my dad are scared that I\u2019m gonna kill my self, but whenever I tell them that it\u2019s the noise triggers that are making me this way they brush it off. \u201cOh, barking gives you panic attacks and makes you suicidal? That sucks. Omg. Anyway, wanna come over to our house where we have multiple rowdy noisy dogs?\u201d \n\nI texted my mom just now and asked her if she could take her kitten home because no one is watching it anyway and all it\u2019s doing is sitting there meowing loudly. She just replied with \u201comg\u201d and that\u2019s it. Like she\u2019s angry with me. She thinks I\u2019m being emotionally abusive whenever I tell her these things, then she ignores me. \n\nSo. People with parents who don\u2019t care. Do you just have to come to some sort of mutual understanding with eachother? Do you stop discussing the hearing problem with your parents entirely because it doesn\u2019t lead anywhere? Is there any hope of having anyone even trying to somewhat understand?

I'm happy for my mother that her shop is doing well, but I just wouldn't be able to handle it (especially because I'm in quarantine and there is a chance that my university won't open until 2021...). I'm so happy I've found this thread. &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 1597, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Worst news ever", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/h0k620/worst_news_ever/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "realdeal", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_flg9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1591813630, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/h0gupy/interview_with_dr_eric_storch_misophonia/", "gildings": {}, "id": "h0gupy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#0079d3", "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b30b2d4e-4103-11e9-88ff-0ef3b569a21a", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_metadata": {"xh5rj63jl4451": {"dashUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/h0gupy/asset/xh5rj63jl4451/DASHPlaylist.mpd?a=1594531346%2CNzYxZDRkNzE0NTMwMWU4NjFmZDViNWNlZjhmNDkwMmZjMDUzZGY5Zjc4Y2ZkY2Y1MjBiNjQ4MTkzM2IxYzk0Nw%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "e": "RedditVideo", "hlsUrl": "https://v.redd.it/link/h0gupy/asset/xh5rj63jl4451/HLSPlaylist.m3u8?a=1594531346%2COThiMjk1ZTQwMjRkYWVmYjUxMGE4MjY1ZDZmODM5YmMyMDhmM2YyODNlZDY3YmJkOGM4YTY0NzM0N2FiMDM0Yg%3D%3D&amp;v=1&amp;f=sd", "id": "xh5rj63jl4451", "isGif": false, "status": "valid", "x": 1080, "y": 1080}}, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/h0gupy/interview_with_dr_eric_storch_misophonia/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "YObNa_jKZ5l_T6dQo0wFtaCjMNQTl65jrcAYptRSs8U", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/STBROgc1hQHsdP2H6rBIbSlmWIqV8DJgHEpgukTV0Uc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09b1207acc33c260321453660e6e0acb7c3bff57", "width": 108}], "source": {"height": 200, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/STBROgc1hQHsdP2H6rBIbSlmWIqV8DJgHEpgukTV0Uc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=bfb20895584a9619c0c839b6fabe07b5f29f9fcb", "width": 200}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1591939347, "score": 6, "selftext": "Dr. Eric Storch is a clinical psychologist, vice chair of Psychology at the [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.facebook.com/BaylorCollegeOfMedicine/?__tn__=%2CdKH-R-R&amp;eid=ARDTuu6wH2ni3vu1dgkBHtfKENRl6uqFDyFv7tWA_upk5y2cMJfWKuLraKpjeBBvxSyqEmPCEAXFUxL7&amp;fref=mentions&amp;hc_location=group), and leading a study at Baylor on misophonia.

Since I live with my parents, it' s almost unbearable to eat with them. I feel absolutely terrible for getting so agry just because of something as trivial as chewing, but I can' t help it.\nI told my parents how I felt and what misophonia was, but they just told me to not research it anymore (I just googled it 1 time) and that it was all in my head, that absolutely every teen went through this at least once. My mother refused to let me eat apart from them. \nIt' s gotten even worse with the quarantine, I' m forced to eat with both my parents (I usually didn' t when I went to school because I was a bit rushed). My parents have absolutely no trouble in eating really close to me or doing loud sounds whilst chewing. I guess it' s exposure treatment... \nI feel terrible for feeling rage against them when they eat.

It sets my teeth on edge, and I get irrationally angered that they haven\u2019t had it removed.\n\nSo I\u2019m wondering if anyone can enlighten me as to what this falls under.

I am struggling inside. My anxiety has gotten way worse and it seems as the weeks go by my days off get shorter and shorter in dread going back to my job. I spend my days off looking at the clock waiting for \"Monday to start\" all over again.\n\nSo we have finished training this one new guy and that means the guy who works in the back office with me will return full-time meaning I will not have the office to myself anymore but on Saturdays which is his day off. I am in fight or flight all day long when he is back there. He sniffles loudly, coughs after he eats for hours, and randomly clears his throat so loud I jump in my chair and it is visible and so embarrassing.\n\nThere is also a problem I am having. I have acid reflux pretty bad and it settles in my throat and I have to clear it often (I know, how ironic that it's my biggest trigger too). I am not loud with it but I am scared to do it in front of other people. I can only cough and clear my throat when I am alone. I have no idea why I am like that, but I think it is a sympathy thing? Like I feel like everyone else is triggered by that sound so I try not to do it.\n\nThe past few months when I have been working once a week with this person I have skipped eating lunch because eating makes my throat worse. But now that he is returning full-time I can't just starve myself all day. I don't know what to do. I can't get comfortable making my own noises in front of others.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how I get over this?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 1483, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Monday Blues and Too much self-awareness to my own noises", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/gmss3a/monday_blues_and_too_much_selfawareness_to_my_own/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "reagan_baby", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bdd14", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1589895133, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/gmom8k/do_i_have_misophonia_or_am_i_just_a_jerk/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gmom8k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#33cc33", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "5b931b10-4038-11e9-9f72-0e3f9e09b804", "link_flair_text": "Support", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/gmom8k/do_i_have_misophonia_or_am_i_just_a_jerk/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1589895135, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just recently learned about misophonia after posting in r/relationships, seeking feedback on a roommate issue.\n\nMy roommate talks on the phone incessantly (seemingly). It makes me very exasperated, tense, and anxious. Someone in the thread suggested that I look into misophonia, and for the most part, I connect very strongly to what I have read. \n\nI am not effected by the more common triggers (chewing, and other bodily function noises) but the sound of my roommate talking on the phone sends me up a wall. My fight or flight definitely kicks in and I experience emotional distress and rage. I can't stop thinking about it. It's so bad that in the moments where she is not talking on the phone (she works three days a week), it's like I can't enjoy the quiet time enough, because I know that it will end soon.\n\nI am having a hard time feeling like I am not justified in my reaction to her though (my level of discomfort does, however, feel disproportionate). She talks loudly and basically puts on a performance every phone call. She digs deep in her belly to force out laughter, she squeals in reaction to things, and talks at a volume like she is trying to get the attention of a school bus full of kids. She speaks on speaker phone as well. This can go on for up to eight hours a day on four days out of the week, and at least three hours on the other days where she does work. She can be on the phone as early as 7:30am and as late as 10pm. She also wakes me up every morning with her coffee routine between 6am-7:30am or so, but that almost feels unrelated.\n\nI live in a 1,000 square foot apartment with two roommates total. It just seems unconscionable to create that much noise in a shared living space. It feels like the sound she creates takes up physical space and forces me to the corners of my own living space and I don't have any space for myself.\n\nBut I'm told I'm wrong haha. Which I get. \n\nReading about this disorder, I realize that I have experienced this sort of rage in other instances in my past. I have a distinct memory of feeling tortured by the sound of my dog whining. My cat meowing at me or pawing at things to get my attention also cut through me. I have at least three other specific memories of taking coach buses and wanting to die from listening to other people's conversations. I also feel like I feel claustrophobic easily, but do not know if that is attributable to sounds. The sound of my roommate's slippers on the floor is really aggravating, but I had been chalking that up to bitterness and resentment, until now.\n\nI have been keeping my air conditioner on the fan setting for over a year, not realizing that I was using that as white noise to cope. I have been wearing headphones that block out a fair amount of noise. I have been taking CBD and melatonin to feel less stress and get restful sleep. I plan errands out of the apartment on days she is there. I have been volunteering on days that she is not working (I am unemployed due to the pandemic). I plan long bike rides on days she is in the apartment.\n\nThis is by far the most challenging part of the quarantine for me, and it is so unexpected. My anger from this turns into resentment towards her - which I don't want. I feel like I am expending so much time and energy to cope around behavior that - to me - seems so selfish. She gets to act like herself and I don't get to. It feels unfair. \n\nThe fact that every piece of advice that I've read from google searches and my post in another sub is that I am wrong to feel this way and she is doing nothing wrong, makes me feel so disjointed from reality. So discovering this sub and the information on this disorder has been helpful.

For the past 4 years, I'd have extreme emotional reactions to chewing, jacket rustling, clattering pots, bass sounds from music, and many more. A month after discovering the name, I decided to tell my parents I think I have it, to hopefully resolve the frustration and damaged relationships I've caused. They were super understanding and supportive, offering to buy noise-cancelling earbuds, and go to a clinic after quarantine. I think this explained A LOT for them.\n\nBut something I've noticed is how much better it's gotten after I told them. I didn't know it could just go away like that. I still feel anger to chewing and a few other sounds, but to many less, and the reaction isn't as strong. I'm glad my tears and panic attacks and down to less, but I do have a fear;\n\nWhen I get tested, the results come back as negative. This means that my \"rudeness\", \"attention-seeking\" and \"over-reacting\" was all some selfish act. That there isn't some explanation for my outrageous behavior over the past 4 years due to the smallest sounds. My parents will probably think I just made an excuse to save myself.\n\nSomeone please help!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 1466, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why is my misophonia getting better all of a sudden?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/gl5id8/why_is_my_misophonia_getting_better_all_of_a/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "disguisedhealing", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_68zxcr4y", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1589609563, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/gkptfe/could_this_possibly_be_misophonia/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gkptfe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#33cc33", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "5b931b10-4038-11e9-9f72-0e3f9e09b804", "link_flair_text": "Support", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/gkptfe/could_this_possibly_be_misophonia/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1589609569, "score": 1, "selftext": "i posted about this in the anxiety subreddit and was pointed in this direction so i want to talk about what i am going through on here and see what you guys think. \n\ni have always been easily startled by loud noises, and it will take me some time to recover from them because of how anxious they make me. but lately i am not just anxious about loud noises, but practically any noises that are out of my control. \n\nhearing people walking around gives me anxiety attacks. the tv playing in the background makes me want to scream. when my stepsister opened and closed her door earlier i nearly bit myself to stop myself from crying or yelling. my mom just opened and closed the closet door and i did end up biting myself and afterwards i sat in bed and sobbed. \n\ni don't know what to do. i am constantly on edge and anxious because i live in a pretty noisy household - three people and two dogs. i'm desperate for relief. even when wearing earbuds listening to meditations or music it's as if i am hyper-aware of the noises i don't want to hear and i can't even concentrate on what i am listening to. it feels like torture, going through this all the time. \n\nso, is this maybe a misophonia thing?

After that had \u201csettled out,\u201d I began to notice that it bothered me when he would chew with his mouth open. I didn\u2019t think it was something anyone would care about, so I pretended it wasn\u2019t there. My depression and anxiety skyrocketed because of this, and I felt like there was nothing I could do about it. When I finally told my family about the sounds that bothered me, they didn\u2019t understand. And how could I blame them? I barely understood it myself. All my life sounds have given me certain feelings, but I never really noticed it. I read a really good book series called The Secret Series that I highly recommend. I especially recommend it to people who have synesthesia. The more I read, the more I realized that I was feelings all the sounds around me. Like how pattering rain on the roof made my skin tingle and the sound of drums made my head throb, I realized that the wretched feeling I felt when my father would smack his lips and chew his food was a type of synesthesia. I did research and learned that it was misophonia. It was nice to realize I wasn\u2019t alone. But the more I researched, the more I realized that I may be stuck with this for the rest of my life. There was no cure, and there wasn\u2019t much research on it in general.\n\nMy mom was obsessed with trying to fix me, but I was just a broken toy that could never be repaired. The more she tried, the more I fell apart. The misophonia got worse, and I couldn\u2019t have a meal with my family without breaking down and sobbing. I was so ashamed. I still am. I\u2019m an embarrassment to my family whenever we\u2019re eating. To ensure that I don\u2019t have a break down, I have to listen to music so loud that I can\u2019t hear anything. This created a huge rift between my family and me. I feel so paranoid when I\u2019m in public. I feel like people are staring at me, judging me. That girl, she\u2019s a stupid teenager that\u2019s too preoccupied with her music to even talk to her family. And sometimes I know that my father thinks that, too. No matter how many times I ask him to just try to chew with his mouth closed, he won\u2019t stop. Sometimes he\u2019ll stare at me, dead in the eye, while he chews. I feel selfish for hating him, but I can\u2019t help it. I know I should be grateful for everything that he does, but I can\u2019t when he looks at me like that. Sometimes I find myself thinking that I\u2019ll only achieve silence when I die. It pains me that I can\u2019t be stronger, but I\u2019ve been alone for so long.

Who woke you up you might be asking. Birds. Pigeons to be exact.

And it's infuriating to say the least.\n\nBy the time I realized they're not gonna stop with all the noise they're making, it was 9:20, I got up and went to \"their\" room to scare them away. So a least I could get a bit of quite. \n\n\nI live in a building and my nextdoor neighbors are the worst. They're always fighting in Russian, and every day with small breaks but without exceptions- morning, noon and night it sounds like someone's punching a punching bag or having a bowling match. I am so fed up with this bullshit. It was like this months before the stay at home order. Last night I placed a letter in their mail box to let them know we hear them everyday and it's very disturbing, asking them to be more considerate as we can't go anywhere to escape their noise.\n\nAt around 11am i fell back to sleep, then shortly after my mom wakes me up to let me know the neighbors are knocking on our door. She's not gonna answer it because she's in the midst of cooking and cleaning. Also she is not bothered by the noise. So she doesn't give a fuck.\n\nI told her I'm sleeping and fuck the neighbors. \nWhy the hell are they knocking on my door like they got something to say?! You guys are LOUD sthu, no more disturbance from you. Was that not clear?!\n\nTo top this whole shitshow of, today's my country independence celebration, because we're not really allowed to leave the house, they said on the news they would drive around cities with firetrucks blasting loud music. I hate that idea but I at least thought they'll do it at evening time.\n\nI was wrong. As soon as (it was more like 40-50 minutes) I fell back to sleep from knowing that our neighbors are idiots that can't form an idea in their stupid heads from a letter, I hear loud music. I swear I got tinnitus from staying home trying to sleep. It completely woke me up and by the time the firetruck lest my street it was only about 15 minutes but was enough for me to no be able to go back to sleep, which is fine, it's already late but it's clear now that the neighbors are just not a giving a fuck about me asking them to stop endlessly moving their furniture around until one of us dies, and keep living their best lives all while fucking up mine.\n\nClarification: the letter I sent was respectful and well adjusted to its audience. \n\nI have no problem waking up early, I'm just trying to fix my hours so galling asleep at around 3am last night- waking up to the worst party ever 6 hour later.\n\nAlso if my neighbors are so keen on talking they can send a letter. I'm not risking getting sick for them to have a fight. I have no doubt in my mind they want to pick up a fight, it's all they ever do.

She was the most polite and nice lady I'd ever met, and yet, the class of absolute hellspawn was brought upon her. That whole school year was a nightmare for myself, and for her.\n\nThat year, \"tech decks\"- or miniature desk skateboards that one uses their fingers to ride &amp; trick with- were all the rage, and kids used those things in class as the ultimate boredom killer. These horrible contraptions would clack and snap with every awful trick or movement that they made.\n\nAnd it drove me nuts.\n\nI didn't know what misophonia was at the time, but all I knew is that this sound drove me insane. I wanted to grab the little skateboard out of my tablemate's hand and chuck it. Both of my tablemates that year absolutely loved to use the heck out of these noisemachines, but one used them far more than the other.\n\nWhen they found out the sound irritated me though, they loved using them even more, and kept on doing it while looking me in the eye, laughing or smirking.\n\nI told my teacher many times that it was bothering me, and she often took away the tech dechs.\n\n The students would steal them back from inside of her desk, and when I told on them for *that*, they proceeded to verbally berate me the rest of the year for tattling and for being a \"narc\".\n\nThis unbearable situation- them playing qith their skateboards and them harassing me- kept up the whole schoolyear, and had eventually brought me to blow up in anger and then crumble into tears, to which the whole class witnessed and I ran out of the room sobbing.\n\nUsually my response to the noise was to get angry. I always shot them glares and talked very very angrily at them, but that only made the problem worse because they'd know their attempts at pissing me off had worked. I couldnt help getting angry though, and it was impossible for me to feel anything else other than searing rage. Looking back, I'm suprised that I didn't blow up more than once at them.\n\nAfter the whole blow-up-in-anger and crying thing, I was so ashamed and everyone thought I was just over-reacting. *I* thought I was over-reacting. I didnt even understand why I hated it so much and I hated myself for it.\n\nI hated myself for hating that sound, being a \"narc\" and not wanting them to play with those stupid things, not being able to \"ignore it\" like my councilors told me to every single goddamn time I came to them for help.\n\nI hated the councilors, and the students too, of course. I was really just filled of hate for that horrific year.\n\n.\n\nIt honestly hadn't \"clicked\" in my head that the tech-deck drama was started entirely because of my misohonia until last night when I read that line on that one vent post about \"ignoring it\".\n\n I still hate my councilor to this day for constantly telling me that. There are so many journal entries from that time, furiously written in caps about how that's impossible and my ears can't help but hear it and that it was impossible not to react to, and how miserable I was.\n\nI can still imagine the kids saying that theyre not doing anything, its not bothering anyone, and asking what the hell I was being so angry for.\n\nI wish I knew what misohonia was earlier, so that I could have made that connection and told the councilor that I wasnt just \"annoyed\" by the noise and being a brat, but that I had an actual legitimate issue that I had absolutely no control over.\n\nI only found out what misophonia was much later, though, once the sound of eating started to bother me, and that was a whole 'nother issue. I was out of physical school by the time I learned what it was, I think.\n\nI was moved to an online school, so I haven't has to deal with shit like that for a while, but... yeah...\n\n.\n\n\nToday, I keep wondering things like \"What if I had explained what misophonia was to the councilors, and that my stress reactions towards their tech deck shenanigans were uncontrollable? \n\nWhat if I had asked them to just BAN tech decks for being \"\"distracting\"\" before it all got so far?\n\nWhat if I explained to my teacher what misophonia was? Explained to the students who bothered me? (But that might have backlashed and made it even worse... Theyd probably try making other sounds to piss me off. Ugh.)\n\nI always came to my teacher, and only ever begged the councilors for help at the end of the year. They didnt want to bother with it because it was straight-up the end of the year..\n\n..But what if I had seeked their help at the begining?\n\nI felt it would extreme to ask the *councilors* for help at the begining, but really. What if I had just taken that \"extreme\" action? Would they still have ignored me if there was a lot of time left in the year?\"\n\nNo use thinking about any of that now, I guess, but god is it hard not to imagine confronting the councilors or kids and what I'd say if I could see them today.\n\nAnyway.. yeah..\n\nI dont know how to end this, but I hope I never have to be seated next to that shitbag ever again.\n\n\nActually, yknow what? Now that I think about it, why the hell was my seat never moved away from that guy?? Did I ever ask to mive away from him? I have no idea!! But why weren't we moved??

(Tried to avoid using the \"b\" word associated with the sound in this post. because it might be triggering.)\n\nSO. This morning I had a horrible nightmare about a fly. The nightmare went as follows:\n\nI kept trying to throw something away in my kitchen trashcan, but whenever I opened the lid, a fly trapped inside the trashcan started making noise, or got louder and louder with each open of the lid, so I shut it again. It was trapped, but I couldnt see it so I couldnt do anything about it, but I also didnt want to dig through the trash and release it because that would require getting closer to the trashcan to sift through the garbage! In the dream I was just about to ask my mom for help with vanquishing the horrible beast before I woke up.\n\nWell, I got up out of bed this morning, after the dream, and eventually, after about 2 hours, I came back to my bedroom and settled down on my bed...\n\nAnd then I heard it. The damn fly. I heard it incredibly loudly, like it was tight behind my head and I jumped up and ran to the door of my bedroom and scanned the room for it.\n\nNOTHING.\n\nI assumed it was an auditory hallucination bc all morning I had been extremely tense bc of the nightmare, and the sound had gone off for only a short while.\n\nBut just 5 minutes ago, guess who I saw? Yeah! You already know who!\n\nI got my sister to vanquish it, and it was suprisingly small for its horribly loud noise, but it's gone at last and I am at peace.\n\nIm just pissed that I had to have a whole nightmare about it. That was absolutely horrinle.  I'd never experienced  the whole, \"hearing something in a dream thats actually going on in real life\" before, but I guess now I have!\n\nAnd I hope I never have to again, if it's gonna be another fly!! \n\nI am absolutely not looking foward to summer because we get an ABUNDANCE of them, and I am surely going to suffer.

We went out shopping for our usual groceries and decided to get frozen yogurt on the way home. The problem is he SLURPS IT SO LOUD.

So of course he mimicks me and dramatically grabs a napkin (they gave us extra when we got the frozen yogurt) so I lost it and basically yelled \"IT'S A REAL DISORDER WILL YOU STOP!??\" and he screams back \"I DIDNT FUCKING DO ANYTHING EXCEPT TRY TO BREATHE BY GETTING A TISSUE TO BLOW MY NOSE\"\n\nIS HE FUCKING SERIOUS?

This might be a new experience for both of us, but I think it will be a good one :)\n\nThank you!\n\nSkyler verch\n\nArizona State University", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 1330, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "To Whom it may concern,", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/g4bpet/to_whom_it_may_concern/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "esnypaige", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5ljd46il", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1587178500, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/g3g8r9/so_sick_of_my_experiences_and_feelings_being/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g3g8r9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#b209d6", "link_flair_css_class": "venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "9420fff0-4011-11e9-bb6e-0eef35d07208", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/g3g8r9/so_sick_of_my_experiences_and_feelings_being/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1587183730, "score": 6, "selftext": "I\u2019ve shed so many tears over this fucking condition.

He then proceeded to tell me how many times I \u201chaven\u2019t noticed\u201d him swallowing. I fucking notice!!! When we spend time together, the whole time is spent in emotional turmoil for me. He swallows SO much and it tortures me. I notice it ALL. THE. TIME. when we are together.

So the only things that really trigger me are certain mouth sounds that my dad makes. There's one that is the absolute worst for me - the one that drives me up a fucking wall - and he just made that sound. As he made the sound, I wasn't facing him, but just sat there in silence, absolutely fuming, and trying my hardest not to explode into tears. He hasn't done it in a little while and I am now here by myself and crying. As far as misophonia goes, I'm not \"out\" to anyone. I really want to tell my dad so that he would (hopefully) stop or try to stop making the sounds but for whatever reason my brain just *will not* allow me to ever say anything about it, despite how much it drives me insane. I have no clue what my fucking problem is. But it drives me absolutely crazy. I'm pretty sure that with most cases of misophonia, people just have outbursts and are unable to control those outbursts. With me, though, I wish I could just let out the emotions and cry, but my brain just internalizes the anger and that feeling of wanting to explode, and I just wait until I'm alone to release it all. Does this happen with anyone else where that one part of you just can't tell the person making the trigger sound that it triggers you? Was this the case for some of you at one point but were able to tell them eventually?

First it was stomping, moving furniture, something falling etc. Basic noises you hear in every building. In summer it stopped  or I didn't notice those noises, but about two months ago they started  again... worse than every.\n\nIt  feels like I hear every single door opening/closing loudly, stomping and  every other noises as well. It's daily and the situation ATM is so bad  that being at home is mostly stressful, terrifying and it gives anxiety.  Those sounds trigger me so much, that every time I hear door closing all  my concentration goes to that noise and I just start thinking about  when the next noise comes or long this noise\"marathon\" will last this  time. It feels like I'm in constant stressmode. Few times I couldn't  just stand it and I had to flee... my own home. Going outside helps  little but anxiety comes back every time I get back to my building. At night is more peaceful.\n\nThose  noises are already so deep in my mind that even putting volume higher  when watching movies, doesn't help, I will hear those noises trough  almost anything. Even going to my friends place doesn't help, because those noises are so normal, that they exist basically every where.\n\nToday  I met my social worker and I mentioned those noises to her. She asked  how many days in the past month were \"noise stress free\" and I said  maybe couple. She seemed bit worried about my answer.\n\nMaybe  a week ago, when I fleed my place, I just wandered about 30min outside, almost went  to a bar for a drink.  I just called distress call to my friend, something I never done before. He  answered and we talked a while. After the call I was way more calm.  Now, when I think about what those noises have done to me, I'm scared. I  never called that way to anyone, I never had an urge flee my home and I  never felt anxiety when getting back to home.\n\nI  got my doctors and nurses appointment in next month, so that's good but  it's still agony be at home. I haven't had a chance yet to mention this to a doctor.\n\nIs this misophonia?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2166, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Noises in my building are driving me crazy", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jxvn5y/noises_in_my_building_are_driving_me_crazy/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Ladicius_-", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1qttno34", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605893853, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jxtjru/how_do_i_tell_my_parents_that_its_impossible_to/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jxtjru", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#33cc33", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "5b931b10-4038-11e9-9f72-0e3f9e09b804", "link_flair_text": "Support / Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jxtjru/how_do_i_tell_my_parents_that_its_impossible_to/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 6, "retrieved_on": 1605893864, "score": 1, "selftext": "Every meal for the duration of my 18 year old life I have been plagued by misophonia.

I haven't been officially diagnosed with misophonia, but I know without a shadow of a doubt I have it. I've always been noise sensitive, even as a young kid. My triggers are frequency noises, or humming pitches. You'd be surprised how many normal things make some sort of these noises! Our dishwasher makes an almost indiscernible high pitch frequency while it runs, during which I don a pair of noise cancelling headphones. Watching a movie in the living room is a chore sometimes, because depending on the cycle, the sound of the refrigerator running can send me into a god damn rage. \n\nMy husband, bless him, doesn't make me feel bad about my constant anxiety (\"do you hear that?\" \"HOW do you not hear that?\" \"Where is that sound coming from??\"). We were watching a movie recently and I had to pause the movie and spend 15 minutes searching for some high pitched noise coming from somewhere, until I realized it was coming from his PS4 that was left on, clear across the entire room. He was astonished I could hear it from THAT far away, over the volume of the movie. It's hard to explain exactly HOW I hear these noises, but it's just like my brain is tuned into them like a radio station. If they're happening, I can hear them. And while they're happening, that's ALL my brain can focus on. Cars driving down the street half a mile away? I can hear the hum of the engine, and lord help me if it happens while I'm laying in bed. I can't sleep anymore. Fans for white noise? I can hear the motor. The small, normal noise of even a fan running is enough to send me in a panic. Do you know how many fans I've purchased, because the previous one became too \"noisy?\" About 5. They're all in rotation, waiting for their turn when another one starts \"acting up.\" \n\nMost recently it's been our outdoor AC unit, which is installed RIGHT OUTSIDE OUR FUCKING BEDROOM WINDOW. What demented builder decided that was the best place to put something so noisy??? Something has happened recently where the metal fans are misaligned, and are creating a very subtle frequency that apparently no one can hear but me. After a week of sleeplessness, I broke down to my husband about it. He isn't excited about the expense, but we've agreed to move the unit far enough away that I can't hear it. A very expensive solution to an otherwise non-problem (he can't even hear the noise I'm talking about, but he believes me). I know it'll just be some other noise down the line, but. Baby steps.\n\nHaving a shared office space at work has been the biggest struggle. One neighbor to the left of me hammers his enter key like he's punishing it for insulting his wife. clackclackclackclackclackBAM. clackclackclackclackBAM. The other neighbor to the right of me plays music on her computer, out loud, and hums out of tune and whistles. And okay, to be fair, the radio thing would probably bother anyone. But this is a vent post and I'm just getting it all out of my system, lol. \n\nThis post doesn't have a point, but I'm glad to have found this community. I've spent so many years feeling so alone and helpless. Like I was crazy.

When your Misophonia is severe, then that means when you hear your triggers you often react with rage, anger, and other things. It's hard for me and although I don't get \\*those\\* thoughts I always wish that I never had this disorder. Everyone in my family except for my sister always chew loudly. My dad is the worst of all. His chewing is so bad that I'd have to go up upstairs, which results in me missing instructional learning. My mom lip smacks WAYYYY TOO MUCH. Sips drink? \\*smack\\*. Eating? \\*smack smack smack\\*. And the worst part is when she talks with her mouth full. When she does that that's when I get really angry too point that I'd grab my headphones and blast music at a high volume. Oh and I forgot to mention, she talks so loud, so when she talks with her mouth full you can hear it from the basement, your room, pretty much anywhere. My mom claims that she lip smacks because \"there's something wrong with her left tooth/teeth\". The part that I get mad about is every time I try zooming (for school) that's when everyone wanna eat, ESPECIALLY when my break is almost over. I tried asking my mom If I can zoom somewhere else, but of course her entitled ass said no. The thing is that last school year back in Spring, I was doing so much better because I was in the living room, but because of gRaDeS I got put into the kitchen, the place I was avoiding. My mom wouldn't even let me zoom in my room because it was really messy, but no one even cares about your room! They only care about you getting their work done. So ever since I've been in the kitchen, this caused me to get some zeros. Once my mom lip smacked LOUDLY on purpose because she thinks it's \"funny\" because teehee mocking someone's disorder is SOOOOO FUNNNY! XDXD. When someone would start eating I would immediately cover my ears, and then rage would fill me because I'd think of the person eating doing this on purpose, and why they didn't eat at the beginning of my break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk ending the bad part, and let's start with the good part. I told my dad that I didn't like chewing, so now every time I was around he would take his food with him and go downstairs into the basement. What a great dad! Since me getting triggered from chewing was \"annoying\" my mom, she set up my desk for me, and put in as far as possible from the table (FYI the kitchen and the family room are connected)! A few days ago when my dad and mom were eating, I couldn't hear anything! I'm surprised I couldn't hear my dad's chewing, since he chews REALLY loud. Finally, less of my triggers being triggered.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2163, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Venting", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jwhxd7/venting/", "whitelist_status": "all_ads", "wls": 6}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "armandxhaja86", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_yh3innx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605686315, "domain": "youtu.be", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/jwbtay/this_is_me_i_guess_this_is_us_its_sort_of/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jwbtay", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "2829e1b8-941c-11e9-8e50-0e3610acc80c", "link_flair_text": "Positivity", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "Skavlan", "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/SkavlanTV", "height": 338, "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RStbYLPxBT8?start=250&amp;feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

Good times.  I\u2019d say it\u2019s been close to a year of suffering for me, yet I\u2019ve decided to face it head on in these last few months. \nThe year before, I had new neighbors move down below. The previous ones had a beagle..nuff said.  The new ones were at least nice and train their dog, thank god for that. \nThe basketball is what really gets to me and I find myself pretty angry and anxious after a good period of this kind of noise. I was tired suffering.  Certainly had ideas of screaming out the window; but I\u2019d rather not be \u201cthat crazy neighbor.\u201d \nSo here\u2019s some things I suggest. \n\n\n I highly recommend you check out guided imagery from a lady called Belleruth Naperstak. Don\u2019t be put off by that crazy name as she is a godsend. The majority of her stuff is on Apple Music along with some on Spotify. She has it all, and it\u2019s helped me greatly. Still a work in progress, but her PTSD one is beyond soothing at the end of the day. She also has them for anxiety, anger, sleep; you name it. Not affiliated with her, although I wish I was! \n\nBinaural beats and noise canceling headphones are your friend.  Top of the line Bose have been with me since forever. \nPack that in with regular exercise and sleep.  If the triggering noise begins. Grab those headphones and beats. Or just watch some Netflix until it stops. \nMy favorite artist that helps calm my nerves is Nujabes :) \n\nDon\u2019t let this own you!   You\u2019re in control more than you think.  I just had a great sit down with some binaural beats after the basket ball began to bounce today.  , I already feel at ease after just 30 min of listening. I\u2019ll be doing that daily from now on.  I also suggest quiet activities with reading and soft ASMR sounds to accompany you before bed. I love the rain/thunderstorm ones. It\u2019s all about management and forming good habits for your mind and body. \n\nI cannot emphasize a good nights sleep enough. Get to bed a bit early and relax with a novel. Light a candle, say a prayer if that\u2019s your thing and I promise you will feel settled even from that. Belleruth has a sleep imagery that is from the heavens itself. \n\nSleep Essentials for me:\nA fan\nEar plugs \nA decent blue tooth speaker with gentle sounds playing all night, I go with rainy afternoon or campfire. \nThis combination has helped me so much. \n\nPlease feel free to share your stories and vent. It\u2019s ok. Believe me I\u2019ve been ashamed to admit to friends in the past. I\u2019ve opened up to them in the last year; and have achieved a great support system which is Another tool to help manage this.

My father is my main \"trigger-person\" and the way he chews when we have lunch together may cause me strong feelings of anger and anxiety, he also made the habit of doing mouth noises all of sudden, which led me to feel distress and anger to the point that I had to resist not to hurt him or myself.\n\nAfter my family and I went to the doctor and he explained misophonia better, my dad gradually triggered me less times, today we don't have family meals together like we used to, and he stopped doing the mouth sounds, at least when I'm nearby, and it's been weeks since the last time he triggered  me or that I felt strong anger from a trigger at all. \n\nEven though it's a great thing I don't feel anger anymore, I've been feeling puzzled wether I still have misophonia or not. One day I was checking on another subreddit that I don't remember the exact name, but it was about transexual people, the thing is one of the posts was titled \"Am I really transexual?\" or something like this, in which the OP said they were sure at some point they were transexual, but then they stopped to think \"Am I really transexual?\", and again were soon sure about it afterwards. Someone in the comment section said it could be \"Impostor Syndrome\", the thing is I've been feeling the same way than the OP, but with misophonia.\n\nYet I do have other people that trigger me, most triggers being chewing and noise/breathing noises, they cause me certain distress and anxiety at some point, but manageable most of times, if the sound overwhelms too much, I'll just get some distance, and none has led me to the intense anger I felt when my father used to trigger me, and I'm not triggered every time they happen and might depend on the time I'm exposed to them. This dilemma is making it confused to me to understand myself and to be sure if I still have misophonia and I would like to know your thoughts on that. \n\nHas any of you had a similar experience where your main trigger is gone ?\n\nHas any of you stopped feeling anger from your misophonia ?\n\nHas any of you experienced \"Impostor Syndrome\" or something similar from having misophonia ?\n\nThanks for reading !", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2981, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "spoiler", "title": "Successfully adapting to misophonia and feeling Impostor Syndrome.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/perqom/successfully_adapting_to_misophonia_and_feeling/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "itsthecircumstances", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_567s56i8", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1630291463, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/pe9eib/misophonia_is_so_debilitating_and_annoying_and_i/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pe9eib", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#b209d6", "link_flair_css_class": "venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "9420fff0-4011-11e9-bb6e-0eef35d07208", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/pe9eib/misophonia_is_so_debilitating_and_annoying_and_i/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1630291474, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve dealt with this thing for like the past 8 years.

But she signed me up to talk to a concealer, but that's not for another week iirc ;W;. \n\nEven right now I'm basically freaking out just out of fear (or anxiety idk) but I won't be surprised if I have to \"go to the bathroom\" to freak out in \"private\". \n\nWhat already doesn't make it easy is that I have adhd and that already so school is basically impossible. I've thought of trying to do it online but I failed the first half of 9th grade because I couldn't be self motivated enough to do work because adhd, I thought of doing alternate school, but I've never tried that and I'm worried it'll end up badly. \n\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2969, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It caused me to fail some of my classes, and I'm scared it will again help", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/pb7ksu/it_caused_me_to_fail_some_of_my_classes_and_im/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Beginning_Beat_5289", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ansfj1pr", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1629790837, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/painsc/podcast/", "gildings": {}, "id": "painsc", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#b209d6", "link_flair_css_class": "venting", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "9420fff0-4011-11e9-bb6e-0eef35d07208", "link_flair_text": "Venting", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/painsc/podcast/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1629790848, "score": 1, "selftext": "I found this podcast on spotify and it is horrible.

He chews exclusively with his mouth open and smacks his lips almost cartoonishly. He is constantly talking under his breath, or talking loudly in his room to friends or himself, and has his TV's volume up very loud as well. Basically half the things he does trigger me, and so whenever I'm awake and he's in the house it's a never-ending barrage of being triggered.\n\nI've tried explaining these things to him, and he *says* he'll try and work on them or keep it down, but that lasts about a day if I'm lucky before it starts right back up again. We've tried making arrangements (if I'm in the living room and he comes up to eat, he should eat in his room to avoid triggering my misophonia. If he's already in the living room/eating, I should stay in my room.) but he doesn't respect them. He knows what misophonia is but still seems to take everything personally, and acts like me or my other roommates (one of whom is his sibling) reminding him to be mindful is a personal slight against him. And I mean, with how he's been acting, it sure is starting to be. He's blown up at his own sibling twice over this. I can't just move out (it's a long story but I am disabled + subsequently on a very limited income + have nowhere else I can be) and I don't have the opportunity to leave the house when he's here very much, so often I feel like I'm trapped. Recently him triggering me has started to cause me to dissociate and go mute, and for lack of better term I just feel trapped in my body. I can't move, I can't speak, the only thing that exists is the triggering noise in question, and when it's a constant barrage of noise, well, I can barely function. And it isn't just during the day, either. He stays up until anywhere from 1 to 3 in the morning, always making noise. I never get an escape.\n\nI don't know what to do about this situation anymore. I'm at my wit's end. I have a noise machine going on in my room pretty much constantly to try and mask the noise coming from him (his room is right above mine) but sometimes it isn't enough, and other times the noise from the machine itself becomes overwhelming and brings me into sensory overload. When I'm not in my room, I usually have to have headphones on, but even though they're noise-blocking sometimes even *they* aren't enough to keep his voice out (and I don't want to turn the volume up so loud it causes me hearing damage, and again it, too, becomes overwhelming)\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?

My family always has family meals and we talk during them and stuff so most of the time it's bearable. I do get very irritated when I am in a bad mood or not doing so great though and also when things are too close to my ears (eg my bf snacking while we watch a movie in bed). \n\nHowever I have a definite focus on triggers produced by my dad. Like very very hard focus. With my mom or my bf things are fine until I'm not and just moving to the other side of the table can help a lot. But my dad only needs to breathe the wrong way on the other side of the room for me to ram my nails into my hands so I don't scream. Things like the distance between his lips when talking or the way he rubs his fingers together when talking trigger me. Even just the pa\u00edses in his speech make me irrationally angry. \n\nI read somewhere on this subreddit (or just the misophonia one) that people can develop heavier reactions for people they are close to because we have them more so I think it might be that but he isn't the closest one to me out of the three. The only difference that I can think of is that mom and bf know about this and respect my struggles and try not to trigger me and stuff. Ever since I told my dad he doesn't seem to remember. When I look miserable at the dinner table and try to hold my ear shut he's puzzled as if I spontaneously disappeared. \n\nDo other people experience this heavy focus as well and if so are there any ways to soothe it or get rid of it or am I just stuck with this?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 2942, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Heavy triggers for a specific person?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/p5dbim/heavy_triggers_for_a_specific_person/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Sea-Big-4850", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8ro0t9qz", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1629052088, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/p4ywdq/i_need_advice_for_solutions_to_help_with/", "gildings": {}, "id": "p4ywdq", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/p4ywdq/i_need_advice_for_solutions_to_help_with/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1629052098, "score": 1, "selftext": "When I was a child (age 3-9) years, I had severe hyperacusis (Sound sensitivity disorder where everything seemed extremely loud.) I actually still have hyperacusis although wearing earplugs has helped a lot with everyday sounds such as car horns, industrial work, barking dogs etc. Although my sound sensitivity isn't as bad anymore, the Misophonia has developed from psychological trauma (not ptsd luckily).\n\nWhen I was at nursery, I was diagnosed with ADHD, Aspergers. In nursery/pre school, I was trapped in a room full of children screaming and shouting, just generally being as loud as they can, it was excruciatingly painful for me. When I could finally talk, My mum took me out of nursery to care for me, I was homeschooled until I was 9, where I joined school for the first time. I actually in the end had a good time at school, although it is still hard to this day (now 15 years old)\n\nThis caused me to develop misophonia about Loud laughter (usually group), Cheering (football crowds, concerts and celebrations) and just generally very loud people screaming. These things I see and hear A LOT on social media, I experience fear, and large amounts of stress when I see these things.\n\nThe worst thing about it is that I also get strong visual triggers from these things (misokinesia?). The things that triggers me most are the Gaping mouths (which reminds me of people being loud, causing pain when younger.) Of people when celebrating and cheering/screaming their heads off with excitement. For example, I cannot stand the FIFA 21 cover where Mbappe on the cover is shown screaming with his mouth wide open, or athletes lifting the cup after winning a game while they all go mad with their cheering. The laughter is the same thing, usually when people start shaking and leaning their heads back/Teeth bared, gaping their mouths, making an absolute racket. For instance search up **\"Zias laughing meme.\"** This is honestly so debilitating for me in my everyday life, restricting many activities I do, I can't enter busy restaurants in evening, nor can I walk past pubs late at night, I can't even watch TV adverts in case an ad comes on that triggers me, nor can I watch certain programmes such as most comedies containing canned laughter, love island, Britains got talent etc. My worst thing about it is I can't go in big meet-ups with my mates or go partying which makes me feel isolated and lonely as nobody understands. At school I experience it all the time too which also makes my life very difficult.\n\nI know people are just enjoying themselves and are doing nothing to hurt me whenever they express themselves in this way, and it saddens me that this sort of joy upsets me, it also upsets and guilts me that I can't be happy for them, Fr I wish I could be...\n\n**Has anybody else had any therapy for misophonia which has helped them get over their phobias, if so, what sort of therapy and how long will it take. I would be so grateful if anyone has any advice for help? I would even be grateful if anyone can relate to me in any way, because I feel really isolated with this\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc.** I want to just go out and watch sport, get turnt at parties and live life like normal.\n\nTo anyone reading this, I hope you have a great day.

A few hours later, some family members came over for a get together and (after showing and dressing) I proceeded to meet with them in the kitchen (along with my mother who was already sat down). Within minutes it was clear I was the only sober one there and trigger sounds were going to be a problem, with a large snack bowl in the centre of the table filled with bread sticks. I've told pretty much all of my family that I have misophonia, and as a result most of them were careful to close their mouths whilst eating. This however, notably exempt my mother who took it upon herself to make as many trigger sounds as she could in such a short space of time. Added onto this, she purposefully began rubbing my back/shoulders without washing her hands first (after eating), which is one of my big OCDic triggers rolled into one (grease/bacteria + physical contact in general). I told her multiple times that what she was doing was bothering me, she knows more than anyone else about my triggers ect., and despite my admittedly weak protests she insisted I stay at the table. Unfortunately the triggers didn't stop, and after I told her to stop eating whilst talking (by this point I was next to her making coffee, she was seated next to my standing position) she opened her mouth and began to make the most triggering combination of sounds I've ever encountered (while spitting food everywhere, OCD trigger) and I'm ashamed to say that I slapped her in the heat of the moment. Shocked, she proceeded to leave her seat and loudly made a scene about what had happened to my other family members before instructing them all to leave the room and join her in the garden. I chose at that moment to finish making the coffee, went upstairs and had an anxiety filled 'am I a bad person' conversation with my friend (she also struggles with various mental disorders) before returning to a fever induced, nightmare filled nap. Later my father came up and basically told me he understood that I knew physically hurting a family member was unacceptable (which I absolutely do know, make no mistake) but that I'd have to win my mother over somehow, adding that I should leave a room if I was triggered (thanks for stating the obvious). The problem I have now is that I have basically no idea of what to do (context: I haven't spoken to her or any other family yet), I feel like I really should apologise for snapping, but at the same time I feel that I need an apology myself, triggers aren't a joke, they aren't funny, it's a testament to my will power that this is the first time I've ever physically hurt someone/thing over triggers, and my mother really shouldn't have acted in the way she did, being 'tipsy' isn't an excuse.

I could really use some help to figure out what my condition is. Throughout my life I have found various noises I absolutely hate that other people usually don't. These include chewing noises, scrunching tissue paper, markers writing on paper, etc. This was especially highlighted to me when I moved into an apartments with 3 of my friends. I eat food without making any noise and have done so ever since I was little so I thought it was how everybody ate, however all 3 of my flatmates chew really loudly to the point where I can hear their chewing noises from across the room and it really gets to my nerves so much that I usually have to move to another room or put in earphones. I asked them how they could stand the noises of each other's chewing and they told me that they don't really mind it, which was really shocking to me.\n\nAnother interesting case was when I stumbled upon an ASMR video with the focus being markers writing on paper. I couldn't last more than 30 seconds without pausing the video and going to the comments to see how much people hated the noise only to find out that people loved that video.\n\nI searched on the internet and found this subreddit. Initially after reading the symptoms I thought that I had misophonia, however, after reading through some of the posts I am kind of confused. I see a lot of people discussing about how people have attacks or get anxiety because of sounds they dislike. I don't really relate to some of the extreme posts on here, as in the attacks I get are really unpleasant but they don't really have a lasting impact and only stay for the duration of the noise. Different sounds have different reactions. Whenever I hear markers writing on paper or anything similar (as in something as shrill as that) I just feel a really unpleasant feeling up my spine, sort of like a tingle that I can't really stand, along with my ears hurting. Whenever I hear someone chewing loudly I just get really annoyed and irritated, sometimes even outright angry. With tissue paper it's gotten to the point where I cannot even hold a tissue paper without feeling really unpleasant, I hate the sound it makes as well as the feel.\n\nHowever my symptoms aren't really too severe. Whenever I hear these sounds I feel really really unpleasant, but never get anxiety. On top of that, once the noise ends I can carry on like normal.\n\nI could really use some help to figure out whether I actually have misophonia or not and if I do whether it's something I could fix or something I should be concerned about", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "misophoniasupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_3idz6", "subreddit_subscribers": 1299, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Confused about my condition", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/g0jjw1/confused_about_my_condition/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "necolea_camp", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_678d2s18", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1586753945, "domain": "self.misophoniasupport", "edited": 1586812593, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/misophoniasupport/comments/g0caz2/misophonia_and_college/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g0caz2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#33cc33", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "5b931b10-4038-11e9-9f72-0e3f9e09b804", "link_flair_text": "Support", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/misophoniasupport/comments/g0caz2/misophonia_and_college/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1586842201, "score": 2, "selftext": "Come September I will be moving away for college.

After crying in my room for a while, I looked up anything about misophonia to send to my mom in terms she could understand. I sent a link to her with no context because I couldn't bear saying anything more. Well, she got mad at me for that too. Like, really mad. She said that I need to talk to her like an adult, etc etc... I had to explain through my immense crying that I cant explain it. If you read the article, it even says, \"Many of those with misophonia can't describe exactly what their illness makes them feel\" or something along those lines. She stormed off, still angry after my explanation, and I thought I was done for. I thought that my credibility had just been taken away and she would never understand. Today, however, my older brother (disgusting chewer- unbearable. can't even look at his plate without thinking of how loud it would be if he decided to put it in his mouth) took a chocolate cupcake and started eating it in the living room. I was sitting with my mom and my brother came near me so I went across the room. He followed me again, probably subconsciously. I almost exploded, but I controlled myself rather well and said, \"I'm moving further away because you're chewing, so please stop.\" As brothers do, he wanted to annoy me and, with a mouthful of cupcake, said \"Why?\" and I left. Immediately. My mom then said \"She has a disorder that makes her unable to listen to chewing noises. I forgot the name of it. It's a genuine disorder.\" I tried to explain to said brother how much pain his chewing really brings me, but he's really insensitive and just said, with cupcake STILL in his mouth, \"Do you have fetal alcohol syndrome?\"... So here I am, in my room, using my stress relief (guitar) because he nearly tipped me over the edge. None the less, my mom read the article and explained misophonia in her own words, and that means a lot to me. My mom is one of the worst chewers in my family but, since the article, she has not been eating around me unless I am eating as well. It feels really good to be normal. Though, I'm still reminded of it when we are eating because she always says, \"I'm trying not to chew loud\". Counter-productive, but I know she's doing what she can to help me and I can't help but appreciate it, even if she fails sometimes.\nThanks for reading this far&lt;3.

Unfortunately for me, my ENTIRE family makes at least one of these noises. And all of them make the one that annoys me the most, eating really loudly.\nI don\u2019t even know how to handle it. I hate being home right now. I\u2019ll be relaxing on the couch and then someone will sit there and eat and annoy the f**k out of me. I hate it. And they all make different noises that push my buttons in different ways. And, to make it all worse, my sisters make me watch a movie with them every night, and I can\u2019t handle it anymore. I can barely hear the tv because of they incessant chewing and lip smacking. It\u2019s like none of them learned to eat with their mouths closed.\nMy oldest sister can barely sneeze into her shoulder or remember to wash her hands (both of which are very crucial in times like these). Luckily, she\u2019s learning to sneeze into her shoulder after I kept on reminding her.\nThen there\u2019s the nose rubbing/\u201cscratching\u201d as they call it. I use one finger to scratch my nose, they just all out rub their entire hand on top of it, or my oldest sister uses a fist under her nose. I don\u2019t understand it. It makes their disgusting scratchy sound and I can\u2019t stand it. \nThen the throat thing. While it\u2019s very mild and infrequent, it\u2019s still annoying as heck. My 3rd older sister makes the sound.

He always speaks really loudly like he just needs to assert his dominance in the room or some shit, but holy crap, he really brings out his consonants too. They're loud, they whistle, and it makes me want to scream in his face. But that's not all. My dad is the kind of person who will talk at someone for hours. Like seriously. When I was little, all I had to do was mention something I noticed or ask a small question out of curiosity, and next thing I knew he would be lecturing me for god knows how long over his point of view on the matter. That's why I can barely even talk to him nowadays. When I think of something I want to say around him, or something funny I noticed about something, I just have to force myself not to say it, because if I do, he will elaborate on whatever I said for the next 30 minutes. And I cant deal with that now. When I was little, I didn't have misophonia. But now I do. \n\nOne thing I will say is that he does know about my misophonia and he does try to be supportive of it most of the time. I feel bad for not mentioning that yet, because I think it's something that most people dont have. I am so incredibly thankful for it. But still, it doesn't mean I can just change the way he talks. He has even tried to do that by talking quieter, but that just brings out his consonance sounds even more. So now whenever I'm around him I just have to wear headphones with white noise blaring into my ears. This is why I usually stay in my room all day. It's safe. But it's also getting real cramped, especially with this self isolation stuff going on. \n\nTo top it all off, right now, hes in the living room, probably 15 feet away from my door, talking at my grandma with his loud ass voice about whatever. Hes been doing it ever since I woke up about an hour ago. Its 9:24am. I just want to have a nice, peaceful start to the morning without hearing him or having to wrap headphones around my head while I lay on my pillow. Yesterday I was having a meltdown in the morning so I didnt have any motivation to tackle my schoolwork, which I now need to make up for today. At the very least, I want to be motivated to do it. But no. I'm getting angrier every minute. I cant just ask him to stop, because he will tell me to put my headphones on. Is it really worth me stopping his conversation so I can sleep easily?

saw the no venting rule, but I think the backstory of how I found out is different. If not let me know and I\u2019ll move it over to the other group!! On mobile so sorry for any formatting issues. \n\nMy first memory of my misophonia was around the age of six years old. I remember the intense feeling of anger filling my stomach in response to hearing my bestfriend, who is a notorious smacker, eating. I remember asking her to stop, I remember she tried, and then i remember hitting her when the anger bubbled out. Of course I got in trouble, but I kept trying to explain that I couldn\u2019t help it, but no one believed me. \n\nI told my parents what happened, and they told me I was being dramatic and that needed to get over it, but it just got worse. There\u2019s an incident I remember, though my family will not agree with me that it actually happened, and who knows, maybe it didn\u2019t. It started with all of us sitting on my couch-my mom, dad, and sister- we were eating dinner in front of the tv per usual. My dad loved to crunch ice sprinkled with lemonade powder over it, and even though he had done that all my life, something about this night was different. I tried to hold the boiling feeling that was sitting in the depths of my stomach in, but I failed, and I just started crying begging him to stop. My sister thought it was hilarious and rushed over to smack right into my ear; they all thought I was making it up. I ended up hitting my sister that night, along with hitting myself while crying. There are many more incidents like this but this is getting too long. \n\nThe icing on the cake, for me at least, was when I found a post on Facebook. It has to have been at least eight or so years ago since I saw it, but it was a picture with the words MISOPHONIA in bright letters, a definition underneath, and bullet points of symptoms. I was over joyed! Finally I had a name to prove I wasn\u2019t crazy! I rushed in to show my mom, but she just laughed and said she didn\u2019t believe things that show up on face book. But get this y\u2019all, she now tells people she has misophonia. Her reasoning? It annoys her when the dog licks his paws, that\u2019s it. One trigger and only annoyance. I don\u2019t know why, but this is the thing that annoys me the most. \n\nI know this is long but I want to end on a positive note. Since I found the term for misophonia I\u2019ve been able to learn how to handle it better. My friends have been so so supportive, they will go out of their way to eat as far from me as they can, or check in with me to make sure they aren\u2019t becoming a trigger even though I\u2019ve never asked them to. I\u2019ve been able to point people to resources when they don\u2019t understand what I mean when I say it\u2019s more than just an annoyance it\u2019s a physical feeling I get-a boiling hot white rage or complete shut down of everything. I\u2019m so excited I\u2019ve found y\u2019all. I\u2019ve never known anyone else who has this and it feels good to know I\u2019m no longer alone.

The woman in the front seat jokes about the man in the back seat's \"smacking\". Where there is no overt, amplified smacking (an obscenity in itself, Matt Damon....), there are muted wet sloshy mouth noises from one of the car's occupants. This legit jacks up my anticipatory anxiety. I can't hit mute fast enough.\n\nSonic uses this same setup to advertise another ice cream dessert, and there is one big smack in this one. All of this is rage inducing and hardly the sort of thing to joke about or view with bemused affection. It telegraphs the social acceptance of vile table manners and even propogates an unfortunate American trope, one I do not wish to describe further right here.\n\nWhen miso finally reaches the big leagues of liberal arts academe, I really hope it gets the treatment I believe it deserves.

What are we eating? A classic morning meal- *cereal*. Now, I love cereal. Cereal is the blood of life in my opinion. It's so easy to make, easy to eat, easy all around, *and* delicious as *fuck*. But when I eat it, I don't slurp, smack, or make any other kind of disgusting noises. I keep my mouth shut and eat in peace so no one else has to hear my gross mouth sounds.\n\nThat being said, let's continue into why I am absolutely fucking *pissed*.\n\nAs I said, I eat my cereal without slurping, smacking, or obnoxious crunching (the crunching happens but it's within reason. Cereal *is* just inherently crunchy.) so as to not disturb anyone or myself while eating. But my sibling? Oh *noooo*! They can't do *that*. They have to fucking *slurp* and *smack* and *crunch* the shit *loud as fuck* like a fucking *six year old*!\n\nI haven't had to eat breakfast with them in a really long time because I'm always at school (I'm 18) by the time they even wake up (they're 23) so I'd forgotten how awful it is to sit across from them and deal with that shit. However, I never really said anything about it so I decided now would be the best time to say something. \n\nME* Calm but mildly annoyed*: \"Dude, could you stop crunching?\"\n\nTHEM, *With an attitude*: \"Why?\"\n\nME *Calmly but still annoyed*: \"It's gross.\"\n\nTHEM *With a snotty ass tone while still eating and slurping*: \"Well I can't eat without doing it.\"\n\nME *Calm and trying to stay that way*: \"Just don't slurp.\n\nTHEM *With the same snotty tone*: \"Well if I don't it'll drip down my chin and that really will be gross.\" *They take another spoonful of cereal and slurp loudly*.\n\nME: \"Just do this.\" *I demonstrate by eating a bite neatly and quietly without dripping, slurping, or smacking*.\n\nTHEM *Clearly pissy now and with an abundance of attitude*: *They get up and walk away into the living room, snapping at me as they do*, \"Just shut up!\" \n\nOur mom was in the living room when this happened. She asked my sibling why they were mad and came into the living room all huffy with their cereal, leading to this conversation:\n\nMOM: \"What happened?\"\n\nTHEM *Still pissy and snappy*: \"She was *freaking out* because I was slurping my cereal.\"\n\nME *From the other room*: \"I wasn't freaking out, I told you to stop.\"\n\nMOM *To both of us*: \"Alright calm down.\" *Then softly she says to my sibling*, \"I slurp my cereal when I eat, too.\"\n\n\nHow the fuck is making me feel stupid for making a simple request okay? If it were me I would have just said \"Okay, no problem\" and stopped making the sounds. I fucking hate how people just discount other's feelings just because they don't get it.

I can\u2019t! We\u2019ve grown so much over the last year and it\u2019s all thanks to you all for supporting us and adding content. We wouldn\u2019t be here without you all, so thank you for everything!\n\nIn addition to that, u/TelephoneMelon and I have been talking about updating the Wiki to reflect some new stuff, including the background to why r/misophoniasupport exists side-by-side with r/misophonia. If there are any things you\u2019d like to see updates or changed in the Wiki or on our sub overall, leave a comment below.\n\nNow the fun part...\n\nThe giveaway! We shut down the giveaway post at the end of February and pulled a name from the comments to win. After talking to that person, they did get back to us in time to order the headphones before we would have drawn another name, and we\u2019ve decided to give them a new flair option as the winner of our February 2020 giveaway.\n\n**The winner is... u/The_Ampersand_Monkey!
