Please do not take this as medical advice. I've omitted the names of the drugs used.*\n\nAfter spending a bit of time at the Beh\u00e7et's Centre in London, and talking with Prof Farrida Fortune quite a bit, they're investigating a promising lead in keeping Beh\u00e7et's under control.\n\nA link to a paper I could find on the topic (for anyone who's curious!) is [here](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lesley_Bergmeier/publication/255948513_Innate_Immunity/links/545a3aa60cf2cf5164843b5d.pdf) (not paywalled), but from my conversations with the docs at the Beh\u00e7et's Centre, and from a bit of reading around, I came to understand the following. I'm totally open to anyone pointing out that some (all!?) of this isn't completely correct as I'm not medically trained!\n\n* There are these proteins called [Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll-like_receptor) floating around in your mouth, and they appear to be one of the first lines of defence in your immune system, especially where your mouth is concerned.\n\n* When a TLR recognises a microbe that isn't going to be good for your body, it signals to your immune system that something bad might be about to enter the battlefield.\n\n* As soon as your immune system gets the signal, for people like us, it goes into overdrive, like a maniacal rogue agent, and starts hacking away at things it really shouldn't be. Like giving a psychotic blind man an axe. And we all know how that story ends.\n\n* Prof Fortune and her team have been experimenting with a combination of a steroid, an antibiotic, and an antifungal used together, dissolved in water, to be used as a mouthwash. The idea behind this is not to 'turn down' the TLRs, as (if I'm at all correct here) I'm not aware of a way to do this, but rather to keep the mouth as 'clean' as possible to try to stop the TLRs picking up on any foreign microbes that may be present. \n\n\nThere will be other things oral things that this treatment addresses, so I daresay this is just one effect of it, but I found it interesting to read about.\n\nI make and use the mouthwash whenever I feel symptoms arise (whether ulceration, fatigue, or whatever). It makes ulcers go away within a day or so (vast improvement, even when compared to prednisolone and immunosuppresants alone), and generally helps me get back to 'normal' a lot quicker. Using the mouthwash when I'm not feeling any symptoms to hold them at bay. I'm quite amazed.\n\nWould be interesting to hear if anyone else has tried a similar treatment. I don't know how treatments differ in the UK compared to the US or the rest of the world.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Keeping mouth 'clean' appears to help", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/3kwl5l/keeping_mouth_clean_appears_to_help/"}, {"author": "papervsglue", "author_created_utc": 1440383058, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_pt40v", "created_utc": 1440387852, "domain": "youtube.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/3i5rh1/trying_to_spread_awareness_on_behcets_disease_my/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3i5rh1", "is_self": false, "media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "Samantha Blinn", "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGutM7LaQ2YLD00y9pP9M8g", "description": "Bonjour!

I'm from the US. I've had recurrent oral sores since being a teenager, in the past couple of years I've noticed chronic persistent pustules/pseudo folliculitis on my legs. I've been pretty miserable for a couple of years  frequent unexplained chest pain, constant headaches, eye floaters, occipital like neurlagia symptoms, knee joint and leg pain in general, always tired, can't keep up with peers partying/work/gym. I'm also turkish/arabic. So the USA in general is pretty awful at this disease. 1st consult tested for HLA-B51(it is not diagnostic), i had to explain to him what the pathergy test was. Anyways after i got positive hla-b51 i started freaking out booked multiple consults at renowned university hospitals in california. All of them are in agreement that it seems mild, 2 of them prescribed otezla which i am currently on.  Knock on wood i've had alot of imaging and labs and i've always been clean so far.  Sometimes I wonder if I kind of pushed for the diagnosis because i have a really shitty lifestyle/mental ilness that may explain alot of those symptoms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions: \n\n1.I often get joint and calf pain, are you guys's knee joints obviously swelled? Like mine are very mildly swelling and rheum and PCP look at them and think they are normal but they hurt quite a bit? Is this your experience to, or is it obviously like Swelled?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.I'm a pharmacist and to my misfortune delved really deep into behcet's medical literature, being a hypocondriac focusing on the most catastrophic outcomes. I'm a dude so more susceptible bad outcomes of the disease(vasc/neuro).  Anyways I read a Vascular behcets review that suggested that a uk vasc surgeons guideline suggests doing yearly CT angiogram to make sure vasc is fine(and imaging during flareups).  It sounds aggressive but because of how dangerous aneurysms can be it makes sense. So I consulted our \"best\" behcets specialists in the USA (NYU langone) and asked the rheum if  that's what they did. He said no, they don't go fishing for stuff with imaging. Wondering how you guys experience is with routine imaging for Behcets that hasn't manifested severe symptoms yet. I'm scared of vasc because i have a family history of clots and a confirmed rare genetic thrombophila(factor v homozygous and heterezygous prothrombin- i'm the luckiest of dudes.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for being wordy!

This past weekend I had the worst headache of my life, it lasted 2 days and can only be described as traumatic. As I\u2019m recovering, my whole body aches/feels like I\u2019ve been through a very serious episode(pots makes you worn out/sore sometimes - but no pots symptoms, just the headache). I realized then that I had a sore in my mouth, and as I researched this I came across Behcets. I\u2019ve had cancer soars on and off, but never thought it could be related to my other symptoms. I also get unexplained rashes, they come and go across my chest/shoulders/back and I had one the day before my headache onset. It didn\u2019t hurt or itch, and left quickly, I thought I was having a food reaction or heat rash. Now I\u2019m wondering if these are common Behcets symptoms? Tonight I have chest pain and extreme joint pain in hips. I\u2019ve always had joint pain and chest pain - the chest we\u2019ve assumed related to the cardiac stress from POTS. \n\nJust wondering if any of this sounds familiar to you or if I\u2019m chasing symptoms down the wrong avenue. To have a rash, mouth sore, traumatic headache and joint pain all in a 4 day span seemed like some type of episode to me... Behcets or not...thoughts?\n\nI don\u2019t believe in being a webmd dr, but from past experience pcp\u2019s can be tough to convince you\u2019re not mental when your symptoms are varied.

Thank you all x10000000\n\nMy question today: I have to choose between Remicade and Humira after Azathioprine really failing me. I'm curious what peoples' experiences with these two are? Especially if anyone has tried both and one worked better than the other. I'm open to either but desperate to get something that will last long term!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n:)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 551, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Humira or Remicade?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/j6wfyw/humira_or_remicade/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TheAbhorsen7", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8632wn6f", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1601596815, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/j3k8z6/any_help_would_be_great/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j3k8z6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/j3k8z6/any_help_would_be_great/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1601597791, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have been fighting for thirteen years to be taken seriously by my doctors.

It's hard to believe that this is happening in 2020 and I know there are other people with issues far worse than mine but if anyone on this entire side could maybe give me some insight I would certainly appreciate it.

I\u2019ve had Beh\u00e7et\u2019s for over 17 years. In December of 2019 I had to stop Remicade and Methotrexate because my liver enzymes spiked. I\u2019ve been on prednisone only since then while we wait for my liver enzymes to return to normal. \n\nNaturally I have been pretty much in a huge flare since January. With new symptoms coming up and worsening symptoms I had to see a neurologist who did an MRI and confirmed Neuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s. \n\nMy problem is how to treat it. A conference with my rheumatologist and gastroenterologist brought me back to Remicade which I just started again after 7 months. Rhuemy decide against loading doses and I\u2019m still in this crazy flare that I feel is getting worse. My neuro symptoms feel out of control. \n\nNeurology was just \u201cimpressed\u201d as I\u2019m the first patient to have Neuro-Beh\u00e7et and they all treat it like it\u2019s a nifty diagnosis.  All my docs belong to a large university associated practice and my rhuemy was with the Vasculitis Clinic at John Hopkins. So on some level they know what they are doing, but once I step out of the rheumatological world the docs all lose their  shit when they see a patient with something this rare. \n\nMy question is what treatments have you been on for the Neuro-Beh\u00e7et? What worked for you, what didn\u2019t?\n\nMy symptoms for neuro are:\noccipital neuralgia (new)\nMovement disorder (chorea-like)\nAphasia\n\nI have all the typical stuff and cutaneous vasculitis but the neuro symptoms are damn well killing me.

I go to another check-up for the ulcer on my lower vulva, doctor immedietely lets me know to get back in contact with my rheumatologist and that it likely behcets. I go and have another appointment, they confirm that these and some other symptoms all lead to a high likelihood of behcets and I've been prescribed medication that will hopefully aid symptoms.\n\nI feel lucky my doctors knew what to look for, and that I didn't have to go through a decade of pleading for my case to be heard like a lot of you- In fact, my doctor was the one to inform me I didn't have herpes when I thought I did. I thought since I was a kid I had herpes because everyone said that's why you get mouth ulcers, and I heard you could get that from sharing drinks (as I've never kissed anyone/been sexually active before).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 515, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "17F, just diagnosed with behcets", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/ihwn9f/17f_just_diagnosed_with_behcets/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwaway729478", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5bw2cmzl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598529763, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/ihjrah/newly_misdiagnosed_with_herpes_test_negative/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ihjrah", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/ihjrah/newly_misdiagnosed_with_herpes_test_negative/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1598529773, "score": 1, "selftext": "the past three weeks of my life have been a whirlwind. 22f here, recently graduated college and started seeing a guy from out of town around march. he\u2019s the only person i\u2019ve been with in the past 6 months, so when i got an outbreak of genital ulcers three weeks ago i was hardcore tweaking. got the igg and igm blood tests and also got a culture done by my gyno towards the end of the outbreak. all three tests came back negative, and his igg / igm came back negative too (and he\u2019s never had any symptoms, it was just me). \n\nstarted reading &amp; beginning to think it may be behcets. i\u2019ve been prone to mouth ulcers my whole life and the other day I woke up with a strange pain/sensitivity in the middle of my palm, which is what prompted the google search that took me right to behcet\u2019s as a possibility. any input/similar stories? i\u2019ve heard diagnoses are hard to come by due to the come &amp; go nature of symptoms for behcet\u2019s, but i\u2019m eager for answers", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 515, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "newly misdiagnosed with herpes, test negative", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/ihjrah/newly_misdiagnosed_with_herpes_test_negative/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "cookiesandpizza247", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_14k87t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598404183, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/igp9ph/how_many_were_told_it_was_just_herpes/", "gildings": {}, "id": "igp9ph", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/igp9ph/how_many_were_told_it_was_just_herpes/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1598404193, "score": 1, "selftext": "I had an incredibly painful breakout around my labia at the start of COVID.

Of course I agreed. I stripped down and sat with the little paper sheet over my lap. She came in with her assistant and examined the sores I had all over my labia. She asked if she could do a biopsy to rule out herpes for sure. She said that it definitely wasn't folliculitis and was confused how a doctor could even consider that as a diagnosis. \n\nShe did the biopsy (all while apologizing for the painful procedure on a sensitive area) and told me she suspected Behcets. A week later she called me and told me that she was referring me to a  rheumatologist but she would still like to be involved in my care because she had only read about it in medical school and she was fascinated/excited by the diagnosis. \n\nTldr: was told I had herpes by a bunch of doctors.

Hope everyone is feeling well. Had a few random questions that I wanted some insight from people like me. :)\n\nSaw my rheumatologist today for regular follow up. I had a bad flare in between seeing him and was given steroids ..but I thought it was partly from having biopsies from colonoscopy/endoscopy as my primary assumed that was probably cause. My rheumatologist didn\u2019t agree and said it may be time to consider one of the tnf inhibitors along with Otezla.\n\nFor my bechets I\u2019m currently taking 1.8mg colcrys and 100mg imuran. \nI was originally told I could go up to 150mg as it\u2019s based on weight. \nI am 5\u20198\u2019 129lbs. Very active when feeling well and healthy (within reason lol)  lifestyle. I have GI complications so my weight fluctuates ten pounds (125-135) That\u2019s just what it was today. \n\nAnyway he told me he doesn\u2019t see benefit in increase as he thinks I\u2019d have higher chance of in side effects, &amp; we can either switch now or wait until I see him in two months for next follow up. \nI have been losing hair too..I\u2019d compare it to postpartum hair loss. Which he noted.\n\nI also had higher blood pressure even though I take procardia xl for it. Not too high for me 135/90. I have HBP issues that they think is related to my disease or genetics since I\u2019m 29 and don\u2019t drink/smoke and am active. Sorry this is long. But my blood pressure always has my doctors on high alert. I had a mini stroke which is when I discovered I had HBP which is what led me down this long road to bechets. \nIt\u2019s honesty my fault I have two young toddlers and just didn\u2019t make time for the doctors, because I didn\u2019t think my issues were a big deal. I was also still nursing ..I gave that up when I started meds. But it\u2019s okay my son was 2 1/2 so was ready. But I just ignored many signs. And I\u2019ve never had HBP even when pregnant. \n\nAfter that very long intro ..anyone have experience on tnf inhibitors vs imuran? Or Otezla? Or any combo. I also wish steroids weren\u2019t so bad for you..I feel my best on them which I always tell him.\n\nHe also wants me to get shingles vaccine, but I\u2019ve never had chicken pox &amp; had that vaccine when I was a baby. My husband is in pharmacy and was surprised by that request. Anyone else told they should do that?\nI have to get pneumonia vaccine but I\u2019m asthmatic so makes sense. \n\nThanks so much for always giving me insight and support !xo sorry so long.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 505, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Medication questions.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/ibkewc/medication_questions/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Leading_Ladybug", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7itiqgbl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597674848, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/ibf8pk/i_will_die_from_behcets_went_from_calm_to_scared/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ibf8pk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/ibf8pk/i_will_die_from_behcets_went_from_calm_to_scared/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597674858, "score": 1, "selftext": "  25 , f .\nA dr diagnosed me with behcet\u2019s 2 weeks ago, after a month of mild joints pain and genital ulcers who lasted  5 days.

The viral culture tested negative for herpes, and since I\u2019ve been celibate since the last time I had a negative std test I highly doubt it\u2019s herpes. (But I suppose it\u2019s not impossible; I plan on getting a blood test to settle the issue. Hopefully doctors will at stop obsessing over the idea that it\u2019s herpes...) \n\nAnyway, herpes outbreaks are not usually supposed to last this long, and if this were herpes it would be a 5 week long recurrent infection which would be even more unusual; I\u2019ve had what I now recognize as genital ulcers before, but never this bad or persistent. (I always assumed it was an ingrown hair or 2 causing extreme genital pain a few times a year... I was so naive lol)\n\nHow long do your BD genital ulcers last, in total?\n\nI also run the gamut for other behcets symptoms; joint pain/swelling, fatigue, skin sores/pustules in weird areas, and most importantly mouth ulcers. I used to get them at least once a month, up until a few years ago when I started plaquenil for an as yet undiagnosed condition. My only consistently positive blood test is ANA. (And yes, I probably have something else going on.) My gf once got me numbing mouth ulcer gel as part of a birthday present the canker sores were so bad for a while. I had a canker sore under my tongue just last week...\n\nLastly, my eyes have been burning up all week; they feel awful. They\u2019re not red, and I haven\u2019t had any vision changes other than maybe something with my right eye which hurts more... maybe some floaters/less peripheral vision. But it\u2019s always been my worse eye an I\u2019m being hyper vigilant about these symptoms, so idk. I haven\u2019t rushed to the dr because last time I went to the ophthalmologist for a flare of the same eye pain/symptoms she couldn\u2019t find anything wrong, so I\u2019ve been hesitant to find out once again there is no obvious reason. I will make an urgent appointment on Monday, rest assured. The pain hasn\u2019t gotten better like last time, and with all my possibly diagnoses having eye inflammation as a possible complication I know I need to go. \n\nAnyone else have eye pain like me and find it to be a non-uveitis complication of BD?

I guess I havent gotten an official diagnosis yet, but my doctor is basically waiting on another biopsy to come back negative and has already started treating me. What I'm saying is, we're pretty sure. \n\nI'm in my mid twenties now. I've had mouth ulcers on/off for as long as I can remember. The obvious first symptom. I had multiple issues with other body parts throughout my life, but they were always ultimately undiagnosed with symptoms treated by specialists of whatever realm, and then forgotten. Until it happened again. You know the cycle. It was always attributed to something else or nothing/anything at all. It's finally all just coming together. \n\nI'm not entirely sure of the point of this post except to maybe just hear if anyone has dealt with something similar. How I've come to finally getting a doctor to look deeper into this is through my skin presentation.\n\n I've read about multiple rashes being a symptom of Behcet's, but I get e x t r e m e blisters. I was convinced I had bullous pemphigoid for a while (negative). But that's basically exactly what it looks like. It started on my feet. Minor trauma would cause a blister. A blister that basically festers and continues to spread wider until it finally bursts (usually due to another accidental trauma). It spread around my feet; you can seriously follow the trail. Then it started appearing on my lower legs. And finally, my inner thighs and mainly, hips. (Actually kind of forgot I would get blisters/trauma on my hands a lot as an earlier-presenting symptom). \n\nI have been very lucky with my symptoms and doctors relatively speaking thus far, but this particular symptom is driving me INSANE and makes me feel pretty gross and even more unusual, seeing as I can't find any account of the same in someone else. I have paper thin skin. ANY thing will rip my skin open and it heals poorly. And now, my hip are ALWAYS itching and burning like HELL, breaking out in a ton of blisters and open sores, and unfortunately never wearing clothes isn't an option. \n\nHas anyone been driving this wild by their outside \"protective\" layer? I've done everything to ease it What else can I do?\n\nTL;DR: Extreme blistering skin. CRAZY itchy hip with very large blisters.

A little background. I have ehlers danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder which is very commonly comorbid with a variety of autoimmune conditions. I've never struggled with any of the common ones like POTS or MCAS. But now I suspect I have Behcet's. I've had mouth ulcers all my life--though these did improve massively when I switched to a sulfate-free, baking soda-free toothpaste, so I didn't think much of it. \n\nFast forward to May 2020. I developed a genital lesion that I felt pretty sure was herpes. I had a past partner who had a positive contact though I was celibate for over a year before this lesion appeared. I saw a public health doctor who said it may or may not be consistent with herpes, swabbed it, and told me I'd get a letter with results some time in July. She gave me valcyclovir, which spoiler alert, did not help. Fast forward to July. The lesion has not healed. I managed to get in to see my primary care provider (who is fantastic and I love her) and she and an infectious disease doctor took a look and said that it does appear most consistent with herpes, swabbed it again, and got my results back just yesterday: negative. They told me that in the event the result was negative, they would treat it as an apthous ulcer-and possibly explore conditions like Behcet's, given my past history, but unfortunately we were all thinking herpes so didn't get to talk much about this avenue of treatment. \n\nAfter doing some research I do believe it's most consistent with Behcet's. I attribute most of my joint pain to my connective tissue disorder but it is there. I also have issues with my eyes- random pain, vision that has been gradually worsening since my childhood, and every time I blow my nose I burst blood vessels in them. \n\nSo I am seeking advice- have you ever had a genital ulcer that did not want to heal? What have your providers advised? Did you use any over the counter products? Were you advised to avoid any particular products? I read on the foundation website that betamethasone cream can be helpful so I picked some up last night and we'll see, but I'm very very very over this entire experience and want to expedite it as much as humanly possible. \n\nThank you, I hope you all are well.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 469, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Genital ulcer not healing", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/hpuapr/genital_ulcer_not_healing/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "behcetsthroaway", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_509vs2jv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594186021, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/hnb928/red_spots_covering_parts_of_my_skin/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hnb928", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/hnb928/red_spots_covering_parts_of_my_skin/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1594186022, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey everyone\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm hesitant to call these rashes because it doesn't seem right, but I noticed yesterday that most of the side of one of my hips, the adjoining thigh, and the opposing ankle area are covered in red spots.

Frequent migraines with and without aura (which were aggravated and worsened by hormonal BC), and awful bouts of exhaustion. These symptoms again have been disregarded by my GP, and even my close family, as I am relatively young, I also suffer from depression, which my GP often linked to my described bouts of exhaustion. \n\nI went on an anti-inflammatory diet and I was feeling quite good until recently I went through a pretty devastating break-up and found myself disregarding the diet entirely. \n\nI recently have felt incredibly exhausted and just a general feeling of malaise. I experienced a yeast infection and took an OTC pill for it. I also experienced several mouth ulcers. And then a couple days ago woke up with a really uncomfortable sensation and realized I had a genital ulcer present. \n\nI immediately freaked out as I'm not currently sexually active and booked a doctor's appointment to have a swab taken. My GP said that ulcer did not appear consistent with what HSV-2 generally looks like but nevertheless took the swab. \n\nI am currently awaiting results, which should take a couple of days, but after researching and finding out about Behcets, something that has never been mentioned to me before, I feel like my symptoms are really consistent. \n\nI live in Canada and getting referrals to rheumatologists can definitely take time, but at this point I feel like I really want to voice this concern to my GP. Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms to these?   \n\n\nFeeling totally lost, but thank you for reading this post and thanks for your time! \n\nHope everyone is doing well.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 467, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Struggling to find answers, symptoms pointing towards Behcets?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/hn6ph0/struggling_to_find_answers_symptoms_pointing/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "myspeckledface", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_m6ok026", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594145245, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/hmzpoe/can_abdominalfullbody_exercise_lead_to_a_flareup/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hmzpoe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/hmzpoe/can_abdominalfullbody_exercise_lead_to_a_flareup/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1594145336, "score": 1, "selftext": "I \\[25/F\\] was diagnosed with Behcet's last December.

I started Humira in April and have been feeling significantly better, so I've tried introducing more exercise into my routine but I fear that it is actually doing more harm than good for me. I typically feel better after yoga, but if I ever incorporate basic core/abdominal exercises like crunches, planks and push-ups, I am completely wiped out for about a week. The first signs of my flare up typically appear the next morning and involve extreme fatigue, shakiness, weakness, nausea, loss of appetite, tinnitus, chest tightness and light/screen sensitivity. Even walking the dog feels like too much effort for me. It's a \"flu-y\" feeling that starts off mild but turns pretty severe after 24 hrs.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this?

This is my first time posting here. After I (29/F) went through a lot of posts here, I\u2019m still confused about whether I might have BD/BS or not. Putting down my journey here and I\u2019ll try to be concise and relevant.\nRight when the shelter in place started in March I started going running everyday due to lack of gym access. All through March I ran 5 miles everyday which is more than I\u2019ve run in the past. First week of April one morning I woke up with burning and itchy vulva (major and minor labia). In the course of that day I had an ulcer outbreak. It started on the left labia and healed in 10 days then another outbreak on the right labia. Healed and then another outbreak on both. Went to urgent care and they thought it\u2019s STI and swabbed for a full panel test. Due to covid they couldn\u2019t test for herpes and prescribed valtrex because they were sure it\u2019s that even though I told them I\u2019ve been in a LTR with my husband for 8 years and we only ever had sex (oral included) with each other. The full panel test was negative btw. The OBs periodically continued. Also I have had chronic mouth canker sores since childhood so this entire time I\u2019m getting mouth sores as well but I didn\u2019t pay much attention until later when I noticed both outbreaks happen at the same exact time. The number of sores in my mouth went up too with recurrent sores in my gums which is new.\n\nAs the OBs continued I got referred to an obgyn who swabbed me for HSV and it came back -ve. I was prescribed more valtrex and the OBs continued still. I got another swab done which was also -ve. Finally a blood test showed presence of HSV-1 antibodies which doc says is very common and shouldn\u2019t cause these aggressive OBs. I got referred to a Dermatologist who is suspecting Crohn\u2019s among other possible inflammatory/autoimmune syndromes but I don\u2019t show all the GI issues associated with CD. Derm asked me about my eye issues which made me wonder if dry eyes, floaters are common in Behcets or does it have to be inflammation only. I did have some eye pain/ brow ridge pain and some pin like sensation in my eye during the severe outbreaks but later when it went down I happened to go for an eye check up and other than my right eye being extra dry they didn\u2019t see anything abnormal. So can the eye inflammation issue be detected only during a flare up?\n\nI have been prescribed betamethasone as a test of whether the genital sores respond to them and they actually did. Last night I saw new bumps and it started to itch/burn like paper cuts and after I applied the ointment I woke up in the morning with burn gone which never ever happened till now since April.\n\nI\u2019ve spend a lot of money due to a high deductible health care plan trying to get answers and still pretty confused.

I do plan on going soon. \n\nBasically I think I have Behcet disease. But I want to know what you guys think about it and if you have any tips.\n\nSo for as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve always had bad ulcers in my mouth, especially around my period. The last few years, they\u2019ve been REALLY bad, hurting so bad that I couldn\u2019t eat or sleep. Recently, I had a yeast infection for the first time ever combined with irritation on the vulva because I ran like 10 km in two days with a thong and tight leggings when it was really hot (I  know I\u2019m fucking dumb, learned my lesson). \nI got my period the next day I did that and as expected I had three bad ulcers in my mouth. Now I have 5, one being on my gum where my wisdom tooth is coming out and it hurts like HELL. I\u2019m taking like 8 advils a day and can\u2019t even close my mouth. Its BAD.  \n\nBut the worst thing is I have ulcers on my vulva. I want to fucking die this is the worst pain I\u2019ve ever experienced EVER and I have a high pain tolerance. I couldn\u2019t pee without screaming. I am 20 years old btw. At first I didn\u2019t know what it was and didn\u2019t even cheked what it looked like. Then I decided to take a look down there and I was horrified. Didn\u2019t even feel comfortable showing my bf. After screaming hysterically while trying to pee, my mom wanted to see and she was positive it was an STD, like herpes (keep in mind ahe doesn\u2019t know shit about stds) which would be really unlikely for me. After crying hysterically and have multiple panic attacks thinking I caught herpes, I realised that the many sores (I had about 10) I had on my vulva looked exactly like the ulcers in my mouth. Also they wee raised like pimples (herpes isn\u2019t raised so theres that) at first and then became ulcers. They are healing now and don\u2019t I don\u2019t have any more pain when I pee. I used coconut oil and I think it helped. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Could a yeast infection trigger ulcers or it was just a coincidence? Can I go my whole life without having them down there and suddenly have them? Do you guys have any tips? I research a lot and it looks like it to me. Also I\u2019ve been really tired don\u2019t know if its just my period though.\n\nThank you so much guys!!!\ud83d\ude01", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 433, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Pretty sure I have it.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/grmxfu/pretty_sure_i_have_it/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ICan24", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_56226fov", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1590592581, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/grlkh2/oral_cancer_concerns/", "gildings": {}, "id": "grlkh2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/grlkh2/oral_cancer_concerns/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1590592592, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have noticed that aside from my daily 5-10 mouth ulcers that my gums have been extra red and uncomfortable.

I got my first attack 6 months ago that began only in my mouth. I woke up one morning with 8-10 huge sores covering the roof of my mouth, tongue, cheeks everything. Since then I have been getting subsequent attacks roughly every 4-10 weeks apart and they seem to be triggered by physical or emotional stressors. My most recent flare happened after I pulled my back working out. I felt fine up until that moment and then after I hurt my back I started getting itchiness all over my body and my mouth started burning and tingling. The ulcers appeared the next day and were the worst they have ever been. I also got a few patches of eczema on my legs and 2 ulcers on my vulva which hurt like hell :( My question is, my ulcers come back in THE SAME EXACT SPOTS in my mouth every time I get a flare. Even when they are healed between attacks, the places in my mouth where they were are very sensitive. Is this typical for behcets? Do other people get the ulcers in the same spots every time or do they move locations? Also, should I expect for this to get worse over time or should the flare ups happen less frequently over time? I am not currently on any meds for it. I use Oracort and magic mouthwash when I get the lesions and hydrocortisone on the rashes which seems to be fine but my doctor is considering oral prednisone to take when I get the flare-ups.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 408, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ulcers recurring in same spots?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/gavcnh/ulcers_recurring_in_same_spots/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ImpossibleAd6412", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5vhwllfp", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1643285952, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/sdx48o/what_is_one_food_that_sends_your_mouth_into_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "sdx48o", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffd635", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "ad76c826-0a50-11eb-95ea-0e6c934e4747", "link_flair_text": "General Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/sdx48o/what_is_one_food_that_sends_your_mouth_into_a/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1643285962, "score": 1, "selftext": "What are foods that effect your oral flare ups?

Ever since I was 2 weeks old, I had ulcers covering my mouth and they quickly spread to my throat/stomach as I got older. Having these ulcers is an everyday occurrence. I never go a day without pain and was misdiagnosed time and time again. My vision gradually got worse in my adolescence and I can't depict a single thing without corrective lenses. Once I got covid in feb 2020, the symptoms of the disease became much more aggressive. The arteries of my extremities are now hardening and my feet/lower legs are mostly purple, ice cold, and numb. Running is one of my hobbies but it's almost impossible for me to enjoy now. It also is starting to affect my kidneys (mostly when I flare). I learned this after doing a MRA w contrast and renal ultrasound. Beginning summer 2021, I started waking up to dried blood in/on my mouth and throwing up a moderate amount of blood daily. I\u2019ve been on prednisone for long periods of time, methotrexate, antivirals, etc- and now I\u2019m on Otezla. Besides the awful GI side effects, I think it's decreasing the number of ulcers I get. Lost a lot of weight since starting it. I also keep a strict diet to prevent flares and see my rheumatologist regularly. I try to manage my stress but have a busy schedule due to work and school obligations. \n\n***Actual Question***: Have any of you gotten your wisdom teeth removed while having Behcet\u2019s? Any time I go to the dentist for a routine cleaning, it triggers a flare. I want to avoid this procedure at all costs but my impacted wisdom tooth is creating so much scar tissue/inflammation that I can\u2019t close my mouth without gnawing at my cheek. The area is covered in ulcers ofc. To be honest, I\u2019m absolutely terrified of how my body will react after the extraction of 4 teeth, considering the fact any minor cut or accidental bite of the cheek turns into a whole flare. What was the aftercare and healing process like for you? How long did it take to recover? I work overnight shifts and go to college during the day so I need to anticipate how much time I\u2019ll need. I hate asking for accommodations of any sort and try to privately tough the symptoms out. It\u2019s very difficult to explain this disease and the severity of it to anyone since it's so rare. Often times, the reaction is \"but you don't look sick\" or them being grossed out when I show how it manifests. It\u2019s the loneliest experience. \n\nThank you for reading and I appreciate all of you!

I also left the job I had just started, it was pretty physical and I just couldn't keep up. I managed to finish the semester from bed and as I started feeling better I started looking for another job. \n\nFast forward to now, I've started a new job I like and the new semester has started, and I was feeling ok and lone behold, my joints started aching, mouth started flaring, and now I'm in a full flare-up, with this fun new edition of hand ulcers (anyone else experience this?). I feel like I can't keep up with school with all the days I need to rest and I feel like I'm not valuable to entry place workplaces because of all the random time I require off when I get sick. \n\nI just want some kind of treatment to work. I know I should probably start some kind of anti-inflammatory diet or something (does anyone have any recommendations?) and maybe light exercise but it is so frustrating to spend so much time dealing with my health and still feel like nothing is working. \n\nI'm so sorry if this is depressing for anyone, I just feel down.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 981, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Feeling discouraged, isolated, and frustrated with chronic illness - not so quick rant *possibly triggering*", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/sb24f3/feeling_discouraged_isolated_and_frustrated_with/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "trying_to_be_amelia", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ve4d0wv", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642882873, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/sab62k/is_mitigare_as_good_as_colcrys/", "gildings": {}, "id": "sab62k", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#94e044", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "b8eccf7a-0a50-11eb-bb51-0e17eac34017", "link_flair_text": "Treatments", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/sab62k/is_mitigare_as_good_as_colcrys/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642882884, "score": 1, "selftext": "My rheum prescribed colchicine, it isn't covered by my insurance.

I've been prescribed colchicine to help with the symptoms that I typically experience, but since I'm not really experiencing them right now, I'm a little worried to take the med as I've heard it really messes with your stomach.\n\nDoes anyone else experience these eerie dormant periods of symptoms or is that just me having a very new/mild case of Behcets? I would appreciate any feedback anyone has!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 975, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can you describe your Behcets when you're not flaring up?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/s65ojp/can_you_describe_your_behcets_when_youre_not/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Muffinman1111112", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_h63gxib", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642380275, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/s5qdwi/im_back_to_complain_about_the_beh\u00e7ets_facebook/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s5qdwi", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ff66ac", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "6c9a188e-0a51-11eb-8602-0e780a47dac5", "link_flair_text": "Patient Support / Story", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/s5qdwi/im_back_to_complain_about_the_beh\u00e7ets_facebook/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642380286, "score": 1, "selftext": "The admin take a break every week now.

I'm not sure if it is better to use it all the time despite its side effects. I'm having a very stubborn tendinitis in my achilles tendon at the moment and considering regularly using it. I use prednisolone only if I have mouth or genital ulcers since I don't wanna get depressed or gain weight.\n\nI'm 29F. My symptoms started around the age of 8 when I was having extremely stressful times. My knees were swollen if I don't keep my legs straight. I was frequently having mouth ulcers as well. \n\nAt the age of 16, I had genital ulcers, like 10 of them at the same time, each the size of an hazel nut. Were very painful, I remember crying from the pain every time I had to pee. My mom took me to a gynaecologist. This gynaecologist thought it was an STD. Told me to let my \"boyfriend\" know so he would go to the doctor as well, in front of my family. I told them I was a virgin and never had a boyfriend. Nobody believed me. By that time I was living in my home country, where the virginity is very very important. They (my family and this gynaecologist) put me through virginity test. She saw that I was a virgin. Then she told my family the hymen is intact, but still this is transmitted sexually. These were horrible times. \n\nI moved out from my family's house when I was 17. Moved out of the country when I was 22. Here where I live atm, I have a reumatologist in the public hospital. Time to time I get joint inflammations on the knees or ankles and kortizon injections to them. However, this ankle joint hasn't been improved for a year now. I was suggested PRP but it's so expensive and I don't know if it works. Any suggestion is appreciated.\n\nThank you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 972, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Prednisolone, PRP or kortizon injection?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/s4qu67/prednisolone_prp_or_kortizon_injection/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kelpiekid", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_j0sc9xb", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642233675, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/s4fd6s/do_mild_cases_exist/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s4fd6s", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#0aa18f", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "d4109638-0a50-11eb-937b-0ecde9b84f77", "link_flair_text": "Diagnosis Help", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/s4fd6s/do_mild_cases_exist/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642233685, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm so sorry this is long, once I started typing I just couldn't stop.\n\nI'm 24F and I've been having canker sores since the earliest I can remember, usually 1 or 2 at a time, lasting a whole month, disappearing for a day or two and then restarting for the next month. My mom has had canker sores her whole life too, so I assumed it was normal/not important to being up to a doctor. I mentioned it offhand to my GP in 2020 and she sent me to get tested for Celiac's and Crohn's (including CT and colonoscopy) all negative. So her 2 ideas were proved incorrect and no follow through happened.\n\nIn 2021 I suddenly had 5 or 6 oral sores at the exact same time for 3 months, with few to none days of peace in the middle. I decided maybe this isn't normal and I went to an ENT. He didn't believe me. So I went to another ENT. She believed me and referred me to a rheumatologist. I went to the rheum today and she asked me all these questions, oral sores, the occasion vaginal sore, joint/muscle ache, fatigue, gastrointestinal issues, all things I experience but never thought connected. She has diagnosed me with a hesitant diagnosis of BD.\n\nI've been reading up on what I can about it all day, and stumbled upon this sub. Reading everyone's experiences here, my question is: do mild cases of BD exist? I see people describing mouthfuls of sores not just a handful.

I don't want to compare what I experience with what you experience, bc mine seems so much more minimal. Like I know canker sores are painful and awful, but I don't want to say I have BD and minimize everyone else's condition when mine is very annoying but (currently) pretty manageable.\n\nSorry, I guess I'm just suffering from some sort of BD imposters syndrome, like maybe I don't have it but just happen to experience the separate symptoms of BD to a degree?

I also have a lot of mouth ulcers since years or maybe decades, but I NEVER thought it was an issue since I got used to them. I just assumed I had a very sensitive mouth or I had a bad reaction to toothpaste... I also have bright RED gums and mouths / inner lips, but I thought it was just a mild gum disease or that I brush my teeth and gums too much to the point it might bleed (I have perfect hygiene but I brush my teeth way too much).\n\nToday I had what looks like a cold sore, I was shocked and I had a nervous breakdown and I didn't want to get oral herpes and didn't want to infect myself elsewhere or my eye area, and didn't want to infect anyone else or to my future baby if I ever get pregnant, and I know that herpes (even cold sores) is more severe for those who have a weak immune system. I know cold sores are very common and for most people it's not a big deal but it has complications for some people. The nervous breakdown was not only about the cold sore, but I heard almost five bad news this week and this was too much to handle.\n\nHad digestive symptoms for the past 10 years, I thought at first I had Crohn's disease (bleeding) and no one took me seriously except ONE doctor who tested me for Crohns then celiac disease, but the blood test for celiac came negative. I had an abdominal ultrasound exam 10 years ago and a few colonoscopies and the doctors said nothing was wrong and they said I have IBS. Any medication for IBS has zero effect on my issues, I've tried them all. I don't react to any special food (including spicy food, hot sauce and vegetables) except dairy, milk, but I don't think lactose intolerance causes bleeding, and I often cut off dairy. The bleeding came back since a few months, almost every day. I am going to do another abdominal ultrasound exam obviously but I live in a very small town without a car so I have to wait longer to have the exam, especially since the pandemic. But my doctor doesn't think I have Crohns because my previous colonoscopies were normal. So he said there's no need to do another colonoscopy.\n\nI spent a week at the hospital a few months ago to find the causes to my fatigue and my epilepsy, at the end of the week after the blood test the doctors said I had some kind of inflammation and I \"might have autoimmune disease but we're not sure so don't freak out, and we don't know which one, we'll talk to other doctors and if if it's severe I promise you'll receive a phone call when you'll be back home, if you don't have a phone call it means it's okay, we'll see the other blood test results\". I never had any kind of phone call.\n\nBut right know, I have a \"cold sore\" and SIX mouth ulcers on the lower inner lip, I am not even talking about the rest of the mouth. I just realized I had so many mouths ulcers. They're usually not very painful but it might be because I got used to them and I have very high pain tolerance. I had severe kidney infection last year and it wasn't until it got really bad that I called emergencies service at night. Not because I don't care about my health, just because I don't feel that much pain so I usually assume it's a mild issue. And so many doctors told me \"it's in your head\", or \"you're probably anxious\" so I don't really feel like my issues are \"real\", I am scared to talk about health issues now. Took me a decade to be properly diagnosed with epilepsy (even with exams like EEGs), until I had a prolonged seizure and almost died.\n\nMy close cousin (male, the same age) has diagnosed Behcets, and even got blind. So I never wanted to ask my family about it, because I thought it wouldn't be fair for him, that he has worst issues than mine, so I shouldn't complain so much. His illness was a huge trauma within the family so I denied my close symptoms for years because I didn't want to cause even more drama. I was even convinced it wasn't Behcets and stopped reading about it. But since my nervous breakdown I'm not so sure, the more I educate myself about Behcets and the more I think I might have it... I read about it since a few weeks. Our parents are from a country where Behcets is way more prevalent. My husband thinks I should really get tested because of my mouth and digestive issues. Sometimes I have red skin lesions on legs.\n\nI am going to see a doctor in a few days, what should I tell him to be sure I will be taken seriously? Which exams should I get? Should I ask for a short admission in a Behcets service right now (in another town) if the diagnosis is confirmed? I took pictures of : the \"cold sore\", all the mouth ulcers I could capture, the bright red gums and mouth. Just to have some proof in case it's gone for a few days.\n\nThank you for reading, I am looking forward for any advice. Happy New Year by the way!

I\u2019m a 27 year old, white/Canadian, female. \n\nMy mom was diagnosed with Behcets when she was in her late 20\u2019s as well IgA deficiency. She suffered from oral/esophageal ulcers for years, chronic joint pain/frozen joints, ibs, ect. for years until they finally settled down with minimal flares now. \n\nI am working my self up to talk to my Dr. about all my symptoms and the possibility of me also having Behcets. I have a very difficult time advocating for myself medically so a lot has slipped through the cracks over the years but I\u2019m trying really hard to take better care of myself lately. \n\nThis past month I got really sick for the first time since Covid started (nearly 2 years) and it seems to have triggered a flare up. I got a genital ulcer for the first time in nearly 8-10 years and with it being the holidays I could only see a walk in Dr and my gynecologist is booked until mid January.. they swabbed to rule out herpes (which came back negative as I already knew) Last time I had them I was a teenager and never been sexually active before. I never got them checked then however (some medical neglect and the my difficulty advocating for myself) my family said it was likely the start of a Behcets flare since my mom also has it and if I started a diagnosis process I\u2019d never be able to afford/get approved for health/life insurance \ud83e\udd72\n\n\nOther symptoms I have I think fit Behcets are:\n- I also have constantly unexplained achy joints which have gotten worse with this flare. \n\n-Fairly regularly ligaments/tendons with get so inflamed and painful I can\u2019t even touch the skin above it without feeling like being stabbed, this is mostly in my hands/wrists but sometimes feet too. \n\n-Mild-moderate ibs. As well as a sharp/stabbing intestinal pain that comes as goes, I\u2019ve had this since childhood \n\n-I\u2019ve experienced Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon since childhood (only recently found out the name and that it wasn\u2019t \u2018normal\u2019 \ud83d\ude05) mostly in my toes but occasionally in my fingers\n\n-Not officially tested but I also get a a mild pathergy reaction to minor abrasions, injections, ect\n\nI don\u2019t however think I experience the mouth sores/ulcers or at least severe enough to be able to tell. From what I can tell they are pretty much a must for an official diagnosis? My mouth is pretty sensitive, I get swollen taste buds all the time and, like I can\u2019t have too much say salt and ginger chips for example or my whole mouth feels raw for days and a layer of dead skin peels off my cheeks/gums sometimes, but I\u2019m unsure if that counts.. I used to get canker sores regularly as a kid but not really as an adult. \n\n\nI\u2019m aware that a lot of my symptoms overlap with other conditions/disorders and that Behcets itself is rare in my ethnicity and where I live but considering I do have an immediate relative with a diagnosis I think it\u2019s worth looking into? \n\nAny suggestions on what or how to bring this up with my Dr are appreciated!

I'd had recurrent mouth ulcers for at least 15 years  prior, and which no doctor or dentist I saw in that time could treat other than telling me to use OTC lidocaine. When genital ulcers popped up, and I tested negative for STDs by my PCP, I was referred to a rheumatologist who diagnosed me with BD presumably because I had both oral and genital ulcers and was positive for HLA B51. He put me on colchicine and prescribed Medrol packs for flares. After about 2 years the genital flares stopped and I felt I could handle the oral breakouts without the terrible side effects of the colchicine. Until 7 weeks ago. I began to feel a genital ulcer forming and called the rheumatologist for an appt. First available appt is 1/31 because I am considered a new patient since I haven't seen him in 3 years. I made a same day appt with at my OBGYNs office.  By the time I saw her the ulcer was 1.5cm and incredibly painful (and this particular OBGYN was awful and demeaning, told me I looked like I got burned by a cigarette and walked me down to labs for STD testing which I'd explained I DID NOT HAVE). I eventually reached out to another Dr in the practice who prescribed triamacinolone cream and lidocaine gel, neither of which did much help. Two weeks later, the 2+cm ulcer now preventing me from walking, peeing or sitting without pain (and the thought of sex is terrifying)  I asked her for a medrol pack, which I took and which worked to shrink the ulcer but not completely heal it. It is now increasing in size again, is exquisitely painful and I also have a mouth full of ulcers. The nurse at the rheumatologist says she can't do anything to get me in sooner, the OBGYN is at a loss, and I am waiting for my PCP to call me back, though I am certain she won't know what to do since it was her who referred me to the rheumatologist in the first place after throwing up her hands on treatment. I just NEED RELIEF and at this point, I don't know where to turn or even what to tell this PCP on how to treat this ulcer since i've never had one this large and deep and  getting worse after steroids.

I\u2019ve given the past 7 years of my life. I want to live. I see my friends, my little cousins all moving away and making something of themselves. I wasn\u2019t even given that option.

(Have had hsv1 since childhood) Never pustules just acute ulcers. Took a hsv2 blood test which was negative, dr said it didn\u2019t look like herpes \u201cby nature\u201d but I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s pretty a misunderstood diagnosis so I\u2019ve taken it at face value. 8 weeks after exposure I took another blood test. Came back positive but my igg levels were 0.0 . Dr said it was a false positive. However I get outbreaks pretty much monthly so with the positive test results I bit the bullet and accepted. My first disclosure ended up as a relationship so I didn\u2019t bother getting retested. I was pretty lax with the valtrex and he didn\u2019t care about sex during OBs. They\u2019re fairly painless just annoying. \n\nWe broke up and I\u2019m getting ready to date again. Going to get retested for HSV2 but reading up on behcets \u2026 dare I say I\u2019m hopeful. Every so often my eyes will get incredibly bloodshot, and won\u2019t subside. First time it happened I thought it was pink eye from hell but nothing worked to get rid of it and I did everything I mean EVERYTHING to get rid of any pink eye bacteria. it never weeped or oozed. as a kid my eyes would constantly water. Used to get upset when I first started wearing makeup , would last like 10 minutes lol. To this day I have pretty frequent ocular pain when I try to look side to side, was told this could be my astigmatism. \n\nI get acne like bumps all over my body, never thought much of it. Can\u2019t tell them apart from pimples until I try to pop them and they are so much worst after that. Thought it was a weird type of acne but I\u2019m almost 30 now. Wake up with mild ulcers on tongue / soft palette thinking it\u2019s a food problem every other month, goes away quick and they\u2019re not severe. I have psoriasis, sometimes starts as pustules on my legs that spread and scar , sometimes stems from a wound (satellite patches from surgical scars) \n\nI have a history of excruciating migraines, diagnosed anxiety, depression and eventually bipolar disorder. I\u2019ve had a lonnnnggggg history with GI / digestion problems. In and out of hospitals as a kid, now I just buck up as my tentative diagnosis was GERD and the medication is linked to cancer. Hospitalized for Ovarian cysts (fever so high they\u2019ve thought it was appendicitis and was prepped for surgery , twice) episodes of localized extreme abdominal pain, felt like I was being shot over and over. ER couldn\u2019t find anything responsible (morphine helped). Arthritis runs in my family pretty rampant + my psoriasis (psoriatic arthritis) so I don\u2019t pay much attention to it knowing I\u2019m just going to have it and that\u2019s that. I get super fatigued, like the thought of getting out of bed sometimes feels like backpacking the Appalachian\u2019s but I attribute this to my depressive episodes. as a kid I had utis and pneumonia like a tag team. This has subsided as an adult but I know how to avoid the uti (doesn\u2019t always work) \n\nDoctors have wrote off my pain my whole life. For fear of sounding like a hypochondriac or being considered   weak and not pain tolerant I avoid doctors like the plague(ironic, innit) but looking back on my medical history I\u2019m like\u2026 wtf . I know my pain and experience is real. It\u2019s all to finally discover it all might be related? From suggesting I\u2019m psychosomatic, to being shamed for my sexual choices, told by an obgyn if I got another X-ray/CT she wouldn\u2019t see me anymore because my ovaries would rot, to being told i must be unhygienic (I am a clean freak btw) \u2026 frankly I haven\u2019t had a primary care doctor since I was like 20. I won\u2019t be condescended anymore. Im so dismissive about it I don\u2019t really even think about it but now I\u2019m pissed lol. But I don\u2019t want to go through the painful diagnosis process - seems like the more you bring to them, the less likely you\u2019ll get a good outcome \n\nWhat made me even come here is I saw a couple articles about behcets patients being extremely irritable upon waking up. It\u2019s like a running joke among my family and partners that I am a heartless person my first 5 minutes of the day. I\u2019ve made grown men cry, people. It\u2019s bad. I may have read these articles wrong but I scoffed when I read it. I\u2019d be sold based off that alone. \n\nLastly to note, my ex never once got an ob and as mentioned we would have sex during mine. I kinda summed it up to the thought that he might already have it and that\u2019s why he was so chill about it in the first place.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 936, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "anxious for advice", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/rdj1ho/anxious_for_advice/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sisterlectic", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_cloil5ih", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1638807349, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/raax2j/anyone_else_start_having_symptoms_come_back_after/", "gildings": {}, "id": "raax2j", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#5a74cc", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1f8b259c-0a51-11eb-9e58-0e9d29332059", "link_flair_text": "Symptoms", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/raax2j/anyone_else_start_having_symptoms_come_back_after/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1638807360, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm 37 and have had a Behcet's for six years.

F. I've been having been struggling to confirm what it is that is going on with my body in the past 7 months and feel like I have a lot of the symptoms that is described in Behcet's disease. My first symptoms were neurological. I felt like bugs or critters were crawling along my skin from the top of my head  down to the soles of my feet. I thought I was going crazy, brushing my arms and legs like something was there, but there wasn't. Then the pain in my stomach appeared. It feels like a tight squeeze to the right of my belly button for a few seconds multiple times a day. The crawling sensation eventually went away, but I do experience neuropathy in my hands and feet as well as muscle spasms in my back and sporadic burning/ prickling sensations along my back and legs. I also have involuntary tremors of my left eyelid that began recently. \n\nIn the last month I started feeling a burning sensation in the genital region and thought I had a UTI. I went to the obgyn and when she examined me she told me I have two ulcers that resemble herpes. I also had a oral sore on my lip at the time. I was devastated to hear this news. She took a culture which was incredibly painful and prescribed me antivirals. Well it turned out the culture was negative and I later went for blood work to determine if I had a herpes flare and it was negative for both types.

So today is a happy day, and possibly the happiest of my life. I'm so excited to hopefully get it under control and start living for the first time in my mid-20's, I've been too sick to work or study for several years now. I really thought the only way we would ever get an answer was going to be through an autopsy. \n\n**Do you all have any recommendations for a newbie, anything I should know? How are you guys treating your disease?** I'd love to get a good feel of what the future holds. This is super fresh, like, biopsies came back this morning, fresh. And rather unexpected! My GI was the one who found it and diagnosed it (and she was excited to see such an uncommon disease in her practice, haha). We catch up my rheumatologist tomorrow!\n\nYou don't have to read the rest of it, the rest of the post is just my journey on how I got here. \n\nFor some background: 25F. white as they come, lived most of my life in the West (Europe/USA/Canada). I've been battling a long list of symptoms that have lead me to seeing just about every specialist that exists. The answer was always the same, \"we know it is inflammation, but we cannot figure out WHY its inflamed, so, good luck.\"\n\nI started getting more and more desperate starting 2021. I lost all my hair. I would get \"staph infections\" everywhere -- giant white pustules -- and they were so painful. Dermatology couldn't figure out why I was losing my hair (ruled out everything, including alopecia) nor why I got so many sores (\"we know you have a bad immune system, right? so probably that.\" -- he really did try, despite what it sounds like). \n\nLike probably everyone here, one reoccurring issue through all my symptoms was the mouth sores. Nothing got rid of them. I tried EVERYTHING. I had excessive oral hygiene (I splurged on a fancy toothbrush, brushed after \\*everything\\* I ate, tried every type of toothpaste and mouthwash in the book. I flossed after every meal. Wisdom teeth were pulled, anything that could be a cavity was filled... I really went to the max). Then my doctors thought a vitamin issue, so I carefully balanced my diet, took a ton of supplements, we'd run tests with and without all the extra measures and everything was normal. Then they'd recommend removing xyz from my diet, I'd comply... still had mouth sores. I couldn't eat. My doctors just kept assuming I was lying and one ENT even dropped me as a patient because they were convinced I was lying and/or triggering them purposely for my visit. I cannot wait to send them my biopsy results. \n\nI'd say half my doctors believed me with all my random symptoms -- the problem is that it was always SOMETHING and it was never consistent with what I was struggling with (beyond the mouth sores, exhaustion, joint pain). Something new ALWAYS popped up. These doctors were so frustrated that they could not narrow in on it. I even got transferred to the top rheumatologist at my Ivy League rheumatology office (in the Ivy League campus hospital). He's primarily a researcher and only sees \"bizarre and insolvable cases\" and even he was super frustrated by my symptoms. \n\nThe other half of my doctors always passive aggressively offered psych referrals. \n\nWe got an answer in the most unexpected way: I wrote my GI asking if she had a standard blood workup she could run/tends to run on new patients, because she was one of the only specialists that had not really done a full workup on me (I had contact with her because I also have Celiac Disease). She agreed. First round of blood tests came back irregular, notably my vitamin A (which in the West, can only be caused by a medical issue). Next round of GI tests came back and one of the inflammation tests -- the range was 0-49 and I hit almost 7,000. Immediately was given an emergency scope. I want to clarify: I've never even had as much as a stomach cramp. I had no GI symptoms. \n\nWhen I came to after the anesthesia, she came into the room and was smiling and announced: \"/u/pm-me-shibas, we found it! We know the source of all your issues these last few years.\" and I was so relieved. \n\nMy biopsies came back this morning and vasculitis is confirmed, with the pathologist noting that Beh\u00e7et's is the most likely. We still have to diagnose the type of vasculitis, but we all agree on the likelihood of Beh\u00e7et's and the types of vasculitis that can effect a 25 year-old woman *and* match my symptoms *and* can also completely destroy a colon (and only a colon -- yes, UC was ruled out) is incredibly narrow. \n\nWe strongly expect to find more damage in other organs where I've had major complaints, so that part isn't over. \n\n**So, tl;dr**: what are your tips for a newbie and how do you currently treat your Beh\u00e7et's?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 903, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Newly diagnosed!!

Right before the onset of the ulcers I was feeling kind of sick, mostly nauseated and achy. Fast forward to this past June I had another flare, similar symptoms of feeling ill and achy and then feeling some sort of itch in my vagina that I though was an oncoming yeast infection but then woke up with sores. Both times I had gotten a similar itch (although its not really an itch like I feel the need to scratch, not sure how to describe) thinking it might be a yeast infection coming, also both times I was under a lot of stress and experienced similar illness symptoms prior to the ulcers. Obviously went to urgent care for STD testing again, Dr said the same thing as before and all tests came back negative. Now yesterday I got that same \"itch\", had been feeling nausea a couple days ago and feeling lethargic and achy/ generally not well the last few days. Woke up with sores today. I plan to get another STD test because I have had sex without a condom once since the last test, just to rule it out but this feels more like the previous flare ups. I dont really get oral ulcers or eye lesions but I do always have random bumps on my body, the other day I noticed a bunch of small red bumps in my shin which I thought was weird but didnt think much of it. Both times I've had the genital ulcers they last aboout 1-2 weeks and the pain gets progressively worse until they start going away, they also seem to start out like small red ulcers then almost scab over.

So let me start the first time I remember ever getting a canker sore I was 19, I just got one and ever since then I would get them constantly. I am 24 now and to be honest I get them all the time. At 23 I started getting genital ulcers (first thought herpes)! I\u2019ve gotten swabbed twice but both were negative, then blood work showed positive for HSV1. Fast forward to this month I went on vacation and noticed an outbreak on my genitals very small so I upped my antivirals, they did absolutely nothing. Then my mouth sores went insane I probably have around 10. I went to my GYN begging to switch antivirals because the pain is so unbearable and I just want something to work. Next thing you know she gets a second opinion and the Dr. asks have you ever heard of Behcets? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s herpes in your mouth &amp; all your genital swabs have been negative. (they swabbed me again so results will be in next week) there\u2019s still a 50/50 chance that I might have herpes but I have a referral for rheumatologist that\u2019s the first step. I just have a few questions about medication side effects. The pain is fucking awful, but do the steroids actually work? Have you gotten weight gain? Steroid induced diabetes?

My sciatic pain and body fatigue has reduced drastically. I only get the pain in the start of the day and it gradually reduces.  But suddenly there seems to be an persistent pain in my upper left back at a certain point. It's like constantly there even when all other symptoms has reduced. Today I had a close call with panic attack during MRI which seemed to have aggravated the pain more. I tried heat pack which worked for few minutes, laying on my left side which worked for few minutes as well then my sister applied pressure on the point which really helped to reduce and almost completely stop the pain. But I started feel a heat cold sensation in my left arm and my chest started to feel tight. After sometime the pain returned and I took plaquenil as last resort. The pain persisted until I fell into nap. I remember waking up in between sleep and not feeling any pain even when I was laying on my back side. Now as I woke up fully, the pain has returned and a tight chest feeling. My MRI results for lumbar scan came, in which I seem to have a 'diffuse annular bulge at L4 / L5 causing minimal thecal sac compression'. Everything else is notmal. I'm not sure what is happening.

The pain is honestly debilitating and I need treatment but I don\u2019t know how to push for a diagnosis!  \n\nThank you in advance for any help and advice! \ud83d\ude0a", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 852, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Diagnosis help", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/plogdt/diagnosis_help/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "EllisMichaels", "author_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "8626b4a6-0277-11eb-a3f1-0eab60cc709b", "author_flair_text": "Diagnosed 1997", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ub0agju", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1630930371, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/piy93y/rising_from_the_illness_behcets_podcast/", "gildings": {}, "id": "piy93y", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/piy93y/rising_from_the_illness_behcets_podcast/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "RrG3lZnHGKqrr384cUiyQv6VU3VVZNKZ3bdipLV0ww8", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/HVaaBgJXwsaf20BPitwJEJhC5jXKAYLKUJ8fizrafjc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b80f93ade6ae06e17d65887ba01f7f150bd621e", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/HVaaBgJXwsaf20BPitwJEJhC5jXKAYLKUJ8fizrafjc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704988786afd28715ad2ddb1d27f2c22fd79d626", "width": 216}], "source": {"height": 300, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/HVaaBgJXwsaf20BPitwJEJhC5jXKAYLKUJ8fizrafjc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5325cd1c61c0a84d603a295415bc92d78b24e6aa", "width": 300}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1630930382, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just wanted to let you all know that I was on a recently episode of Rising From The Illness, a podcast created by a wonderful woman with Behcet's disease.

I (M20) was really excited to find out there is a sub for behcets so I could talk about it.\n\nAs the title says, I was recently diagnosed with behcets. I\u2019ve had mouth ulcers since I can remember and  I just lived with them as a child. When I was around 17 and I become sexually active with my current gf I started to get genital ulcers. To begin with I was told they were friction sores and I was prescribed an antibacterial anti inflammatory cream. Since then I haven\u2019t been able to have any type of sex life as any injury causes ulceration and I will randomly get \u201cthe itch\u201d around stressful times which indicates ulcer formation even without sex. I\u2019m currently in the middle of my worst outbreak of penile ulceration so far. Thankfully I have a good cream for the inflammation and I think it has a local anaesthetic because it reduces the pain. \n\nWhen I when to my latest doctor he suggested behcets. I went to a rheumatologist who barely even knew what behcets was. He actually spent the whole session googling things about behcets. I don\u2019t have eye problems and for some reason I can get a wave of ulcers in my mouth but not genitals and vice versa. I was prescribed colchicine but I don\u2019t know how to take. Is it 2 little pills a day or what is it even for. \n\nWhat I mean by I am sceptical is that I don\u2019t know if I even have behcets or just another condition that causes mouth ulcers or penile ulcers or both. I live in Ireland and know no one else with behcets. \n\nDo any of you think I have it and if so is there any thing I can do to try have a normal sex life? Also I was curious, does circumcision help?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 838,

Woke up with muscle weakness and blurry vision on the 15th, went to ER, CT showed no sinus infection or abnormalities. Normal blood work. Went for an MRI two days later, no abnormalities. SED and CRP normal. Awaiting ANA (also ELISA, I traveled to places with ticks and mosquitoes this summer). Doc wouldn\u2019t run an ANCA, but I\u2019m ordering my own. \nAlso developed shingles on the 18th. (It\u2019s been a blast.)\n\nOnly thing\u2014 I do not currently have any mouth ulcers, genital ulcers, or skin ulcers. \n\nDoes this sound like Behcet\u2019s? (Or NB?)\n\nThanks for any input!

I was actually diagnosed fairly quickly since all these symptoms showed up at the same time in the beginning. Prednisone helps with some of this, but it still usually lasts a few weeks and totally turns my world upside down.\n\nThe weirdest part is that these episodes are almost exactly a year apart each time - always late August for some reason. Last year\u2019s started on August 21st, and I started feeling the onset of one yesterday on the 24th that\u2019s progressively getting worse. I\u2019m hoping this one is not as catastrophic, as I haven\u2019t experienced any of the more serious symptoms since getting on medication like colchicine full time. \n\nI am amazed at how precise the timing has been, and I can\u2019t think of anything seasonally-specific that might trigger it. Anyone else get full body inflammation like this at the same time of year for no apparent reason?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id":

Was stuck in the hospital about two weeks with a ton of unanswered questions for a rheumatologist to finally confirm it was behcets, which of course, very little people have heard of even in the medical community. My favorite is when new doctors tell me they \u201cgoogled it\u201d. Well I was on Otezla for a while before the pandemic, and I felt like maybe it helped but I still had flare ups which they gave me prednisone to help with.

Flash forward to now (or about two months ago) I start having a really bad flare up (arthritis pain on full blast, nausea, vomiting, gut pain). I went to the ER when I was dehydrated, they asked what usually helps. I get put on new but different steroids that help with everything except tearing my stomach to shreds. I finally found a primary care but I can\u2019t see her for about a month and a half, and I can\u2019t see any specialists without her referral- so I just don\u2019t know what to do short of going to the ER again. I know they\u2019re just going to try to put me on more steroids which I don\u2019t think my stomach/intestines can take. I guess this is mostly a rant about how hard I\u2019m struggling to live a regular life with this disease (I\u2019ve had to call out of work all week and I fear my job is on the line) but I guess also a cry out for any advice at all. Anything natural or even just soothing temporary remedies I can do at home to keep myself comfortable JUST until I can get in with my doctor?

Over the 25+ years since my diagnosis, I've amassed quite a collection of Behcet's info. Now I'm going to share some of the disease's most interesting facts with you. \n\n***1. You're more/less likely to be [insert unlikely event] than diagnosed with Behcet's***\n\nIn the United States, it's estimated that roughly 0.38 out of every 100,000 people have Behcet's disease. That's about 1 out of every 260,000 people. So the odds of having Behcet's are about 260,000:1. Not quite one in a million: More like four in a million. \n\nThe good news is, if you're just some random American with no signs or symptoms of Behcet's disease, it's incredibly unlikely you have it. The bad news, of course, is for people like me who definitely do have it. Well, not so much bad news as it is just plain old bad luck. \n\nExactly how unlucky are we? What other rare events are more common than a Behcet's diagnosis? How about less common? When comparing the unlikelihood of a situation to something known to be rare, two things come up more than anything else: winning the lottery and getting struck by lightening. Let's see how Behcet's stacks up next to them. \n\nIn any given year, the odds of being struck by lightening in the United States are about 1 in 1.2 million. But over the course of an entire lifetime (~80 years), the odds of getting struck are 1 in 15,300. That means you're 17 times more likely to get struck by lightening at some point in your life than to be diagnosed with Behcet's disease. \n\nWhat about winning the lottery? This one's harder to calculate because it's impossible determine the odds of winning over the course of a lifetime, as there are many variables to consider (games played, frequency of play, etc.). However, we can compare winning any one drawing with getting diagnosed. \n\nTake Powerball, easily one of the most popular lottery games (if not the most popular). The odds of winning the jackpot is 1 in 292 million \u2013 give or take a few hundred thousand. That means you're more likely to have Behcet's disease than to win the Powerball jackpot with a single ticket \u2013 a lot more likely: 1,123 times more likely, to be precise. \n\nHere are a few more comparisons: \n\nThe odds of dying in a motor-vehicle accident are 1 in 107. That means you're 2,430 times more likely to be killed in a car crash than diagnosed with Behcet's. \n\nThe odds of dying in an earthquake are 1 in 159,890. That means you're almost twice as likely to die in an earthquake than be diagnosed with Behcet's disease. \n\nThe odds of being killed by a hurricane are 1 in about 62,000. That means you're about 5 times more likely to be diagnosed with Behcet's. \n\nAnd lastly, the odds of being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the US are about 8.3 per 100,000. That means you're about 22 times more likely to be diagnosed with MS than Behcet's. \n\nAs you can see, Behcet's disease is rare. It's not as rare as winning the lottery or being killed in an earthquake, but it's rare. So if you've been diagnosed, you're either really lucky or really unlucky \u2013 depending on how you look at it. \n\n***2. Behcet's disease doesn't discriminate***\n\nBehcet's disease is a type of vasculitis, a group of disorders that cause inflammation in blood vessels. There are many different types of vasculitis including Kawasaki disease, Takayasu's arteritis, Buerger's disease, among others. \n\nOne thing all these different types of vasculitis have in common is that they either affect arteries or veins \u2013 but not both. Behcet's disease, on the other hand, doesn't discriminate: it can affect arteries and veins. In fact, Behcet's is the only type of vasculitis that can affect both. \n\nArteries are vessels that pump blood away from your heart and supply oxygen to your body. Then the deoxygenated blood travels through your veins, vessels that carry blood back to the heart. \n\nThe different types of vasculitis are divided into three groups based on the size of the vessels they affect: large, medium, and small-vessel vasculitis. Though Behcet's disease is classified as a small-vessel vasculitis, it can cause inflammation in arteries and veins, small, medium, and large. \n\nIn general, Behcet's disease affects veins more than arteries and small vessels more than large ones. But inflammation in large arteries is possible. In that respect, Behcet's doesn't discriminate. \n\nHowever, Behcet's disease can be a tiny bit sexist. Although it affects both men and women, vascular involvement is more frequently seen in men. That doesn't mean women with Behcet's don't experience blood-vessel inflammation, too \u2013 just not as often as us guys (lucky us!). \n\nWhat about other Behcet's symptoms? Do some affect guys more than gals? Do some affect the ladies more than the fellas? Up next, we'll explore some gender differences in Behcet's disease. \n\n***3. Behcet's disease does discriminate***\n\nBoth men and women can be diagnosed with Behcet's disease. And while either gender can experience any of Behcet's symptoms, some are more common in one or the other. \n\nAs mentioned above, vascular involvement is more common in men with Behcet's than women. And, unfortunately for us guys, so is serious ocular (eye) and neurological involvement. \n\nA study published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology looked at 880 patients with Behcet's uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, part of the eye). After 5 years, the risk of losing useful vision in male patients was 21% and 10% in women. After 10 years, the risk was 30% for men compared to 17% for women. The researchers concluded that Behcet's uveitis is (generally) more severe in men and more likely to result in vision loss. \n\nAnother study published in the same medical journal looked at childhood-onset Behcet's uveitis. The researchers found that uveitis was more common among males diagnosed with Behcet's disease than females. \n\nBehcet's disease can affect the nervous system (including the brain). This is referred to as Neuro-Behcet's. Estimates vary widely as to what percentage of people diagnosed with Behcet's experience neurological involvement, anywhere from 2.2-50%. \n\nThough Neuro-Behcet's can affect both men and women, it is more commonly seen in men. The men:women ratio for Neuro-Behcet's is 2.9:1. In other words, men diagnosed with Behcet's disease are about 3 times more likely to experience Neuro-Behcet's than women. \n\nWhen it comes to some of the other common symptoms of Behcet's disease like oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and arthritis, men and women are affected at roughly the same rate. But there's one more way Behcet's discriminates \u2013 mortality rate. While Behcet's has an overall mortality rate of about 5%, men are a lot more likely to die from Behcet's-related complications than women. \n\n***4. You're saying it wrong***\n\nI'll never forget the day in 1997 that I got diagnosed with Behcet's disease. I was at the Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston being seen by one of the leading retina specialists in the country. He sat me down and said in a matter-of-fact tone, \u201cYou have Behcet's disease,\u201d as if all sixteen-year-old kids are supposed to know what that is. \n\nThis doctor \u2013 who's name I won't mention \u2013 pronounced it buh-shets disease. And the rheumatologist I began seeing soon after also pronounced it buh-shets. So, naturally, I assumed they were saying it correctly. These men were, after all, highly accomplished doctors. \n\nWell, they were both wrong. And so have most of the doctor's I've seen since. You see, Behcet's disease was named after the Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Beh\u00e7et. You may notice that little mark under the letter c. That's called a cedilla (sometimes spelled cedille or cedilha) and it changes the pronunciation of the letter. \n\nCedillas are a little hook or tail under certain letters and are used in several languages. In French, a cedilla under the letter C gives it a s- sound. However, in Turkish, a cedilla under the letter C gives it a ch- sound. \n\nSince the written word was the most common form of communication in Dr. Hulusi Behcet's day, a lot of people had only seen his name in writing. And a lot of those people assumed the cedilla in his last name was French, not Turkish. \n\nBecause of this, the disease he wrote extensively about became known over time as buh-sets or buh-shets. But that's not the way Dr. Hulusi Behcet's family name was pronounced. Since it's a Turkish name, the C-cedilla follows the Turkish rules: it's pronounced not like s- but like ch-. So, if the name of the disease stayed true to the doctor it's named after, it would be pronounced bay-chets disease. \n\n***5. To B or not to B \u2013 HLA-B, that is***\n\nThe cause of Behcet's disease is believed to be at least partly genetic. And no other gene has received nearly as much attention as the HLA-B51 gene (HLA stands for human leukocyte antigen). \n\nNearly 40 years ago in 1982, researchers published a paper that demonstrated a close association between Behcet's disease and the HLA-B5 series of genes, particularly B51. Since then, as genetic science has progressed, lots of other research has been done on HLA-B51 and other genes related to Behcet's. \n\nIt's estimated that between 50-80% of people diagnosed with Behcet's disease are positive for the HLA-B51 gene. However, just because you test positive for HLA-B51 doesn't mean you necessarily have Behcet's. In fact, 20% of healthy individuals (people with no signs or symptoms of Behcet's or anything else) have the HLA-B51 gene. \n\nAnother gene associated with Behcet's disease \u2013 though much less strongly \u2013 is HLA-B52. A study done in Israel, a country with a high prevalence of Behcet's, found HLA-B51 present in 63% of patients with Behcet's and HLA-B52 in 21%. While that might not sound like a high percentage, it's more than twice that of the control group. \n\nLastly, I'll mention the HLA-B27 gene. This one is associated with several diseases including reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and anterior uveitis. HLA-B27 has also been shown to be associated with Behcet's disease, though not nearly as strongly as HLA-B51. \n\nI'm not sure about HLA-B52, but I personally have the HLA-B51 and HLA-B27 genes. I did uncover a bit of good news for those of us with both genes. At least according to one study published in 2007, patients diagnosed with Behcet's uveitis who tested positive for both HLA-B51 and B27 had more favorable prognoses.\n\n*Thanks for reading!

It\u2019s more like a big swollen bit of skin with a bit of ulceration \n- extremely sore inner vulva and vagina (to the point of bleeding) \n\nI went to the clinic today where they visually examined me. She did a culture then and there and said she didn\u2019t think it was thrush. She also said herpes was unlikely based on how it looks and also the fact that the anti virals were taking so long to work. \nI\u2019ve also had some mouth ulcers this week and a random sore on my finger. She suggested it might be Bechets so I\u2019m waiting for blood test results. \n\nMy question: does it cause extreme itching on the genitalia? For me this symptom is worse than the pain.

My most common symptom is ulcers and swelling in the mouth and throat, which pretty much happen every few weeks / all the time to varying degrees. I've been given triple mouthwash to take 4 times a day when I have ulcers and 2 times a day with no symptoms. I am also on two colchicine tablets a day. I used to go on steroids a lot, probably about 5 or 6 times in the last year (which I know isnt great!!). But I've now been stopped from taking them as I know have recurring shingles and it triggers nasty shingles flare ups. So they're taking a 'softer' approach to treatment. \n\nMy experience of taking triple mouthwash hasn't been great so far. Its staining my teeth and caused black tongue, which doesn't sound so bad but it sucks for self esteem. And I find it really tricky to get it to dissolve. \n\nAnyone using it and have some advice!?

Out of nowhere, my 29 year old self, had a strange headache after work one night. I began pressing into my sinuses and at one point, my eye began to twitch uncontrollably. The only difference was, it never stopped. It twitched for months afterwards. This was the first of my baffling symptoms and my long journey with an undiagnosed illness. \n\nThe following weeks started to become gradually worse and the symptoms became stranger and stranger. The twitching had progressed to my other eye as well and I developed a severe burning sensation behind both of my eyes (it felt like eyelashes in my eyes 24/7!). Constantly had floaters in my vision. I started to get dizzy spells at night, and even had these horrifying audio dropouts in my hearing\u2026followed by ringing in my ears. I had gone to quite a few emergency rooms at this point, and doctors tested me for many infectious diseases and other problems\u2026but none of them could piece together my strange list of symptoms. Even my girlfriend was beginning to question my symptoms because every doctors visit was futile.\n\nOddly, I noticed a strange bump on my left calf shortly after many of my initial symptoms\u2026it looked like a medium sized pimple\u2026except it never went away (I still have this strange bump, nearly 3 years later\u2026it hasn\u2019t disappeared). As weeks turned into months, I was certain I might die which was thankfully an over reaction to my frightening symptoms. My eyes were on fire, they twitched, I had strange headaches, and finally one of my most frightening symptoms began to manifest. I had a throbbing blood clot/pulsating type feeling in each of my temples at random times. The closest thing I could find to this type of disorder was \u201ctemporal arteritis\u201d which was very strange because I didn\u2019t even come close to the age group for that type of disease. Regardless, when I felt a pulsating feeling in my temple, my body would have random muscle spasms associated with the throbbing sensation. Sometimes my leg might have tiny spasms\u2026other times my shoulder\u2026even my arms would have this feeling when I felt this strange sensation in my temple. The inside of my sinuses were on fire at this point as well. It was as if someone poured acid into my eyes and up my nose\u2026\n\nI documented a lot of my symptoms around this time. I felt certain I was about to have a stroke. I eventually had trouble focusing on conversations\u2026almost like a brain fog. I had this strange tingling feeling down the back of my head and neck on many occasions which followed with dizzy spells and confusion. These were very frightening! \n\nThe last symptom which I saved for last\u2026because of the irony\u2026is apthous ulcers (canker sores). I\u2019ve had these sores my whole life in my mouth. I never thought much of them before. They came and went as I grew up\u2026but I never knew they could be linked to something like the terrifying symptoms I was having. Usually, the minute I bite my lip or cheek, I\u2019m destined to get one of these ulcers\u2026it\u2019s became pretty routine for me and I never though much of it. However, In the past 30 days or so, I\u2019ve specifically tried to count the number of times I\u2019ve had these types of ulcers. So far, the number of ulcers has been exactly 3 (1 on my tongue, and 2 on my inner lip).\n\nAnother reason why I\u2019m rather certain that I must have Behcets is because I\u2019ve always had strange joint pains. Once when I was younger, I woke up and my legs were so week I couldn\u2019t walk\u2026I look back at that and realize how serious this was\u2026and how I never really though much of it because they worked fine the next day. This happened again to me near the end of my initial storm of symptoms! My knee began to randomly jolt with severe pain which was crippling. It popped and I nearly fell a few times when my leg just spontaneously would give out. I though I had torn a muscle\u2026but my doctor suspected arthritis.\n\nThe arthritis diagnoses may have saved my life! I was battling a storm of worsening symptoms around this point\u2026eyes always on fire\u2026I thought I might go blind or have a stroke and lose my vision. I could almost tell that something was up with my arteries because of all the strange things happening with my body at this point. Finally, the doctor prescribed me a week of Prednisone for what he suspected was arthritis. \n\nMy year long nightmare of symptoms faded rather quickly upon being prescribed Prednisone. My eyes stopped burning, the throbbing in my temples went away, my dizzy spells became less frequent\u2026nearly all my symptoms went away after just a week of Prednisone. \n\nTo this day, most of my symptoms have been easy to maintain and the storm-like deterioration of my health has thankfully subsided. I cannot promise that I have Behcets\u2026because I went to every doctor/specialist I could find and none of them ever even seemed to suspect anything of the sort\u2026even if they did, upon my research, it is quite difficult to diagnose. \n\nIf you have Behcets and can relate to any of the symptoms I\u2019ve listed, please feel free to comment. I believe I will discuss this illness with my new doctor at our next visit because it almost certainly resembles everything I\u2019ve experienced thus far. I\u2019m reaching out here because if my illness is in fact Behcets, then I strongly sympathize for anyone else who\u2019s had to deal with this in their life.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 742, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I believe I have Behcets.

When I was 3/4, I used to suffer from bone and muscles pain on my lower legs but it is gone itself. Then I began to suffer from chronic mouth ulcers (everywhere in my mouth and tongue) since 5 and keratitis (cornea inflammation) since 11. I tried all medicine (and even an eye injection) during these decades but the symptoms just come and go. My mouth ulcers become very severe in the first year of my high school and my doctors (in China) suspect it is immune system so I got injections on my lymphatic (I am not very sure which kind of medicine it is). Before I started college, someone heard of my symptoms in eye and mouth, and he suspects it is Behcet. I also found purpura on my lower legs, and been diagnosed as Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura and after it is cured, it didn't come back again. I don\u2019t have arthritis or ulcers on my vagina, but it is still scary to me and my family and we realized my two symptoms are related and cannot be treated alone.Then I started 4 years Chinese medicine (for all systematic cure, you know). Ulcers are under controlled but eye symptoms go on (not as severe as in my childhood though so I just leave it there). However, I began to have acnes on my face\u2026 until now. I went to comprehensive eye examination routinely and didn\u2019t find any problem.\n\nThen I come to the U.S. I still have keratitis so I went to eye doctor routinely and take \u201crestasis\u201d an eye drop for a few years. My eye doctor said it is cornea inflammation caused by dryness. My ulcers become much better in the first year I came here and they came back only when I was in China for summer break. Then I completely got rid of them since almost three years ago, only occasionally one came out and cured itself automatically after 10 days (drinking a lot of water will facilitate the progress). I thought everything was fine. But for a while, I got lower back pain after long-time sitting and I went to chiropractor for that. Nothing more.\n\nHowever, since last October, I start to have eczema on my hand (and it doesn't go away until now). My ulcers came back again soon, here and there in my mouth and tongue, one cured automatically after 10 days and the other came out right after. Simultaneously since I stopped Restasis, my eye problems became more severe and more frequent (although I never completely got rid of them) and it blurred my vision. I went to cornea consultant and he recommended me to see a rheumatologist.

Basically I get an itch and slowly it turns into pain and swelling and lots of no fun. Looking back theyve gotten progressively worse every time. They hadn\u2019t been too bad* (too bad meaning interrupting my day to day function) up until this week, the most recent flare up. I thought I was never going to get relief. \nI was completely unable to urinate from the pain at one point, lasting two days, and I\u2019d burst into tears immediately. I have a tender sore spot at the corner of my mouth that makes it difficult to eat, which has scabbed over but somewhat resembles a canker sore. I was seen at an urgent care Sunday, the emergency room Monday, and a gyno Tuesday. \nI was negative for all the STI\u2019s, yeast, my pH was normal, my white blood cells were up, and I was experiencing an odorless discharge. I was so swollen the speculum kept getting pushed out at the ER. It was as if my entire vagina just became infected, leaking discharge and so swollen it hurt to walk and stand for too long. I didn\u2019t have any pelvic pain, it was essentially my labia and vaginal entrance that hurt.\nNobody was able to help me and it was a really terrible experience overall honestly, until I got to the gyno.

Since I came off the infusion I broke out in a strange rash all over my tummy, legs and arms. I\u2019ve had one quite large sore/ scab appear on my leg and then lots of little just red dots and you can see in the pictures. I was told by the doctor it sounded like psoriasis over the phone due to covid they would not see me.  Majority of that cleared up I still do get the odd spot. I also have quite sore joints, my jaw often becomes stiff and unable to open past a certain point, I got a mouth guard to try and help ease this. I also get pain in my neck and ankles. Another thing I have experienced since coming off treatment is sometimes sore eyes. In one case it got very inflamed and red. I often get severe headache and migraines, and even since my UC has been in remission I have struggled to keep a steady weight and am very below average weight. Most recently and concerning me the most is I have ulcers on my genitals. I have been to the doctor and they suggested it may be herpes. I was tested and it came back negative. I know herpes tests can sometimes not be accurate so I decided to go ahead with some treatment anyway. The symptoms are still here but I haven\u2019t completed treatment yet. I do sometimes get ulcers in my mouth but I have never thought too much of it having ulcerative colitis. However, after doing my research on the symptoms of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease and reading other people\u2019s posts on Reddit about misdiagnoses of herpes and crohns I am now considering it could be a possibility I have beh\u00e7ets. I am very unsure and honestly feel a bit embarrassed to go to the doctor incase I am totally reaching with this diagnosis as I understand it is a rare condition. If you read all of that thank you! And any comments or opinions  would be really appreciated and helpful.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 704, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Misdiagnosis?

Does anyone else get this? It's debilitating.  Last time I ended up in a wheelchair for 7 months of my life no longer able to move my legs essentially without horrendous pain, while having to be on heavy duty pain meds.  It also came with tendonitis in all of my tendons around joints.  And horrendous arthritis in every joint from toes, feet, knees, hips, wrists to elbows and spine. It grew from my feet up each week like a paralysis spreading.  No one could explain what happened.  Just \"oh it's just your crohn's or behcets, try stretching.\" My legs and feet swelled to twice their size and no one was concerned for long term damage.  It was that way for over 5 mo.  I couldn't even wear shoes anymore. My doctor's still keep me on a crohn's diagnosis because they say they can't tell the difference between the two if intestinal inflammation is involved.  And crohn's offers me more trials that behcets.  So I guess that's that.  \n\nI noticed pain points randomly deep in my legs here and there.  Thinking this feels like nodes, but no nodes.  Tonight I feel my first node since 2017.  I'm on remicaid, though I switched to inflectra just last may.  Which in July I got eye pian that never goes away and shows nothing in tests.  I'm scared now, as every few years something horrible happens and can't be explained and ruins my life for a bit and then I recover.  Well I recovered last time because I had an allergic reaction to Imuran, which led to big dose of steroids and epinephrine. Overnight it was gone. \n\nAnyone experience these nodes? Or anything like this?  I've tried colchicine before, but it had no effect.  Can't remember my dose. \n\nI'm attaching pics of before, if anyone has experienced this before, how do I stop this before it gets here again.

(TL;DR at the end)\n\nMy girlfriend and I were watching the new remake of \"Flatliners\". It wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't great, but I digress. In the movie, a patient is described as seeing the color red differently in both eyes. This immediately piqued my interest, and I went searching online, and what I found threw me for a loop.\n\nA little background on my life: I've been sick ever since I was a little kid. I started around 5 with allergies, asthma, and the odd seizure now and then. I also randomly blacked out a few times. A few years later, I suddenly started having extreme joint pain, with a strange red rash on the joints that hurt. Sometimes the rash would be so pronounced that it would almost look like raised legions or some kind of burn. To this day I still get an odd red rash over painful areas. My knees would also lock up for a period of time when I was 11. The immunologist I ended up seeing have the final word and called it \"Post streptococal rheumatoid juvenile arthritis\". Mouthful, huh?\n\nSo thus ended my 'pre-crohn's phase', as soon after, during my 14th year, I started having intense abdominal pain. The bouts of pain wrecked me, and I couldn't do anything to make it better except wait it out. It just got worse and worse, as my wonderful local GI continued to enthusiastically treat me for \"constipation\". Eventually, I wound up in the ER for appendicitis. The surgeon removed my perfectly healthy appendix and discovered a severely inflamed and scarred terminal ileum and cecum. I started going to a better GI who was awesome, and she put me on Pentasa, 6mp, and nexium. She also tried to put me on TPN, but 2 months into it my liver started to fail, so the super fun period of time where I didn't eat (so I just drew the food I wanted and filled sketchbooks with cheeseburgers and chicken parm) had to end.\n\nA year later, I had my first bowel resection at 15. It went so well I thought I'd have another one about 8 years later. But before that could happen, in 2007, I had strange fistulas pop up in my rear-area, or at least that's what they were called because hey, I had Crohn's right? Not some weird disease no one's apparently ever heard of in NJ that could cause ulcers just about anywhere on the body. The only problem was that the fistulas never led anywhere, so they closed them up and that was the end of that party. A couple years later, in 2009, I had bleeding and pain behind my navel. A surgeon said it was an ulcer, guessed it was the Crohn's, and removed it. The surgery wasn't enough fun, though. So the wound decided to get infected and I had to spend the rest of my senior year of college stabbing it open twice a day and changing the packing because it became soaked and would start to go through my shirt in the middle of class, which was awesome. I almost didn't finish college because of this. This was also the last time I would feel normal, or like my life was still on track.\n\nA year later, in 2010, I started having those dreaded abdominal pains again, but the doctors said the anastomosis just showed severe ulceration. They told me I could either get it removed and start again, or go on Humira, which I was deathly afraid of due to horror stories of a 100% fatal lymphoma that mostly shows up in young males under the age of 25. I chose the surgery, again. The surgeons, in their infinite wisdom, decided to go through the only part of my abdomen that I asked them not to go anywhere near: you guessed it! The navel. And surprise! It got infected again! Gee who could possibly have known that would happen??\n\nSo it got infected, I had a fever of 106, and had to have a mainline put in my neck as I was moved to the scenic Mount Sinai ICU, where I would spend several days fighting for my life and hallucinating as I went through my first near death experience. A year after that, another surgery. This time by a different surgeon, thank God, who knew what he was doing. Only problem was, he did a side to side anastomosis, which is apparently a no-no for people like me, who just that year was diagnosed with the hyperflexible and stretchy form of Ehlers Danlos syndrome. This made sense, since I was 6'5\" and could bend every joint backwards about twice over. Anyway, the side to side anastomosis caused my intestines to get stretchy and create a painful balloon of death. With ulcers in it.\n\nSo I dealt with that for a few years, because in the meantime I went to the Mayo clinic. By this time. My family and I had seen so many 'Crohn's specialists' that we were beginning to lose our minds. So many of them had said that I wasn't in as much pain as I said I was, or that I should be in some kind of pain rehab program (I had just started painkillers as a way to deal with the pain, plus it also helped my CONSTANT, NEVERENDING STREAM OF DIARRHEA THAT NEVER, EVER, EVER STOPPED), or that I was making symptoms up. We were naturally slightly miffed and exhausted by this time, so the Mayo clinic seemed like the right choice. While I was there, they discovered that my celiac artery had some kind of inflammation thing going on because a ligament was pressing on it or something, and as a result I only had about 30% blood flow to the rest of my abdomen. Luckily I found a surgeon who knew how to do this extremely rare surgery right next to our house.\n\nA year later, the worst years of my life continued with another surgery. This one would be another resection to fix the side to side anastomosis and change it to an end to end anastomosis. This way, the balloon of death would no longer be an issue. This GI doc had the new theory that I was still having pain because of the balloon of death, and he thought this surgery would be the end. We all hoped this would be the case. I even finally went off painkillers after 2 years. I was also finally tapering off of the insanely high levels of prednisone I had been on for 2 years as well.\n\nThen the true hell that has been my life for the past 3 years began. 2 months after I stopped painkillers and prednisone, I had an adrenal crash due to my body not making cortisol on it's own, and I wound up back on painkillers and prednisone yet again. Over the next 2 years, I would keep trying to slowly taper off prednisone. I was diagnosed with PTSD. I started Entyvio. And the pain continued to get worse. I was continuing to get ulcers everywhere, in my throat, mouth, intestines, stomach, esophagus, colon, and I had bad foliculitis and was also bleeding out of my penis. I was tested for lupus and shogrins syndrome, given IGG treatments, had a herniated disc in my lower back, horrible migraines, and my bloodwork was so crazy that no one could tell me what the hell was going on. My CRP in particular was insanely high, with no apparent reason why. Eye problems, vascular problems, the list goes on.\n\nAnd this leads me to today. With everything that's happened, when I read about Behcets I nearly started bawling. It was like everything I had been experiencing my entire life had a true name, and it was like I had been lied to for 17 years. I'm now almost 31, with no life. No career. I'm disabled, still on painkillers, which I hate. I'm dealing with PTSD flashbacks and nightmares. I'm unable to be independent. Its been really hard. But for once I feel like I'm close to having a real answer to the worlds cruel riddle for my life. I was referred to NYU, and I will be making an appointment there soon for the final word.\n\nThank you to anyone who read the whole thing, I just felt like venting. It's been a long, harrowing road. Maybe soon I'll actually be able to start the rest of my life.\n\nTL;DR: Was told I had Crohn's for 17 years, had crazy symptoms that made no sense and doctors thought I was nuts, it basically ruined my life, but now i found out it might be Behcets.\n\nAll thanks to the Flatliners remake.

She was initially admitted to the hospital and diagnosed due to genital ulcers. She hasn\u2019t had ulcers since and was taking colchicine. We have stopped the colchicine for the pregnancy due to undecided recommendations from our doctor. The symptoms seem to be somewhat at bay for now although nausea is a usual symptom that she experiences but nothing like she is experiencing now.\n\nThe last 3 weeks have been absolutely horrible. She is always nauseous and pukes a minimum of 2 times a day (most times it\u2019s more mixed in with the dry heaves randomly throughout the day). She has been in bed for 3 weeks and has missed 10 days of work. She cannot function whatsoever. Laying in bed is pretty much the best she can do.\n\nShe has been prescribed Pyridoxine/doxylamine (Diclectin) and Ondansetron (Zofran). We have also tried Gravol.\n\nWe have oil diffusers with an array of different oils, tried preggie pops, lemons, candies, teas etc. the list goes on and on. \n\nI feel helpless, useless and sad...

I think it's very possible, but my rheumatologist said no, because I'm not middle eastern.  That was her ruling.  My PCP said it was likely, and my GI doesn't have an opinion nor care much about anything.  \n\nI was diagnosed with Ulcerative Proctitis in 2010 (means inflammation was only in rectum).  For last 7 years my symptoms have always changed each flare I get.  Making it hard to deal with. No drugs have worked for me except remicaid (had to stop because I got shingles in my eye)  which for mild colitis is a bit overkill. My colitis symptoms have been blood and mucus in my stool, no diarrhea, no weight loss, minimal abdominal cramping (none nowadays).  Urgency and frequency increased due to the mucus. But normal stools.  \n\nIt was later changed to Crohn's because I got fistulas and abcesses and other \"complications\" like mouth ulcers.  I've had mouth ulcers since I was very young.  I get on average 5-8 at a time, on bad days I get 30.  When old one heals I get new ones so I can have them for a month or longer.  Mostly on my tongue (tip and sides) or near my tonsils.  I had many cases of tonsillitis in my 20's prior to my colitis diagnosis, I think it was 5-7 cases, one or two a year.\n\nSo my mild Crohn's, still only the rectum area, causes such severe secondary issues.  I have erythema nodosum, 3rd flare in 4 years.  I get it sometimes when my Crohn's isn't flaring. This time it's so bad I can't walk anymore.  I think I have 30-40 nodes over my feet, ankles and legs. I now have arthritis too, in ankles feet knees and severe swelling in ankles. I've been bed ridden for 6 months now because of these secondary issues.  These issues are new to me in my 7 years of Crohn's diagnosis and they still say my Crohn's is mild.  I'm trying new drugs entivyo but if it's not Crohn's it won't work.  I also get skin lessons (like deep cystic acne that hurt and scar and take months to a year to heal - on my legs, arms and back, so not normal acne places). \nI recently noticed sores on my vagina, which I don't know are pimps or something else.  They are red spots and come and go, they hurt and sting when touched. \n\nI know behcets can cause Crohn's like symptoms so I'm wondering if they got my diagnosis wrong and if so how/who do I go to get to listen?  Dermatologist? Second opinion from a rheumatologist? Anyone else ever have a fistula with their behcets?  I just can't help think that this is why I don't respond to medication, because we are trying the wrong ones and want someone to rule it out for good reasons not because it's rare or I'm not the right race.

I have had mouth ulcers my entire life. A year or so ago, I started having ulcers in my throat. At the time (first presentation), I was super worn out, and didn't want to get out of bed for 3 months. I constantly felt tired. I kept having chills, and feeling feverish, but without having a fever. Ever since then, every few weeks I have had throat ulcers that last approximately a week or two. During that time I feel feverish but often don't have a fever. I have an inability to focus and just feel run down. Every now and again my eyes will be red for short periods (never lasted for more than say an hour or so).\n\n\nThe sides of my throat have been red/inflamed for months. This is usually where the ulcers form. They also form on my tonsils, which are large. Lymph nodes appear to be large as well.\n\n\nI have random sharp pains in my abdominal area that last for a few seconds at a time and occur when sitting.\n\n\nPerhaps unrelated, my memory is AWFUL as of late. It used to be amazing, but I can't focus and I can't remember anything anymore -- including things I did or said the previous day.\n\n\nEvery time I eat, my throat swells a bit and I feel like I have to clear my throat constantly and cough and my nose runs. I also always feel dehydrated. (GERD-like symptoms) My doctor says these are unrelated and may be a respiratory issue.\n\n\nOn multiple occasions I have tested igG and igM negative for HSV1 and HSV2. I also had a Western Blot done to confirm this is not HSV. It may be worth noting that my EBV titers are high.\n\n\nEvery time I have a 'flare up', I feel sick. With this latest one I have fluid in the ear and again feel downtrodden.\n\n\n\nOtezla seemed to limit the occurrences but had bad GI side-effects. With Otezla, the flare ups wouldn't ulcerate or would be drastically shorter and just red spots. Otezla also seemed to exacerbate some depression-like experiences I was having, and my doctor decided to pull me off the drug as a result. I loathed taking Otezla because it gave me horrible cramping every morning.\n\n\nI feel defeated. I spend a lot of days crying. As I'm typing this, tears are welling up. I hate not knowing what is going on, but I also hate the fact that my rheumatologist thinks this is bahcets, as my endoscopy, colonoscopy, and video endoscopy don't reveal IBS or anything like that. I just want to be normal. I just want to feel normal.\n\n\n* Does this sound like your behcets symptoms? \n* Does behcets every spontaneously clear up/go away?\n* Are there any differential diagnosis (other disorders which produce similar results)?\n* Have any of you experienced the throat sensations I am describing?\n* General advice on how to proceed? \n\n\nMy doctor wants to try weekly inject-able treatments, and I am just not ready for that -- but also, I want to be sure of diagnosis before proceeding to such extremes.\n\n\nPlease help", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Differential Diagnosis", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/7fd7j5/differential_diagnosis/"}, {"author": "malakepringles", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1510169392, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/7bnqc0/getting_tired_and_feeling_sleepy/", "id": "7bnqc0", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/7bnqc0/getting_tired_and_feeling_sleepy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1510252130, "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Getting tired and feeling sleepy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/7bnqc0/getting_tired_and_feeling_sleepy/"}, {"author": "daffy1490", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1508811499, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/78cseu/does_anyone_else_here_get_sores_like_these_these/", "id": "78cseu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/78cseu/does_anyone_else_here_get_sores_like_these_these/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "Z_3lXqpiFR5Egi0-j-Mf59Li1xLC90GwFPCJAq2KJH8", "resolutions": [{"height": 144, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/OVHXSmeLXQruD2qLwe8dA-9-fuTcvWNZPk-dUtztnFQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=5908f293f72cc85c951a7811d0596ad0", "width": 108}, {"height": 288, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/OVHXSmeLXQruD2qLwe8dA-9-fuTcvWNZPk-dUtztnFQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=9e3f23d81875a4537892235986ca62bb", "width": 216}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/OVHXSmeLXQruD2qLwe8dA-9-fuTcvWNZPk-dUtztnFQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=6c236cd66ec6c6ed347173a9474b7fca", "width": 320}, {"height": 853, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/OVHXSmeLXQruD2qLwe8dA-9-fuTcvWNZPk-dUtztnFQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=603be5ae35da2c71333c4d5369ee3557", "width": 640}, {"height": 1280, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/OVHXSmeLXQruD2qLwe8dA-9-fuTcvWNZPk-dUtztnFQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=20c2a6fc3025692b34893a441b08c664", "width": 960}, {"height": 1440, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/OVHXSmeLXQruD2qLwe8dA-9-fuTcvWNZPk-dUtztnFQ.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=619174c2ee51c5728c964d1aab1e0467", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 3264, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/OVHXSmeLXQruD2qLwe8dA-9-fuTcvWNZPk-dUtztnFQ.jpg?s=bec74213b4c4393f36e7fd7812f1c53c", "width": 2448}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1508893146, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "thumbnail": "https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WocJLNgU7njvj8x6jHBpsIku6z3honbu5Q_GYRdTa48.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Does anyone else here get sores like these?

I wasn't happy with this, but at least it feels like a step forward.\n\nI'm 22/m and wonder if anyone has had similar problems to mine. I have the common ulcers in my mouth, stomach pain, and instead of ulcers in my genital area I have constant inflammation. My doctor also found some ridiculously high IgE leves, so he doesn't want to label me as a Behcet patient yet, until we rule out the allergies causing most of the symptoms. I've also been having swollen lymph nodes for quite some time with no signs of bacteria, virus, etc. So that also doesn't match the symptoms, but after checking for mono, Epstein, strep, and all kinds of similar diseases which turned out negative, we're still thinking it's Behcet.\n\nI would like to know what most of you do to control it? I'm currently outside the US and will have a hard time going to the doctors once I'm back due to having no insurance and the cost overall, what kind of over the counter products work well with the various parts this disease affects?\n\nI had to leave school for the past 2 years because of the pain I keep getting. But knowing this is something I might have to deal with for my entire life, I want to go back and try to handle the pain best as I can. I'll keep reading older post and working with my doctor before heading back to the US.

I first had ulcers and pain in my joints as a child. Being from a small town in North Carolina, I went undiagnosed for a very long time. Puberty happened along with more symptoms. I was able to keep those embarrassing problems away from my family. They started realizing something was up by the way I was walking and that I had difficulty during flare up with simple things like getting out of bed. Puberty was by far the worst time with my symptoms and thankfully they are not as bad. \n\nWell my parents took me to a doctor, and another, and another. The diagnosed ranged but most thought I had diabetes. I end up going to one doctor at CHKD in Norfolk, VA who finally came to the conclusion of behcets and recommended me to a rheumatologist. We also went to see Dr. Yusuf Yazici (this guy is who you want to see if you have the opportunity but I think he has shifted to research, his dad discovered behcets). I have also been seen at Duke University's eye center. I had 6 or 7 students in the room looking at my case because of how rare it was. They were specifically looking at me for uveitis after I took a golf ball to my eye. There were some signs of uveitis in that eye. (They did this really cool test called Fluorescein angiography).\n\nSince my diagnoses I have been on many different meds, colchicine, azathioprine, Prednisone (I took this for a year, do not stay on this for that long if you can. It is a great drug short term though.) and most recently Thalidomide (Blackbox drug that worked the best). I am currently not on any medication, but still have a few flare ups.\n\nBehcets is an awful thing. I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. However if you take it day by day you will be fine. There are much more worse things that I have seen people have while sitting in the doctors office and it makes you see your disease in a different light. If I had to say anything about the disease I would say don't let it hold you back, but be rational your ambitions. My parents almost held me back from going to college because of it, however I was able to get my B.S. in Biochemistry and minor in Chemistry from East Carolina University on time and will be going to optometry school in the fall in Florida. There are days where I just don't think I can do it, but I somehow have made it this far and I don't plan on stopping. If anyone needs any support or advice or just wants to talk shoot me a message. My disease is not something I flaunt around or talk about publicly(hardly any of my friends even know I have it), however I have seen the benefits on opening up about some of it and I figured someone may need to do the same.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Figured I post my story", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/6ce9bu/figured_i_post_my_story/"}, {"author": "melodysj", "author_created_utc": 1410048177, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_ia1ea", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1493673188, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/68osko/help_shape_a_public_health_mobile_app_for/", "gilded": 0, "id": "68osko", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/68osko/help_shape_a_public_health_mobile_app_for/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "Z16aRjlA5Birjv7xrwEG8Ag2VnNFampugLkEvGuSYyQ", "resolutions": [], "source": {"height": 1, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/py9BdpPVXuz_9y2hpVru9I9x8g8RxFBDdHKnnf42ZdQ.jpg?s=4bd488cdc4d5c0f6c642e94a7895164e", "width": 1}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1494655123, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Are you a teen/young adult ages 16-21 with a pediatric rheumatic disease or a parent of a teen/young adult ages 16-21 with a pediatric rheumatic disease?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nKDH Research &amp; Communication would like to get your feedback on an idea for an innovative, easy-to-use, video-rich smartphone/tablet app (called BLAST) to support teens and young adults ages 16\u201321 with pediatric rheumatic diseases as they transition from pediatric to adult medical care.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBLAST will also provide parallel content in a microsite for parents.\n    \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo participate, please complete the following survey:\nhttp://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/3401091/PRDs\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Please note that no personal information will be collected -- only your opinions about the mobile app.**", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help shape a public health mobile app for teens/young adults ages 16-21 with a pediatric rheumatic disease!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/68osko/help_shape_a_public_health_mobile_app_for/"}, {"author": "wakatea", "author_created_utc": 1471585643, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_10ovox", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1492329226, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/65o35j/first_symptoms_to_diagnosis/", "gilded": 0, "id": "65o35j", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/65o35j/first_symptoms_to_diagnosis/", "retrieved_on": 1494601110, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Just wondering about the experience of this disease generally.

She turned 40 this year and she had small canker sore begin roughly 6 months ago, they came and gone and weren\u2019t too bad to start off with, but since the beginning of December 2019 have increased drastically and moved to her throat and makes it hard for her to swallow and (before 1 trip to ER) even breathe, especially the in the morning. She has also been using refresh tears on her eyes for years, and ever since we\u2019ve met she\u2019s had this sort of gagging cough in the morning (she says nothing comes out, and usually only in the mornings while brushing teeth). \n\nLooking over some of the stories on here she has some of the same symptoms, but no joint pain or private area ulcers, but the mouth symptoms are definitely there, to the point where drinking a gallon of whatever liquid for a colonoscopy is out of the question right now, also the dryish eyes could be another symptom? We have an upcoming appointment on Monday (12-23-19) with a rheumatologist after an oral pathologist referred us to a Gastrology doctor who referred us to the rheumatologist. The Oral pathologist was referred from a Ear Nose and Throat doc, who originally was referred to us from a primary care physician. Yet, I\u2019d think some kind of mouth swab would be taken from one of her sores and examined or tested by ONE of these doctors, but that hasn\u2019t happened yet? The most human responses we\u2019ve seemed to get were from ER Physician Assistants, acknowledging how frustrating this must be, after just doing what we\u2019re told to do and being beat around the bush, as her condition seems to worsen by the day. And yes I\u2019ve raised my voice seeking answers and treatments. \n\nIt just seems like we\u2019re going from doctor to doctor to doctor and each one is trying to get rid of us cause nobody knows whats going on and hopefully the next guy/gal will but Behchets has been mentioned! I just wonder if we\u2019re on the right track with that? \n\nRight now it\u2019s amazing seeing her not coughing and walking around laughing and doing normal things after a heavy dose of painkillers from the ER and her 2nd day of perdnisone treatment, but I worry it\u2019ll be short lived once the tortal (type of pain med in shot form I believe it was called) wears off and shes coughing again... coughing up blood... waking up at night, grimacing every time she swallows... it\u2019s heartbreaking to see, I\u2019m 9 years younger than her, but by looks you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell BUT we just got married 2 years ago... \n\nI guess my questions are, could we be on the right track? Is there anything we can do at home/ besides magic mouthwash, OTC Aleve and Tylenol to help with throat lesions and swallowing?\n\nP.S. My wife is originally from Lao, and we\u2019re in Minnesota now, so many doctors I fear haven\u2019t seen this before one admitted it\u2019s not anyone that they\u2019d know areas of expertise at all... she\u2019s lost 3 pounds as she\u2019s forced to eat ramen noodles that aren\u2019t even spicy (she loves spicy food), rice soup, egg drop soup, ice cream.

Doctors have been dismissive, condescending, patronizing. I was sent to mental health over and over again. Then they found the brain tumor... But they said, oh no, it's not the cause of all your symptoms, that's still mental health... I told them where they could stick their opinions. I kept chasing testing,  diagnostics, etc... Then I started testing positive for random rare subtropical bacterial infections. Tests that were supposed to have a specificity of over 96% but I got a false positive. The doctor tried to tell me \"well that can happen\" and I said 4x in a row? So I stated looking into how you could get such a false positive and it mentioned a few autoimmune disseases. I'd already treated negative for all of them, but behcet's had no test. So I started reading up on it, the oral ulcers, the skin lesions... That's totally me. So I brought it up with the doctors. \"it's just too rare\" they said. So I did my own pathergy test before my rheumatology appointment. The doctor wad trying to tell me why I couldn't have it. I showed him the lesions in my mouth, on my skin, on my balls and then he said \"well, maybe we could try a pathergy test...\" so I pulled up my sleeve. \"Oh...\" he said... But I didn't think I had just behcet's. I thought I had neuro behcet's. But he said it was so rare, he'd never even seen it before and he was a behcet's specialist. He said I should have lesions on my brain stem and I didn't. I asked \"well, if you've never seen it before, radiology probably hasn't either. How do you know they didn't miss it?\" and he just kind of chuckled because he thought I was being silly. I went home, put in official requests for my prior MRIs and got to work watching YouTube videos on how to read MRI scans and installing MRI software. The discs arrived a few days later and I spent a Friday night pouring over the scans. It took 3 hours. I wrote down all of my symptoms, then the cranial nerves that would need to be damaged to cause those symptoms. Then I scrolled to that spot on the MRI and bingo, little white dot. So then I looked at the radiological diagnostic criteria for neuro behcet's and verified that the lesion I found met those criteria. A week later I was in the rheumatologists office, showing him what is found. He just couldn't believe I might have found something a radiologist missed, but he agreed to order a new MRI to calm me down. I went in for the MRI and tried to get the tech to tell the radiologist where to look but she said she wasn't allowed to do that. So after the scan she was walking me out, I just spotted following her and walked into the radiologist office. \"my abducens nerve. The left side. There's a lesion there that I think they missed on my lady scan. Look there. She laughed \"Ok, well check it out\"\n\nA week later I got the results. Lesion on the abducens nerve confirmed. It was also confirmed on the last scan that they'd missed it and it had grown since then. She said that given my symptoms it was likely neuro behcet's. Then the rheumatologist asked **me** what I wanted to do. I said \"I want methotrexate, now.\" he said \"OK\" and wrote the script. \n\nAbsolutely ridiculous.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 292, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Neuro-Beh\u00e7et's confirmed via MRI", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1570908462, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/dgjznx/neurobeh\u00e7ets_confirmed_via_mri/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "CanadianBeaver1983", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1alua86h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1570468805, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/demjv9/cherry_angiomas/", "gildings": {}, "id": "demjv9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 28, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/demjv9/cherry_angiomas/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1570468806, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a lot of very small ones that showed up about 5 years ago.

Negative prick test. Negative allergy tests. All other bloodwork within normal ranges. HSV/Herpes simplex 1 &amp; 2 negative by IGG/IGM and western blot. EBV/Ebstein-barr positive a few years ago with high titers.\n\nThis has destroyed me physically, mentally, and emotionally. I used to be a strong individual with few fears. I have become a caustic, negative, anxiety-ridden overanalyzing mess. I push people away with the neediness that stems from that. I find myself using faux-arrogance and crude humor to cover up all the bullshit going on.\n\nI have points where I am close to my older self, upswings, where my creativity flourishes, I'm inquisitive, and ready to tackle the world, and explore, and try things, and meet people, LISTEN to what they have to say, be present in the moment. I LOVE THAT PERSON - but he hasn't been around in a while. I want to live in the present/live in the moment again.\n\nDoes any of this sound similar to what you guys are experiencing? I'm so lost and don't really have anywhere to turn.\n\nHave any of you found a specialist on the West Coast (US) that I might be able to fly to and review findings with?\n\nHave any of you looked at genetic testing for this?

It sucks, I would love to raise awareness for this disease, but don't know where to even start, any ideas?\n\nGrowing up, I had always suffered badly with mouth ulcers but other than that I was relatively healthy, had asthma that seemed to go away after a couple months of steroids and a year or two on asthma pumps. In hindsight, I can see my Beh\u00e7ets symptoms now, big weight loss/gains, mouth ulcers, I had a genital ulcer at one point, at twelve I had to have my tonsils removed because I was getting tonsilitus on a regular basis, probably had something to do with my asthma too if I ever even had asthma, i'm not sure about that.\n\nI was diagnosed in 2015, when I was 18, I had it quite rough, I was coughing up blood for months as it progessively got worse, I seen many doctors in the beginning, I was mis-diagnosed as having a bad chest infection, I felt at the time I wasn't being taken seriously, I was a young man, healthy as can be on the outside, so doctors would take a quick look and send me on my way with some meds (not the ones I actually needed), not only the doctors but my family didn't take me seriously either. As I said, I was coughing up bits of blood to begin with, then it got worse and worse, to the point where blood was literally pouring out of my mouth. It was a nightmare come true for me as I am really bad when it comes to blood, I get dizzy and I have fainted in the past because of it.\n\nNovember 2015, I had been in and out of the doctors several times and I was given Prednisolone and told to rest up, so I took my meds and stayed in bed for the majority of the time, in hindsight this was a big mistake, as I had clots all over my legs that I didn't know about yet, staying sedentary was only making it worse. So, one night at around 10pm, I was laying in bed watching TV with my girlfriend and I start cough again, the coughing didn't stop and I was starting to bleed really heavily, blood was everywhere, like I said it was a nightmare come true, it was even on the ceiling, had to throw out all the bedding and re-paint the walls, I fully believed I was going to die that night, I can remember asking my girlfriend if I was going to die and she assured me that I wasn't going to but I didn't believe her, it must've been so frightening for her, we were both quite young but she has always been the strongest one out of us both, she called an ambulance, I lost a lot of blood and needed to be rushed into hospital, the ambulance guy was amazing and I wish I could thank him, he done a brilliant job keeping my mind off of what was happening which is incredible when you think of the circumstances.\n\nI ended up in A&amp;E, sat waiting to be seen on those cold hard metal benches in the waiting room while filling those cardboard bed pans full of blood because they had nothing else for me to use, an hour or two go by and I finally get called in to be seen, the doctors were very confused, which only made my worst fears worse, now at this point things get a little blurry as I was very weak at this stage, I had lost pints of blood and I was still bleeding, so I can't remember too much, but what I do remember is the coughing coming to a stop and I could finally go to sleep, then come early morning I was being woke up by the nurses because I was being moved to a ward, after getting to the ward I started to feel better, to the point where I was able to relax.\n\nThe next night I was relaxing in the hospital bed watching some TV and I feel that tickle in my throat, I knew instantly I was about to start coughing blood up again, I called for the nurse and pressed my buzzer, the nurse came around and she was mortified at the sight of me, I didn't even need to cough anymore, blood was just pouring out of my mouth, the nurse had no idea what to do, so she went to get help, next thing I know I am surrounded by doctors, nurses and medical equipment, asking me loads of questions trying to figure out what exactly was happening to me, they had no idea at all, I look at my heart rate monitor and its in the 200's, I was going into respiratory arrest, at this point I was sure I wasn't going to survive this, I started thinking about my life and all the people in it, what im going to miss ect, it was truly the most terrifying experience of my life.\n\nThis is where my memory gets really muddy, because all I can remember from that point on is going through the cold corridors of the hospital on my way to the emergency room, on the way I see my brother and my father making their way through the hospital trying to find the ward I was on, they didn't notice me at first and I tried my best to call them and raise my hand so they would see me, they seen me and followed me down to the emergency room, where my mother was waiting for me.\n\nThen I am surrounded by surgeons and doctors again, one doctor was asking my family some questions and reassuring me I was in good hands, I can remember feeling hopeless because my girlfriend wasn't there, she has always had my back through thick and thin and had been caring for me the entire time I was ill, where as my mother, father and brother did nothing for me, they never have. The surgeon told me he was going to put me to sleep as I needed emergency surgery and to count down from 10, I fell asleep looking at my family looking over me crying, I thought this was the last thing I was going to see.\n\nI wake up a couple of days later surrounded by my family after having emergency surgery to remove the clots from my lungs, I had a lot of them, but there was one really big one that was blocking something vital, they were worried about removing it because it could've been the only thing stopping me from bleeding out in less than a minute, they had told my family it was 50/50. I couldn't speak as I had a big tube going down my throat to help my lung work because one half of my lungs completely shut down, so they gave me a pen and some paper so I could ask some questions, they had put me into an induced coma to keep me stable, according to family and my girlfriend, I could hear people in my coma and would sometimes respond by moving my hand or my girlfriend tells me that I would squeeze her hand 3 times, which is our way of saying I love you whenever we can't say it out loud, we are quite shy people so we don't like to be all lovey and soppy around people. I don't remember a thing though, just waking up.\n\nThats when I asked what was happening to me, and they told me the doctors think it's Beh\u00e7ets, they had called and spoken to several doctors all over the country until they came across a doctor in Birmingham who suggested it might be Beh\u00e7ets, he got a flight the next day over to Wales where I live to come and confirm it.\n\nSo a week later and i'm home again, taking Humira once a fortnight and after a little while I was comepletely back to normal, felt like nothing was even wrong with me, this is where I messed up, I stopped taking my Humira regularly and would miss it sometimes, I learnt the hard way so if you're reading this and you have Beh\u00e7ets or know someone with it, TAKE THE MEDS, don't make the same mistake as me, please.\n\nLast year, close to Christmas time, I started getting headaches, thinking nothing of it (please, if you get even a small cold, go to your doctor to be checked, its worth it), I carry on with things and take pain killers, the headaches get worse as the days go by, dizzy spells, sensitivity to light, vision loss and fatigue get worse and worse, so then one night it finally hits me, this is bad I need to see a doctor, so I call out of hours and they suggest I go to hospital as it sounds really serious, so I go the next day, a nuerologist comes to see me after waiting for hours, and she checks the discs in my eyes and she says that they are swollen and inflamed, which is a bad sign, so after a couple of days of tests and speaking to different doctors it turns out I have a clot in one of the main veins to my brain.\n\nSo currently i'm on Clexane to thin my blood (looking at alternatives with haemotology at the moment), Acetazolomide to reduce swelling in my brain and Humira to help with the immune system side of things, I'm back on my feet now and have just got a new job, I was lucky to survive both of these journeys and I am terrified of it happening again, I have a daughter on the way and I fear for how its going to effect me in the future when it comes to her, I want to be able to provide for her and be there for her, i'm also scared because noone seems to know anything about if Beh\u00e7ets can be passed down, I would hate for her to have to go through any of this.\n\nThank you for taking time to read this, I really appreciate it, I apologise for the length, its been a crazy couple of years and I have never been able to fully get it off my chest. You are more than welcome to message me if you have any questions, advice or would just like someone else with Beh\u00e7ets to talk to.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 252, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Story.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562685303, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/camb5q/my_story/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "roboto_", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_11ashd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562200437, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/c8vxnf/at_what_age_were_you_diagnosed_with_behcets_how/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c8vxnf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/c8vxnf/at_what_age_were_you_diagnosed_with_behcets_how/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562200439, "score": 2, "selftext": "My wife shows all the symptoms except ulcers.

I'm not good at English, but if I go to a specific field like medicine... well, I don't know how to say anything XD.   \nThis is a strange disease, and it can be very different from pacient to pacient. I've always thoutght that the way we treat data in this cases is very bad for research, but I can't change that, what I can do is, with my limited knowledge, tell my story. It probably won't be very useful, but well, here it goes.   \n\n\nI was diagnosed... three years ago? My first symptom was being tired, very tired, some days, but in that time I didn't think I was ill. One week I started feeling a little weird and one day my eye started failing, I went to the hospital and they saw that pressure inside my head was too high, there was a thrombus in the jugular vein. At that thime they thought that I had something in my blood, so I started taking  anticoagulants for over a year, and that was all.   \nA year after that I had fever for over a month, I went to the hospital. In that time I had some ulcers in my mouth, and one in my testicles (the only one I have had so far) and when they took my blood, I had something similar to a pimple in my arm... even though there wasn't any prove that could say \"this is positive, so you have Beh\u00e7et\", I was diagnosed with it. In any case, I asked for a second opinion in another hospital (and they thought the same). \n\nIn that time I started taking prednisone, some inmunosupressors and still took the anticoagulants.  \nWell. a year after that, around the same time of the year, I started feeling bad... and that time was the worse, I coughed a considerable amount of blood. New thrombus in the lungs, they treated me with more prednisone and quimiotherapy, I stopped taking anticoagulants (after all, thrombus are not caused by the blood in our disease, but because of the veins and arteries).\n\nAnd now, this year, in the same month, the fever is with me again, though this time I think I got it on time and it won't be so bad (at least I hope so). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I find very curious is that I didn't have many ulcers, my main symptom is fever, and then thrombus. I trust my doctors, and even if I don't have Beh\u00e7et, it's surely something similar and all that kind of stuff is treated in the same way, but sometimes I even doubt that I have it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, that's all, have a good day.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 240, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hello, my medical story", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559663282, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/bv5tb7/hello_my_medical_story/"}, {"author": "21hiccups", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_xblageh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1555559975, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/beh5yt/anyone_experience_extreme_hives_and_muscle_pain/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "beh5yt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/beh5yt/anyone_experience_extreme_hives_and_muscle_pain/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1555559977, "score": 2, "selftext": "I was diagnosed with Behcet's at one year old.

I checked with the moderators here and they told me that it would be OK if I asked you all about this. My name is Kim and I'm the owner and head therapist at Movemental (located in Los Angeles, CA). I'm looking for help with some research I am doing to improve the process of identifying, treating and healing autoimmune conditions and conditions that have been diagnosed sometimes, as often the case with IBS, Graves' or others, wrongly as Behcet's or other autoimmune conditions. The goal of this research is to use the findings to educate medical and mental health professionals about the current confusion and frustration that people can experience when navigating our health system. I've created a research survey with the hopes of gathering information on people suffering from Behcet's and showing the need for improvement in how people with Behcet's are treated by those they go to get help from.\n\nThis is not a marketing ploy or an attempt to recruit clients. I do ask for some identifying information at the end (to facilitate an Amazon gift card giveaway I'm offering) but that is 100% optional and will never turn into anything sales related and will never be shared with a 3rd party. I'm also happy to answer any questions you have here and will be responding to whomever may have them. The main thrust of this is really just research that can hopefully help people in the future who suffer from Behcet's (or some of those other conditions I mentioned earlier). My standard blurb about this research is below, but I wanted to reach out to all of you directly (and prove I'm not a bot).\n\nHere's the link to the research survey:\n\n[https://helptohealautoimmune.typeform.com/to/ymdXVR](https://helptohealautoimmune.typeform.com/to/ymdXVR)\n\nGive it a look. Like I said, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have, either about the survey itself or my research. Since I'm new to the community, I truly want to respect what you have built here and not come across as someone exploiting it or intruding. I promise you that my purpose in reaching out is to further the research into and care of people that suffer from Behcet's (and other conditions)(Yes, I'm approaching other communities here, too). I hope you will allow and/or help me to do so.\n\nThanks,\n\nKim\n\nHere's my standard blurb about me and this research:\n\nThank you for participating in this important research survey for MOVEMENTAL ([www.themovemental.com](http://www.themovemental.com/)). MOVEMENTAL is dedicated to providing psychological support, training and relief to those suffering from chronic autoimmune conditions and 'medically unexplained' symptoms. MOVEMENTAL is led by Kim Hollingdale, licensed psychotherapist and mind-body expert that specializes in managing the psychological contributors to these conditions to provide symptom relief and in some cases, long term respite. This research survey aims gather data to support our work with patients struggling with these conditions, as well as to educate the medical community that often first encounters them (but frustratingly frequently, knows little about them or how to help).

He had complications but he got better. But recently, he developed more and more *severe* symptoms and was diagnosed with Behcets. There's one doctor that isn't sure due to B not presenting classic symptoms.\n\n\nOne problem with B is that he's (he's always been) strongly averse to admitting ANYTHING \"bad\". He's visibly very different, compromised, symptomatic, but he says precisely this: \"I'm getting better, it's just my leg.  \n(He can't even walk alone, and invites me for events, then he sleeps, and he has an explanation that excludes sickness - I'm not angry at all, I'm very sad and extremely worried about him)\n\n\nHe's been presenting, too, a unexplainable absolute NEED to sleep: he sleeps for 3 or even 4 days, being woken only to be fed. *I haven't found any information about it*.\n\n\nThen, when he wakes up, he stays up for like 2 days, and has symptoms of psychosis (extremely agitated, speaks to no one, sits in front of the computer - he's a very competent programmer, and is very lucky to have a supportive workplace; he's not working now, and even with the medical documents, his temporary disability was denied, but we're going to have it questioned through the judicial system)\n\n\nFor now, I'd be immensely thankful for some, any information about the symptom of sleepiness. He's on medications, he doesn't mention pain.\n\n\nBut, for example, he's always loved to play with his son (5yo). This week his son visited him, and kept calling him to play, but he could only SLEEP. IMO, it's clearly a neurological manifestation (he has psychiatric symptoms too, but it's not one of them), and/or a side effect of medication. But we are lost about it. He just sleeps 6 times more than normal sleep, and he absolutely CANNOT CONTROL it.\n\n\n\nI'd appreciate any help and advice.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 142, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help please.

Providing, that is, if you have that choice.\n\nBehcet'ssyndrome (BS) is a rare disease, and more importantly, an extraordinarily complex one with protean manifestations and vast variations between how it presents and progresses in individual patients. BS makes the diagnosis of most other autoimmune-hyperinflammatory diseases such as lupus, MS, Goodpasture's, RA, GPA, etc., look like child's play. This not to say that the diagnosis and management of these conditions are easy. Instead, these diseases most often present in more stereotypical ways and the clinicians treating them have had experience with many, many more such patients than they are likely to have with BS patients. BS is the very definition of a disease that requires not just a \"specialist,\" but a highly experienced one.\n\nI can think of many other screening questions to ask your prospective treating physician. However, what I'd really like to hear from others here are:\n\n1. What remarks or actions by your (inadequate) treating rheumatologist have you found to serve as red flags that he lacks an adequate experience base, is un- or underinformed, or has insufficient interest in learning more about BS in order to treat you more effectively?\n2. What information about your BS, or BS in general do you consider essential to be communicated to you upon diagnosis or treatment? Here, I'm referring not just to verbal interaction, but to referencing or providing print or other educational materials about what you can expect and what you should be vigilant for? I believe that every rheumatologist treating BS patients should provide them with an extensive and reasonably comprehensive handout about the disease or with equivalent online resources.\n3. What incorrect or even potentially harmful advice or guidance have you been given that you would consider as disqualifying a clinician from treating you or any other BS patient?\n\nI think that assembling a compendium of BOTH negative *and positiv*e criteria for selecting a rheumatologist is a crucially important resource that is missing here. I'm interested in assembling a \"best practices\" resource for patients to use in screening and selecting their treating rheumatologists and other supporting clinicians. If the Redditors here can provide such a \"database\" I'm willing to format these data into a patient-friendly resource tool that, hopefully, can be present here on an ongoing basis in an easy to access way.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 649, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Screening your rheumatologist", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/lio4ry/screening_your_rheumatologist/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "catsnmovies", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3et5n7yt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1613119195, "crosspost_parent": "t3_li0dpj", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "catsnmovies", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3et5n7yt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1613122209.0, "created_utc": 1613093409.0, "discussion_type": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.autoimmunity", "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": false, "id": "li0dpj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": null, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": null, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_li0dpj", "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 1, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/autoimmunity/comments/li0dpj/behcets_disease/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "removed_by": null, "removed_by_category": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 10, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nMy father was diagnosed with Behcet's disease which is extremely rare.

I spent that first year having flair ups, eyes hurting, IBS, and would have to not participate in activities. I ended up getting a colonoscopy which came back with a great bill of health.

We defined Western BD as cases from North America and Northern Europe and compared important criteria to traditional BD (Table 1). Intestinal BD has a prevalence of 50% in Western populations and is considered rare in traditional BD ([15](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jchimp.v6.30362)). The prevalence of oral aphthous ulcers and genital ulcers is similar in Western and traditional BD ([16](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jchimp.v6.30362)). Likewise, skin manifestations characterized by papulopustular lesions are similar in the two populations ([17](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jchimp.v6.30362)). These clinical manifestations are part of the ISG criteria. The remaining two other ISG criteria, eye lesions and pathergy phenomena, are much less common in Western BD. Only 10\u201320% of patients in North America and Northern Europe demonstrate the pathergy phenomenon compared to 50\u201375% of patients in more endemic areas ([18](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jchimp.v6.30362)). Ocular disease occurs less frequently and is less severe in North American and Northern European populations ([19](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jchimp.v6.30362)). Intestinal Beh\u00e7et's disease, while not on the ISG criteria, is significantly more common in Western BD ([15](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jchimp.v6.30362)). Thus, the ISG criteria may not be sensitive enough for Western patients with BD.\n\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that susceptibility to BD is strongly associated with the presence of the HLA-B151 allele. Of note, up to 81% of Asian patients with BD who live along the \u2018Silk Road\u2019 express this allele. Conversely, only 13% of patients with BD in Western countries express HLA-B151 ([23](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jchimp.v6.30362)\u2013([25](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jchimp.v6.30362))). Environmental factors such as ubiquitous antigens and infectious pathogens, including herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C, parvovirus B19, and Streptococcus sanguis, have also been implicated as factors in the diverse clinical manifestations of patients with BD ([26](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jchimp.v6.30362)). Scientists have hypothesized these antigens may trigger a cross-reactive autoimmune response in patients with BD.\"", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 625, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Western vs. Silk Road Behcet's", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/l4lcou/western_vs_silk_road_behcets/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Michael-G-Darwin", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_brmz7p4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1611569630, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/l4l1ld/covid19_and_beh\u00e7ets_disease_clinical_case_series/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l4l1ld", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#edeff1", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "37f3290e-0a51-11eb-8b6b-0e260cf27199", "link_flair_text": "Research / Study", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/l4l1ld/covid19_and_beh\u00e7ets_disease_clinical_case_series/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1611569641, "score": 1, "selftext": "[https://ard.bmj.com/content/annrheumdis/early/2020/07/20/annrheumdis-2020-217778.full.pdf](https://ard.bmj.com/content/annrheumdis/early/2020/07/20/annrheumdis-2020-217778.full.pdf) \n\nData on patients with systemic autoimmune diseases with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are currently lacking.

All patients gave informed consent for publishing their clinical data. We used nasopharyngeal swab samples for all diagnoses, amplifying the betacoronavirus E gene and the specific SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene by PCR.\n\nOn 16 April 2020, 2135 consecutive patients with SARSCoV-2 infection had been admitted to Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. We admitted 238 (11%) into intensive care units and we discharged 1481 (67%) with supervised outpatient care. Of all patients, four (0.19%, 95% CI 0.05\u20130.48) had BD ([table 1](https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2020/07/20/annrheumdis-2020-217778#T1)), of whom three were admitted to the hospital. Two of the patients were nurses and have had contact with patients with COVID-19. Only one of the patients with BD had comorbidities, and in all of them, disease activity, measured with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease Activity Index (BDAI)[4](https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2020/07/20/annrheumdis-2020-217778#ref-4) at the time of first COVID-19 symptoms, was low (BDAI score of &lt;3). Three patients had upper respiratory infection and one had viral pneumonia. No patient required admission to the intensive care unit or invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation. In other words, the severity of COVID-19 infection was mild in all cases.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 625, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "COVID-19 and Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease: clinical case series", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/l4l1ld/covid19_and_beh\u00e7ets_disease_clinical_case_series/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "stanlawhudson", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_50edloio", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1611524201, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/l489bp/do_you_tell_people_when_youre_in_too_much_pain/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l489bp", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#ffd635", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "ad76c826-0a50-11eb-95ea-0e6c934e4747", "link_flair_text": "General Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/l489bp/do_you_tell_people_when_youre_in_too_much_pain/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1611524212, "score": 1, "selftext": "Out of curiosity, how do you explain why you can\u2019t talk/can\u2019t talk much (due to ulcers causing too much pain) when you\u2019re in a setting where you have to speak, such as work or school?

Does anyone here with Behcet's also experience inner ear symptoms? I've had issues with my right ear since I was an infant. I am wondering whether it's linked to my Behcet's, or if it's just another coincidental medical issue I have to deal with.\n\nI ask because my right ear is usually the first indication of an upcoming flare. I will hear ringing (I have constant tinnitus, but it worsens right before flares), pressure, throbbing, and lots of pain. It usually causes vertigo and nausea, and sometimes \"spreads\" to my throat. Whenever I'm on oral prednisone, it goes away instantly with all the other Behcet's symptoms.\n\nBUT I recently saw an ENT who specializes in autoimmune patients, and he suggested I likely just have inner ear problems unrelated to Behcets. I found it hard to believe considering how closely the symptoms are linked to my flares, and how well I respond to Prednisone. But I think it could also make sense since I've been struggling with this since infancy (you can't have Behcet's as a baby, right??). I've had 2 ear surgeries on the right ear, so maybe it's just bad luck? Does anyone else here with Behcet's share a similar experience?

I have not had any ulcers on the genitals, an occasional pimple which feels like it takes forever to heal, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I can maybe take out the neck pain due to now having a dog sleeping in the bed and he ain't a small dog, which I never had.

I have been dealing with a few strange health issues for the last couple of years and have been looking for answers. My rheumatologist is now leaning towards a behcets diagnosis due to recent symptoms. Things started with a very bad case case of erythema nodosum (both legs were completely covered, lasted for 3 months, could hardly walk because my ankles and knees were so swollen).  I began experiencing bad arthritis and severe back pain, horrible headaches and chronic fatigue (this is ongoing, I struggle with these symptoms daily or 2 years now). Around this time I also got Bell\u2019s Palsy that was accompanied by pretty bad eye pain although I can\u2019t remember if I was ever diagnosed with anything specific relating to my eye but the doctors thought the eye pain was unusual with Bell\u2019s palsy. Shortly after recovering from Bells Palsy, I started fainting regularly, experiencing lots of dizzy spells and vertigo episodes in my sleep. I\u2019ve had a myriad of tests done and did discover (about 2 years ago) that I have a genetic marker for behcets which initially sparked the conversation with my Rheumatologist. At the time I did not have any genital or oral sores so we ruled it out for the time being and just kept monitoring my symptoms. Flash forward to now, I have started getting outbreaks of extremely painful oral sores.  This has happened about 3 times in the past few months and each time there are about 5-8 sores in my mouth that last for about 2 weeks. \n\nMy rheumatologist is pretty certain I have behcets, although it seems to be pretty mild. I\u2019ve been doing research and trying to learn about the disease. A lot of what I\u2019ve experienced over the last couple of years seems to line up with a mild case of behcets but I have not found anything that links the fainting/dizzy spells/vertigo with behcets.

I'll try make this as short as I can but may be hard.\n\nDid anyone have a bloody hard time getting diagnosed with this? My partner got diagnosed with arthritis at the age of 14. He had suffered with mouth ulcers on top of that, and he was always told that the mouth ulcers were an allergy to all foods and that there was nothing they could do apart from give him mouthwashes and sprays, which have ultimately resulted in his teeth discolouring etc. Anyway, fast forward a couple years, and at the age of 16/17 he still has the mouth ulcers, still has the arthritis, but now he's suffering from genital ulcers, which they test for herpes etc, with negative result and he is left with the doctors unable to figure out what it is again. So by this time he's suffering with arthritis, mouth ulcers, genital ulcers, inflammation and skin lesions. He's now 24, and he's never been without mouth ulcers, they're not just small ones either, they're huge - his tongue is very badly scarred from this and recently his genitals have flared up badly.\n\nSo me being me, I'm research mad, I searched all his symptoms and came up with behcets and I done my load in research. And contacted his GP. He's suffering, so bad, especially when he can't eat and barely sleep because he is in that much pain. After speaking with 2 GPs, someone eventually takes an interest and is willing to help. I sent him all the information I had gathered and he said he wanted it as he lacked knowledge. He contacted my partners Rheumatologist (who he maybe sees for 5 mins a year) to explain my partners concerns and also the GP himselfs concerns as he is seeing the same red flags! The Rheumatologist is uninterested, said it cannot be this, blah blah blah but when asked to explain how and why, he told my partner to get a second opinion cause he's not interested. (he got his secretary to do this BTW, and he's also been my partners rheumatologist since he was 14 and we think he doesn't want to admit he is wrong)\nBUT..... He wanted to prescribe him a medication that is commonly used in behcets, like cmon. \n\nSo we did, we asked for a second opinion. We asked for him to be sent to the centre of excellence (we live in Scotland) and we were told that it's not funded for us and that he would have to wait for a new rheumatologist to refer him - he is currently on the waiting list for rheumatology but can take up to a year to 1 year and a half.\n\nI feel so defeated, defeated that I'm fighting for him and no one helps, no one is caring about the torture he is going through.

For context I'm a 29 year old white British female living in the UK. \n\nStarting with the most recent symptom, a few days ago I was diagnosed with iritis/anterior uveitis in my left eye. It came out of nowhere and has been extremely painful. Its better with eye drops but now it's subsiding i'm noticing my joints are painful (mostly wrists and fingers but also knees/ankles) and also I've got terrible pain in my throat and am really fatigued. \n\nIts not the first time I've had an autoimmune-type condition, in November 2014 I had a really bad case of erythema nodosum. The nodes ulcerated/popped and have left long term scarring on my legs. At the time I had really bad joint pain. I also had a crazy number of mouth ulcers - when I mentioned the ulcers to doctors at the time they thought I was allergic to penicillin and changed the antibiotics they'd given me. I also had a strange rash on my face but put that down to reacting weirdly to the meds I was on. \n\nBetween these two potential flares(?) in Feb 2017 I  had a weird period of getting lumps/rashes on my face, hands, chest and legs. At the time they diagnosed my leg lumps  as folliculitis although the doctor wasn't overly sure. This all seemed to subside after a couple of weeks to a month. \n\nOther than these three major periods that I can think of I'm generally healthy, I get joint pains quite a lot but never severe enough that I've bothered getting them checked out. My boyfriend points out that I do get an above average amount of headaches (have one at least weekly) but again not severe I always just put it down to too much screen time/ not enough water.  I'm also fatigued a lot and need to nap most days but have been putting this down to getting older! \n \nWhat makes me think it might not be BD is that firstly I've only had a few flare ups and each time it's been something different. I also don't think I get mouth ulcers any more than the next person, excluding the ones I had during my erythema outbreak. I did have tonsillitis and throat problems a lot growing up and am now wondering whether my throat problems are caused by ulcers? I don't think I've ever had any genital ulcers. \n\nAnyway if you've got this far thanks for reading, I'm mostly just curious at this point. My optician is writing to my doctor to do some follow-up blood tests after my iritis diagnosis, so I wanted to do some research of my own too. I'd be interested if anyone else also has Behcets that doesn't flare up very often or that doesn't have ulcers as a key feature? Any advice on getting diagnostic tests also appreciated - thanks in advance!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 586, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Could I have a mild form of Behcets?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/k4258z/could_i_have_a_mild_form_of_behcets/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Leading_Ladybug", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7itiqgbl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606738035, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/k3ulzw/how_uveitis_feels_like/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k3ulzw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#5a74cc", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1f8b259c-0a51-11eb-9e58-0e9d29332059", "link_flair_text": "Symptoms", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/k3ulzw/how_uveitis_feels_like/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1606738045, "score": 1, "selftext": "I recently Felt a loss of vision in my right eye that comes and goes along with driness in Both eyes. \nI m Also wearing weekly contact lenses with lower diopters because i was in a hurry when i ordered them and i ordered -3 \u00eendreapt\u0103 of -3.5.

My canker sores have always been annoying, but never really debilitating until this year. Since March, I've had 3 canker sore flareups that included both regular sores in my mouth but also really painful sores in my throat and on my uvula. These flareups have been associated with fatigue and weakness, even though I'm getting plenty of rest and minimizing stress.\n\nI've seen several docs including an ENT, and I just this week got a referral to see a rheumatologist. The ENT wants me to get checked out for Behcet's. \n\nIn the meantime, I'm curious if you all think my symptoms sound like Behcet's? I haven't had sores anywhere but inside my mouth (i.e., no genital sores or rashes on my body). I typically have dry/sensitive eyes but I don't think I've noticed any particular worst pain or inflammation during flareups. My family is from Italy and I likely have ancestors from other Meditteranean countries. Between flareups, I feel healthy and have no other symptoms.\n\nMy second question is how you all manage in your personal and professional lives? My symptoms really wear me down to the point where it wears me down to do even basic house chores. I'm an active person and I want to push through it but I fear that any additional physical stress will slow my healing.\n\nThanks and I hope you are all hanging in there. I've read through many of your posts and I can tell that you are all serious fighters and I find that really inspiring.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Behcets", "subreddit_id": "t5_38j2o", "subreddit_subscribers": 579, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A couple of questions", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/ju4gxf/a_couple_of_questions/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "checkmyvibes", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_55r8l75y", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605251998, "domain": "self.Behcets", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/jtcsmz/could_this_be_that_could_that_be_this/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jtcsmz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#0aa18f", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "d4109638-0a50-11eb-937b-0ecde9b84f77", "link_flair_text": "Diagnosis Help", "link_flair_text_color": "light", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Behcets/comments/jtcsmz/could_this_be_that_could_that_be_this/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1605252008, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey thanks for your help behcets community!\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been experiencing wicked bad joint pain, for just over a year, maybe a bit longer, and recurring, debilitating canker sores(for not quite as long as that, maybe the last few months.)
