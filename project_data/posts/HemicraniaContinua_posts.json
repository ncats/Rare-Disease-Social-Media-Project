I started taking indomethacin this week, and it\u2019s taking away the pain significantly. \n\nI have been getting chronic headaches each year for 8 years, but I only get them daily from May until October when it\u2019s hot outside. At first, I thought it was allergies, and I got shots for 6 years, but it didn\u2019t help, and all manner of allergy meds don\u2019t help. \n\nHere are my symptoms\n\n\\- Head pain is not throbbing. Dull pressure pain all the time mostly on my left side and behind left eye and top of head. However, the pain does permeate into the other side of my head. \n\n\\- Throughout the day, I will experience \u201cattacks\u201d of sharp shooting/electric type pain in head. At times, I have pain in face, behind and around my eyes and across nose. These attacks come and go throughout the day and sometimes last longer, turning the dull headache into a strong, intense headache.\n\n\\-Upper neck is stiff, and the base of my head feels very painful.

My headaches last 3-7 days and I was starting to get them 2-3 times a month.I've had them for about 3.5 years. I went to UCLA oral and facial pain and they quickly diagnosed me with HC. I got put on Indomethacin 25mg 2 capsules 3x a day  and Boswellia 2x everyday as well. My only issue is that I dont want to be on Indomethacin everyday as I know it leads to a lot of stomach problems and i'm pretty wary taking any prescription med everyday for the rest of my life... has anyone else felt this way? I still take boswellia 2x everyday but I try not to take Indomethacin unless I feel a headache coming, and unfortunately by the time the headache comes and I start the indomethacin- it takes too long for the indo to kick in and im therefor stuck with my headache for the 3-7 days anyway. I know its my own fault for not wanting to take the indo everyday regardless of whether I have the headache or not.

For most of that time, she has had a 3/10 headache, with episodes of 6/10. Dealing with this pain has been a struggle to her, but going to her neurologist and receiving pericraneal blocks, and taking Celecoxib (She reacted initially very badly to Indomethacin, so the doctor didn't continue with it) has helped her to have the headaches under some control. \n\nHowever, for the past month and a half, her headache has been 5/10 most of the time, with day-long episodes of 7/10 and 8/10. She has barely been able to do any work (which fortunately does not affect her too much as she is independent) and has been bed-ridden for most of the time. Nerve blocks and Celecoxib aren't working as well as before for some reason, so we have been trying with indomethacin for the past few days. Fortunately this time she responded better. However at the current dose of 75mg daily her headache is now 4/10, with frequent excacerbations of 7/10 and above, but still less than the past weeks. We are going to increase the dose slowly until we hit one that works better for her. (We are also fortunate that her doctor is an expert in headaches and a very kind person).\n\nAnyway, as her boyfriend, it's very sad to see her going through this, and it's also emotionally draining. I've tried to help her as much as possible, but, tbh, it's really frustrating to know there's only so much you can do. That's why I would like to know your opinion, what do you think it's the best someone close to you can do to help you? What kind of things do you wish someone would do or not do that can make your life better in some way?\n\nI know much of the advise depends on each specific situation, but, we probably can agree that the emotional and physical struggle of someone with this illness is very particular.

In 2012 I started suffering from a weird stabbing headache that started evolving into what took about 3 years and many A&amp;E visits later - Hemicrania Continua. It was immense pain on one side that reacted to absolutely nothing but indomethacin. \n\nI took indomethacin for a good 6+ months and was pain free for the first time in years, and all of a sudden they stopped working... Migraine medication (I assume we've all been through the bloody lot of them) did nothing, but out of the blue, Candesartan seemed to do the trick (usually treats high blood pressure).\n\nAnd yes, you guessed it, about a year later that too stopped working. I've recently discovered I only have 1 kidney and can't use NSAIDs, and indomethacin in particular. The hospital I attend will not go through alternative medication for HC unless I sign to a possibly toxic dose of Indomethacin to \"confirm the diagnosis\". I've asked to see someone else but really want to make sure I tell them everything in the most objective way possible.\n\nSo finally. My question: Do those of you who have suffered from this for a while get accustomed to the background pain (probably a 3/10) that is always there? I'm finding it very difficult to mediate what kind of pain I'm in as I seem to somehow get used to the low lying pain and completely collapse when it starts to peak. \n\nAny comments hugely appreciated!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "HemicraniaContinua", "subreddit_id": "t5_9pmt8", "subreddit_subscribers": 14, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Question about symptoms", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557636808, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HemicraniaContinua/comments/bmb0ac/question_about_symptoms/"}, {"author": "dragonfliinflight", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1bic3qim", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1556167392, "domain": "self.HemicraniaContinua", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HemicraniaContinua/comments/bh4kvx/need_alternative_medication_for_hc/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "bh4kvx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/HemicraniaContinua/comments/bh4kvx/need_alternative_medication_for_hc/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1556167393, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have both migraines with aura and HC.

Particularly the first injury exasperated the symptoms of HC.  Up until that point I never had any issues.\n\nAfter dealing with a neurologist that was continuously of the option that I had post concussion syndrome and kept upping my prescription of amitriptyline to ridiculous levels, 150mg.  I started to look for a second option as I was having side effects from the high dosage of the amitriptyline and still never any relent besides ice packs, lots of Advil, and rubbing the sensitive areas of my head.  Indomethacin was what I initially started taking when I was diagnosed, which not only gave a concrete answer to the IRHS, but it also gave me my quality of life back, outside of the side effects on my stomach, etc.  \n\nAfter months of being on it, due to losing my Neurologist, I found another Neurologist that specialized in HC.  He recommended Gliacin (Boswellia Serrata).  It worked just as well as the indomethacin after being on it for a few weeks, I say weeks because I had to keep upping my dosage.  The dosage I found to work best for me was 1125mg (3 Capsules) taken 3 - 4 times a day depending on how much sleep I got the night before and of course stress! The only major side effect I had from the Gliacin was overactive BMs that we\u2019re ever frequent and never solid.  I did have an increased sensitivity to certain foods that would cause heartburn, but I compensated with Zantac with those particular foods.\n\nA little over a year ago I switched from the Gliacin to Hemp CBD, all I can say is wow!  No more sensitive heartburn or overactive BMs, just relief as well as having less anxiety!  It took me awhile to find the right dosage and also a brand that was not only reputable but one that also produced a safe, effective product that I could afford.  Today I consume about .25ml of CBDistillery\u2019s 5000mg 30ml full spectrum hemp CBD oil 3 - 4 times a day.  A bottle will last me close to a month.  I actually have gone to the point of re-selling their products (wholesale) because I admired the quality and safety.  The oil works best for me for the instant effectiveness as well as price point.  Their other products are great as well. I have tried their gummies and capsules but due to both having to be absorbed through the digestive system, they take much longer to take effect and in my option require a higher dosage which is more costly.  I honestly don\u2019t mind the natural flavor of the oil tincture, it\u2019s easy to get used to and has made my quality of life vastly improve.\n\nI don\u2019t know of any HC sufferers in person to share my successes with but I\u2019m curious to see if others would be as successful as I am with finding relief from the HC symptoms via Hemp CBD products.\n\nAnybody else care to share their successes as well as interests?
