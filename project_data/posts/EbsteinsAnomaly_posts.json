My 5 year old daughter had her repair in May with Dr. Dearani. She had the cone, and an ASD/PFO repair. Once he got her on the operating table, it turned out that her atrial septum basically looked like Swiss cheese, so he cut out the majority of the septum and patched it with bovine pericardium, but also created a single ASD in that patch to act as a pop off valve just in case pressures were ever too high. At first, after we returned home to her cardiologist here, her inflow gradient was measuring high (cardiologist said her valve was a little tight, the diameter wasn\u2019t quite wide enough). It seemed to slowly improve each visit, and at the appointment before this last one, the cardiologist said she thought things would continue to improve, but slowly (\u201cover the course of years rather than months\u201d). Then, at the last appointment (only 2 months between those appointments), her inflow gradient dramatically improved (went from 6 to 3) and they also said they thought her ASD had closed because there was no flow through it. They were thrilled, but of course I\u2019m skeptical \ud83d\ude05. I plan on calling Dearani\u2019s office to ask, but I thought maybe one of you here could also answer whether anything similar has happened to you or your loved one!

I'm severely underweight (BMI 14) and have been my whole life, which has complicated getting adequate medical care.\n\nI've had episodes of tachycardia since about age 15, and when I brought it up to my pediatrician, he said I had acute pulmonary tachycardia and left it at that, he never called for any imaging. So I went off to college and continued to think my symptoms of racing heart and palpitations were just normal things hearts do sometimes. \n\nThen I graduated from college, 22 years old, and was about to get on a bus to leave NYC where I had been living, to go visit my parents upstate. I had a severe episode of my heart beating so fast and out of rhythm that I almost fainted and had to call an ambulance because I was finding it hard to breathe. \n\nOnce I was at the hospital, I had my first ever heart tests. I believe they did a 24 hour EKG, and they told me my heart is not what they'd expect in a 22 year old, and looked more like a 65 year old heart. I was concerned and looking forward to doing more testing to see what they meant, because that was quite vague and not a diagnosis.\n\nThen, before we could admit me for more testing, two female doctors came into the room and they were very angry at me. They said that they heard my BMI was 14 and that I had to be moved into the psychiatric ward to be treated for an eating disorder. I had never been diagnosed with one and my weight has been the same my whole life, I was actually holding and eating an egg and cheese biscuit as they yelled at me. Fortunately, my mom was there and helped me state my case that I am sane and I do eat, but they did not believe us. So my mom and I snuck out  when they weren't looking and left the hospital. I became very scared to see doctors and seven years went by.\n\nNow I'm 30 and I have realized that it's not likely to happen again, so I've been seeing a primary care doctor (he thinks my weight is fine since I've always been like this) and we are only just now starting to do the imaging tests I've needed all these years. The diagnosis of EA makes a lot of sense given that from what I've read having a congenital heart defect is associated with being underweight. Next up I'll be seeing an electrophysiologist. \n\nHas anyone else experienced being underweight with Ebstein's anomaly?\nWhat is your first appointment at the electrophysiologist like? I'm not sure if they will want to cath abalate or operate, and we are not sure if there's a hole or not yet, so still a lot to be determined. Would love to hear if anyone has experienced a late diagnosis or a misdiagnosis which has caused a large gap in care.

Every cardiologist we have seen for my child has tried to tell us they could do surgery of some type at their facility, but as much as I like those cardiologists, I guarantee that none of those facilities would have been prepared for the surprises that were encountered once surgery had started.\n\nBottom line, be informed, and advocate for you or your loved one when necessary.
