They already tend to talk to each other really loudly with semi agressive tones, but on top of it, my boyfriend gets overwhelmingly angry when he has a period (maybe episode?) of noise sensitivity. \n\nThis morning as we all ate breakfast together, he couldn\u2019t stand both my parents chewing with their mouths opened, their lips smacking, their glasses of water clicking against the table and how my father\u2019s knife squeaks against the plate. Then as he cleaned with my mother, she started repeating words and sentences like \u201cyou know\u201d \u201cyou get it\u201d \u201chey\u201d as she talked to him. He tried to keep his anger down by not talking to her but she only kept going louder and louder. He eventually shut himself in a smaller part of the kitchen to pretend to clean, shutting the sliding door. My mother then went in there and started speaking to him again and after that he went upstairs to our room, landed on the bed, started screaming like a madman as he pulled on his hair screaming \u201ceverything is so loud\u201d \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d \u201cstop it\u201d \u201chelp\u201d \u201cso loud\u201d. It was terrifying. I then realised he had already gone too far and even my speaking voice is making him scream, as if he is trying to cover up the other sounds he perceives as loud with the sound of him continuously screaming in anger and pain.\n\nTo calm him down, I stoped speaking and gave him headphones. They don\u2019t cancel out noise or anything but it\u2019s better than nothing.\n\nDoes anyone else have that? Are there ways to stop someone\u2019s attack from going too far? My parents don\u2019t believe in anxiety or panic attacks and my mother is especially bad at adjusting to others including myself and my emotional sensitivity. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry if this is not the sub for this, if you guys know there are better subreddits where I should be asking for help on this, replies about them would be greatly appreciated as well.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "soundsensitivity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t1ld", "subreddit_subscribers": 113, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just saw my boyfriend scream from noise sensitivity", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/soundsensitivity/comments/n2ez5a/just_saw_my_boyfriend_scream_from_noise/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "T_H_Help", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_b815acnu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1617416850, "domain": "facebook.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/soundsensitivity/comments/mizgdm/to_reduce_sound_sensitivity/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mizgdm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/soundsensitivity/comments/mizgdm/to_reduce_sound_sensitivity/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1617416861, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "soundsensitivity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t1ld", "subreddit_subscribers": 113, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "To Reduce Sound Sensitivity", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.facebook.com/107554354760873/posts/114452487404393/", "url_overridden_by_dest": "https://www.facebook.com/107554354760873/posts/114452487404393/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "H0lyThr0wawayBatman", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1zl9ra2n", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1613078547, "domain": "self.soundsensitivity", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/soundsensitivity/comments/lhv51e/pain_signals_sent_down_through_hands_when/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lhv51e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/soundsensitivity/comments/lhv51e/pain_signals_sent_down_through_hands_when/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1613078559, "score": 1, "selftext": "Had no idea this sub existed until just now, I know it's not very active but I'm hoping someone can tell me if they've had this experience too?\n\nJust for some background... I'm not sure what condition causes this, my therapist says I'm a highly sensitive person but I think there's more to it than that (I suspect undiagnosed autism). I have an exaggerated startle response to certain unexpected loud noises. It makes me jump or tense up. Mostly thumps/bangs, doors/drawers/cabinets slamming, stomping. A loud knock on the door can also trigger it, and a doorbell is enough to give me a mild panic attack. I live in an apartment building and become extremely angry in seconds if my neighbors slam a door or make a loud thumping sound. I find my trigger sounds absolutely intolerable and am prone to angry outbursts if exposed to too many sounds in a short span of time. Or sometimes I'll get so overwhelmed and burnt out, I'll shut down and become unable to think straight, or even cry. I know these reactions aren't uncommon in people with sensory issues.\n\nBut I've also noticed that sometimes I'll get what feels like a jolt of electricity down my arms and onto my hands. Once it reaches my hands, it feels like it branches off and continues down through my fingers. It's not terribly painful, just startling and uncomfortable.\n\nWhat the heck is this?!
