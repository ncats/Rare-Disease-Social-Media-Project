I returned sporadically before committing to it again fully around 2011.  \nI knew something was wrong shortly after an injury resulting from a night of drinking (I was 20 or so)  \nSaturday Night Palsy, is what the doctor said.  I had passed out with my head resting on my forearm on a small garbage can.\n\nThat was the first time I had injured any of the nerves in my arm directly. Much later, after I recovered from the saturday night palsy I had continuous bouts of carpal tunnel like symptoms in both of my hands because guess what, I am a gamer.. I've logged thousands of hours in hundreds of games which I know doesn't help my situation.  \nAnother thing that did not help my situation was pretty much all of my interests including:  Gaming, Painting, Digital Graphic Design &amp; Desktop Publishing, Music Production, Pretty much everything I am interested in requiring a computer.  So naturally I would pursue these kinds of careers.  But nope, Me being the smart guy I am decided to work at the casino as a Dealer, I mainly dealt poker tournaments or in the poker room, blackjack tables and other smaller table games like 3 card poker. \n\nI worked the night shift at the casino for 8 years before deciding I'd had enough, I was burnt out.  \nand my hands and forearms ached everyday.  It was time to switch jobs again!\n\nI chose to go back to school for graphic communications and in between semesters broke my tibia plateau at a Festival.  My leg recovered surprisingly well.  Then after finishing the graphic design program and getting a job at a local Printer &amp; Bindery I started having problems with my hands, and wrists again, it was the work I was doing, Repetitive motions for hours.  I left that job shortly after, still unknowingly suffering from HNPP but I suspected it wasn't just carpal tunnel like all the doctors thought.\n\nSo I cycled through some unsuccessful minimum wage jobs, before landing a nice AV Tech and Operator position with a local AV company.  It was one of the only jobs so far that didn't require me to sit or stand in the same spot for hours except during certain events but I could always get up and move around, In fact there was a lot of that during these events.  I worked there until shortly before the rental department of the business I was working at shutdown.  I should have stayed there and learned how to install and service AV systems.\n\nInstead I chose to work at a Vinyl and Sign Shop, We wrap vehicles, boats, trucks &amp; semi's and all kinds of things in colored vinyl and we also do paint protection for half the dealerships in the city.  So there is again a lot of idle time in front of a computer, combined with repetitive motion while applying constant pressure with tools and sitting or standing perched in awkward positions on, in, or around vehicles.  I've been doing this for about 4 years now and I absolutely hate it.  Everything on my body is sore, back, legs, arms, wrist (from old injuries mostly).  And now I am getting new symptoms in my legs and feet when I sit or stand for too long, sometimes I don't even have to sit or stand for 2 minutes before I feel dull aching pressure in other parts of my legs (hamstrings, achilles, heel, sides of feet, gluts, quads) Sometimes its a dull ache and sometimes I start losing the feeling, when I try to walk it off, I sometimes feel the same dull pain travel from my heels into my legs repeatedly with each step.\n\nLight massage and exercise involving continuous low impact movement I have also found to be helpful, I practice Qi Gong and plan to go back to Tai Chi as well. Both are and have been very beneficial not only to symptoms of HNPP but for my general well being. I also find ointments like Zheng Gu Shui (made by Yulin) and other oils like Thunder Oil help with dealing with aches.  \nI will often fill a bathtub of the hottest water I can stand, dump epsom salts and a little Zheng Gu Shui in the water and soak for 40 minutes.  It is very therapeutic.\n\nI also found that rolling a ball like a tennis ball or a much harder ball like a lacrosse ball around with the bottom of the feet helps with my leg aches a little.  It will also help with some symptoms in the arms and hands when rolling the ball around with your shoulder blade against a wall or the ground.  I have been going for acupuncture in the mean time to try to deal with an issue of weakness in my right pinky finger, the abduction is weakened because I cant seem to send the signal to my muscle to open my finger fully.  (I could have been sleeping on my side one night, which brings me to another point!)\n\nHow in gods name does everyone sleep in here without something going numb?  My arms are the worst for this because until not too long ago I always slept on my side, and shifted between side and back during the night.  But now I sleep strictly on my back, although if I lay too long sometimes parts of my legs will go numb or parts of my arms on occasion.\n\nSo here I am contemplating yet another change in jobs, I am going to apply again at the AV company I worked with, they are only hiring a part-time casual installer so I might just have to keep working my same job until they have a position for me.  Unless they consider hiring me full time which I need to help pay my mortgage.\n\nWhat career paths have some of you taken?  \nWhat jobs are great for people who have HNPP?  \nDoes anyone have any tricks they use to manage pain, numbness and general symptoms of HNPP?  Does CBD help at all with aching nerves and tendons? (I ask because I have tried and haven't had any luck with CBD yet, maybe Im not using the right product)\n\nAlmost done now but I could not leave without asking what effect do you think cannabis and/or alcohol has on your nervous system?  I assume they both affect your nervous system as most things seem to but is it doing any damage?  Why or why not?\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, I hope some of it has been helpful to someone out there.  \ndrop some of your experiences in the comments!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "HNPPsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_1194ch", "subreddit_subscribers": 49, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "HNPP and career paths, injury management, excercise, sleep, drugs &amp; alcohol", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HNPPsupport/comments/r65kgd/hnpp_and_career_paths_injury_management_excercise/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Curious_Increase", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_a5n3d27c", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1631957588, "domain": "self.HNPPsupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HNPPsupport/comments/pqjd15/could_heart_rate_chest_strap_cause_discomfort_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pqjd15", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/HNPPsupport/comments/pqjd15/could_heart_rate_chest_strap_cause_discomfort_in/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1631957598, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi\n\nThe last few weeks I have been experiencing discomfort in my left side chest and left arm.
