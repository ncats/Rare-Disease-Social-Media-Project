It was responding well to Cabergoline and just kinda chilling out. I did have some minor blurry vision spots at first but nothing major. About 3/4 months ago my vision was still degrading and surgery was starting to be discussed. The docs wanted to take their time and see her extent because scans showed the growth was actually away from the optic nerves so we were not really even sure if the vision degradation was related and prolactin levels were under control.\n\n\nLast week:\nI had my scheduled follow up with Endocrinology as well as an MRI because I was noticing further degradation to my vision. Tuesday I drove to the MRI no problems. Friday, met with the Endo and labs showed some elevation in Prolactin I also expressed my further degraded vision he expressed that perhaps surgery would be the correct path. Saturday however my vision was shot. I was so blurry I could not read anything, I could not pick my family members out of a crowded restaurant. It was bad. At this point my wife and I decided I had to go to the hospital!\n\nSurgery:\nThey prepped me for surgery yesterday morning the whole thing took about 5 hours including prep and waiting for me to wake up from anesthesia. My vision was immediately better! I could read, I could see people\u2019s facial features, and best of all I just felt relieved to be on the track to healing. I was discharged from the hospital today and am recovering well at home.  Luckily had no complications and we expect the recovery to be smooth and easy about 4 weeks.\n\nThe Neurosurgeon told me there was some fluid trapped in the tumor and it was likely pulling on my nerves and blood vessels for my eyes causing the strain and degraded vision. He basically removed the fluid and reduced what he could. He described it as leaving the balloon but removing the filling and interior. So basically I have a shell of the tumor left and that\u2019s it. The endo told me my labs after surgery show my prolactin levels well below maximum for a male my age and asked me to stop Cabergoline for the next month until we do follow up labs.\n\nThank you to this community for the support, research, and information you guys are amazing!

They tested my testosterone level and they were below the low marker. They gave me some gel to rub on my inner elbows to help boost it. After my first dose, insurance cut off the supply. I ran through the bottle and called it quits. Went another two years before I got to the point where I was so fatigued I had to gasp for breath to talk sometimes. Body always cold, weak, tired, dead.\n\nThe wife pushed me to get back into the doctor to check my low-t again. Tests come back, lower than before. I had a nurse handling it, and she said I had to see my primary doctor to get prescribed anything. I hadn't seen the guy in 4 years because he was always booked 2 months in advance. Somehow, he actually had an opening a week away. I took it.\n\nSat down with the doctor, he said \"I treat low-t every single day... But in 60 year olds, not 26 year olds\". He sent me to a endocrinologist. The specialist looked me over, said he thinks it's either testes issue, or thyroid issue. Sends for blood work, sets an appointment for two weeks out.\n\nSoon as the results came in, I got an email with the results. Prolactin, normal range from 3-17. Mine was 2,042. I thought it might have just been a typo, but the doctor's aide called me right after that and asked if I could come in immediately.\n\nThey needed a CT scan. Doctor suspected a prolactinoma.

Like during the lapse, my body built an immunity to the cabergoline.\n\nThe last blood work I had done, prolactin is still in the normal range, but the FSH, Testosterone and T4 are low again.\n\nJust feel defeated.\nThat's where I'm at with mine.\nJust suffering from the side effects of a compressed pituitary gland.

I'm writing this post in a bit of desperation as things are quickly sliding towards the end of our marriage.  I've heard Cabergoline has been nicknamed the \"Divorce Drug\" and I'm wondering if anyone out there has experienced anything similar to my story.  \nHere goes.  2 years ago my wife age 30 was diagnosed with her tumour, I may get the measurements wrong but I believe it was 12mm x 12mm x 10mm.  She was prescribed Dostinex 0.5mg once a week and after a year the tumour had shrunk by about 25% and seemed to be responding.  She had some mild side effects that seemed to come and go.  Hypersexuality was one, but drinking really became her vice.  \nI first observed the behavioural change when we went to a bar for a birthday party.  We left our puppy in his crate and planned to return home after 5 or 6 hours at the latest as this was the longest he had ever been left.  As the night wore on she wanted drink after drink after drink.  Nothing seemed to phase her, I reminded her we had to go but she just wanted more.  Eventually when the dog had been in his crate for 7 hours I finally said we have to go and drive the hour home.  She proceeded to vomit in the car on the way home and felt horrible the next day that she did that to the dog.\nThe next incident was at a friend's wedding.  Again she started pounding the drinks and became disruptive at the wedding.  Laughing and making fun loudly at the speeches.  I grew embarrassed and angry and told her to be quiet and the night went sideways from there.  She refused to talk to me, disappeared into the dark for hours and I had no idea where she was.  I found her with a good friend and she was crying that her marriage was over.  I tried to get her in the car but she wouldn't leave with me.  As I was leaving she stumbled up and said \"Babe, hun, can I have $20 for beer before you go?\".  I left and drove home alone.  In the days following she confirmed that she felt our marriage of 2 years was over.  That she wanted different things and felt like a different person.  We agreed to work on things, and this was last August 2017.\nFast forward to this past November and we had her brother's wedding to go to.  She was a bridesmaid and again decided it would be a good time to enjoy some champagne.  Typically beer is her go to but wine and champagne really hit her hard.  She quickly became drunk and was ordering people around and directing traffic at the wedding fairly aggressively.  She was cursing in front of children, and on top of this several times she came up to me and grabbed my crotch and told me what she wanted to do to me in front of her family (grandma, mother etc.).  I gently pushed her away and told her later she could do those things to me later at home but again her mood swung in the opposite direction.  She started to become depressed because I had rejected her.  She wanted me to leave her at the wedding and go home but I wasn't going to do that this time understanding that this was her medication causing issues.  She said she was ugly and no one told her how pretty she looked.  Then she started crying and couldn't stop.  She excused herself to the washroom and I followed to console her.  Around 11:00pm we left and I drove her home and she passed out in the car.  \nChristmas time rolled around and we were still struggling with her wanting to go drinking, at times she was fine and could have several drinks and be perfectly fine, but the previous examples had me scared half to death.  She would want to go drinking in the city an hour from home and I was afraid she wouldn't come home or would end up with someone else.  She took those fears as controlling behaviours and me not having trust in her which only further compounded our marriage issues.  \nA month ago everything came to a head.  She was determined to go out downtown and went out with work colleagues.  She said she would be home by 9:30, but when I checked in to see how the night was going she hadn't left the bar and said she would be home at 10:30.  I checked in again closer to 10:30 and she still hadn't left the bar.  6 drinks and 2 shots later she managed to catch the train home and got back to where we live at midnight.  She then proceeded to drive home drunk.  We had a giant argument about everything that had happened, and how all my fears were valid and she said she now understands that she does have a problem with drinking while on her medication and that she is going to stop but following her apology she told me she doesn't love me anymore and wants to separate.  For the last month we have been living in the same home and I've watched her at arm's length become drunk night after night, going out and not coming home until 1:00 or 2:00am with no idea where she was or who she was with.  She hasn't stopped drinking she has only increased the amount to 5-6 drinks daily 4-5 days a week and sometimes more.  In addition a few months ago at her sister's house she wanted to bring home this ziploc bag full of weed.  My 15 year old son had just been caught trying this and we came down really hard on him because of it so I told her I wasn't comfortable with having that amount in the house.  She agreed to leave it at her sisters and respected my view on it.  However this past weekend she was at her sisters again and she came home with that very same bag and hid it in her dresser.  I could smell it and the dog led me right to it but again this type of behaviour is totally unlike her.  She's forced me away at arm's length and continues to self destruct while claiming everything is fine with her.\nI have tried to talk to her doctor but her doctor will not speak to me because of patient confidentiality and I've been searching for answers as to what could be doing this to her.  My only thought is that the Dostinex is amplifying her impulse control and causing her to act in the way she has.  She has grown cold, and distant, quick to anger and long to forgive or apologize if at all.  She says she has no feelings for me, she is not in love with me and wants to live a single life and to find out who she is.  She is pushing for us to sell our home.  It's all very hard to understand and I've tried to talk to her about this numerous times but she doesn't want to listen, she feels controlled, parented etc.  In full transparency we have had other issues in our marriage but it just seems unlike her to be unwilling to try.\n\n\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 265, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "MacroProlacinoma - Dostinex Side Effects", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/8ecg6u/macroprolacinoma_dostinex_side_effects/"}, {"author": "The_CaptainMorgan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1523650342, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/8c286s/135_ngml_prolactin_levels_and_not_sure_what_to_do/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8c286s", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/8c286s/135_ngml_prolactin_levels_and_not_sure_what_to_do/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1523652833, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 6, "selftext": "Preface: 22/F/ Never been pregnant\n\nI'm in the Air National Guard as of currently, but when I was Active Duty, i was stressed up to my eyeballs so bad that my period eventually stopped.

I was officially diagnosed with a pituitary tumor after an MRI last month. Started bromocriptine 1.25mg twice a day in mid-March and got a confirmed single-digit prolactin (4 ng/mL) after 3 weeks of treatment. I found it very useful to read your stories, especially ones where levels were borderline. The literature seems very poor for these cases in terms of treatment value and likelihood of finding a tumor.\n\nLast October, I went to a reproductive endocrinologist after a year of timed intercourse cycles that did not end in pregnancy, 3 of those with Clomid 50mg prescribed by my OB-GYN. My cycles were usually in the 26-30 day range, with some important exceptions in the 32-40 day range. My charts were pretty consistent in showing ovulation, but my luteal phase varied a lot, between 10-14 days. I could not take B-complex in the fertile window, because it would pause ovulation, even after positive LH tests, until I stopped taking it. The OB-GYN and RE looked at me like I had 5 heads when I told them about the B-complex, but it was reproducible, so I was confident in the conclusion.\n\nAnyway, the RE was the first one to check my prolactin, and I was instructed to fast before the blood draw: 41.5 ng/ml. I got instructions to avoid nipple stimulation and whatnot before the follow-up draw: 24.6. She said the in-house lab reference range went up to 30.9, so we were good to go for a PCOS diagnosis. I was extremely skeptical about the prolactin, since most reference ranges go up to 20-25 and she hadn't done a full thyroid panel, but my husband said we should trust the expert. \n\nAfter a failed letrozole cycle, I asked for one more draw, hoping to see something under 20 so I could let this go: 25.7. At that point, I asked an endocrinologist friend if I should get it drawn somewhere else or get another opinion. She said a thyroid panel and draw at another lab would be a good move, but I would probably need IVF down the line. While I was doing the letrozole cycles, I went to my GP office and asked for the thyroid panel, thyroid antibody, and prolactin draw. The NP was willing, as long as I kept following up with the RE. The thyroid panel was clean, and the prolactin was 30.7, with a 23.3 ng/mL max on the reference range. I called up the RE office and sent a screenshot of the result to the nurse, and they ordered the MRI on the condition my insurance would preauthorize, which it did. After my latest blood draw, the RE wants me to take 1.25 mg of bromocriptine once per day.\n\nSince my \"PCOS symptoms\" were very mild, it seems like the prolactinoma is more likely to be responsible for them. My husband and I decided to take a break from fertility treatments for a lot of reasons, but we're hoping we won't need any more interventions. If we do, we still have time to revisit the topic. Hopefully, this post is helpful to someone in a similar situation.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 261, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro: 31F 3mm tumor with levels ranging 24-41 ng/mL and infertility", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/8az2id/intro_31f_3mm_tumor_with_levels_ranging_2441_ngml/"}, {"author": "HOME_MADE_FUCK_OFFS", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1522073371, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "edited": 1522073847, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/879d9q/high_prolactin_no_tumor/", "gilded": 0, "id": "879d9q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/879d9q/high_prolactin_no_tumor/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1522117614, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 3, "selftext": "My prolactin level is 3.5x higher than the upper limit for men but I had an MRI last month and the results came back I have no tumor and my endocrinologist won't treat me because there is \"no treatable cause\", they said they booked a review for me in may, whatever that means.

In a previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/7y2m1b/prolactinoma_and_hopeful_surgery/  I talked about tumor size and symptoms. A pre-op blood test on 3/18 showed a slight increase in prolactin level corresponding I guess to the slight increase in tumor size.\n\nPost-op my neuro doc says he was able to remove 95-98% of the tumor, as expected he was not able to get to the part next to the carotid artery. He said that the mass was filled with tumor material along with fluid blood and dried blood product which may explain why it was not decreasing in size as expected. He showed me the before and after MRI images and it is amazing to see the pituitary gland hanging there in the center of my head for the first time :).\n\nProlactin level is now 13.5 but I'm still on the cabergoline because of the remaining tumor.\n\nSo, my nose is a little sore and I need to flush with saline.

It\u2019s been reassuring knowing that other people have gone through this strange experience as well. I guess writing a post about it will be somewhat cathartic for me. \n\nSo I am a 21yo Male, I had just finished studying and was working 6 days a week as well as exercising around 8 hours a week. I thought I was in pretty good shape and hadn\u2019t been to the doctor in around 7 years. This was partly due to good health but also due (ironically) to a fear of blood tests and medical procedures. In hindsight I probably should have picked up that things weren\u2019t quite as right with me as I had led myself to believe. My arms and legs were incredibly skinny with barely any muscle, and I had very little body hair. Despite weighing 59kg I was still carrying excess body fat that I could never lose. I had also plateaued exercise wise but I always thought train harder bro, you\u2019re just cutting corners. There were also other issues as well, such as a lack of confidence, motivation, anxiety and never having had any relationships with women. Some pretty classic low testosterone signs. Weirdly, No issues downstairs however\n\nThe first glaring symptoms I noticed were blinding headaches when driving home each night from work. I put these down to bad posture or stress. So these headaches continued and I ignored them until one night I was woken by the same headache, only this one lasted for six hours. It felt like my skull was splitting apart. I probably should have been in hospital at that point but I went to the doctors the next day who immediately sent me for a CAT scan. When I was told that I had a pituitary tumour later the same day it felt like my world had fallen apart. After avoiding having had a blood test my entire life out of fear, I was then was faced with needing one straight away, which unsurprisingly led to a panic attack and more headaches. \n\nWhen the results of the MRI scan and the blood test came back I was even more shocked. I had a 30x30x30mm Prolactinoma with a prolactin level of 128,000mIU/L or 6000ng/mL. My testosterone level was a quarter of what it should have been for a 21 year old male. I was then sent to have my eyes tested, but despite the size of the tumour it hadn\u2019t affected my peripheral vision. Still i was stopped from exercising, working, drinking alcohol and driving which had a pretty big impact on my social life and general well being. \n\nSix months later I\u2019m now three MRI scans in and have got used to having blood tests pretty quickly. I was also seen by a neurosurgeon but for now my treatment is being done medically through an endocrinologist. I\u2019m taking 2.5mg of cabergoline a week which has caused some shrinkage of the tumour and a reduction of my Prolactin level to 2144 mIU/L or 100ng/mL in six months. Sadly my testosterone levels have yet to recover, but the doctors want to give it more time to kick in before considering TRT due to the complications it can cause. I put on ten kilos in the first three months after the diagnosis, but I am now in the process of losing this weight as I have been allowed to begin exercising and driving again. I am still banned from drinking alcohol, which has been a struggle as I used it as a way of gaining confidence socially around friends and when out on a weekend. \n\nIt\u2019s been difficult to talk to any of my mates about the exact details of the condition, mainly out of embarrassment surrounding the low testosterone issue and having to explain the use of prolactin in the body. This has led me to feel partly ashamed but also a bit cheated that this tumour has affected my life for years without me even noticing. Still, I am gradually coming to terms with realising I\u2019m not as bulletproof mentally or physically as I thought. I still consider myself lucky that this turned out to be a prolactinoma diagnosis and not something worse. Now I get the chance to put the pieces of my life back together and face the long road ahead.\n\nIf you made it this far, congratulations and I wish you all the best. I\u2019ll probably make another post in future or update this one if the need arises. Also I apologise if there is any medical terminology used incorrectly, I\u2019m still learning a lot about this stuff and would love to hear if anyone has any advice for me about what to expect in the future. If there\u2019s any questions please feel free to ask. Thanks.

Prolactin levels have been at a good low level the last few blood tests. I also have hypothyroidism.\n\nWhen I was first diagnosed, my endo told me I could no longer take hormonal birth control. After I found out about the thyroid problem, I was told that that was more reason not to, even though plenty of people with thyroid problems take hormonal bc. I can't take dual hormone because it raises my blood pressure, so I was on the mini pill. I had a hard time deciding what to do, I was scared of getting the copper IUD because of the horror stories but it was my only option, so after consulting my OBGYN I did it. Insertion sucked, and while at first afterwards I didn't have side effects now my periods are long, my cycles are short, and my cramps suck and periods are heavy. I have anxiety and OCD and it gets worse around my cycle so having it more frequently and for longer REALLY sucks. I was on state health insurance at the time (aka healthcare for poor people)\n\nNow, I have Kaiser and my OBGYN says that she's had patients who've had Prolactinomas be on hormonal BC and that it shouldn't be a problem, especially Mirena since it's localized. And she said what I always thought, that the thyroid problem shouldn't stop me from taking bc. I'm exited about this, but also wary. I have had a shit time with doctors over the last five years, with various health problems, misdiagnoses, and lots of conflicting information. I could write a fucking novel about all the back and forth I've done. It's been extremely frustrating and has made dealing with my health problems long and exhausting. I'm definitely gonna get a second opinion from a new endo, but I have a hard time trusting now after my other experiences. If they say it's ok, what if it's not and it makes my prolactinoma worse? What if they say it isn't ok, but really it would be fine and I'm suffering for no reason? Hearing other people's experiences would ease my anxiety about everything, so if anyone has any knowledge or experiences to share I'd really appreciate it!!

I started having vision changes in 2012 and have been to the doctor several times to diagnose but the last doctor said \"It seems like something is impinging your optic nerve but if that's the case it's likely inoperable and it would tell us what's up but probably wouldn't give us a course of treatment.\"  Also I have brittle Type 1 Diabetes and am MRSA colonized so ANY surgery is extremely risky, so I understand the eye doctor's caution to leave well enough alone. The vision changes were only problematic in low light and I don't drive in the dark anymore.\n\nMy prolactin levels were pretty low at diagnosis last week compared to other folks with this condition - I was at 48. I'm leaking like a bad faucet tho and the headaches are awful. She assumes my prolactinoma is super tiny based on these levels.\n\nMy doctor put me on bromocriptine 2.5 2x/day and the nausea and effect on my blood sugars is too destabilizing. I am all over the place and today I skipped my morning dose and am starting to feel normal again and my sugars are starting to calm down.\n\nWhat other meds are there that DON'T come with these side effects? Should I get an MRI to see if surgery is a better course of action? I have 4 other autoimmune disorders besides the Type 1 Diabetes and frankly, if surgery makes more sense I'd rather just do that and have this thing handled and over with.\n\nIf I stay on meds how long should I expect until the adenoma shrinks enough to stop padding my bra?

The cabergoline stopped working after the first 9 so for the past 6 months the dosage was increased to 1.5mg/week. Results came back recently and everything is basically the same, tumor isn't shrinking, T and P are chilling at the same level and due to the size of my tumor surgery is a non-option. They said surgery would permanently fuck my pituitary gland and probably cause permanent brain damage, that's not an exact quote from my neurosurgeon though.\n\nI do not enjoy taking the medication, my thoughts feel foggy, it makes it difficult to concentrate so school is difficult, I'm fatigued, I get headaches, constipation, come close to fainting if I get up too quickly, it has basically turned me into an 80 year old man. I'm also on 20mg/day of another drug (an anti-seizure called clobazam) because due to the tumor pressing on parts of my brain like a vending machine I get partial seizures and more bonus side effects.\n\nIn an effort to continue shrinking things (and growing some other things hopefully) Endocrinology has decided to increase me to 3.0mg/week which starts today.

This is something I am personally currently struggling with.\n* How have you handled the prolactinoma in your personal life?\n* Do you tell friends and family, are they supportive?\n* Do you find your prolactinoma defines a large portion of your identity and life?\n\n**Thank You**\n\nEdit: formatting", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update and I need help from experienced prolactinoma connoisseurs", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/7gbqic/update_and_i_need_help_from_experienced/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1511943480, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/7gbqb5/test/", "id": "7gbqb5", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/7gbqb5/test/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1512011462, "score": 1, "selftext": "[deleted]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Test", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/7gbqb5/test/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1511943299, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/7gbpur/update_and_i_need_help/", "id": "7gbpur", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/7gbpur/update_and_i_need_help/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1512011343, "score": 1, "selftext": "[deleted]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Update and I Need Help", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/7gbpur/update_and_i_need_help/"}, {"author": "HasturDragon", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1511900813, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/7g75z7/male_28_yo_looking_for_some_information/", "id": "7g75z7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/7g75z7/male_28_yo_looking_for_some_information/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1511974250, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hello,\nI recently went to see my doctor for fatigue, lack of concentration, and mood issues, among some personal problems.

Since little, i have had all kind of weird problems that baffled me. Easy to gain weight, a tad high cholesterol levels (?), Tireness, issues with eye sight, etc. Nothing to worry about i guess, maybe i am weird and different than my family. \n\nSkip a couple of years, i am 15is now and i find another symptom, delayed puberty. We go see a doctor, he says some people are like that. No biggie. \n\nWe wait till i am 16-17is, i am almost legal and still, i look like a 14 yr old. We go check on our doctor which recommends us an endo. This is where the good/bad doctor comes in play.\n\nShe examines me and my privates. Ask a couple of questions, says that i am ok and ita just an extreme case of delayed puberty and to wait. Now, we live in a small country and seeing all the patients made us think she was good. We tag along for 1 year, going there every 6 month, she does the same and keeps saying i am OK. She eventually recommends also going to urologist which then leads us to a genetist.  I am almost 19, so we express our concerms, she says if i wanted to get injected with hormones, thats when i lost it.\" Fck it i said. Lets look for aomeone else, she aint good doctor\" i told my mom, saying that i investigated and she isnt good (really i was scared of injections xD). She believes me.\n\nWe go to another endo and turns out i was right. She was a bad dr. (atleast for me). The second endo, without touching me, only seeing the exams told me: ur hormones are all over, but why were u never tested for prolactin. We do it right away and bam. We find the culprit. We are then suggested CT scan and we find Jerry (my prolactinoma). We start cabergoline treatment. 2 per week. We are then suggested to see a neurosurgeon.\n\nHere, boys and girls, is were again, look for a good dr. \n\nWe see this guy. Amongst the top in my country. He asks a couple of question, tells me its ok, hesistates a little then drops it: You should get surgery. \nHe says he could work the price since i didnt have insurance.\n\nGiven that its a surgery, we naturally go for a second opinion. Next neuro, apparently THE top. Actually checks the resultanof the CT and explains the situation: wheres the tumor, what is it affecting, why is it important, etc. He says theres no need for surgery, why fix aomething that isnt wrong? Rather take ur pills and of it continues growing then we go for surgery. He recommends then an eye doctor (optalmologist?) To check if Jerry affected my optic nerve. \n\nIts been 4 months roughly and i am seeing more progress than in 2 years with the first dr. I later found out that those three dr (endo, urologist and genetis) are kinda friends and they suggest themselves to \"milk us\". And the first neuro, was just for the money. \n\nThanks for hearing my story. Ask anything you wish to ask me. :) Stay safe \n\n\nTLDR: Go for a dr that isnt for the money. If he/she barely examines you (or youndont see a change) and keepsntelling you to come and suggests other costly procesures , look for a second opinion.

New to the sub, but I've been dealing with my prolactinoma for about 8 years. I was first diagnosed at age 18, with prolactin level at 386. Went on caber for a while but couldn't tolerate it. So, I had surgery when I was 20 to have it removed. The neurosurgeon said he got everything, so I went on with my life. My period didn't return right away so they put me on a medication to bring it back. After that I got my period and everything seemed fine for a little while. I want on the birth control that took away my period and for the next few years had no period, and didn't question it. However, I started a notice some of the symptoms gradually return, so I had my levels checked again when I was 24. They were back up around 250, so I had another MRI. The tumor had returned, even though the neurosurgeon removed it all during my surgery. The neurosurgeon said that some of the tumor cells infiltrated in my pituitary stalk and the surrounding brain tissue, meaning surgery is no longer an option for me. I went back on the cabergoline,.25 mg twice a week. My levels begin to decrease, and I had my IUD removed. My husband and I are trying to conceive, but I'm not hopeful because my period has not yet returned.\n\nThanks for sticking around for the backstory! Now for my question.

As of July 14 my prolactin is back up to 232, which brings me to my place of concern. Why is my prolactin going up? Is this an indication the tumor is growing, or just not being blocked by the medication?\n\nI know this isn't a medical diagnosis, but I am just nervous and wondering until I can get into the endo to ask them all my questions. I am hoping someone has asked these questions or knows a bit more than I do.\n\nThanks for your time.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Any idea what causes prolactin to go up?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/6ok3bh/any_idea_what_causes_prolactin_to_go_up/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1500367718, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/6nzj63/fm_prediagnosis_symptoms/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6nzj63", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/6nzj63/fm_prediagnosis_symptoms/", "retrieved_on": 1502116049, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "default", "title": "FM Prediagnosis Symptoms", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/6nzj63/fm_prediagnosis_symptoms/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "leirbag23", "author_created_utc": 1350577401, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_9ccjp", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1499622386, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "edited": 1499742891, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/6m8suw/bromocriptine_is_ruining_my_life/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6m8suw", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 17, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/6m8suw/bromocriptine_is_ruining_my_life/", "retrieved_on": 1502084726, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nI've been diagnosed with a macroprolactinoma, and for the past few years my endocrin has been trying to manage it with cabergoline. I have a 1.9x1.7x1.5mm tumor, and it has only reduced in 0.2mm in one of its dimensions since a year ago, when we started the cabergoline.\n\nI took up to six tablets of 1.0mg caber per week, but my prolactine never went below the 400's. The baseline before I started my treatment was around 1200ug/mL. So the doctor decided to try bromocriptine, one 2.5mg tablet per day, to see if I'm less resistant to that, before we try a surgical intervention.\n\nA little bit more context: I'm in Brazil, and cabergoline is ridiculously expensive here. The dose I was taking would cost me literally 1/3 of my salary every month, if we didn't have the possibility of getting some prescription medicine from our public health system, which is completely screwed up, but sometimes kind of works.\n\nSo when the doctor told me to switch to bromocriptine, which is much cheaper, I was overjoyed, and started my new treatment immediately. The problem is that the side effects are literally ruining my life, a single week into the treatment. \n\nI can't focus, I am miserable all the time, suicidal ideation has skyrocketed and I can't bring myself to do barely anything productive. Even reading is a chore, because I have to make an effort to go past the ridiculous, constant brain fog. It's hard to think, and people around me have already noticed how my mood has changed abruptly. When I say \"literally ruining my life\" I mean literally in its actual, *literal*, meaning. I can't go on like this for much longer.\n\nI work as a teacher, and I'm afraid that this new treatment is going to be impractical if I want to keep my job.\n\nMy question is: have any of you had a similar experience with bromocriptine? I'd like to know if this sort of situation is to be expected with this medication, and if it goes away with time. \n\nThanks!\n\n**TL;DR**: After one week of daily use, bromocriptine is quickly deteriorating my ability to function. I'm tired, unfocused, depressed, suicidal all the time. Is this normal? \n\n**EDIT**: Thank you all for your kind responses! I spoke with my endocrin, and he decided that I should stop taking bromocriptine immediately. Now I'm back on cabergoline, and I never thought I'd be happy about taking that stupid pill. It makes me tired and moody, but it's a walk in the park compared to what I experienced this week with bromo.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Bromocriptine is ruining my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/6m8suw/bromocriptine_is_ruining_my_life/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "imapinkpartydonut", "author_created_utc": 1475703651, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_11wue6", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1498578347, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "edited": 1498579255, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/6jtjdv/hyperprolactinemia_anyone_recognize_these_symptoms/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6jtjdv", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/6jtjdv/hyperprolactinemia_anyone_recognize_these_symptoms/", "retrieved_on": 1500187192, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "After being on cabergoline for 1,5 year i decided to quit because of the side effects, i became really tired and depressed to the point that i didn't leave the house much anymore.\n\nI quit cabergoline 3 months ago and my prolactin level is super high again.

I was diagnosed with macroprolactinoma back in early October 2016 and have been on cabergoline and Anastrozole for about 4 months now. My prolactin levels were at 150 when I was diagnosed and my testosterone at 180. After almost three months of treatment, my prolactin was down to 49 and my testosterone at 368. A few weeks later, I started feeling swelling in my chest after I was taken off the Anastrozole. I already have gynecomastia even though I've been skinny my whole life until about a year ago. I got another blood test three weeks after the last one, and my prolactin was the same and my testosterone at 230. I've now been on medication for 4 months and the only thing I've noticed was that my headaches have gone away. I'm still exhausted all the time. My genitals have shrunk and I'm never in the mood for sex at all. My breast tissue is super swollen and pokes through my shirt really bad. I can't lose weight or gain muscle at all, even though I'm running several times a week and eating less and better food. My legs are so sore I can't even run anymore and I'm gaining weight no matter what. I switched doctors and he put me on a slightly higher dose, .75mg twice a week for the cabergoline. Anybody else feel like it took forever to feel better at all? I keep reading stories on the internet about people who felt better after a few weeks, but my new doctor says I won't start noticing a difference until my prolactin levels and testosterone is in the normal range for a guy my age.

I was diagnosed via bloodwork and an MRI over a year ago. (Approx Nov 2015) At that time they had to dilute the blood work many times to get a Prolatin reading. The doc told me it was over 4000 but as I have read more and more I am unsure because it seems different labs use different references in either case I was well over 10 times what this lab showed as acceptable reference for a man my age (late 20s). My Testosterone levels were also horrendously low. The doc told me I was in double digits when the reference for \"low\" was above a 100 but below 150. We started with bromocriptine but quickly switched to cabergoline within a month. The doc was weary about starting any sort of TRT until we saw shrinking of the tumor and a decrease in prolactin levels. At the 6 month mark we saw some shrinkage of the tumor and my Prolactin levels were in the hundreds. (Don't remember the example number) At about the one  year mark we saw enough shrinkage in the tumor that the doc felt comfortable with proceeding to TRT. I do not have children and my spouse and I wanted to keep those options open so we decided not to do injections as it can impact fertility. The doc decided to prescribe me Clomid off label. Boy did it work. Within a week my low T symptoms were gone. I felt so much better and really felt my age for the first time in a long while. A month after starting Clomid my T levels were 600! The doc was both impressed and a little concerned but since I seemed fine we continued on the course. I continue to take Cabergoline and the doc suspects I may have to for a long time if not for the rest of my life due to the size of the tumor we started with. As for TRT the doc is concerned the tumor and the prolactin levels may have permanently impacted my testosterone function but the TRT seems to work. After my spouse and I have children I may switch to more traditional TRT but for now the Clomid is working. The only thing I have a concern with currently is my hands have started to partially go numb. Particularly my pink fingers and the base of my palms by my wrist. I am unsure if this is related to either of the prescriptions or if its entirely unrelated but will likely meet with the doc soon to discuss. Has anyone experienced hand or extremity numbness with Cabergoline and/or TRT/Clomid? Does any other male take Clomid? I know its commonly prescribed to females for fertility but I imagine the side effects are different.

After I graduated college I finally had my surgery for gynecomastia and shortly after noticing that on my medical history, a doctor recommended I get my hormones checked. They showed, among other things, a low testosterone level. \n\nI was put on testosterone replacement for a while, and it turned me into a completely different person - easily angered, sex-obsessed, controlling, etc. Switched off of it and went to clomid, which worked fantastic. Felt great, had a high libido and was able to perform normally during sex, but without all the roid-rage of TRT. All my levels were looking great. \n\nHowever, the last few months or so I've been feeling incredibly lethargic and lost interest in sex. Went in to get a blood test, found my prolactin was high, testosterone, FSH and LH were low. Got the MRI, prolactinoma found. The Doc told me to stop clomid and so far, I haven't noticed a difference (I guess it stopped working). \n\nMy question is, what does treatment feel like? Did any of you experience any side effects? What things should I know or expect? Why did clomid stop working and did it have anything to do with the tumor, or was it always there in the background?\n\nSorry for the long post and thank you all for taking the time to read and respond.

The proloactin is indeed going down at a slower rate but he's not too worried because he thinks my tumor simply has fewer receptors for the Cabergoline but is confident it will continue to shrink. We'll do another test in 3 months and if the prolactin still isn't decreasing quickly enough, we may have to increase the dosage. Doing T replacement therapy is an option, though I am not willing to go that route yet because my body may stop making it naturally altogether.

Mine was never like clockwork anyway, but I was also on various forms of BC so it helped regulate it. I had an MRI a couple years ago that didn't turn anything up, so I just ignored the non-periods and minor breast discharge.

Anyway, after putting it off for a long time, I finally went to an endocrinologist, who has put me on .5 mg of cabergoline twice a week, and my levels are back in the normal range. I'm feeling much better, and I'm feeling less depressed after several years. Sadly, my boobs are really small and like, deflated now. I'm hoping going back on the pill will help that, because when i went on the pill nearly 10 years ago, my boobs got swollen and even though they were tender, they looked great haha.  \n\nSo, two things: I declined getting another MRI because I can't afford it right now, even with my insurance. Is this a mistake? I feel like, even if it does turn up a prolactinoma, my treatment will continue as is, so why bother?\n\nAlso, I'm just wondering how long I should expect before my periods come back or if I should go on the pill again, or if anyone else has a similar experience? Is it normal that my period hasn't come back yet? Will my boobs ever be nice again? Could I have an estrogen problem?\n\nSorry for the wall of text, I'm just... feeling sort of lost about this.

I had my first physical in about 6 years two weeks ago and the prolactin test had been added to my blood work by my OBGYN due to lactation for about 1.5 years that I just never followed up on after I first told her about it.  Turns out my prolactin levels are at 500 - the highest my new PCP has personally seen (he is also an endocrinologist).  I was surprised to see some of you have MUCH higher levels than that, after he made such a big deal about it.\n\nMy experience so far - as I mentioned, lactation, and my vision has been getting progressively worse (but not terrible) over the past few years.  It could just be too much computer use, but now I'm wondering if it has to do with the prolactinoma.  I have also been experiencing seriously low libido for a couple years now and attributed it to extra weight gain.  I am also very obese but working on it (thanks to /r/keto, I've lost 78lbs as of today).\n\nMy doctor started me on cabergoline twice a week (I don't know the mg per pill, have to check later).  I've taken 4 doses so far.  I had zero issues after the first two doses, but after dose 3, all weekend I was feeling dizzy, slightly out of body, sleepy, and mild headaches.  I've been walking like I'm drunk but I also have knee issues so I don't know what is really causing it.  Some of those side effects are continuing now and I'm getting nervous about how long the effects will last.  My doctor said we could go down to once a week for a few weeks but I don't want to slow down the progress of the medication - I don't even know if that matters.\n\nI still need to schedule my field of vision test, and my doc was going to get back to me about if I should have a CT scan done, as MRI is out of the question due to my weight.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to introduce myself and thank you for the subreddit.

Now for someone who never drinks water that is a TON! So I went and saw my primary care physician and he ruled out regular diabetes but thought that I had diabetes insipidus meaning I was missing the hormone that told my kidneys to stop only making urine. I had a water deprivation test at the endocrinologist and found out I have it and was put on desmopressin to control it. I should also add that I get terrible  migraines if I consume too much salt (wow is it hard to kick out salt!)  That only tells part of the story, now they needed to find out why.  I was sent in for an MRI and they told me over the phone that my pituitary gland is enlarged and that they wanted me to come in for a consultation with the endocrinologist and a neurosurgeon about having a biopsy  (of course that freaked me out).  The endocrinologist sent me in for some blood work that for the most part came back relatively normal except for my prolactin level which was 45 their chart said normal ranged from 4-23 so I know it's elevated but I am not sure if prolactinoma is the culprit.  I should also mention that I saw my tests on-line on my medical chart and have totally turned into Dr. Google.\n\nUPDATE\n\nOk new update the endocrinologist thinks that what I have is Primary Hypophysitis and not a pituitary tumor. With this news I feel like I am being pushed rather quickly into having a biopsy but everything I read about this condition says that this is noncancerous and surgery does nothing for it.  If it were a matter of it being a quick in and out procedure I would say, absolutely I will do it are you crazy?

Waking up was kinda shitty, had a very bad headache which was similar to the headaches I had when I tried medication ([story in my other thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/2f8ofq/diagnosed_with_a_prolactinoma_in_january/), the headaches I had when I took meds were unbearable). Luckily they gave me a shitload of morphine, the pain dissapeared and after a few hours I got off morphine permanently, because I felt good.   \nSo, I've had to stay on the recovery room for 18 hours before going back to my room at the neurosurgery department. When I got back to my room I've noticed that I felt really good, so later that day I went out of my bed slowly.   \nThe headaches/attacks I've had the years before are 95% gone, the \"leftover\" is barely worth noticing (especially because I am used to fucking shitty headaches all day). I can also imagine that the little headaches are still there, because it's just one week after surgery.    \nI have had barely surgery complications: no brain liquor etc. Although I've been pissing alot while I was in the hospital for a week, but apparently that's normal after a pituary gland surgery.    \nSo I've been home since the 20th of October (In the Netherlands you've gotta stay one week in the hospital after surgery) and been feeling great. My hormonelevels are fine and I've haven't felt tired since. Before the surgery I could sleep for 9 hours a day and still feel so damn tired. Now I sleep less and feel really great when I wake up!     \n\nGreetings!    \nEdit: Small update: my t level is still pretty low (I am 22 years old). 11 nmo/l (had 7 before surgery). Normal range is :20 till 39 years old: 9,00 t/m 37,48 nmol/L. I will have an appointment with the endo in 2 weeks, so we'll figure it out.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I've had my surgery last week!", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/2k6uzf/ive_had_my_surgery_last_week/"}, {"author": "PuntAccount", "author_created_utc": 1410921914, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_ifqsb", "created_utc": 1410927952, "domain": "reddit.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/2gmqia/hormone_issues_rbodybuilding/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2gmqia", "is_self": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/2gmqia/hormone_issues_rbodybuilding/", "retrieved_on": 1441167233, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Hormone Issues \u2022 /r/bodybuilding", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/bodybuilding/comments/2gmkg7/hormone_issues/"}, {"author": "StandnIntheFire", "author_created_utc": 1403364517, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_h2njr", "created_utc": 1406388193, "domain": "standninthefire.wordpress.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/2bs802/started_a_new_blog_on_my_experience_with_having_a/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2bs802", "is_self": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 9, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/2bs802/started_a_new_blog_on_my_experience_with_having_a/", "retrieved_on": 1441249931, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "thumbnail": "http://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gUvv-eb-E87Zz3xb.jpg", "title": "Started a new blog on my experience with having a prolactinoma", "url": "http://standninthefire.wordpress.com/"}, {"author": "FreedomGoal", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1403144454, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "edited": 1403469937, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/28im0v/comparing_notes/", "gilded": 0, "id": "28im0v", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/28im0v/comparing_notes/", "retrieved_on": 1441305596, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "My answers in parenthesis:\n\n1.

My prolactin levels were over 1800 at the time I found out. My Endo prescribed me with Dostinex (cabergoline). I will never forget trialing these meds. I only had to take them twice a week, but the evening I did, and the following day after (and onwards), I felt nauseous, dizzy, and constantly tired. I ended up contacting my Endo and asked if there was any other medication for my pretend tumor, because I couldn't cope or adjust with the side effects, even after 4 months. Anyway. He then prescribed me, Norprolac (Quinagolide) .\n\nNorprolac definitely has it's own side effects, though after less than a few weeks, I could function, didn't feel constantly tired or the nausea that I felt Dostinex gave me. \n\nI have been on Norprolac for over 6 years now. I have tried to \"trial\" coming off the medication, though both few times I did my prolactin levels increased really high and I had to go back on them.\n\nLast week, I found out, from my chemist, that Norprolac has been discontinued.\n\nI live in Australia, and have done the only thing I can, which is get my GP to fill out some compassionate form to retrieve the cancelled medication, as there is only a limited amount of stock left. It has been discontinued worldwide (apparently), and I have only 1 month supply.  \nApparently, they (whoever makes these drugs), is trying to bring fourth another version of Norprolac, but! The TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) have not approved it yet, and this could take months, a year, whenver it (or if) it gets approved...\n\nThis post is more of a rant, and I am quite upset and trying to figure out what to do. (My doctor/endo just suggest Dostinex and don't really give a shit).   \n I currently am studying and working, and I dont think right now is the best time for me to trial coming off these meds. I was hoping someone (anyone) on this forum, is going through the same thing? Or have had similar experiences? Or if anyone has come off Norprolac themselves/and would be ok to share how they did it?  \n\n\n:) Thank you", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 565, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help!

Doctor said she couldn't give a good answer to why it happened. I asked whether I needed progesterone supplement after reading some earlier conversations here, and she said that my level was good so there is no need for that.\n\nWe are going to try again, I'm not losing hope and knew that we were in for a long haul.

My trouble all started the day before i was to leave for vacation to Japan. I got the worst migraine I've ever had and proceeded to be violently ill the next few days. My family found that i wasn't getting better and actually getting worse. At some point i thought i had puked so hard my eyes crossed. After hearing that they took me to the doctor as i was yellow and slipping in and out of consciousness.  The doctor seeing me directs us to an emergency room. Long story short i almost died from my kidneys eating my muscle as i was dry heaving. While i'm there they saw my issues with one of my eyes and chalked it up to \"pink eye\". I was discharged and very weak and tired over the next few weeks. We went to my doctor post emergency room to follow up on my eye as it wasn't getting better. They then sent me to a ophthalmologist as i'm not sure they knew what was up.  We went to the ophthalmologist and they put me through a battery of tests with the final being sending me for an MRI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis whole time no one would tell us what they thought it was or could be.  So after the MRI they send us to a neurologist who after seeing the MRI and bloop tests tells us its a tumor and that we will need surgery on it.  They then referred us to surgeon who then explains that the tumor had grown to a size that it affected to my vision and most likely started bleeding, which created the illness to start with. He said vision should come back in my eye (cant see outside peripheral) as eyes are hearty. He also looked at my testosterone and it was like a 6 out of whatever it should, never the less extremely low. He said that this tumor had been there for a while and has messed with a number of hormones. I even had extreme thirst so i was constantly urinating and drinking water. In the end the tumor was 2.1cm x 2.1cm x 1.9cm in size.\n\n  \nSkip to now post surgery and they got all of the tumor. I was in the hospital for 2.5 days. I didn't have the post surgery headaches they thought i would and recovery has been fast so far. The thirst has disappeared as well as the urinating. Next week i see the hormone doctor for the first time. Vision i feel is very slowly coming back, the doctor said it could be 3 months to a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts been a crazy few months, this happened late February of this year.

I always thought I had a multitude of problems that could never be fixed.  I don't get very emotional, but the realization has made me want to cry out of sheer relief.  I've felt something was wrong with me for so long.  *Every* symptom I've had since my mid-teens can be explained by prolactinoma.  I've had neurological issues (frequent migraines/headaches, ***all*** of the vision problems frequently described and ***more***), and hormonal issues (breast tissue development, lactation, fat depositing on my hips/butt and cellulite developing there, lack of muscle and strength, severe depression, severe fatigue).\n\nI'll obviously allow actual professionals to draw their own conclusions and I'll need to go through tests first, but I've been curious about one aspect of this in particular..\n\n***If*** I have prolactinoma, it quite literally may have slowed and halted my puberty, and has left me hanging around the mid-teens in terms of physical maturity.  Other adults frequently ask me why I'm not in school, I see people's eyebrows raise when they realize I was born in '93.  I've even had a bartender deny my ID even when I showed it to them.  I don't look my age \u2014 I look about about 16.\n\nMy other pituitary hormones centers have potentially been restricted for the past 10 years\u2014or even ***longer*** considering that visual effects start when the growth gets large enough to press against the optical nerves and I was experiencing that in my mid-teens.  ***If*** my issue *is* macroprolactinoma and I get help... will these levels shift towards normal?\n\nIf my (essentially adolescent) body was never able to experience these hormones at normal levels, does that mean I'll be experiencing the rest of puberty in my mid 20s?  What would *happen* in a case like mine?\n\nFrom what I understand, acromegaly shows that when HGH is out of whack in fully-grown adults it will result in changes in the forehead/jaw/nose/hands/feet.  Does this mean that I'll experience changes in these areas over the course of a few years once my HGH levels are normal, if they never were able to be?  And that's saying nothing of the mental changes of not being so fatigued and depressed anymore.  Will the testosterone give me facial hair?  Will I stop having so much fat deposited around my hips/butt?\n\nI find the idea of all of it fascinating, and a bit scary.  What if my brain never developed fully?  I don't know who I'll be or what I'll look like if my problem is prolactinoma and I seek treatment.  It'll be like hitting a \"Resume\" button after my body has been stuck on the \"Pause\" button for 10 years.  I've been trying to remember what I was like around 12-13 before everyone remarked that I changed and became so lethargic.  I thought that the lack of vibrancy in the world and lack of energy and feeling like everything is so hard was a normal part of growing up.  I chased poetry and art and music so hard to try to keep *feeling* things.  Everyone used to remark how I used to be so energetic and friendly and full of life, and I remembered it too..  But it's such a distant memory now it feels fake \u2014 like a different person entirely.\n\nI'm doing my best to not jump the gun here \u2014 I'm trying to not get my hopes up.  But is there a chance I might be able to fix my depression and not look like an adolescent anymore?  The quality of my teenage and adult life has been so low that when I thought I might have late stage breast cancer I decided I was fine with the idea that I probably won't make it.

They did an ultrasound and determined that since i\u2019ve been on the birth control pill for so long (8 years), my uterine lining has gradually become very thin, which they could see on the ultrasound, and that was why it was occasionally breaking down mid-cycle.  They weren\u2019t concerned and I went on my way. I have never missed a \u201cperiod\u201d during my non-hormone week. \n\nHowever, she wanted to be extra thorough and ordered a prolactin / blood pregnancy test. My thyroid was normal and pregnancy was negative, but my prolactin level was 45 ng/mL. She referred me to an endocrinologist, who I went to today and am getting another blood test tomorrow. The endocrinologist immediately suggested an MRI to check for tumors, which freaked me out even more than I already was. I\u2019m not on any meds and i have zero of the hallmark symptoms for hyperprolactinemia, so i\u2019m confused and honestly a bit terrified. I know prolactinomas are benign but it\u2019s still freaking me out. \n\nMy question is this: are there any other things, like stress, that are known to cause a slight elevation in prolactin? I had an insanely stressful day at work the day before my blood test with the gyno (and am just very anxious at the doctors office in general). I\u2019m also wondering if 45 ng/mL is something i need to be gravely concerned about? It seems like a lot of hyperprolactinemia patients with prolactinomas are in the hundreds so I\u2019m not sure what to make of this number. \n\nIf i need to get an MRI, i will get it, but wanted to get some opinions/past experiences from this group.  \n\nthank you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 485, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "45ng/mL prolactin, zero symptoms, and not sure what to think.", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557649817, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/bmojdr/45ngml_prolactin_zero_symptoms_and_not_sure_what/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "987654321mre", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1qjrbdg0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1556477614, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/biekps/newly_diagnosed_with_microadenoma/", "gildings": {}, "id": "biekps", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/biekps/newly_diagnosed_with_microadenoma/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1556477615, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hi, just wanted to introduce myself.

Kind of expecting it having to due with my age(lowered testostone) and being overweight; come to find out through a couple of blood labs that i have \"significantly elevated prolactin levels\". 270 IIRC. Doctor told me this is the cause of many of my symptoms and order an MRI to be done to confirm I have a tumor on my pituitary gland.\n\nWhen I got the call for confirmation, I didn't really know how to grasp that I have a tumor in my head, I was kind of scared. Was referred to see a Neurologist and an Endo. The consult wasn't very fruitful with the Neurologist, just a straight forward meeting about what options there are and wanted more blood work to confirm the tumor was producing the prolactin. The doctor was very nice, though. A week later I meet with the Endo thinking it was going to be a similar consult, but this doctor blew my mind. Seem to really care a lot about my condition and gave me a lot of information assured me it's noncancerous and that in most cases this can be dealt with medically through medication. Advised me not to go back to the neurologist as surgery would be unnecessary, and that there is no question the tumor is producing the prolactin. So he order more blood work to get an accurate read on my testosterone levels and he started me on Cabergoline 0.5 mg twice a week; which I took my first pill yesterday. \n\nSo, as I'm sure this probably isn't any different than anyone else's experience.

Eventually testosterone was found to be low at 66ng/dl.\n\nI was referred to endocrinology and additional tests were ordered. Interestingly, I would say I have Not had trouble with libido or ED, which strikes me as odd given the very low T level... \n\nFSH was low, LH and E2 were below testing thresholds. All other hormones were within normal range. Not taking any medications that should effect prolactin. No chronic illnesses. Also, no drugs or supplements etc. \n\nI had a normal puberty and have all expected secondary sexual characteristics. However, my beard grows fairly slowly and does not connect to my mustache. I\u2019ve gained about 50-60lbs over the last 5 years, 20-30 in the last year alone. Went from 190 lbs and fit to 255 and fat.\n\nEndo started me on Dostinex/Cabergoline 0.25mg twice weekly. I\u2019ve only had two doses so far, can\u2019t feel any change yet. Follow up tests are in three months. The doctor wants to hold off on any additional treatment to raise testosterone and see if it will normalize on its own.\n\nThe waiting is killing me, I don\u2019t think other people understand just how crappy I feel.

Recently, I felt like something was off so I got bloodwork just to make sure everything was okay. My hormones and everything are perfect. My health is perfect, except for my prolactin. My levels are not as high as everyone is reporting here, but the doctor is concerned about my level (85), compared to a year ago when it was 26. He has ordered more bloodwork and an MRI. He does not think I have that tumor thing that everyone is talking about (sorry I'm new to all of this so I don't know the terminology), but he is positive that even if he doesn't find anything on the MRI, he wants to put me on the cabergoline to lower my levels anyway, as a precaution. I'm an extremely healthy person who works out 4 times a week, eats a strict vegan diet, and doesn't drink alcohol. But my PCOS makes it very difficult to feel any health benefits, and now that I have to take this medication on top of that with all of the symptoms... lets just say I am terrified.\n\nThe side effects I'm most concerned about: sleeping issues, vertigo, weight gain and mood swings.\n\nWhen I don't get sleep, I can't be productive. I have ADHD already, and I'm scared my learning disorder + lack of sleep + not feeling well is going to make me lose my job. I already struggle to complete all the tasks at my job on a daily basis, so this makes me very nervous. I can't work without a full  night of sleep. It's very difficult for me.\n\nVertigo just freaks me out in general. I had it badly in high school and fell into a depression because of it. Very nervous about that.\n\nDoes the medication cause weight gain or weight loss? I've heard both sides. The weight gain doesn't make me nervous, it just makes me a little sad because, with PCOS, it's very hard to lose weight. It's taken me 3 years of dedication, restriction, and exercise to simply lose 50 pounds. If I gained any of that back, I would be so heartbroken. \n\nAnd mood swings... I have gone to therapy for anxiety and have had bad anxiety attacks in my sleep. I never took medication for it, it was never THAT bad, but it really did effect my every day life. It effects my relationships and whether or not I can function at work. I just had my last appointment with my therapist because after a year, I finally felt okay to be on my own and deal with it on my own. Now, with the threat of mood swings with this medication, I am overwhelmed with that feeling that anxiety is going to take over my life again. \n\nI know I did a lot of rambling here, but basically what I'm saying is, I have no clue how this medication is going to impact me and I'm terrified about the side effects because emotionally, I have never been a strong person. I finally felt like things were going right in my life and that it was only up from here, but now I feel like it's all going down again b/c I have to deal with this prolactin. \n\nDoes it ever end? Will my chances of side effects be lower if I take a lower dose for a shorter period of time? How long does it take to go back to normal? So many questions that no one can answer, not even my doctor.

High levels of prolactin suppresses testosterone (which is why quiting PMO makes peoples voices deeper, beards and body hair grow thicker, and improved musculature)&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Guy 1: &amp;quot;Some of the best benefits are that my voice feels stronger and conversations with people seem so easy&amp;quot;Guy 2: &amp;quot;I think my voice is deeper and sounds less &amp;quot;bothered&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;troubled&amp;quot; and more clear&amp;quot;Guy 3: &amp;quot;On the plus side, my voice is super sexy again I&amp;#39;ve been noticing that around 5-7 days of the reboot my voice always gets extra deep and smooth sounding. Sometimes I talk just to hear myself talk, which is totally not normal for me! &amp;quot;Guy 4: &amp;quot;I notice that my facial hair is growing a bit faster too! Now, I recognise that the amount of facial hair on a man has as much to do with genetics as it has to do with hormones, so I will precede the following with the expression that I do not have a lot of facial hair in general. My moustache, during the times that I&amp;#39;ve tried to grow it in the past, has been wispy at best... This has been a minor source of anxiety in my adult life. Yet, now, after 4 weeks, I find myself needing to trim my moustache every 4 or 5 days, rather than every 2 weeks!&amp;quot;Guy 5: &amp;quot;Since beginning abstinence from PMO around a year ago, my hair line has grown back and my hair is a LOT thicker&amp;quot;Guy 6: &amp;quot;Beard hair is growing really fast. My hair on my head seems to be growing out and my (nonexistent if you ask me, but small if you ask others) bald spot seems to be shrinking&amp;quot;Guy 7: &amp;quot; -muscles on upper body gets really toned after 1 week (no extra exercise!!) &amp;quot;Guy 8: &amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m hitting the weights at the gym a lot harder, and am noticing increasing muscle mass. I weighed 70kg of just light muscle, bone, skin but have put on 2 kg in a week! &amp;quot;Guy 9: &amp;quot; Muscles are sculpted easier. Some of my friends, who also don&amp;#39;t orgasm, swear that they get buffer faster when they don&amp;#39;t ejaculate for long periods of time. It takes less effort to put on muscle. But then again, all of us are around 20-23 years old, so muscle definition will come easily no matter what. That being said, my core is more cut than &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The pituitary gland in your brain overproduces the hormone prolactin.

I've been suffering hairloss for months and it's been hands down the worst experience of my life because of the cause behind it. I talk with so many men and women who say that their endo's will not recognize their hair loss in relation to their tumor, its frustrating! I was found to have a prolactinoma in September and have been on cabergoline since but my hair has kept falling. I have seen all my other symptoms disappear however, hair takes a while. I wasn't sure if the reason was PCOS (as you know prolactinomas can mimic this), or if it was due to high prolactin (which increases testosterone to DHT conversion), low sex hormones (I have both low estrogen and progesterone) or maybe just chronic Telogen Effluvium. Well, after months of research and labs, [I found this study](https://mdedge-files-live.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/files/s3fs-public/issues/articles/media_5840634_ccq50_2-0111.pdf), and it all goes back to the adrenals and mentions prolactin and pituitary tumors. I wanted to share it with you all. It serves as a motivation to never forget your meds, perhaps ask your doc about a low dose of spirnolocatone, and avoid estrogen and BCP as they may contribute to pit tumor development in women with androgen adrenal hyperproduction. I was about to give up all my hard work with stress reduction and nutrition and give into birth control as a treatment for my hormones and I'm glad I haven't. I've finally bought the adrenal supplement my naturopath told me about way before we knew I had a pit tumor. I will update you guys one day if my hair loss stops, but I do see regrowth so that's cool.

Haven't been with anyone in a long time and have had no desire to masturbate. I also recently moved in with my SO. She and I have been together a little over a year and I've been failing at sex. My beard stopped growing as fully and I had no drive. I also reached a plateau in my weight loss. 2 years ago I was at 104 lbs lost, and now I'm at 90. I went to the doctor to get my testosterone checked. It seemed like a reach, but as it turned out, I had really, really low testosterone.

Weekly lab tests and such in the meantime, and another MRI in a month. Also scheduled with ophthalmology for the mass effect on my optic nerve. \n\nThe first few days on Cabergoline I've been nauseated like hell. Hard to eat but when I do eat I feel a bit better. It's hard to teach all day feeling like this but I am too stubborn to take time off. I feel like I'd be failing my students if I couldn't be here for them. \n\nI will be perfectly honest and say I'm really scared. This is a huge prolactinoma, bigger than some of the people on here have mentioned. I'm worried that the medicine won't reduce the size of the tumor. I'm worried that I'll have to have surgery which has a high recurrence risk. I'm worried I'll go blind, or that I'll never be able to function sexually. My SO and I want to have kids together someday and if this doesn't work I don't know what I'd do. \n\nThank you guys for the support. I wish you all the best.

About 3 years ago I experienced my first issues with ED. Had a big WTF moment. Blamed it on porn usage and sexual boredom.\n\n2. Went to my primary care doc, asked for testosterone check and he dismissed this, said it was very unlikely for someone of my age (~36 at the time) to have low T. I trusted his judgement. He sent me off with a script for Cialis.\n\n3. Cialis worked ok, but of course it wasn't really addressing the root cause of the problem. Even after I sort of defeated the whole ED issue, I was having huge problems with delayed ejaculation (basically couldn't achieve orgasm). In retrospect, this is hugely obvious now.\n\n4. Continued to blame this in porn. Some time later joined r/nofap. I eventually got to the point where I was completely fap- and porn-free for 9 months. It did make a huge improvement, but I still was having issues with sexual desire, and still had occasion dysfunction. During that time, my sexual function was so much better that my wife got pregnant (yay!) and we had a baby (YAY!).\n\n5. Ok, we're done with babies. Time to join the V club. I find a urologist and he's a super great guy. We get to talking and I casually mention my ED issues and he's all like WTF you're way too young for that. Checks my T.\n\n6. T is low, waaaay low, like 120. FML. He calls me in, we talk and he suspects not only low T but high prolactin. I have no idea what that is and he tells me. I am mortified.\n\n7. He tests my T again, and it's even **lower** this time at 84! And my prolactin is like 775 (highest he's ever seen). At this point he's surprised I don't have breasts, says I have the T level of an 80-year-old. Decides to halt the vasectomy.\n\n8. SERIOUSLY WFT!??\n\n9. Get an MRI, confirmed macroprolactinoma (~2cm x 2.1cm). I go to a neurosurgeon and have to explain entire history and get my balls examined. They do a blood test and discover my prolactin is even higher (&gt;1000) and my thyroid is super low too - the tumour is blocking thyroid now which is why I'm so damn fat (despite eating carefully and exercise). They say the tumour has probably been growing for at least 5 years, maybe 10.\n\n10. Now on Cabergoline and synthroid. So far side effects are not too bad (minor depression and jitters, etc.).\n\n\nLooking back, even though porn wasn't the root cause of the ED, I'm glad in a way I went through this because I was finally able to get rid of the porn from my life, something I had been trying to do (unsuccessfully) for the last **15 years**.\n\nAlso, I was shocked to learn just how common these are. Seems that 1 in 6 women are suspected to have them and it's not uncommon with men. After some research, it seems that Bisphenol-A (BPA) may have some role in the recent upsurge of these things, as we are all exposed to on a daily basis.\n\nThanks for letting me get this off my chest reddit!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Story in 10 Easy Steps", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/3t183l/my_story_in_10_easy_steps/"}, {"author": "Oliiives", "author_created_utc": 1435518021, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_oegpy", "created_utc": 1443806801, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/3n8yzu/anyones_dick_get_bigger/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3n8yzu", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/3n8yzu/anyones_dick_get_bigger/", "retrieved_on": 1450757329, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Seriously, after about a year of treatment my SO gained about an inch and a half of peen.

This is about the best source about prolactinomes I've found!\n\nThis is my prolactinoma story about 3 weeks after discovery/beginning of treatment:\nI am 30 years old, male. I am from Europe, so some of the units might be different :)\nAbout half a year ago I began noticing issues with my vision. It took quite some time from to get from an optician to a stupid oculist (\"just get new glases\") followed by another optician until I got to an oculist who did a visual field exam (huge deficits on the left eye) and sent me to get a MRI. Right after they took the first few MRI pictures they took me out of the tube just to inject some contrast agent to take better pictures. That was the moment I knew they found something. They told me I have a huge macroprolactinoma (about 22mm x 20mm) which squeezed the optic nerve and caused the vision impact. I was told to go to the hospital the next day to get my hormones checked and plan the next steps. In the hospital they did a blood test and my prolactin level was about 2000 \u00b5g/l. They immediately kept me in the endocrinology ward of the big university hospital, not even giving me time to get my clothes and stuff from home.\nThey started with 0.5mg cabergoline every evening (told me to take it right before sleep to not suffer from the side effects). Three days later the prolactin level was down to 150 \u00b5g/l. After 5 days I got out of the hospital and they decided to get down to 0.5mg cabergoline every two days. During about a week after beginning the treatment I had mild headaches several times a day, but not even enough to get any painkiller. Afterwards no headaches at all. About 2 weeks after beginning the treatment my vision already improved a lot. A visual field exam a few days ago confirmed that. Didn't notice any other side effects, just some pain in my left chest, not sure whether chest or heart. After two electrocardiograms they say everything is fine, but I will get an echocardiograph just to be sure (I've read a lot about side effects of cabergoline on the heart). Next week I will see an endocrinologist outside of the hospital for the long term stuff.\n\nIn this subreddit it looks like the focus is on testosterone and weight, until now my focus was my vision :) My testosterone level is 1.93 \u00b5g/l (reference values 2.18 \u00b5g/l - 9.06 \u00b5g/l). In the hospital they grabbed my balls to inspect the volume and everything was fine, they said my testosterone is just a bit low, nothing too worrisome.\nNow reading about the symptoms of a prolactinome I notice many things I guess I can contribute to it: In the last few years I've had a short (few seconds) but stabbing pain in my head when I got frightened or embarrassed (once every week or two). When I rode with my bike over cobblestone I had an unpleasant feeling in my head due to the vibration as well. Seems like those issues are gone already.\nI've never had much facial hair (last year I didn't shave for 3 weeks and all I got was about 1 cm of a light mustache and chin-beard). Otherwise puperty went normal, I am tall and got normal pubic hair. Haven't had a girlfriend for 10 years and not that much libido either, I guess. About 8-10 years ago I gained some 20kg of weight which I lost about 3-4 years back with a strict diet, since then I have a constant BMI of 23 which is OK, although it would be great to loose some 5kg more (especially to get rid of my tummy). I appear very young, often people think I am 18 instead of 30.  Now with cabergoline I notice better digestion, before I would only defecate about 2-3 times a week, now daily. In the endocrinology ward I met a guy who was there because he drinks way too much water. I do drink about 4-5 liters a day as well, maybe that can also be related to the pituitary gland. Since I can remember I've always had low energy/being lazy and noncompetitive.\n\nHopefully this story helps someone after getting the shocking diagnosis. I am quite happy I finally got the diagnosis and the treatment and I am looking forward to the future!\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My story 3 weeks after discovery/beginning of treatment", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/3ehzi3/my_story_3_weeks_after_discoverybeginning_of/"}, {"author": "Duck-Hunter", "author_created_utc": 1360298864, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_aipws", "created_utc": 1434955358, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/3aopcj/seeking_advice/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3aopcj", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 7, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/3aopcj/seeking_advice/", "retrieved_on": 1440655948, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I have a prolactinoma.

I was also pretty old and had little to no facial hair (a rarity if you looked at my family genetics). \nit really hit that something was wrong when I started working out (from nothing) 5 times a week and saw little to no weight loss after 4 months.  a friend finally convinced me to get a blood test\n My testosterone was astonishingly low and lh and fsh were in the low range as well.\n\nI guess my question is, how long on cabergoline before you guys started to see an increase in your t levels.\n\nother info: my prolactin levels started up around 10x the average it had since gone down to around 2x higher...but none of the other hormones have changed\n\nany help would be appreciated", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "male 27, recently diagnosed", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/2yn7he/male_27_recently_diagnosed/"}, {"author": "witzowitz", "author_created_utc": 1345828418, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_8rwte", "created_utc": 1422385031, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/2tvb4b/29_years_old_recently_diagnosed_male/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2tvb4b", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/2tvb4b/29_years_old_recently_diagnosed_male/", "retrieved_on": 1440942036, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hello everyone, it's so great to see that other people are sharing their experiences here, it's reassuring to read some of the outcomes people have reported.

That prompted an MRI that revealed a 3mm microadenoma. I was tested a month later, and had a prolactin level of 55. A month after that it had dropped to 27, and a few days I was tested and it had fallen all the way to 16. I was very confused by this, having no idea why it had fallen so low without treatment. \n\nMy elevated prolactin was also causing low testosterone for someone my age, around 390. I was looking into ways to boost it naturally and just learned that sunlight can boost it by up to 200%. I've worked a night shift and sleep during the day, so I haven't really gotten much sunlight for about 5 years, so I bought a vitamin D light from Amazon. I also have been eating vitamin D supplements, starting around when my prolactin started to drop (though I've only just made the connection).\n\nI shined the light on my neck, torso, and testicles for about 15 minutes total and noticed a huge improvement to my mood almost immediately. For years I've been having problems with mild ED and delayed orgasm, and after shining the light on my balls I had the best orgasm I've had in years. \n\nI think it's safe to assume that I was suffering from vitamin D deficiency, which can cause elevated prolactin. The question is, did having elevated prolactin for years cause my microadenoma, or was it a red herring all along? 20-30% of people have microadenomas, and the vast majority of them don't secrete prolactin. If my prolactin remains low, is it still worth taking caber for a few years to shrink my microadenoma? I also have high TSH (5.5) so it's possible that the microadenoma is causing hypothyroidism. I'm really curious whether years of elevated prolactin caused my microadenoma to grow, or if it was always there, and my elevated prolactin is unrelated. Is it possible that my microadenoma could shrink on its own if my prolactin stays low? \n\nObviously this won't apply to everyone, but if you think you might be suffering from vitamin D deficiency, it's definitely worth looking into. After ~3 weeks of vitamin D supplements and 15 minutes of exposure to a vitamin D light my prolactin has dropped from 55 to 16 and I feel like a new man.

In the past month my PRL has dropped from 45 to 17 and the brain fog has been lifting a little more everyday.  Have felt particularly clearheaded the last 4 days or so until last night.  \n\nLast night I drank two Fiddleheads, a hazy IPA style of beer.  About 90 minutes in, I hit a wall and was mentally exhausted and had major word finding problems and was losing my train of thought mid sentence.  This was disproportionate to the amount of alcohol I'd had and I didn't feel drunk as much as mentally exhausted.  Actually, I didn't even finish the second one.  I like hazy IPA's but usually avoid them because I always felt like they get me way too drunk way too fast.\n\nTurns out that one of the things that makes a beer hazy is a polysaccharide called Beta Glucan.  In clear beers, the Beta Glucan has either been changed by an enzyme or settled out or filtered out.  9All or some of it filtered, I have no idea.)\n\nGuess what Beta Glucan does?  It increases prolactin.  By how much,?  How quickly?  Well, I don't have access to the lancet article, but regarding increased PRL in general, another website said this referencing the Lancet:   **Prolactin levels peaked at 30 minutes in all of the women, regardless of the fluid they consumed. However, the rise in prolactin level was significantly larger (p &lt; 0.005) after the women consumed beer (27.1 +/- 13.7 ng/mL) compared to water (12.6 ng/mL +/- 4.1) or water with 6% ethanol (12 ng/mL +/- 2.2).**  ( If any students or academics or whoever have access to the lancet, I'd love to see the whole article.  - Prolactin secretion after beer. Lancet 1981 Oct 24;2(8252):934. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(81)91422-7.)  I wish I knew what the prebeer average PRL was also how long prolactin remained elevated.  I know my brain was still foggy this AM, but feels like its mostly cleared up now,\n\nThe thing in beer that increases PRL is not the alcohol, it's the polysaccharides.    And, I don't know by how much, but since it's Polysaccarides that make a beer hazy, that amount must be higher in hazy beers than clear beers.  \n\nAlso, interestingly, from another study, the higher your PRL levels, the drunker you feel.\n\nSo, if Hazy makes you Crazy, now you know why.  Which seriously blows, because they are delicious.  However, based on what I've learned today, I think I'm going to mostly take a pass on beer from now on and certainly avoid any hazy varieties.\n\nCheers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1943, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hazy IPA makes me crazy, now I know why", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/s8sjne/hazy_ipa_makes_me_crazy_now_i_know_why/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "HELPPPPPPPPPPPPPPqP", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3w3x592p", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642637436, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/s84tbd/can_i_take_mucinexdm_12_hour_with_cabergoline/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s84tbd", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/s84tbd/can_i_take_mucinexdm_12_hour_with_cabergoline/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642637446, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1942, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can I take MucinexDM 12 hour with cabergoline?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/s84tbd/can_i_take_mucinexdm_12_hour_with_cabergoline/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "zigzagers", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_i1sip49l", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642622189, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/s7yw74/whats_your_schedule_for_taking_cabergoline/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s7yw74", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/s7yw74/whats_your_schedule_for_taking_cabergoline/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642622199, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just started taking Cab 0.25mg twice a week for elevated Prolactin levels.

am a 24 year old male on no medication and in decent shape. So this medical journey started with ED and small gynecomastia. Last week they found a 3-4mm microadenoma. I believe my problems are caused by my elevated prolactin however, the doctors say this does not make much sense due to my high test (normally I tend more towards 10ng/ml, this test was done around 11:00 with bad sleep). They mostly dismiss my prolactin since it is not greatly elevated. Often they tell me its stress related and say that the microadenoma shouldn't cause any problems. \n\nOn another test they included estradiol which came out at 44 pg/ml (8.1 - 49.5). Also my progesterone came back at 0.29 which was considered very high on this test but on other lab result they write a reference range of 0.1-1.00. DHT came back at 1.51 ug/l (0.25-0.99).\n\nSo my question is, do you think prolactin is causing me these problems, do you think the 3mm adenoma is the cause and might it be a prolactinoma?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1938, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/oZZlfoY03KGw00gmNmJ6d7b_Ah36RtAHIiHo4PlcvAg.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 48, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Microadenoma - Prolactinoma?

30yo male. For about a year I\u2019ve had high prolactin and worsening symptoms. Had non existent free test so started trt around that time. Still kept feeling worse. \nFast forward &amp; Prolactin was still high again a few weeks back. so finally I was able to convince them to order an mri. \nIt concluded a small cyst or possible tumor on the pituitary gland. Just had an endo apt with a random one to try making it in a reasonable time frame. \n\nBasically I was told it\u2019s too small to cause any symptoms. That the prolactin isn\u2019t high enough to make a difference in anything. \nOh, and that the crazy low testosterone was probably just not tested properly.. based off my age and being fit (Even though I lost about 10-15lbs of muscle in a year) .. must had just been coincidence \ud83d\ude44\n\nI get that it\u2019s not a huge tumor, but when prolactin is over 5-10x the normal range along with other hormonal issues &amp; symptoms, it just seems too evident to not be negatively doing something.\nThey basically said that it\u2019s not the cause of any symptoms. That they have patients with levels at 10,000 without symptoms. &amp; that most of the time people never even know with no symptoms, and most pituitary tumors aren\u2019t even discovered until the autopsy after they die.. so yeah off to a great start.\nThey reluctantly gave me the option to get cab anyway, said it probably won\u2019t do anything since the levels aren\u2019t high enough &amp; it\u2019s not a big enough tumor. \n\nAssuming I should probably seek another specialist, yeah? I mean, comparing levels of other patients and what they\u2019re personally experiencing is ridiculous in general. I asked to get the script anyway,\nI\u2019ll just have to decide if it\u2019s worth taking. I\u2019ve been feeling horrible 24/7. I sleep like every other night, all I feel is stress. I get tremors/twitches from any stressful thought. I lost a lot of hair just this past year. Randomly developed degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis, also developed some labral tears. High blood pressure despite being very active prior to all this. Always in pain in my joints and everywhere. My feet become swollen and it seems like diabetic type symptoms. My skin is uncomfortably dry if that matters. Debilitating depression and anxiety. Feeling of disassociation, etc etc. \nThis is just to name a few of many. \n\nIdk.. it is a small legion or whatever. Has anyone here experienced these kind of things with just a tiny pituitary legion? Is it worth just trying the cab? I\u2019m already so fatigued and emotionless, that I\u2019m worried about it making it worse or something.\nApologies for the longer post.

I've got more in 4 weeks time but I know they'll be high again as this has been for the last 10 years so another month isn't going to make a difference lol.\n\nAfter researching this I came across the possibility of a prolactinoma. I researched the symptoms and I match almost all of them except the leaky breasts. I've never had a sex drive, irregular periods, can't seem to lose weight no matter what I do etc. \n\nMy question is I know 54 is high but is it high enough to be a prolactinoma? I don't take any drugs, am not stressed etc which are all factors that could cause high prolactin levels. \n\nI'm tempted to get a private MRI scan to see before my repeat blood tests so that if it's there I can start treatment asap and maybe finally live like a normal young adult! \n\nWhat do you think?

I'm a 19 yo woman from Mexico, I've been on feminizing hrt for about 2 months taking 5 mg estradiol cypionate and 25 mg of medroxyprogesterone via injections weekly. Before starting my hormone treatment I used to have high prolactin (I really don't remember the exact number, but pretty sure it was between 22-29 Ng/ml, which is a bit above the male range, which was still used for me at the moment. ) , but my doctor said it was likely that it was caused by stress and didn't order any further investigation. \n\nNow, yesterday was my 2.5 months follow up blood test and everything seemed kind of normal, except my prolactin levels. I was in range for estradiol in females and in the lower end of testosterone for females. My prolactin was at a ridiculously 94 Ng/ml level, almost 4 times above the female range. \n\nTalking to a doctor yesterday I was kind of relieved since she told me that it was most likely due to my medication (high dosages of estradiol seem to raise it?), so, it would be a drug related hyperprolactinemia, but I'm also waiting for my actual doctor's opinion. Also, idk, 94 seems like a really high number, idk how much it could be related to my prescription since it is really close to 100 Ng/ml which basically is diagnostic for prolactinoma. \n\nI'd also like to say that I have basically no symptoms, no weight gain, no galactorrhea, no visual problems aside from my astigmatism and no headaches. I've had obvious breast growth in the past two months, but I'm pretty sure it's most likely explained by my estrogen therapy. \n \nSo, my questions are: how dangerous is it to have a prolactinoma? Is it really expensive to treat? (if it's expensive I'll have to get into the government's hospitals, and it will take a long time) Can it become malignant if I don't get to treat it right away? And the most important: will I have to stop my estrogen therapy if I get diagnosed? I can't imagine a worst nightmare than returning to my male body, it causes me horrible depression and anxiety, even suicidal thoughts.\n\nThank you so much", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1889, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Lots of doubts, transgender woman on medication dealing with high prolactin levels", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/rt4zk2/lots_of_doubts_transgender_woman_on_medication/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tajajenay", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3fjnjhho", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1640886473, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/rs7k0i/small_cysts_within_the_hypophysis_part_of_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rs7k0i", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/rs7k0i/small_cysts_within_the_hypophysis_part_of_the/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1640886484, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone. \n\nSo I got blood tests done a month ago and my prolactin was a bit high (it was 28 and the range is 3-23).

Last year, I went through a very stressful time. I was put on antidepressants, but they did not help me. I had developed a dissociative disorder (DP/DR), anxiety, panic attacks, brain fog etc which is why they put me on the antidepressants. \n\nI had also stopped taking the combined birth control pill before this. I\u2019d been taking it 6 years before this, and had no problems. I was off the pill and struggling with these issues for ages, constantly being told I was mentally ill and this is my life now. It wasn\u2019t until I told my GP that I hadn\u2019t had a period for over a year since stopping the pill, and that I was lactating despite never having children, that they ran some tests. My prolactin was at 939mu/L. My GP recommended I go back on the pill and see what happened. So I went back on the pill, and immediately started to feel better. The dissociative issues went away. I could think clearly again\u2026 I moved on with my life.

Despite eating well (I gave up sugar a decade ago), and doing quite a bit of exercise (I go to the gym three times per week, and hike on weekends), I can't seem to lose weight.  I thought perhaps with the combination and low sex drive that I maybe had low testosterone. So I paid a private lab for a full hormone panel.\n\nMy testosterone was sort of in the middle, and my thyroid hormones seemed ok.  The only real red flag (literally) was my prolactin, which was outside of the range, but not hugely.\n\nIs it possible that this is the  cause of my inability to lose weight and low libido?

even a settlement exists for male patients who experienced breast growth. i was on this medication for about 1.5 years, until i became an adult and quit it against all medical advice. needless to say, the medication did nothing for me because i didn't need to be \"fixed\", and i consider what happened to me flagrant medical malpractice.\n\nthis medication caused me to begin lactating (also caused fast weight gain, ect), and the lactation just..never stopped. all other side effects ceased after i got off it. \\~6 years have passed since then. i found out that i have a small pituitary tumour nearer to when i ceased taking the medication, but because of my trauma surrounding medical abuse (i could not have possibly consented to that medication nor the effects it had on me! i was not informed!), i refused treatment. i became very focused on health/wellness/fitness and have thrived in many ways.\n\ni am averse to any and all medications. i'm very healthy compared to most folks i know. and the lactation is subtle- almost not at all, but if i squeeze my nipples a very very small droplet of milk might be secreted, and then if i do that many days in a row the quantity will increase bit by bit. so i just avoid stimulating the area. i don't leak.\n\ni do have, at present, a few other small things that may hint my hormones are off-balance. so a summary:\n\n* low level, mild lactation\n* somewhat painful cramping during the first day of my menstrual cycle, which i minimize through folk medicine (crampbark and raspberry leaf teas harvested myself)\n* sometimes vaguely low energy if i haven't kept up a good sleep schedule, or if i've slacked in my exercise activities i might be quick to have mood drops\n* i have low libido but still can get in the mood when my partner initiates\n\nit's difficult for me to discern how many of these could be attributed to the hormones vs other lifestyle/environmental/dietary factors. i am going to try going to get my hormones checked out. last time i did, (about 5 years ago), i think my TSH levels were high (?) along with my prolactin level (which was on the precipice of high end of normal/too high). HOWEVER, i got a nutrient test done alongside this, and came back with mild-moderate deficiencies in iodine, zinc, and vitamin D.. all rooted in poor dietary balance.. i do better with nutrition now, but imagine i may still struggle with periodic mild deficiencies due to seasonal dietary changes. these are all nutrients linked to endocrine health and hormone production/regulation, yeah? so not sure how much might be rooted in diet opposed to a pituitary tumour.\n\ncompared to most people, i believe i am very healthy. i don't take birth control, or any other medications. so i feel like my lifestyle overall mitigates all of my potential symptoms..\n\nmy questions:\n\n1. should i get this checked out again? is treatment necessary, if it probably isn't growing?\n2. is there any possibility that these tumours might *shrink* on their own?\n3. if i were to seek treatment, what medication(s) would i likely be prescribed, and for how long? i would like to independently research them and learn how they actually effect change in the body.\n\nthanks", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1867, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "seeking a little advice re: medical abuse, prolactinoma, &amp; treatments", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/rkuwah/seeking_a_little_advice_re_medical_abuse/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "shards_of_sanity", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_930qon5p", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1640018186, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/rkrags/cabergoline_vs_bromocriptine/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rkrags", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/rkrags/cabergoline_vs_bromocriptine/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1640018196, "score": 1, "selftext": "Has anyone had experience with both?

Any advice you all have would be so appreciated. \ud83d\udc9b", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1037, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cabergoline and Zoloft?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/jo9gdy/cabergoline_and_zoloft/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Xtroverted-Introvert", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8jx1r0iw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1604423939, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/jneesa/my_mri_came_back_i_have_a_tumor_its_bleeding/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jneesa", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/jneesa/my_mri_came_back_i_have_a_tumor_its_bleeding/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1604423950, "score": 1, "selftext": "I got the phone call this morning. 7mm pituitary microadenoma confirmed by an MRI.

I have my MRI in a month, could this be a tumour? \n\nAny insight for a total newbie is really appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1025, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Swelling", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/jkf06e/swelling/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ellydon7717", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_57ri7wxy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1603979714, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/jkag7y/hi_new_here/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jkag7y", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/jkag7y/hi_new_here/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1603979725, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have been tested and confirmed that my prolactin levels are elevated and I'm almost positive that I think I have a tumor because after researching, I have been experiencing the symptoms of headaches and mild blurry vision.

My symptoms include male breast development, male lactation, delayed puberty, extremely slow-progressing puberty, and a lot of other oddities that all fit prolactinoma.  My testosterone was checked and was on the low side of normal, my prolactin was on the high end of normal.  My doctor wanted me to see an endocrinologist but I\u2019d looked at my results and went: \u201cThere\u2019s no way I have prolactinoma if this test came back anywhere within the normal range.  I must just be experiencing weird symptoms because I\u2019m fat.\u201d\n\nSo I did what no one should do: I was having a rough mental health patch and I cancelled my endocrinologist appointment figuring it wasn\u2019t too important anyway and that they\u2019d just tell me to lose weight.  I\u2019d entirely convinced myself I was being a hypochondriac (which I can absolutely be) and that I was exaggerating.  I felt ashamed and full of self doubt.  Since then I lost about 40 lbs through diet/exercis and the lactation is still there.  I\u2019m still 30 lbs overweight, but the fact that the symptoms haven\u2019t been going away started to scared me.  I brought it up with my doctor last month and she told me I should see an endocrinologist, so off I go for real this time.  I also got a mammogram and was told I have a very peculiar amount of breast development for a man and that I really should be seeing an endocrinologist.\n\nThe endocrinology appointment was yesterday and when I described everything he told me it sounds like a prolactinoma.  I surprised him with how much I know about them (and other medical things, I do a lot of reading) and even pointed out my prolactin levels were within the normal range, then he hits me with a curveball and tells me about the Hook Effect \u2014 where you can have a *lot* of prolactin in your system and it only registers as having a normal-to-slightly-elevated amount if you don\u2019t do the tests the right way.....  *That* was entirely new to me.  I had no idea that was a thing.  Apparently my tests weren\u2019t done the right way.\n\nSo I learned the test I\u2019d had essentially told me nothing about my real prolactin levels (Although it did at least let me know that my pituitary function was normal-ish otherwise!) and that I could be sitting here with a giant prolactinoma in my skull.  It\u2019d explain why I slowly lost my sense of smell at 17-18 and the horrible migraines I was having at 16-17 where I had to be sent home multiple times.  (I\u2019m 27 and I still get headaches, just not as bad usually.)\n\nMy next blood test is in a few hours and I\u2019m feeling like a moron.  If I can put this out there and help convince someone else that they aren\u2019t as smart as they think they are and that they really need to see someone who spent *years* learning about something for this exact type of reason, instead of trying to determine if they have one themselves?  Then airing out my shame will be worth it.\n\nListen to your doctors, if you know something is wrong get it checked out instead of just accepting it and hoping it\u2019ll go away.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 909, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I was dumb and potentially delayed diagnosis by an entire year, don\u2019t be me.

This all started 4 years ago (I'm assuming that's when the tumor started developing) and my depression got insanely bad for two years but for the past year I've managed to control it mentally and I started becoming a bit happier and just content with my life in general, even though I knew that depression was lurking in the background. \n\nI was officially diagnosed with prolactinoma at the end of Feb and finally got to talk to my doctor in June. She recommended cabergoline as I suspected and I started taking it shortly afterwards. About two weeks after I started taking it, I started experiencing bad side effects. My depression is back with a vengeance and it's spiralling out of control. Some days are so bad that I can barely get a word out if I'm on the phone, it's just exhausting. I'm experiencing worse physical and mental fatigue, and brain fog. It's honestly been hell for the last month and a half and I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience. Does it get better over time or should I expect it to stay like this as long as I'm taking the medicine? \n\nIt's odd that most ppl say they're feeling much better and have more energy. It's exactly the opposite of what I'm experiencing. \nAlso, I'm a bit embarrassed to say this but I've also been having real back constipation. I only use the bathroom once a week now. Been like this for a month now. Just wondering if others have experienced this as well. If so, what did you do to alleviate the problem? Laxatives or some high fiber food source? \n\nI apologize for the long message. This is literally my first post on reddit. Hopefully I can get some helpful answers.

Here are the results (free testosterone is going to come a week later from now);\n\nTriglyceride -  65 mg/dl (60 - 150)\n\nTSH -  1,71 \u00b5IU/ml (0,27 - 4,2)\n\nGlucose - 84 mg/dl (75 - 110)\n\nLDL -  78,3 mg/dl (60 - 130)\n\n*Prolactin (PRL) -  20,94 ng/ml (3,46 - 19,4)\n\nCholesterol (Total) -  149 mg/dl (50 - 200)\n\nTestosterone (Total) -  14,87 nmol/L (1,63 - 34)\n\n\nHe said not to worry but if I want he can start me on 0.5 mg dostinex 2 times per week, which he does not see necerssary. I am kind of scared from reading the side effects. What are your thoughts?\n\nThank you all in advance.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 877, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Decreased erection quality for the past few months.

New to this sub and posting on mobile so please excuse any errors. I (28f) was diagnosed with prolactinoma about a month and a half ago. I had/have a slew of symptoms with my prolactin levels being over 40 and my testosterone being almost 70.  They aren\u2019t sure the testosterone issue has to do with this specifically, but think because I ignored symptoms for so long, it caused other issues which we will treat after. They started me on bromocriptine nearly immediately, which is why I am coming here.\n   I feel like I\u2019m in a nightmare on this medication. I can\u2019t eat, sleep, or even speak properly. I have been slurring my words or stuttering pretty severely. I am patient facing at work and it\u2019s definitely noticed. I have slight visual hallucinations with words/letters moving around or with light flares (not sure how to describe these properly). I can no longer exercise due to exhaustion and dizziness. I am also still lactating after a month and a half. I have called my doctor about this multiple times and they keep saying \u201cjust try it another week.\u201d They\u2019ve said this three times now and, while I have not gotten any worse, I haven\u2019t gotten any better. I cannot continue to live like this but everything I\u2019ve read on it says to not stop taking it suddenly.\n    I guess I\u2019m just looking to see if anyone else has been on this medication and has had similar issues or if anyone has any advice?\nTL;DR: The medication they have me on seems to be messing me up worse but they won\u2019t take me off of it.

I ended up getting a bleach job before I knew that I had a tumor- and let\u2019s just say, things got a million times worse. My hair was coming out in clumps. My boyfriend and my parents started noticing. This went on for months and my hair got extremely thin. It made me very self conscious. For a 20 year old female with a brain tumor, it\u2019s a pretty upsetting place to be. One day I decided that I was at my wits end, so I did a bunch of research and I ordered a lot of products. I\u2019m not a brand ambassador (if I was, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019d be promoting it here), and I don\u2019t know if it will work for everyone... but I found something that worked for me. I know that having a prolactinoma can be very stressful and I wish that someone had recommended this to me in the beginning. The product that I found has five different types of hair growth stimulators (so if one doesn\u2019t work for you, the other four might). I almost thought about going on midoxinil or rogain because it had gotten that bad. However, I knew that those more intense chemicals came with many risks (such as progressing the rate of hair loss at an even faster pace before it possibly may/may not work)... that\u2019s why I tried these chemicals first. I\u2019m glad they worked and I didn\u2019t have to try the harsher chemicals. The product is called *Curlsmith Density Elixir* (even if you don\u2019t have curly/wavy hair you can use it). I also just bought their *scalp stimulating booster* to see if it works. I heard that you\u2019re supposed to use both in combination, but I only used the elixir and it seemed to work amazingly. Instead of a hairbrush full of clumps, I\u2019ve probably had 5-8 hairs fall out whenever I brush my hair. I notice a big difference on the days that I don\u2019t use it, and the longer I don\u2019t use it the more hair I lose (in other words, it starts going back to the normal amount that I lost due to my tumor). I wonder if it\u2019s strong enough to also work on radiation patients. I thought I\u2019d share because this is something that really helped me, and I know it could be good for others as well.

It started after my bf and I binged on greasy food and smoked a ton of weed. The day after that happened, I started to get what I can only describe as a tightness around my chest, abdomen, and back, with some pains. I went to the ER and they said I had IBS. My stomach was apparently overactive and they gave me meds for stomach spasms. I didn\u2019t feel better and the next day I was back in the ER. The ER did a CT scan and found a cyst in my left ovary (I get these a lot) and inflammation in the lower lining of my lungs. They gave me meds for my lungs but my primary doc said I did not need to take them because I had no wheezing, no fever, and my lungs sounded fine. I also noticed that the CT saw a cyst in my liver that I was never told about. I told my doc and he said it was so tiny that he wasn\u2019t concerned. After that, I had an abdominal ultrasound and the cyst could not be seen. Instead, I was told I had a gallstone. I followed up and was told I didn\u2019t need surgery to remove my gallbladder, however. My gastroenterologist diagnosed me with gastritis. My ENT said I have silent reflux. My endocrinologist found my prolactin very high and a sex hormone low, so he wants me to get a brain MRI to see if I have a prolactinoma. I am also awaiting results of a HIDA scan this week for my gallbladder and liver. In addition, I have been going to electro stimulation therapy for herniated neck discs. My rheumatologist said I have fibromyalgia and a Vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, my rheumatoid arthritis factor is rather high but not \u201cconcerningly\u201d high. Some of the symptoms I\u2019ve had include muscle twitches/cramps, bloating, random abdominal pains, bones cracking a lot, joint pain, swollen legs and feet, visual disturbances/blurry/double vision, heat sensitivity, cold sensitivity, fatigue, trouble sleeping, night sweats, reflux, fluctuating bowel movements, back pain, sinus issues, allergies, headaches, dizziness, skin changes like darker skin colors or red areas/spots after showers, ear ringing/clogging, heart palpitations, mood swings, bouts of crying. I take Effexor, Trifluoperazine, and Clonazepam as needed for anxiety and depression. I also take Pepcid and Vitamin D. Occasionally, I take CBD. I go to talk therapy. I have seen an alt medicine doctor, a chiropractor,  and I\u2019ve participated in reiki circles. I try to exercise to some degree but I haven\u2019t been back to my normal exercising regimen since November. I also lost weight fairly quickly and I\u2019m trying to gain now. My weight fluctuates. I have cut out beef, chicken, dairy, and now gluten. I have had normal EKGs and tested negative for H Pylori. I know nobody on here can diagnose but, thoughts? Hopefully I will have my MRI soon but my endocrinologist seems to think I definitely have a prolactinoma. Do others agree?

I've been reading everyone else's posts for a while and wanted some advice/help if possible. I've been experiencing a lot of problems for around 7-8 months: headaches, night sweats, absolutely zero libido (absolutely not normal for me!), brain fog, memory issues, numbness/tingling in hands and legs/toes, cold extremities, depression, recurring sinus problems,bald patches in my facial hair, unexpected weight gain around my abdomen, inability to gain muscle/loss of 'current' muscle amongst various other things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeen to the doctors SEVERAL times and feel I've been fobbed off with just depression, she's said that my complete loss of sex drive/libido is just because I'm depressed and my immune system has taken a battering because I've been depressed. Ive asked for blood tests on several occasions as I know all of the above is not normal for me - she finally gave in and asked for various things - thyroid, testosterone, prolactin and a full blood count, the figures all came back relatively normal. I decided to have some private blood tests done as I've known something just isn't right in my body. The results have come back and my prolactin levels are 1044 mU/L and cortisol is 587 nmol/l.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust for reference, the reference levels of prolactin on this report are as follows:\n\nNormal: 86-324\n\nBorderline high: 324-333\n\nHigh: Above 333\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCortisol levels reference range:\n\nNormal: 166-507\n\nBorderline high: 507-557\n\nHigh: 557 and above\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy question is, were your levels of prolactin anything like mine and what did you do about it? I have an aunt who currently has a prolactinoma and her levels were around the same as mine - she's on cabergoline and steroids to try and shrink the tumour. She said all her symptoms have pretty much returned to normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long winded post, but I have really felt like I've been banging my head against a brick wall with this.

My periods had been quite erratic for a while and then became non-existent for 4-5 months. My mood had been all over the place but I put it down to grieving. I had had issues with spontaneous lactation for at least 7+ years (after an abortion) but never mentioned it to any doctors as I thought this was normal. There were other issues which align with prolactinoma which made me suspect it might be pituitary gland related. GP (I'm in the UK) sent me through to endocrinology after blood tests and Endo only mentioned that my prolactin levels were rather elevated and requested an MRI. Got put on 0.5 mg Cabergoline. At follow up was told that nothing could be seen on MRI scan (if there is a prolactinoma it might be very small still) but a Prolactinoma had been suspected as my prolactin levels were at **4300 ng/mL** in September, at 3700 ng/ml in October and in January at 13 ng/mL. He also told me normal levels are &lt;20. Considering that **4300 ng/mL** is more than 4000 times of what is considered normal I thought Endo could give me more info on how this might have affected my mood (I felt really crazy when I first went to the docs) and other aspects of my health. He wasn't really able to tell me if and how this very high prolactin level could've affected me bar the missing periods. This really frustrated me as I felt like he doesn't really know.\n\nAs mentioned above my prolactin is at a good level now, I am feeling much better, got my periods back, am losing weight (have lost almost 5kgs in 5 months or so and I feel like I'm still losing) but of course I am worried that this might be an ongoing issue. I am also hypothyroid and have alwasy been quite rubbish at taking my meds (much better now as I've read that hypothyroidism may cause high prolactin?) but I am still annoyed that all the info I am finding is quite disjointed and rather vague.\n\nI guess I am interested in others who have had really high prolactin levels and are hypothyroid and how they felt this might have affected them.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 718, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do Endocrinologists actually know what they are treating?

I really appreciate it, I\u2019m terrified. \n\nI am (26F) I have had menstrual issues from the beginning at 13. My mother started taking me to Doctors then as my periods were irregular and my nipples were extremely swollen. Doctors said \u201cshe\u2019s just started, it will regulate\u201d. It didn\u2019t. \n\nI was diagnosed as PCOS and anovulatory cycles with anxiety and depression at 18. They would just give me something to start my period if I didn\u2019t menstruate for more than 90 days. \n\nFrom there about 5/6 years ago things just went back to normal and another GP said the PCOS was misdiagnosed. I\u2019m not overweight, no excessive hair, no acne, no signs and normal fertility. Even fell pregnant but didn\u2019t have the baby as I was too young and it was unplanned (please don\u2019t judge me). 2-3 years ago I started having irregular/not present cycles again with extreme fatigue, bladder issues (not being able to urinate) and kidney infections. \n\nI also noticed my left eye was not straight but pointing inward from photos and people telling me so with severe fatigue and headaches. I went to an optometrist and he confirmed I had vision loss in my left eye but only peripherally and the nerves in my right eye had taken over for the left.\n\nI have also always had extremely sore breasts but over the past year they\u2019re a lot worse, heavy, and my nipples have again swollen. Also very veiny. Not pregnant. \n\nI had a head injury to the back of the head in December 2019 and the following day presented at emergency with slurred speech, memory loss, blurred vision and headaches which they attributed to post concussion syndrome as a CT scan showed no bleeding or stroke but the symptoms haven\u2019t improved. \n\n23 January 2020 I was in crippling pain in my lower right abdomen and went to emergency. I had an ultrasound and they confirmed a corpus luteum hemorrhagic cyst with mild internal pelvic bleeding and my right ovary was 32cc which \u201cshould have dissolved itself\u201d. The clinical team also reported absenteeism seizures. 25 January 2020 I re-presented and underwent emergency surgery for a cystectomy. Doctors not concerned as they did biopsy and no cancer (I am positive for BRAC1 or 2 can\u2019t remember which one was tested positive as my Mother passed from Breast Cancer).\n\nUnknown to me in December 2019 my general practitioner ordered prolactin bloods (I need to read things more) and they were elevated at 3230ng/100ml. Oestrogen also off.  She since took personal leave and I therefore didn\u2019t receive the results until I went to a different GP for the post surgery check in 03 February 2020. He was a Skin Cancer Doctor filling in for my normal GP and brushed it off as the CT in December 2019 was normal. He printed 50 pages of history and suggested a new GP. I felt off, something wasn\u2019t right. \n\nWent to a second GP on 09 February 2020 and he said he suspects this is all attributed to pituitary tumour and re-tested the prolactin. I have my appointment 13 February 2020. He mentioned an MRI and I feel I should ask for contrast? I also ordered the report from my Optometrist for the appointment to be on the front foot. \n\nDo you have any other suggestions for the appointment?\n\nCould the CT have missed the tumour as they weren\u2019t looking for it specifically? \n\nNo private health for an Endocrinologist and may wait 12 months in the public system where I live. \n\nThank you for bearing with me. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and need some guidance.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 714, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Female, high prolactin.

I'm new to this sub so apologies if some of these things have been addressed before. I've skimmed through and have found some useful information but hoping for more advice from those more knowledgeable than myself. Basically, I have a handful of symptoms of which I'm wondering could be caused by a prolactinoma.\n\nI'm a 34 y.o. male. Two years ago, I started putting on some extra weight in my belly and noticed my energy level was extremely low. I attributed it to having started a new job in which I sit at a desk all day. I started exercising more to compensate but was having a really difficult time seeing any change in body fat and was not retaining any muscle growth. Many months later, I started having a lot of bloating in my abdomen so I changed my diet - cutting out dairy, coffee, anything I thought may be bloating me. I got to where I felt like I was barely eating anything yet still putting on weight. Nothing was helping and my doctor basically told me I am just gassy.\n\nThis past summer, I started getting headaches and dipped into a very deep depression that was completely unprovoked. At the same time, I noticed my chest started developing extra tissue. I saw my doctor, who ordered labs to test my testosterone and thyroid, and told me to monitor my diet and exercise more. Unsatisfied, I recently did a mail-in hormone test that showed I have an elevated level of prolactin and sex-hormone-binding-globulin.\n\nSo my questions are... can a prolactinoma cause weight gain, depression, headache, and breast growth in men? Also, since caffeine affects the pituitary gland, would it be smart to cut caffeine completely until I have a diagnosis? Could something else be amiss causing a higher level of prolactin?\n\nSince I've seen my doctor twice now about the same issues and am unsatisfied, I have an appointment with a new doctor next month to address these issues and see if I can move forward to test my prolactin levels.

Back in December I finally went to my doctors to try and get on trt. As I felt like shit and had all the symptoms of low T. Found out I had a high prolactin level of 4000. He referred me to an endo which on the NHS 1st appointment was not till feb. I went private and got diagnosed with a 17 mm Macroprolactinoma and started treatment just before Xmas. \n\nCabergoline dosage is 0.5mg a week. It\u2019s been about 4 weeks since I started treatment. Prolactin is down to 1700 still well above the range of 300. LH and FSH are still low. I am still waiting on my latest results for testosterone. First test back in December had me at 2.9 nmol/L. \n\nTo go along with the symptoms of low T.  I also suffer from headaches/migraines (I honestly don\u2019t know the difference I have a sharp pain in my head, sometimes it\u2019s a dull ache sometimes it\u2019s a throbbing pain usually always involves some kind of discomfort with my eyes.) I find it very hard to focus, lack motivation and am starting to struggle at work. I just don\u2019t seem to grasp things or multitask. My endo wants to treat the prolactinoma before considering trt. \n\nAfter googling I am convinced all my problems stem from this tumour and low T. Tumour is being treated but how long do I have to wait to start feeling normal again. If it\u2019s any longer I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll end up divorced and unemployed.

Background: I was diagnosed with a macroprolactinoma (like 21 mm in diameter) in August this year. I am 16 male, 6\u20191 and 145ish pounds (was 160, have lost some weight). The cause for diagnosis was the frequent headaches I had been experiencing since March of this year. I also developed frequent nausea, but nothing else. When my hormone levels were tested, all came back normal except Prolactin, which was at 2325. \n\nI was put on Bromocriptine for ~1 month and experienced great results within the first two weeks. Prolactin dropped significantly, and I was for the most part headache free. However, the headaches came back after the brief 2 week period. \n\nAfter ~1 month of Bromocriptine I was switched to Cabergoline because they thought it would be more effective. However, I took Cabergoline for ~1-2 months and saw no progress. \n\nThen, I was back to Bromocriptine, with an increased dosage. I\u2019m not sure the dosage of pills, but once I was fully ramped up on them I was taking them 4 times a day. Just yesterday I got the results back, nothing. \n\nNow they\u2019re putting me back on Cabergoline with increased dosage. However surgery is becoming more and more of a reality. Can anyone share their experiences with surgery?

Taken several blood tests, where all of them came back fine except for prolactin (25 ng/mL, although I had taken large amounts of B6 and L-Dopa  weeks/months before blood test, so it might have been higher at some point) and TSH (5 \\[0.2 - 4\\]), but normal-high FT4). My mental health is fine (no depression or anxiety). The only logical explanation I can come up with for my low libido is my elevated prolactin levels. I finally got my doctor to prescribe me some cabergoline to see if it helps. 0.5 mg/week (split in two doses) for the first two weeks, then 1 mg/week (split in two doses) after first two weeks. I took my first dose of 0.25 mg 24 hours ago.\n\nI don't want to take this stuff if I really don't need it and it doesn't help with my condition. \n\nSo my question is: how fast does cabergoline lower prolactin levels?

This time I think the testosterone made it so it prolonged it as it\u2019s been now 5 months.

I had a CT scan first, which was easy because it's open, but they couldn't confirm the tumor, so they sent me to have an MRI. I was hospitalized at the time because my blood pressure, heart rhythm, and mental state was all over the place, plus I had diarrhea and a kidney infection at the time. I had already started taking cabergoline because I was seeing an endo due to lactation and feeling like I was losing my mind, as I would forget what I was saying in the middle of speaking to someone and I had anxiety that I had never before in my life experienced. I was always chill, and even in the most stressful or emergency situations, I could remain calm and work through them like a piece of cake. So, I was in the hospital and they diagnosed me with \"general anxiety\" and being a \"hypochondriac\", kept on trying to give me diazepam, but I felt terrible because they just put all these symptoms on me, as if it was all just mental, and that made me feel way worse, like I was just crazy and making things up. \n\nAnyways, after the CT scan, they sent me to get an MRI. I told them I was claustrophobic, and so they said, \"Okay, we'll have a student doctor go with you with diazepam and inject it right before you go in.\" While we were there waiting, the technician goes, \"No, they don't allow that anymore because the other day a man went in there and they gave him diazepam, and he had a heart attack and died.\" So, you can imagine how I felt after that. My anxiety spiraled, but the student doctor, my mom who was always by my side, and the technician kind of hyped me up and said that I could do it, so I was like okay, yeah, I can do it. So, I go into the room with the machine...I was able to lay down, but as soon as they put the head thing on and headphones, and started to put me in, I was like, no, I can't. It was so embarrassing, but I had a full-blown panic attack and just couldn't. So, I was rescheduled for two months later with an anesthesiologist. \n\nThe day came, and I was feeling so nervous. They sent me to the bathroom to put on my gown. My mom came with me, and I couldn't stop crying as if I was a 5-year-old. Everyone was like, \"Are you okay? You'll be fine.\" I was so surprised that everyone was being nice and patient because I had only had bad experiences with people lacking in compassion and care for their job at that hospital. After about 10 minutes, a woman came in and asked if I'd allow her to pray with me, and I said yes. Still brings tears to my eyes that a total stranger would do that, but that moment she prayed for me gave me a sense of calmness and strength that I so needed at that moment. My mom had asked me the same thing just a few moments before, and after we got home, she was like, \"Why didn't you want to pray with me and you did with her.\" Honestly, it was just the feeling that someone else would do that for me, like God sent this person. Anyway, so I gathered all of my strength and went to the MRI room with the anesthesiologists. I was scared of the anesthesia as well because I had never had anything major done to me; no anesthesia, no surgeries, and so they said they'd only give me a little. I was reluctant to give them my arm with the catheter...I kept blocking it with my other hand and saying, \"Wait.\" LOL She jokingly said to the other anesthesiologist, \"I'll put it in through here then,\" pointing at the end of the line that was attached to the catheter. I knew what she was talking about because I'm a vet tech and know how lines work, so it was kind of funny to me, and I was like, okay and let them give me the anesthesia. They gave me a little and asked how I felt, and I was like, great, but they were like, a litle more. I didn't fall asleep, but I felt like I could give a s\\*\\*t about anything because I was so relaxed LOL They don't have music or an emergency button there, but they said I could move my feet if I wanted out, but that I wouldn't get another chance :( So,I was in there for about 30 minutes, but thankfully, it felt like 5 haha  I just remember the noises and I was kind of looking forward or down-ish, and in my mind, I was like, \"Don't look up cause you'll freak out,\" but then I did and I didn't really care...wonders of the anesthesia I guess :)\n\nSo, they ended up diagnosing me with a 6mm microprolactinoma. Doctors were always saying I might need surgery, but I was like, \"I don't want surgery.\" Some make it sound so routine, but the fact is even if it's through your nose and blah, blah, it's still a major surgery and should be avoided if possible, in my opinion and in my now doctor's opinion. In fact, they told me a story about a young lady about my age that her mom insisted on her having surgery. The doctor said he explained over and over that she'd be fine with the cabergoline, but that she demanded to see the neurologist, so he finally said, \"Okay, I'll refer you to him.\" And he called and let them know about her, expecting them to tell her that he was right, that she didn't need the surgery. Well, they ended up doing the surgery just so the mom would stop insisting (terrible, I know). A couple weeks later, the woman returned to the doctor's office with her daughter complaining of a terrible headache. She ended up having a cerebrovascular event and passed away :( Not to scare anyone, but if your doctor says you can be treated with medication, try and trust them and give it a try first. If necessary, then surgery can be the second option. Of course, I also know of people who have had the surgery and are perfectly fine now, but the risks are there. \n\nSo, back to my story, :) I ended up finding a great doctor who took all of my symptoms and worries seriously, and said the other doctors were just lazy, that all of my symptoms had a reason, and he recommended I try the cabergoline again, but half the dose and he also prescribed me VITANCO, a natural but FDA-approved and regulated medication for stress and anxiety, and it has been a life-saver. Sure, I get a little anxiety here and there still, especially the day after taking the cabergoline, but I can get through it easily compared to before. My prolactin is now 11 from 220, my periods are regular, almost no lactation, hair has grown back (at 29 years I was getting a lot of gray hairs and balding) and hardly any gray hairs now, my energy is better, I am losing weight without trying (26lbs), and even faster when I try with diet and exercise, my memory is waaay better, hardly any vision issues, I only take 1/4 of metoprolol twice a day for blood pressure and tachycardia, where I used to take 4 different meds just for that, and my anxiety is mostly under control. I get nausea, weakness, and sometimes stomach issues as a side effect, but nothing my doctor can't fix. He usually gets me on meds for like an irritable bowel and probiotics for two weeks or so and it goes away. \n\nMy doctor wants to do an MRI at 6 months to a year of treatment, and if all is well, slowly take me off of it. After all of that, I've learned that there is hope, even when all seems lost and dark ;)\n\nI wrote a lot, but thank you for letting me share my story. It is sort of a relief getting this all out, and it's just a tiny bit of what I've experienced through this whole ordeal LOL I hope, if there are others out there feeling frightened, anxious, like they're losing it, that you know it's going to be okay. Never give up on finding the right doctor and people to help you. You and your family have to be the advocates for your health because no one else will be, and you can't just stand on the sidelines waiting and hoping. It took me a while, but I prayed and prayed and feel like God somehow sent us to that doctor and just overall wonderful hospital where everyone is so caring. If anyone ever wants to chat, I am happy to do so.

I was just diagnosed with high prolactin levels. I also have hypothyroidism and take 50mcg of Synthroid.\n\nMy prolactin started at 105ug/L and then retested after two months on Synthroid and it dropped to 55. I retested again 3 weeks later to see if the Synthroid would bring it down more, but it crept up to 57. The range is from 5-27ug/L.\n\nSo doctor put me on Dostinex .50mg twice a week. I took my first dose yesterday and had no symptoms. My question is, do you think I need to take two a week which would actually be 1mg a week?

I never had lactation. My main problem from the high prolactin is irregular periods, even though I get them every month and my inability to get pregnant (possibly not ovulating?). \n\nTLDR: Dr prescribed .50mg Dostinex twice a week, but I think it should be fine to take it once a week because my prolactin is only 30ug/L over the normal range.

While I ended up not being diagnosed with a prolactinoma, I am hoping it may be useful in building a repository of all kinds of prolactin related experiences.\n\nI was diagnosed with PCOS (Polycystic ovary syndrome) several years ago, after experiencing oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, acne, and trouble losing weight for most of my adult life. At the time, my blood levels had increased levels of testosterone and normal prolactin.\n\nThis year, I started noticing additional issues with extended PMS- with week-long cramps, bloating, extreme hunger, and fatigue. I decided to visit my gynecologist to discuss the symptoms, and I matched the criteria for PMDD (Premenstrual dysphoric disorder). She ordered bloodwork and flagged that I had very low levels of Vitamin D, as well as slightly elevated prolactin levels (37.8), and she referred me to an endocrinologist.\n\nI figured the prolactin was probably elevated from PCOS or venipuncture stress as I am very afraid of getting my blood drawn, however when my endo did my bloodwork my levels were higher (48.2). Additionally, I had abnormally high levels of DHEA-S (but strangely normal testosterone). I have also dealt for a long time with an odd combination of a high libido but low bodily arousal. I have never had any galactorrhea related symptoms, but some increase in breast tenderness.\n\nMy endocrinologist ordered a pituitary MRI with and without contrast. I think to wait several weeks for the MRI was the most challenging part of the experience- I have obsessive-compulsive disorder and my anxiety was thrown into full swing. I had a lot of trouble eating and became very \"floaty\" from low blood sugar and being so nerve-wracked. I had my primary care physician prescribe me medication that I could take to ease panic attacks. I believe that trying to keep more regular healthy habits (normal meal times/portions, going for walks, etc) would have greatly helped during this time- I would definitely suggest not doing what I did to others going through similar experiences.\n\nMy MRI was yesterday, and I took a Xanax beforehand and had my cousin come with me. I am not claustrophobic and had had an MRI before, but I was extremely nervous about the gadolinium contrast in light of all the recent documentation about retention and just the very concept of having dye injected in my bloodstream. My experience with the dye was actually much better than expected- the saline solution felt worse than the dye to me. Both felt similar to having an ice pack held to my wrist for a moment. I did not have the sensation of needing to urinate as others have described. The MRI machine itself was actually fairly relaxing, and the radiologist let me choose music to listen to. When I got back home I drank a lot of water throughout the day and mostly rested in bed with a slight headache.\n\nMy doctor called in the evening and told me the results of my MRI were normal, but that I will still be prescribed Cabergoline to lower my levels of prolactin and that we will continue to monitor things. He said that it is possible I have a microadenoma too small to visualize on an MRI or have some other unknown factors that are contributing. Additionally, he is unsure whether I have PCOS at all- if the Carbergoline resolves my PCOS-like symptoms then I may actually just have hyperprolactinemia presenting as PCOS.

The endocrinologist prescribed me cabergoline, which I took on and off for around a year, the longest period of time on it being six weeks and was earlier this year.

I visited a urologist with symptoms of ED, low libido, fatigue, and low seminal volume and after running two blood tests over a period of a week, he wants me to get pituitary MRI to look for prolactinoma.\n\nMy blood results seem unlike anything I've seen commonly reported.\n\nProlactin: **27.0** (4.0-15.2) \\[twice repeated\\]  \nTotal testosterone: 562.0 (282.0-1058.0)  \nLH: 5.5 (1.7-8.6)  \nFSH: **0.9** (1.5-12.4)  \nThyroid stimulating hormone: 3.880 (0.450-4.500)\n\nThree odd things occur to me:\n\n1) LH/FSH ratio: Normally, both LH and FSH would be equally suppressed from hyperprolactinemia, but the ratio is &gt;5:1. In women [such a ratio indicates polycystic ovarian syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14737959), but I'm a dude. I've read that with chronically low testosterone, LH production increases to counteract the hypogonadism. My only guess is that hyperprolactinemia globally suppresses FSH and LH, but lower testosterone than what would otherwise be my baseline means elevated LH as compensation, keeping testosterone within normal range.\n\n2) Sexual dysfunction: There is clearly a pituitary issue given both clinically low FSH (*very* rare for males) and elevated prolactin. But is it enough to cause my problems? These are not psychogenic and developed gradually a few years ago, but I have always had a lower sex drive. Before I learned about this, I blamed it on antidepressants but it didn't get any better after stopping them and seemed to gradually worsen independent of whether I was on or off of antidepressants. (For the record: I was not on antidepressants when I did these blood tests).\n\n3) Mild elevation: Obviously there is pituitary involvement, but I've seen most prolactinoma reports manifest with numbers significantly higher than 27.\n\nI'm just really confused.

This is an abridged version but is still pretty long. \n\nAbout two and a half years ago I was diagnosed with hyperprolactinemia and I was put on bromocriptine after 6 months without a period. Unfortunately after that I moved city and the doctor I saw about 5 months after the first diagnosis was useless, told me I shouldn't have been diagnosed and so, feeling completely let down, I forgot about it and the bromocriptine stopped. \n\nAfter that I went months without a period again and visited a doctor. They told me that it was due to my weight and they prescribed the contraceptive pill to fix the period issues (despite me explaining I wanted kids in the next couple of years). They stated my PRL level was high, but not too high to worry. I started secreting from my breasts so had a mammogram. No issues so that was left alone. In this time I had stopped the pill because I really don't want to be on contraceptives, and again I had no periods.\n\nAbout this time I started researching things more independently - not to self diagnose but because it was growing tiring to be let down again and again. This was when I learned about prolactinomas. \n\nIn about May this year, I saw a doctor and the first time I saw her, she was pretty positive about fertility and while my PRL was high, it wasn't high enough for concern again. The second time she confirmed a diagnosis of PCOS and that I still had hyperprolactinemia and so put me on bromocriptine again and the contraceptive pill to 'balance my hormones'. She also changed her tune regarding fertility and made it sound like it would be really difficult with both diagnoses. I asked about having an MRI and she said that the level wasn't high enough to worry about any prolactinomas.\n\nSince March, I've been having flashes in my vision so I went to an opthamologist. After doing a vision field test, she told me that I had a loss of some vision. I was completely taken aback, thought it was an error with the way they had covered my eye during the test, until the evening when I realised it was true. My peripheral vision close to my nose was so blurry that I could only make out colours. She suggested the MRI. The gynocologist I had been seeing just agreed to it, just to rule out a tumour because she thought it was highly unlikely.\n\nAfter moving cities again, I booked an appointment with an endocrinologist who immediately took it seriously and asked why no one before had pushed for an MRI. They took bloods and I booked an MRI for the next day.\n\nI guess here is where the story really begins.\n\nMy results came back and I have two tumours: one in the anterior position of the pituitary gland and one in the posterior gland (which seems non-functional). My doctor has said a few times that this is strange because my PRL levels aren't high enough to indicate a tumour. After my doctor had spoken to neurologists, they thought that the tumours may be cysts - possibly caused by previous treatment.\n\nI was told to see an opthamologist to check the vision problems and my optic nerve because they didn't think that the cyst/tumours had caused them. Well, this week I saw the opthamologist and she says my optic nerve is pale and apparently my macula (whatever that is) is not healthy. I left with the advice not to exercise too hard or sneeze too hard (not sure how to control that though) with a retina test booked for sometime soon. Additionally she said that the vision loss I already have is probably permanent, but again that this is strange because the loss is in one eye on the nasal side whereas they'd expect it to be on the outer periphery of both eyes. (She doesn't think the flashes are related.)\n\nAfter hearing from the opthamologist, my doctor has now recommended that I change hospitals and doctors to see experts in pituitary tumours, neurosurgery and endocrinologists specialised in the pituitary gland. I'm nervous to go through the whole thing again with new doctors but hopefully we'll finish the journey. I feel bitter because if someone had taken it more seriously earlier, maybe I wouldn't have these vision problems. I've basically given up on having kids naturally because it doesn't sound easy or possible and I don't want the heartache of IVF. I feel like I'm in limbo at the moment while taking bromocriptine everyday waiting to find out what's really going on. On top of it all, I've just started a new job and because I'll have to be asking for cover (I'm a teacher) I know I'll have to share the whole story. My husband is pretty relaxed, but very supportive, but I have this constant cloud over my head wondering about what all this means. I'm the sort of person who needs explanations and to be able to understand what is going on, but right now it seems that even doctors can't explain everything.

Getting it diagnosed was a nightmare as i had the symptoms for around 8 years but it was constantly missed by the GP. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main symptoms were as follows; fogginess, bilateral gyno, fatigue, rapid weight gain (around 8KG despite no change in diet and being very active, lift weights 5 x a week, sports 3-4 x a week), decreased interested in women and complete lack of sex drive. I was also playing sport at a high level and was finding it really difficult to recover in between sessions. On top of this I was gaining weight but losing muscle mass despite my main lifts in the gym getting significantly stronger. I went to the GP and described these symptoms for years, I did not know anything about prolactinoma's so I wondered if it was due to low testosterone to which blood tests were ordered and was told i was on the low side but nothing to worry about and I just needed to exercise more and be more active (lifting 5 x a week and playing sports 4 x a week....lol). Unfortunately a full blood test was never ordered over the years so my symptoms just got worse and I noticed that my vision started to get worse quite rapidly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnnoyingly i was getting nowhere with the GP so I gave up and ordered my own private blood test and within 3 days had a phone-call saying i needed to get an urgent GP appointment and request an MRI as they suspected a prolactinoma and my Serum Prolactin level was 101,000 mu/L (normal range for males is 45-375 mU/L). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas booked in with an endocrinologist and had the MRI ordered which confirmed I had a macroadenoma measuring 19 x 23 x 15mm. Consultant said that was the highest levels she had seen (go me) and was surprised I had been able to get by with my symptoms for that long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWas immediately started on cabergoline 2 x 0.5mg weekly and have side effects with it (struggle to sleep at night and headaches) but I am happy to say that as of the past few months my Prolactin levels have dropped from 101,000&gt;74,416&gt;12,323&gt;2,442mu/L, which obviously I am very happy with! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy only issue is I am still having pretty much all of the symptoms that I started with.

I don't know if this is necessarily a problem, my endo doesn't seem to think so, but there also isn't an explanation for those low numbers or my fatigue and other symptoms that never abated.  \n\nSo, I guess I'm just wondering if it's possible for a prolactinoma to cause other pituitary problems, like low FT4, and whether or not anybody else has experience with this or something similar?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 349, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Prolactinoma and other pituitary problems?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/9wuv9h/prolactinoma_and_other_pituitary_problems/"}, {"author": "IdeserveYoDownvote", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1onpxqwh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542064214, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/9wja1w/really_really_need_your_help_please/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9wja1w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/9wja1w/really_really_need_your_help_please/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1542064215, "score": 1, "selftext": "I had two concerns:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) My doctor ordered a normal MRI and MRA opposed to a \"pituitary\" MRI.

Last blood test they were 650ish, and this time round they\u2019re 1350ish. \n\nWhen I first got diagnosed (2011) I started with 0.5mg Cabergoline once a week which I had a troubled relationship with. I could take it consistently for a while and then I\u2019d feel like my libido was out of control and \u2018take a break\u2019. Surprisingly, it never seemed to effect the size of the prolactinoma and eventually my prolactin levels got down to within the normal range.\n\nDue to the problems with Cab my endo switched me to 75mg Quinagolide every day. I\u2019ve been taking it consistently for about a year now, never missing a dose. It just doesn\u2019t seem to work as well as the Cab did. \n\nRecently I had a major stress because my driving license was revoked temporarily because I got diagnosed with sleep apnea. It caused so many problems. I\u2019ve got my license back now, and I\u2019m surprised not to feel any different now the stress has gone.

I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here telling you all this. Just hope someone can maybe tell me something helpful. \n\nIt\u2019s good for me to know that the prolactin levels are high again because it sort of explains away why I feel so dead inside.

Reading all the posts on here has been a huge help!\n\n\nAs indicated by the title, I'm a 25-year old guy who has just last month been diagnosed with a macroadenoma. Mine's a decent-sized one, 3cm or so and my levels at diagnosis were at 5600 (down to 2000 after only a week of Cabergoline though. Woo!) I first went to my urologist about 2 months ago with some serious sexual function issues. By an absolute miracle, he wanted some bloodwork done just in case my hormones looked funny. He saw the high prolactin, ordered and MRI, and found the culprit. My endocrinologist had me taking a single Cabergoline 1x a week, but I've just been increased to 2x per week after seeing some improvement.\n\n\nThese past few weeks I've gotten to thinking about some of the issues I've had in the past, and am wondering if others have had similar experiences or could shed some light on the matter? As far back as I can remember, I'd have these sort of 24-hour long \"colds.\" I'd wake up in the morning with a stuffy nose, and ALL DAY LONG my nose would absolutely drip like a faucet, I'd be sneezing like a madman, and I'd occasionally have some intense sinus pressure.\n\n\nAnd then the next morning, it's gone just like that. I could relatively accurately predict when they would come on too. Usually after an intense workout/run. More recently, I've observed them after spending a few hours playing boardgames with friends.\n\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because I've sort-of psyched myself out reading about potential CSF leaks that can accompany these types of growths. I mentioned it to my endocrinologist, but has attributed it to my massive amounts of allergies (I am allergic to cats, have seasonal allergies, hayfever,) These ones only last a day though, and do not come with the itchy eyes.\n\n\nSorry if this was a bit ramble-y, just looking for some input from others. Any advice is greatly appreciated!!!\n\n\n\n**TL;DR** Recently diagnosed with a large prolactinoma.

However, now that that's stabilized, and so many issues remain, it would be nice to know if something else is going on that hasn't been caught yet - my partner and I want to start having kids in a couple of years so I'd rather not find out after a miscarriage or two that something treatable is present, vs dealing with it now so I'm good to go later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStumbled on hyperprolactinemia doing research for school, and found it fit many symptoms.

She immediately called me after my blood test and said we had to do further testing because they picked up on something in my brain. She referred me onto an endocrinologist who I met to discuss my test in detail.\n\nOn my paper, it showed **'Prolactin (mIU/L) 3514'** and the endocrinologist said that the regular range for females was 60 to 620.\n\nMy MRI results showed that my pituitary gland was... what, 6mm in size or something? The endocrinologist said this was relatively small and that I wouldn't need surgery.\n\nHe asked me a series of questions:\n* **Do you see double vision?** No.\n* **Do you have thyroid issues?** No.\n* **Do you have nausea?** No.\n* **Do you have migraines?** Nothing out of the regular.\n* **Do you have milky discharge?** No.\n\nI have no idea where this growth came from, but I guess that's like with any form of tumor. I was in denial and couldn't bear to research any further on this cause now I realized that I had a tumor (benign as it was) in my brain.\n\nThe endocrinologist prescribed to me 500mcg Cabergoline tablets. I now take one tablet once every week. After I went back to my endocrinologist, my prolactin levels were at a **7**. I was worried about such a low count, but he said low levels didn't matter as much as high levels did.\n\nNow, I noticed that I've gained a huge amount of weight (I always just chalked it up to stress), and my hair is getting thinner and I'm losing hair. My skin is constantly in a state of break-out and I'm tired all the time.\n\nI've always been a little overweight, so I always assumed that my hormone levels would return to normal after taking the medication - but it seemed to be having a complete opposite effect.\n\nMy question is: what would happen if I decided to stop taking cabergoline?

My levels came down to 20, which is still slightly elevated. Since, my libido has improved a lot, also my sleep got much better.\n\nThe cabergoline gives me mild side effect: apart from some light dizziness my sexual desire can get somewhat strong.\n\nAs there is no hyperprolactinemia sub, I post this here.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 321, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Idiopathic hyperprolactinemia", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/9bgz2e/idiopathic_hyperprolactinemia/"}, {"author": "ploopis", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1534961094, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/99fmoq/ttc_late_period_negative_pregnancy_tests_on/", "gilded": 0, "id": "99fmoq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/99fmoq/ttc_late_period_negative_pregnancy_tests_on/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1534961096, "score": 2, "selftext": "CD40 no period yet.

I started showing symptoms (galactorrhea, extreme weight gain, constant fatigue, serious migraines, irritability) in November and was diagnosed in March. I was put on Cabergoline but taken off it only a week in as it induced (at only 0.25mg!) quite horrible visual hallucinations and worsened my fatigue significantly to the point that walking down my street would wear me out so much that I was left bed bound for the rest of the day and even some of the day after. \n\nOf course this is a very severe reaction and coming to this Reddit I expected people to be reporting similar but I can\u2019t find anyone talking about the hallucinations? \n\nThey put me on quinagolide instead as they were not confident I would react well to bromocriptine and as I also have Borderline Personality Disorder and autism they were too worried to take the risk. \n\nThe quinagolide has left me with much more energy, almost as much as I had before the tumour, and even has helped my mood. It seems to be allowing my diet to lead to me steadily losing weight also. \n\nHowever, there is a serious problem. The hallucinations are still here. They last about two hours after taking the quinagolide. They are not as severe as the cabergoline but this time I am having auditory hallucinations as well, and constant sleep paralysis, which is horrifying. The result is that my body is now not able to go to sleep until around 5am each day on average. This is despite me taking the medication at around 9pm every night. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I have spoken to my endocrinologist but he is confused by this and has only suggested I reduce the dosage but that would mean it would be too low to treat the prolactinoma symptoms. \n\nI just wanted to know if anyone else has had symptoms like these at all. I can\u2019t be the only one? My endocrinologist is really taken aback by it as he hasn\u2019t seen any other patient that has reacted like this. I am starting to get really worried.

I explained to him that my primary didn\u2019t say this and he said all the evidence between the blood result and the MRI would give us enough evidence to say it is an adenoma. \n\nI tried calling my primary care back and asking her about these mixed results and she was still not willing to call it an adenoma until I see and endocrinologist (in 2 months \ud83e\udd72) this time she did call it a \u201cnodule\u201d.. which is probably the more proper medical term instead of \u201cswelling\u201d. \n\nI am so frustrated with how difficult it is to navigate the health care system.

I refused and continue to use it. \n\n\nSome months later I did medical check up with different endocrinologis,  my prolactin was below low range and she adviced to stop it. Solo finasteride then. She ordered CT scan of adrenals to roll out tumour - as source of extra Estradiol and cortisol and nothing was found. In meantime, adviced by her I stopped finasteride in June as it was again thought to be a problem.  August 2021 she also ordered MRI scan of pituary - 5mm tumour was found in anterior pituitary gland.\nIn meantime I decided to start CBT therapy.\nTalking with my family it turned out I got probably some mutation in FIPA region, as my mother and her father both got pituary adenomas.\nMy Prolactin levels were similar to attached above, and I was having problem with erection and libido. She put me on cabergoline and adviced consultation with different doctor in endocrinological clinic, to order DNA tests. \nThis endocrinologist did parathyroid USG to rollout MEN-1 and concluded that my increase in Prolactin and Cortisol (ACTH) are from not from tumour but from psychiatric stress and I should consult with my psychiatrist to put me on some new meds - she mentioned trazodone as it may help with my sexual problems, continue psychoteraphy and consult sexologist- psychologist. My psychiatrist refused to give me any medications and told me to continue therapy as he see no psychiatric point to give me any medications. Also mentioned to stop using cabergoline as it \" would not help me with my therapy\"\n\nSo yeah, right now I have no idea what's going on, my libido is 0 I can't get erection and if i get it's about 40%, haven't go to gym for 3 weeks, and am having troubles sleeping (waking up multiple times at night), also my motivation is low.\nIf anyone would have any insight what's going, please comment.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1828, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[Blood work] Need advice, I'm absolutely confused.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/r78c2n/blood_work_need_advice_im_absolutely_confused/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Pinkprincess_22", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gh5ek9xg", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1638414187, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/r6x2ez/what_does_fatigue_feel_like_to_you/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r6x2ez", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/r6x2ez/what_does_fatigue_feel_like_to_you/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1638414198, "score": 1, "selftext": "I want to preface this by saying, I am a pretty anxious person.

For the girls among us I just wanted to give some info. I was treated for a prolactinoma by 2 docs over 10 years - 2 clearly useless docs. This year I moved hospitals. This hospital is considered as a leading research hub on prolactinomas and such. First appointment they are horrified when they look at my record and see I\u2019ve been taking the birthcontrol pill since before the tumor was found and nobody has told me to stop it. They said that the hormones in the pill are basically like steroids for a prolactinoma. \n\nSo for 10 years i was on incredibly high dosage of norprolac but my tumor just kept growing - due to the incompetence of 2 doctors. The docs even accused me of not taking the meds because there was no improvement. \n\nNow i quit the pill and am on a low dosage of cabergoline and the effects are immediate. My test results are looking good. I am now using a mirena spiral which is apparently fine, the hormone in that is not harmful. \n\nHope this helps someone.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1823, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Beware of contraceptive pill", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/r5jvgf/beware_of_contraceptive_pill/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "thismodernleper", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5b9wlpc5", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1638248939, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/r5fgx1/looking_for_advice_for_girlfriend/", "gildings": {}, "id": "r5fgx1", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/r5fgx1/looking_for_advice_for_girlfriend/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1638248951, "score": 1, "selftext": "For a few months now has been complaining of headaches, dizzy spells, nausea.

I\u2019m a 31yo male. Basically I got checked for low T. Prolactin was about double (I have to look again), free T was at 6. Estrogen was also way low. The Dr. Indicated a pituitary tumor. The past 3 years I\u2019ve been falling apart. I have complete anhedonia now. I was an extremely disciplined productive person my entire life. Always active and pursuing athletic hobbies and growing in life. I\u2019m basically bed ridden now. Always in pain, joints are always sore and feel bruised. Out of no where a few years ago I found out I have hip dysplasia, and horrible degenerative disc disease that\u2019s already of a 90yo. I was wakeboarding everyday a few years back. That doesn\u2019t just randomly happen so rapidly without something else going on. Depressed, panic attacks daily, occasionally Stuttering words, I see no purpose in anything and can\u2019t convince myself to do the simplest task. I\u2019m randomly getting migraines. I barely sleep either yet I\u2019m always lethargic and fatigued. I can slam energy drinks, coffee, even take take stimulating drugs (prescription), and nothing will give me energy. I tried asking a couple doctors for an MRI and it\u2019s just been too complicated, I feel so broken down and exhausted. I\u2019ve been up for 2 days straight doing nothing, typically I sleep every other day. I don\u2019t remember what happened days ago. I\u2019ve also been on TRT to treat the non existent test the past 6 months also, and nothing has really changed other than gaining back about 15 pounds of the 30lbs of muscle i lost. That\u2019s another thing, I lost a lot of muscle mass as something else that happened. I remember bits of things and I recall getting a ct scan from an accident (nothing too serious) about 4 years ago looking for a concussion, and the person looking at it asked a colleague, \u201cis that normal\u201d?, and they just brushed it off. It was night shift in the ER. Makes me wonder there was something there these past 5 or more years. I\u2019ve also had a bit of gyno since I was like 18 and I have very low body fat, not sure if that indicates something. Are all of these symptoms of a tumor? My levels weren\u2019t even THAT high like I see some other people dealing with. Though I\u2019m assuming the symptoms vary person to person since clearly this could have been the reason for the ridiculously low hormone levels. I was not depressed before a few years ago either, something just randomly shifted. The past 2 years especially has gotten worse and worse, the past 2 months it legit feels like pressure in my head between my eyes a couple times per week. I also can\u2019t breath out my nose as well as I used to. That might not be related and stupid to mention but figured I\u2019d throw it in there. Is this what happens with these tumors? This is straight up torture. Maybe it doesn\u2019t even have to do with it. I\u2019m sorry for wasting your time if it isn\u2019t that.

something similar.\n\nI\u2019m M27, healthy, fit, and About 5 months ago I went in to get blood work done because I had started to get visually noticeable gynecomastia in my left breast that was sensitive and seemed to be growing pretty rapidly. I had a mammogram and ultrasound done and results came back that it was gyno, my doc wanted to put me on Cabergoline because my Prolactin levels were high (not crazy high, like 20.6 ng/mL with the normal male range being 4 - 15.2 in males according to my paperwork), my FSH levels were low, and everything else was normal. \n\nNow, I wanted to understand the cause directly before going on medication and my doc said to be sure I\u2019d have to get an MRI because there were no other known causes, so I assume he was thinking I had a prolactinoma? It was never actually confirmed but I don\u2019t know what else it would be since everything else was Normal.\n\nHowever, MRI\u2019s are expensive and I wanted to do my own bit of googling to see if there were any studies on alternative treatments that were cheaper and/or safer. I found a 2016 study that found that vitamin b6 (200mg p5p, activated version which is easier and safer for us to absorb) supplementation had led to reduced prolactin levels, and another study showing about 400 IU equivalent of Vitamin E also lowered prolactin levels by inhibiting pituitary hypertrophy (in rats - yes I know, a stretch, but there are other sources as well).\n\nSo i figured if I could safely supplement these, it might help before committing to going on another med or something the rest of my life.\n\nSo about 4-6 weeks in, and I had noticed I had stopped getting the \u201csensation\u201d of feeling my left breast more, and the senstivity became nearly non-existent. Another month or two in and the size of the mass feels SIGNIFICANTLY smaller, and is not visually different than my right breast.\n\nAdditionally, it felt like my sex drive had increased again but it may be tied more to confidence boost than hormonal so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nNow, I haven\u2019t repeated bloodwork, but I\u2019m coming up on 6 months and was going to get another blood test done to see what my levels have been like or if they\u2019ve reduce to normal. \n\nHas anyone else tried anything like this? This is in NO way medical advice, but I\u2019d just like to see if anyone has tried it. I\u2019m happy to post sources for the studies I used if anyone is interested. \n\nTL:DR; Vitamin B6 (p5p) and Vitamin E supplementation have appeared to reduce my gyno from an assumed prolactinoma, any similar stories?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1805, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anecdotal Self-Medicated Success Story", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qxyr82/anecdotal_selfmedicated_success_story/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ItsWackOutThere", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_cjxj4tfd", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1637383338, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qxxz3q/sexuality_change_post_tumor_treatment/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qxxz3q", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qxxz3q/sexuality_change_post_tumor_treatment/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1637383349, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi, I don't know if anyone will relate to this here, but nobody I've met ever has, and I'm wondering if anyone out there has had or knows about someone having a similar experience to mine. \n\nGrowing up, I always thought I was straight, just with a low sex drive. My periods were always irregular, and I started lactating at 17, though I didn't tell anyone. When I got to college, I tried having sex with men and I was just never that into it, but I thought I just needed to meet the right guy. I finally went to the doctor at 19, got diagnosed with prolactinoma, and started cabergoline soon after. Soon, I started feeling very attracted to a female friend of mine. It was shocking and very confusing for me. I had no clue that I was gay, and felt very disconnected from other gay people, who have stories about knowing when they were a kid, or crushes in high school. I'm 21 now, and realized within the past year that I'm not attracted to men at all. It's been a total reality shift, and I feel like I'm not the person I was before I started treatment. \n\nI've done a lot of work to accept myself, and now I love being a lesbian, but it doesn't feel quite real to me yet, still. I've also had to deal with having real feelings for someone for the first time at the age of 20, and I still have no relationship or sex experience with the gender I'm attracted to. \n\nIt just feels so... weird? I'm so different from who I was two years ago, that it feels like I've created a persona which I don't understand. \n\nI feel isolated from my peers with relationship experience, from the straight life I used to lead, from the lesbian community I know nothing about, and from everyone I've talked to about this, who treat it like an interesting, weird story that they view as a quirk of mine, and never have to think about. \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who had a similar experience?", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1804, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Sexuality Change Post Tumor Treatment", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qxxz3q/sexuality_change_post_tumor_treatment/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Intelligent_Cat__", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bme2j6o6", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1637364270, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qxsa2q/struggling_to_focus/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qxsa2q", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qxsa2q/struggling_to_focus/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1637364281, "score": 1, "selftext": "It's just me or the cabergoline (Dostinex) could cause a difficulty to focus ?

As a result I got scheduled for an MRI that showed a 3mm tumor on my pituitary gland. About a week later I took another blood test which showed a prolactin level of 55. I talked to my primary Doctor about it, and he offered to start me on caberoglene but we decided not to because at that point my endocrinologist visit was only a month away so I would have only gotten one dose of caber anyway. We both assumed the endocrinologist would prescribe caber.\n\nI just saw the endocrinologist last week and it was a nightmare. Apparently the endocrinologist never got my MRI or my second blood test. All he knew was that I got one blood test that showed a prolactin level of 45. He was super young, unprofessional, and said a bunch of things that I know aren't true. Worst of all he refused to prescribe me caber, instead he ordered more blood tests and a follow up appointment for THREE MONTHS from now, after I waited 3 months for the first visit. If I had started caber when I first had my MRI, my tumor could be gone by now. \n\nAs for what the endocrinologist said that made me uncomfortable:\n\n-he said surgery is dangerous because \"digging around in your brain is never good\" even though the pituitary gland isn't in the brain\n\n-he started talking to me about his race and how he's \"brown\" for no reason\n\n-he told me that my high prolactin is probably caused by depression and not the tumor since he didn't have access to the MRI\n\n-he told my father on the phone that I'm \"asymptomatic\" even though I have high prolactin, delayed orgasm, depression, and gynecomastia\n\nI contacted my primary Doctor to ask for a second opinion and if he could prescribe me caber since the endo wouldn't. He told me that the only other endo he could put me in contact with is out of state even though there are multiple endocrinologists near me, and that he wants me to do the 3 months of blood tests before he prescribes caber even though he offered it to me over a month ago. \n\nI really don't know what to do.

I went to a behavioral health services place but they would not diagnose me because I was \"too smart for ADHD and had a master's degree.\" I feel like my brain still isn't working at all like it used to and everything is difficult. I think they're honestly afraid to diagnose because of people seeking stimulants. I've been on SSRI's for years and it has decreased my anxiety but not these symptoms. I'm on a max recommended dose of venlafaxine at 225 mgs. I recently asked full-time psych (she does not do ADHD diagnostic exams) about adding wellbutrin despite not having a real ADHD diagnosis and she was supportive.

I went to my doctor and I got a bloodtest done that revealed a prolactin level of 36 ug/L , testosterone level of 14.7 nmol/L, and free testosterone level of 380 pmol/L. I was a given an mri a few months later (july 2020) that revealed no tumour. Around this time I began to develop severe anxiety and ocd so I was prescribed sertraline.  I was then referred to an endocrinologist and my appointment was end of Jan 2021. I had another bloodtest done that revealed a prolactin level of 25.5 ug/L. Because of the lowered prolactin and because i am on antidepressant the endocrinologist decided not to prescribe me any medication. I began eating clean &amp; working out the past few months and had another bloodtest done a few days ago because my appointment is upcoming end of may. My prolactin level was tested at 37.6 ug/L &amp; prolactin monomeric at 26.5 ug/L (can anyone explain the relevance of this) and testosterone is now at 17.5 nmol/L. I don\u2019t have any symptoms relating to the high prolactin i will only sometimes experience discharge and nipple pain but its not often. I believe i\u2019ve had high prolactin since I was a teen as I remember times of this exact same nipple discharge, I also have minimal gains from the gym despite working out on and off for around 10 years. I really want to be prescribed cabergoline. Judging from my current bloodtest will I be prescribed medication, and what could I expect hormonally to change related to testosterone.

Visited neurologist and within a week symptoms had progressed to include blurry distance vision, extreme fatigue, spontaneous brain fog, some memory loss, &amp; increased headaches. Neuro ordered MRI &amp; EEG (to rule out focal seizures as cause of brain fog, memory loss, &amp; fatigue). \n\nFast forward to today, just 3 weeks after GYN appt. Not able to work due to constant &amp; still-worsening brain fog, migraines, confusion, sensitivity to light &amp; sound, plus all previous symptoms. Can\u2019t teach the children if I can\u2019t remember what day it is leet alone drive. \n\nHad MRI today, radiologist reported a 7.4mm pituitary adenoma. Had neurology appt immediately after MRI, nurse practitioner confirms adenoma on scans, goes to get neurologist doctor. Doctor comes in, looks pissed, immediately starts dismissing my symptoms, says \u201cthere was a 5mm or less \u2018something\u2019 on your scans but that means it\u2019s nothing\u201d, tells me I need to \u201caggressively treat my depression\u201d (already on meds for, in counseling, have psychiatrist, too) and add a migraine medication (that I have taken before but stopped because I thought it was making me gain weight - called Aimovig). I brought up prolactin level, he claims neurology doesn\u2019t deal with prolactin, so he refers me to endocrinology &amp; calls it done.\n\nUnfortunately it\u2019s Friday night so I can\u2019t make appointments until Monday morning, my symptoms now get worse daily, &amp; my migraine has stopped responding to anything I happen to have here at home. \n\nQuestions:\n- should I seek out new neurologist ASAP, or worry more about getting in with endocrinology first? Not that my adenoma per radiologist is even of large concern, but my symptoms sure are getting worse. \n\n- anyone have experience transferring MRI scans from one practice to another?

So it had doubled in size in 11 months. meanwhile my prolactin had remained the same.\n\nMy question is this: Considering its growth rate in 1 year and my prolactin levels, is this considered a prolactinoma?

This diagnoses comes at the end of a grueling sixth month trek through two different medical institutions where I was just dismissed as a \"migraine sufferer\" and none of my symptoms or issues were properly assessed because I had been shoved into the box of a patient with daily migraines (even though no pills, eye drops, injectables, etc would give me any relief from the symptoms I'm experiencing). Finally the neuros gave up and referred me to an endocrinologist, who I am hoping will be my savior.\n\nOn 4/23 I began taking bromocriptine at 5mg per day, with follow up bloodwork to be completed on 5/14. I will see my endo the following Thursday to discuss the results of my first few weeks. So far I have not gotten any relief at all and if anything I feel like I'm continuing to get worse. I've read on this and other forums and medical journals that the timing seems to vary from person to person but I feel like at this point I should be getting SOME relief but maybe I'm wrong. My symptoms are as follows:\n\nDaily persistent headache, focused between my temples and behind my eyes. No prescription meds or OTC painkillers assist with the pain. Would rate it around 6.5-7 of 10.\n\nDebilitating (and I'm not blowing this out of proportion at all) light sensitivity, especially with LED technology. This has gotten so bad that I struggle to drive due to headlights (no one wants to know what my solution for this has been because it is not safe at all), cannot go outside at night or early in the morning, unable to go inside of most stores due to overhead lighting, and I cannot even bare to see a cell phone, tv screen, computer screen, etc in any field of my vision for even one second. The feeling that exposure to light gives me is debilitating pain, nausea, disorientation/dizziness, inability to communicate/slurred speech, and fuzzy vision. My entire day can be ruined by 5+/- seconds of LED exposure.\n\nShort term memory loss. I can remember key things about each day but not the smaller details like conversations and etc.\n\nInsomnia. This began back in November when all my problems started ramping up and still hasn't resolved. I take trazodone to help get to sleep at night but I wake up like clockwork every 2-3 hours and struggle to get back to sleep. Taking something to sleep doesn't provide the same level of rest that sleeping naturally does so my sleep debt has been stacking up for 6ish months now. Plus I didn't get prescribed the trazodone until March, all these neuros except for the last one who ultimately sent me to the endo just kept saying that when the pain got under control that I'd sleep...\n\nFrequent urination. I void between 15-20 times per day and sometimes as much as 4 times per night. I currently drink a lot of coconut water to keep myself from dehydrating, which happened to be back in February before my diagnoses.\n\nThe pain along with everything else that I'm experiencing is pushing me to the edge of what I can bear and initially my diagnoses gave me some hope that relief was around the corner but obviously that isn't the case. Thankfully my work has been accommodating and I have a great support group of family and friends to help me but that only goes so far.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with all of this together or any individual symptoms at this severity? If so how long did it take for oral treatment to begin to relieve the symptoms? What drug were you prescribed if so? Should I push my doctor to increase my daily does if he doesn't initially reach that conclusion at my next visit? \n\nI am open to all suggestions and recommendations from anyone willing to give their two cents here.

He said the levels were at about 1000 (which I think is about 50 in the other units) and wanted to try bloods again. The results for that just came in and they've lowered to around 900 (45ish I think). Because of general anxiety I have, and a clean mri scan I had in late 2019, my Dr says he thinks the levels are due to stress and says to get more bloods done in about 2 months and see what the levels are like then.\nI'm worried however that if there is something there and I keep leaving it, it's going to only get worse and am not sure whether I should just ask for an mri now.\nI've no clue how high prolactin is too high so really don't know how concerned I should be. \nI will say since Novemeber 2020 my periods have arrived every month with my cycles being about 35 days. No change in flow however I have noticed itchiness at times, but I put that down to my natural cycle as before I was on the pill I would often get itchy before my period. \nThanks yall.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1385, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Should I be trying to get an MRI?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/n4kx0d/should_i_be_trying_to_get_an_mri/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ioktbtinoktat", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bj1btlqd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1620108883, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/n4hhbj/sick_of_the_lack_of_sex_drive/", "gildings": {}, "id": "n4hhbj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/n4hhbj/sick_of_the_lack_of_sex_drive/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1620108893, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve been taking cabergoline for over 3 months now.

Sorry in advance for the formatting, I am currently on my mobile. \n\nI was diagnosed in 2019 and promptly prescribed bromocriptine. The bromocriptine absolutely lowered my prolactin levels, but the side effects (extreme nausea, fainting, vomiting) were intolerable. My endocrinologist at the time (we will call her Dr K) told me that it was to be expected and I should push through. So I did. It was my understanding that under the best circumstances, I would only have to be on medication for a few years and my prolactinoma would shrink. \n\nFast forward to late early 2021. My symptoms that ultimately resulted in my diagnosis have come back and are significantly worse. The most noticeable of all was the weight gain. In 6 months I gained 150lbs. When I brought this to the attention of Dr K she referred me to a \"weight specialist\" endocrinologist (we will call him Dr B) and told me that it wasn't the tumor that did this,, because \"prolactinomas don't cause weight gain\" so I'm no longer her problem. At this point I'm frustrated and upset. My doctor who seemed so positive outright abandoned me. I went ahead and followed up with Dr B who took one look at me, prescribed me diet pills and swapped me to Cabergoline. I haven't heard from him since. \n\nAt that point I wanted to know how much longer I needed to stay on medication... do I need another MRI? I mean, I have a growth on my pituitary gland, we should check that. So I reached out to my primary care physician. He helped me get a referral to a specialist at an outside hospital with Dr M. I was really excited to see Dr M because this hospital has such an outstanding reputation. However, after we had a new MRI done there is evidence the prolactinoma hasn't reduced in size at all, it's gotten bigger by a millimeter on each side. Not only that, but the report reads that it is now pressing on the pituitary gland, which it was not in 2019. So what does Dr M say? She writes back a two sentence email full of misspellings: Not a tumor, it's a lesion that will never go away. If you took your medication it would be smaller. \n\nExcuse me. WHAT. \n\nSorry for the long post. I'm feeling really disheartened and so lost right now after seeing so many physicians. It's taken so long to get to this point and I feel like I'm worse off than I've ever been. Where do I go from here? There's only one other hospital in my major city that even works with endocrine stuff, but we all know how hard establishing care can be. Should I file a grievance?

Reason for going to the doctors was a case of hypochondria proved right. For a long while I felt as if something was off in my body. I couldn't stop gaining weight no matter how much i dieted or worked out. I gained nearly 100lbs. (150 to 243) One thing I couldn't shake was the excessive amount of bubbles in my urine, which I've come to learn over time was just surface tension of urine hitting water- that's normal for guys who pee standing up.\n\nThe doctor asked me how my libido was and I admitted that I felt less sexual and had trouble maintaining an erection. She perked up when she heard that. I was 27 at the time. She ordered a blood test that discovered low T. Was sent to urologist who was going to prescribe me testosterone but did\u200b a prolactin test first. Bingo, prolactin through the roof. MRI confirmed. T was at 62 when low is about 300.\n\nGot started on cabergoline. Almost instant result: I precum like a faucet sometimes and my deodorant stopped working as effectively. Then I started to grow actual facial hair that requires shaving more often. (I could have gone 2-3 weeks to have what little hair I had to grow back.)\n\nMy sex drive rebound and my erections last for the duration of sex. Unfortunately my stamina is not very good but I'm not sure if it's because of the medicine or not. Previously I had been able to last longer.\n\nMy T levels are about 300ish. I took to the cabergoline well, at 1.5mg 2x a week. No side effects except I have shitty sleep on nights that I take it. The tumor which I nicknamed ['ghostie'](http://i.imgur.com/CfUcNxG.jpg) is now about the size of a small grape. I may need to take cabergoline for the rest of my life.\n\nThe only thing that still plagues me is the inability to lose a bulk amount of the weight that I put on. I now weigh 230ish pounds, and have put on some muscle. For my body type/height I should be about 170lbs. I'd like to be more fit and muscular and I'm contemplating asking to be put on testosterone shots if my T is still low. I think it'll help with weight loss and muscle building.\n\nOverall I feel lucky to have gotten the Cadillac of head tumors.

The gynecologist office I was at had a Nurse Practitioner who kept up prescribing the original dose of 2.5mg/day to \"float\" me til I could see a new specialist after I was (insurance) dropped from my orginal endocrinologist after diagnosis.  When I was unable to see a specialist within 6 months due to wait times to establish as a new patient, I was cut off of my Rx.  So I've been frantic trying not to go cold run out on my meds.  Doctors won't prescribe without me seeing the specialist but I'm also not supposed to stop taking it without supervision--a cruel cycle.  A new NP at a general health clinic recently upped my dose to 5mg a day when I had severe chest tenderness/swelling (even post top-surgery/double mastectomy).

I'm based in the US. My husband and I have been trying to conceive, unsuccessfully, which is what led us down the path of checking hormones, seeing the outrageous levels for prolactin (I believe the range they used was 5 - 30, and mine was 70). \n\nI was originally on cabergoline, which caused such hypotension, I felt faint just sitting in my chair trying to work. I wasn't even able to take my dogs for a walk, as I was afraid I'd pass out on the walk. \n\nThen, my doctor switched me to bromocriptine, which caused constipation and some mood issues, but was much better than cabergoline...until the insomnia started. First, I was waking up a few times a night, having a hard time going back to sleep. Then, it escalated to being unable to sleep at all until the early morning, getting only 2-3 hours of sleep per night. \n\nI've stopped taking the bromocriptine and emailed my doctor to see what my alternatives are. I know this is a tumor, but I refuse to live my life balancing side effects, being utterly miserable. \n\nI'll be getting my doctor's opinion on Monday, most likely. But, it's hard talking to people in my life about it. I don't think they understand. My parents didn't have trouble conceiving, and I'm the first child to start trying for children. I'm also the only person in my family with a prolactinoma. At this point, y'all, I'm ready to ask if we can do surgery to just get it out and be done with it. I'm so over having to worry about what the next medication and side effect(s) will be.

I just wanted to ask about others\u2019 experience with getting diagnosed, specifically - what symptom made you go to your GP to get that initial check up? \n\nFor me, it was 2 things. My periods have been irregular my whole life and are only getting further and further apart (my cycle used to be 45-60days, now it seems to be closer to the 60 day range) and I never really cared much until I got married then I started worrying about fertility so I just wanted a general check up on that front. I got a blood test and my prolactin was 570 (only slightly raised as the high end of normal is 500). GP asked for a repeat test, mentioned that it COULD be a benign tumor, but stress can raise prolactin levels so I needed a retest. \n\nAround the same time, I realized I\u2019d been having headaches 3-4x a week for over a year and the last 6 months was every single day. I scheduled a separate GP appt, they recommended me getting my eyes checked as a first resort and then go from there. Turns out my prescription changed from R-1.75 L-1.25 to R-2.25 L-1.75 in less than 10 months time. Doc said the headaches were most likely muscular and would ease up, at least partially, when I got my new prescription lenses. I\u2019m currently doing a 2 week symptom diary before going in for a follow up. I thought my headaches had gone away, but this week I had a headache 3 days in a row that wasn\u2019t helped by ibuprofen or paracetamol. \n\nMy repeat blood test came back and my prolactin is now 680. GP called and said he is referring me to a specialist (didn\u2019t say what kind) and I\u2019d have an appt in 3-4weeks. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing a lot of googling (bad I know lol) but I\u2019m just looking for reassurance that I\u2019m heading in the right direction for some answers. I have a gut feeling it\u2019s a prolactinoma due to some other symptoms (increased facial hair growth on my chin, very tiny amounts of white/milky nipple discharge) but I\u2019m also an anxious person in general so it might just be me catastrophizing. \n\nEither way, I cannot stand these headaches and it\u2019s affecting my daily functioning and my work so I hope there is a concrete reason for them that I can effectively treat sometime very very soon!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1286, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "In the process of getting diagnosed.

I\u2019ve been lurking on both r/PCOS and here and wanted some advice because I feel a bit lost.\n\nI\u2019m 19F. I\u2019ve had irregular periods for around 5 years and have finally decided to get it checked out. I also have excessive facial/other hair growth (so much that I have felt like it was a mistake that I turned out to be a girl and I\u2019m secretly a man) which I understand is another symptom of both PCOS and high prolactin. I had a blood test and I had the following significant results:\n\nSerum LH: 13.2 iu/L [&lt;16]\nPlasma FSH: 6.3 iu/L [0.6-9]\n\nSerum testosterone: 1.8 nmol/L [0-2]\nSerum SHBG: 11 nmol/L [30-100] (abnormal)\nT:SBHG ratio: 16.4 (abnormal - I believe this is called Free Androgen Index, it\u2019s the ratio x 100)\n\nSerum TSH: 4.32 miu/L [0.3-4.2] (abnormal - but only slightly elevated, the doctor also said it probably wasn\u2019t significant)\nSerum free T4: 14.9 pmol/L [9-23]\n\nSerum prolactin: 639 mu/L [100-500] (abnormal, need to repeat test - I believe this is just above 30 in the other unit)\nSerum macroprolactin: No level given but Reported Abnormal - need to repeat test \n\nI will have another blood test soon to look again at the abnormal results and another GP has referred me for an ultrasound as she suspects PCOS.\n\nWhat I\u2019m confused about is my T, LH and FSH are all normal - are these not abnormal in PCOS? And how is my SHBG so abnormal but my T isn\u2019t - what is causing the hirsutism? Is it another hormone similar to T?\n\nThe notes next to my prolactin/macroprolactin results (by the GP I originally spoke to) also mention to rule out anything else that causes hyperprolactinaemia (not pregnant and I don\u2019t take any medications) and if they are still elevated to consider an MRI for a prolactinoma - but the GP I spoke to to discuss these results did not mention this. I also have vision problems (I\u2019m shortsighted but recently I have noticed it to have gotten worse) and I also have double vision (but I\u2019ve had this since childhood?)\n\nI understand that a small % of those with PCOS also have slightly elevated prolactin and many posts on here have much, much higher levels and would see mine as insignificant (and I don\u2019t wish at all to disrespect those who have clearly high levels indicative of a prolactinoma). But I seem to have normal levels of T, LH and FSH, and the ultrasound wouldn\u2019t necessarily rule out PCOS as you can still be diagnosed with or without cysts on the ovaries. \n\nLogical me knows I should have the ultrasound as the presence of cysts would confirm PCOS but I guess I am just worried that I could have caught a potential prolactinoma early as my levels are not that high and both conditions show similar symptoms.\n\nSorry for the long post. I don\u2019t know if any of this made sense of how I\u2019m feeling (I don\u2019t know how I am feeling either tbh).

Last week I was diagnosed with a 4.4 x 6.4mm microadenoma. \n\nLast June my husband and I decided we wanted to start a family, so we went to the OB/Gyn to check-in and talk about fetus-friendly psych medications. I started tracking basal body temperature and ovulation so that we can time our sex to maximize our chances. Between June and September, I didn't get a single positive ovulation test, and I wasn't really having periods - just brown spotting. I went back to the doctor and she had my husband do a semen analysis, and I went in for labs and an ultrasound. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband's swimmers were fine, my bits looked healthy and were in working order, but my prolactin came back at 98.8ng/ml. So more labs. The second prolactin came back at 95.5. The doctor thinks it might be my medication, but there's a small, unlikely chance it's a brain tumor. I change medications again. Two months later in early February, I get labs drawn for the third time. My prolactin is at 81.6 ng/mL and the doctor is more serious and concerned during the follow-up. She tells my husband and me that it's either a tumor or an over-active pituitary. If it's a tumor then it's visiting with endocrinology or neurosurgery, depending on its size. If it's over-active pituitary then tough shit, there are meds for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had my MRI last week, and a few hours later the hospital called and told me I have a brain tumor, and immediately gave me information for an endocrinologist. The tech sounded so serious and somber, but I just couldn't connect with it. I was ecstatic. After so many months of tears, being poked and prodded, and the pain of seeing countless friends announce their happy pregnancies I couldn't believe I was so close to having a plan forward. Part of me is devastated that I'm basically infertile until the tumor is treated, but there will be a treatment plan. It's not permanent, it's not forever, it's not an immutable fact of my existence. Tina the Tiny Tumor is not going to be a permanent resident in my noggin until the end of my days. I have been living with low libido, painful sex, adult acne (I'm 28 please make it stop), and absent periods since at least 2016, and the thought that that doesn't have to be my normal anymore is so exciting.

After going to an eye doctor, I was able to get glasses that sort of helped, but never quite properly. After a few follow up visits, the doctor was unable to find anything and advised to wait until the issue becomes a worse problem.   \nFast forward to 2019, and I began experiencing frequent headaches that I attributed to eye strain due to regular computer use and bad glasses. The headaches slowly progressed to an almost daily occurrence, and also increased in severity. My vision was unchanged and slightly blurry but still barely affected my day to day.   \nEarly 2020, and my vision began to rapidly decline. Due to the closure of many non-essential businesses, I  was unable to schedule an optometrist apt. until late May. At this point I had bi-lateral hemianopsia; however, each eye would compensate for the other, making it difficult to notice unless specifically testing for it. The day before my first doctor appointment, I experienced the worst pain in my life in the form of a thunderclap headache that was caused by a hemorrhaging of the tumor.  The next day, MRI revealed the Prolactinoma (4.2 x 3.1 x 1.9 cm) and blood test resulted that my prolactin level was 6,960 ng/ml.\n\nMy testosterone levels at the beginning were measured at 50.3pg/ml. As you might expect, I have no drive, and I have been lethargic for quite  a while. I always thought this was just how I was, not a symptom of a hormone imbalance. \n\nI have been only taking cabergoline for about a year now and I am now taking 5mg once per day after several dosage plans. Luckily, I have not experienced any of the worse side effects, and only mild dopaminergic ones on behavior. My prolactin is still high (674 ng/ml), and my testosterone is still low. Every test shows steady decrease in prolactin, however testosterone is consistently sub normal range. I have complete recovery of eye sight with 20/20 vision, and absolutely no improvement in mood/drive.

These are the ingredients:\n\n **Amount Per Vege Capsule:**  \n*Vitamins:*  \nVitamin B1 (Thiamine) 50mg  \nVitamin B2 (Riboflavin) 50mg  \nVitamin B3 (Nicotinamide) 20mg  \nVitamin B5 (Calcium pantothenate) 50mg  \n**Activated B6 (Pyridoxal 5\u2019 \u2013 phosphate) 40mg**  \nVitamin B9 (Folic Acid) 300mcg  \nActivated Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin) 50mcg  \nCholine L-Bitartrate 365mg \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI was wondering if it would be ok/safe to take 3 P5P pills a day + 1 B complex pill a day considering it already has 40mg of P5P in it? Which would amount to a total of 190mg of P5P daily. Would that be ok?   \n\n\nJust asking out of concern because I understand these vitamins can be dangerous.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1597, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/abRYr2SWtAfH84j6I1x9Y8lwLGIc4agmKRcdkg7g_Qk.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 131, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "P5P for lowering prolactin?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi everyone,\n\nAbout 8 years ago (at the time 18M, currently 26M), I put on 60-70lbs in a few months for seemingly no reason. Dieticians/nutritionists, exercise physiologists, personal trainers and the works have given up on me over the years. It seemed that no amount of exercise, calorie deficit or surplus would affect my weight. Like many people here, the words \"you're just not working out/dieting correctly\" frustrated me to no end.\n\nThis past winter, I was diagnosed with a small prolactinoma after an MRI. I had high prolactin (27.4 ug/L) and low testosterone (6.0 nmol/L) levels. My endo told me this was likely the cause of my inability to gain or lose weight, and I was so excited to finally go back to my old self. Reading posts online about how others in my situation would shed obscene amounts of weight in weeks or months on Cabergoline gave me so much hope.\n\nMy hormones entered the normal range after about 3 months on 0.25mg of cabergoline weekly. Currently at 9 months, my prolactin is now 7.8 ug/L and testosterone is 13.1 nmol/L. Despite this, and with considerable exercise and dieting, I have still not been able to gain or lose a single pound, and seeing all of these success stories has me more dejected than I can describe.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience, and were you eventually able to lose weight? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1566,

After an ECG, CT scan and chest xray they weren't able to figure out why it happened. But the doctor I saw said he is interested about the Cabergoline I'm taking (0.5mg once a week), and mentioned it might have caused low blood pressure and caused me to have the fainting and convulsion episodes. But I've been taking it for two years and have never had that happen before in my life. Since no real cause was confirmed, I'm unable to drive for 6 months.\n\nMy partner saw it happen and I have no recollection of it, but apperantly I was struggling to breathe and my eyes were wide and I couldn't control my arms and they were convulsing. Then I passed out and was unresponsive. Happened twice.  \n\nHave any of you heard if this before? I researched about side effects of cab and it mentioned low BP but even the doctor said that was a weird situation and doesn't think it's likely. I have more appointments coming up to talk about it. \n\nMy most recent appointment with an endocrinologist said my levels have just returned back to normal (from my prolactin being 3250ng/mL in May to 232ng/mL this month). This is my second time on Cabergoline since before may they took me off because my levels were normal again. Went back on it in May. \n\nJust wanted to hear if anyone has experienced this or has heard of this before.\n\nThank you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1556, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cabergoline- fainting and convulsions?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/ou8kwq/cabergoline_fainting_and_convulsions/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dek55", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1jp0qqyq", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1627580161, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/ou26vk/macroadenoma_treatable_by_medication/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ou26vk", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/ou26vk/macroadenoma_treatable_by_medication/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1627580172, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello,\nWhat are experiences of users with macroadenoma here, are you treating your macroadenoma with medication or surgery?\nSeeing conflicting reports- some say macroadenoma, despite its size, nowadays is treated by drugs, others say surgery.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1556, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Macroadenoma treatable by medication?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/ou26vk/macroadenoma_treatable_by_medication/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "RedditAccount28", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_hkafz", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1627493762, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/otet4n/male_is_a_prolactin_of_176_cause_for_concern/", "gildings": {}, "id": "otet4n", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/otet4n/male_is_a_prolactin_of_176_cause_for_concern/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1627493774, "score": 1, "selftext": "Free t3: 4.3\n\nFree t4: 1.8\n\nTSH:2.83\n\nProlactin:17.6\n\nTestosterone:313\n\ndoc wants to schedule an MRI.

Would that indicate tumor growth (if I have an adenoma)?\n\nI am annoyed because the brain MRI isn't for another three weeks, and I'm miserable with a large weight gain, worsening depression, and anxiety (the Pristiq doesn't work for me). \n\nSo I take it that there's absolutely nothing I can do to lose weight in the meantime?

Growing up before puberty this was never the case however around 16 I started to store fat there for no reason and im concerned that could have been when the tumor started to grow (if there is one). I am concerned this may be because of my  elevated prolactin levels at they were outside of the reference range both times and actually increased, (suggesting the tumor grew a bit???). Furthermore, I believe I have seem some discharge from the gynecomastia before but it is hard to detect since it is only a little bit so I am not certain about that symptom. \n\nUpon seeing this my doctor said she is a little concerned and would schedule an MRI to look for the tumor but she is also sceptical if it can even be the tumor that is causing it because it is only slightly elevated, whereas prolactinomas normally cause P levels which are extremely large. The MRI is also over $2000 which is why I have not gotten it yet but I would like to. Do you all think these prolactin levels could be caused by a tumor? \n\nAlso,\n\nI workout often and I have seen some literature suggesting that intense exercise (what i do) may raise prolactin levels, could that be the reason?

My treatment is going for almost 6months.\n\nIt\u2019s a mess, you are becoming a different person (at least I did) and you have no idea why. I couldn\u2019t sleep, I couldn\u2019t sit in calm, I was exhausted and \u201cdone with life\u201d, and I had no idea why. I was super emotional about everything, no offends, but I\u2019ve acted like a woman with her period, like 24/7/365, I couldn\u2019t react normally, it always was drama. I was super angry at me, my memory was danzo. I was med-student, when the exams came, 1st part was nice, but as my doctor explained me later, at some point, my prolactin was that high, that my memory was gone. So they\u2019ve kicked me out from the school. And the carousel continued, I was more and more angry and sad. I\u2019ve overused drugs at that point, because I had no idea what to do, or what\u2019s going on. In early December I got my appointment with a doctor, he said that my prolactin is over 600 mUI/l, and sent me for MRI. So here we go, I was diagnosed with 1.8mm microprolactinoma, I think all of us know those feelings, those thoughts how bad it might be. I had no idea at those times, what all was caused by elevated prolactin. My treatment begun, so I\u2019ve started with caber, after few weeks, I\u2019ve could sleep, but my moods..hah, caber is the worst and the most craziest \u201cdrug\u201d I\u2019ve ever been on. But it helped me in the end, so I guess, we owe one to the Pfizer, haha. After all, my prolactin got to the ranges, but my libido was still gone, my D just was off, and didn\u2019t care about me. He said that prolactin destroyed my T, and prescribed me Tamoxifen, which was nice my T raised over the ranges, but the problems didn\u2019t disappear. The fast elevation of T erased my E2 over the edges, so currently I\u2019m on anastrazol, and I hope it\u2019s my last part of this hormones carousel.\n\nWhy am I writing all of this? Well, first it is because of myself. This \u201cjourney\u201d, is hard, I know that, you know that. In a year or so, I wanna just save my feelings and read them, remind myself how bad it was, and what I\u2019ve been through, to fight more. The second thing..I remember how scared I was, how lost I was. I don\u2019t know, if that gonna be helpful for anyone, but I hope it gonna be. Yo, you\u2019ll be fine, no matter how bad it looks. It\u2019ll take a time, a lot of time. My ED is still not gone fully, and my libido is not really back in 100%, but it got better, a lot.

Never been pregnant or tried to be. Diagnosed with a macro sized tumor (4.1 cm) March 2020. Tumor is still macro sized (\\~2.8cm) and controlled with cabergoline (just increased from 3 tablets to 4 tablets a week). All hormones have leveled to normalcy except estrogen. It's still low, but not astronomically like it was. My regular endo believes this is the reason I still don't have a period which means I don't ovulate. My husband and I would like to start TTC within 6-12 months, hence the referral to the RE.\n\nI am one of those people who researches my health issues obsessively because I have anxiety over health procedures, especially reproductive health due to childhood and doctor inflicted trauma. I need to know what to expect and ask nurses/doctors to talk me through with what they're doing. With that said, I completely understand and am open to doing those procedures but I need to have some directions and know what to expect to prepare myself mentally. It's been very difficult for me to even receive routine female health care due to this anxiety and avoiding the GYN led to the monstrous size of my tumor. I regret it every day. \n\nI made sure to schedule with the most experienced female RE in the state (maybe even the surrounding states). My friend also used this doctor to conceive her baby in 2020 and has glowing compliments for her. This took the edge off the anxiety but it's still pretty strong.\n\nSo, what could be generally expected at a first RE appointment? I've read about vaginal ultrasound procedures, scopes and similar things. Is that something the RE may want to do? Or is it safe to assume it's just a hormonal imbalance and we'll try injections, pills, etc and then explore other (more invasive) treatments/diagnosing procedures? Since we're a little way out from TTC I was also curious what they could actually do for me right now. \n\nThank you so much for even just reading this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1531, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need Advice for First Reproductive Endocrinologist Appointment", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/on3qbk/need_advice_for_first_reproductive/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Deathgripsandchill", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5jg36nb9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626627305, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/omuezv/low_t_high_prolactin_worried_about_tumour_any/", "gildings": {}, "id": "omuezv", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/omuezv/low_t_high_prolactin_worried_about_tumour_any/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1626627316, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi.

I've had gynecomastia since I've been middle school aged 11-13. I went to my family doctor telling him that I was experiencing nipple discharge in both nipples. I had an ultrasound done and everything came back clear so a bloodtest was ordered. My thyroid Stimulating Hormone was tested at 3.13 mIU/L, and my Prolactin which was tested at 36 ug/L. Now i've relatively kept up with a gym regime since I was 14. I never made progress like any of my friends ever. My muscle mass stayed relatively low, while my bodyfat stayed relatively high despite having a clean diet. I always suspected low testosterone but my doctor would never test me despite these issues. I wonder how to proceed with this information. I fear my doctor will dismiss the prolaction levels because it isn't extremely high despite it being more then 2x more then normal amount. So to summarize I have had almost daily nipple discharge for the past few weeks, gynecomastia ever since I was a child, low muscle mass with a high bodyfat, my erections have been weaker, but to be fair I would not complain about my sex drive.

That time of age where puberty hits and you start to grow facial hair and become more assertive or whatever, just didn\u2019t take for me. My nipples started to pudge out all of a sudden and would be tender. I also went from being very active (wrestling and football and skateboarding) and weighing 125lbs at 13, to weighing 185lbs at 14.\n\nFast forward to Highschool. When I was 16, I started to notice that my chest was getting fatter and tender. Eventually I started lactating. Now for a 16 year old male going through the Bs of Highschool and a weird off brand of liberty, I was embarrassed and scared of anyone finding out and refused to go to a doctor. I started having sexual encounters at 16 and had a tough time completing or even maintaining an erection.  This did not help my already depleted sexual confidence considering I was still lactating.\n\nFast forward again to college. I was at a party and started to get a really bad headache. I went to bed early and woke up with blinding pain in my head. I literally was losing sight from the pulses of pain in my head. I finally went to the doctor for tests and after an MRI and bloodwork, they confirmed my prolactin level was higher than a third trimester pregnant female. I was put on Cabergoline for treatment but due to medical expenses and having a low paying job without insurance, I had to stop taking it. \n\nFast forward to today. I\u2019m 30 years old. My current girlfriend pushed me to start taking care of myself again so I\u2019m back on my medicine. I have much more energy, focus and more stable moods.  I\u2019m no longer lactating and no complains in the bedroom.\n\nThe whole reason I am posting this, is when I was younger I got so scared by all of my symptoms and embarrassed, thinking I was the only one.

I just joined today. I wanted to share a bit of my journey and ask a few questions as well. To preface this, just know that I have generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder and, while I don't like to admit it, these disorders do have an impact on the way that I make decisions/behave. When I was about 16 my cycle stopped. At the time I was sexually active and terrified to tell my mother, because I thought that I was pregnant. I spoke with a few friends of mine who got me a pregnancy test which came back negative. At that point, even thought I knew I wasn't pregnant, I was still afraid to tell my mom about my cycle stopping because I was worried she would ask why I hadn't mentioned it before. I know that it was stupid and irresponsible, but I didn't mention it to her until I was 18. We went to Planned Parenthood, which is where I learned I had high levels of prolactin. I was referred to an endo, had an MRI which confirmed prolactinoma, and started taking cabergoline. However, when I was 19, I aged out of being covered under my mom's insurance and I had a lapse in insurance coverage. By the time I was able to establish my own insurance several months had gone by and I was afraid to try to re-establish treatment. And, to be quite honest, I didn't really know where to start. So I ended up convincing myself that, because a prolactinoma is benign, it wasn't really an issue. Again, stupid and irresponsible. Over the past few years, I have had an increase in headaches, mood swings, weight gain, hair loss, and countless other symptoms. About a month ago, I had a headache so severe I thought that I was having a stroke or an aneurysm. I immediately went to the ER where I was given a CT scan to check for brain bleeding and an MRI. They determined there was no brain bleed and that my tumor had nearly doubled in size, from 1.3 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm in 2013 to 2.7 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm. They said I had suffered an occipital headache, likely due to my tumor and referred me to a neurosurgeon. This was kind of like the slap in the face that I needed to finally get off of my ass and do something about this. I had been frozen, convincing myself that it wasn't a big deal for so long. Like an \"oh shit\" moment, I guess. Today the neurosurgeon sent me in to get labs done. My prolactin levels, as of today, are 4,123.1 ng/mL. This is my journey so far. I don't know what's going to happen from here, whether they'll have me take cabergoline again or a different medication, or possibly even go the surgical route. But I'm honestly scared. And I know that probably seems silly to those of you who have gone/are currently undergoing treatment for your prolactinomas. So I guess I'm just wondering... Were any of you afraid at this stage of your journey? After confirming the tumor exists (in my case, still exists) but before starting treatment? And, since this specific type of tumor has an impact on our hormones and mood, were any of you afraid of how you would be during/after treatment? I have this irrational fear that getting rid of this tumor is going to have an impact on who I am as a person. I've been living with this and the symptoms for so long that I'm worried I might be different somehow when it's all said and done. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else feels or has felt the same way that I do?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1767, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My (27F) journey", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qmfi1m/my_27f_journey/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PurpleNurple8647", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8ihu7jn1", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1635978741, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qm64e1/does_anyone_have_relief_tips_for_very_sore_breasts/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qm64e1", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": true, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qm64e1/does_anyone_have_relief_tips_for_very_sore_breasts/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1635978752, "score": 1, "selftext": "Please excuse the forward question.

It was more than spotting I was having full on periods during my ovulation week. Eventually after seeing a few different doctors I was sent for bloodwork which showed that my prolactin was slightly elevated. At that time it was only by a very small amount. The doctor bluntly told me I might have a brain tumour and we will retest the blood in one month, if it\u2019s normal there\u2019s nothing to worry about if it goes up we will send for an MRI. The follow up one month later showed normal prolactin levels so I forgot about it for the time being however I continued to have midcycle bleeding for a year. I should also mention prior to all of this starting I suffered with subacute thyroiditis which really messed up my body. I suspect that the subacute thyroid is what started all of this crap.\n\nI eventually sought out the help of another Doctor who tested my blood again and as per my request sent me for an MRI. The reason he sent me for the MRI was because of my anxiety based on what the first doctor casually dropped on me by mentioning a brain tumour but his diagnosis was PCOS although I don\u2019t have many of the symptoms of it. He also ordered a internal ultrasound which revealed a uterine polyp the size of a human thumb which was removed surgically one month later in September 2020. Once the polyp was removed the mid cycle bleeding stopped and my periods were completely normal. In October 2020 my prolactin levels were at 47 so just about double what they should be. In December I got pregnant and I miscarried one month later. I had a D&amp;C The first week of January to clean our any remaining tissues as per doctors recommendation.At the beginning of March I found out I was pregnant again. At the time I had a lot of personal things going on and I decided to end the pregnancy and I had another D&amp;C. In May 2021 I had a follow up bloodwork that showed my prolactin levels were normal no MRI was scheduled and my next blood requisition was ordered for October 2021. \n\nMy doctor called me two days ago and told me that my prolactin is now at 49 so it\u2019s gone up again. I have no other symptoms aside from occasional tiredness but I think that can be attributed to the fact that I don\u2019t get a lot of sleep and I work two very demanding jobs with no days off. I don\u2019t have headaches I don\u2019t have nipple leakage I don\u2019t have anything  my periods are regular. I have a period every 29 to 31 days. The only thing I can say about any difference to my periods is that I don\u2019t have as much cramping and it\u2019s not as heavy as it was when I had the uterine polyp but I also attributed this to the D &amp; C. \n\nI just feel like this has been a complete roller coaster. My first MRI was done with contrast in August 2020 and the results were suspected pituitary microadenoma but it was not confirmed and the only other note said that there was a slight hypo enhancement in that area but nothing concrete. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research as I\u2019m sure many people do when they\u2019re in this position and a lot of it suggests that the levels I have could be related to stress and dopamine and anything above 50 is likely a prolactinoma. I just don\u2019t understand why it keeps fluctuating between normal and double what it should be every time I get news that it\u2019s in the normal range I\u2019m excited and relieved and then I\u2019m back to square one being worried when it\u2019s elevated. \n\nI have a follow up MRI booked in a few months and I\u2019m already dreading that because I generally have a lot of anxiety being in hospitals so that\u2019s going to be fun. I just wanted . input or opinion on this I know that there\u2019s probably not a lot people can say but I guess this was kind of a vent also. It is increasing frustrating to constantly be ba k and forth with my levels and not knowing what\u2019s going on. Even the first MRI showing a slight hypo enhancement but nothing solid was frustrating because I feel like that wasn\u2019t a definitive answer. \n\nThank you to anyone who took the time to read this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1744, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hoping someone can relate to my unique case..suspected prolactinoma.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qh202c/hoping_someone_can_relate_to_my_unique/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "heather748", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_q7o0rts", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1635351392, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qh0asq/looking_for_infoexperiences_on_surgery/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qh0asq", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qh0asq/looking_for_infoexperiences_on_surgery/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1635351403, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello All- I was diagnosed with a prolactinoma macro adenoma in August of this year.

I\u2019ve been on antibiotics for three days and nothings changed yet I\u2019m really hoping that it will get better\u2026 But I have a little faith.

I\u2019ve had low t for some time but it really didn\u2019t seem to causing any problems. Last year my libido fell off a cliff and started having progressively worse ED. Urologist sent me to endo, and test showed elevated prolactin between 70-80, and nearly zero testosterone. They expected much higher prolactin levels if this were prolactinoma, so they suspected adenoma pressing on the stalk of the pituitary causing \u201cstalk effect\u201d. MRI showed a 1x2cm growth that wasn\u2019t touching optic nerve or carotid artery. Docs chose not to treat with caber first because they didn\u2019t think prolactin levels indicated prolactinoma. So surgery was the recommended way to go.\n\nI went to a neurosurgery clinic at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston that has a pituitary clinic, and had a transsphenoidal surgery to remove the tumor. Turns out have been a garden variety prolactinoma they are calling a \u201cpoor secretor\u201d. I was out of the hospital the day after surgery (usually 1-3 days) and had no complications. Six months after surgery prolactin are testosterone are both normal, and no more ED or libido issues. I will need follow up MRIs annually. \n\nTakeaways for me are that 1) Surgery was not fun, but it wasn\u2019t traumatic \u2014 if they recommended surgery don\u2019t talk yourself out of it, 2) go to a clinic that specializes in pituitary surgery \u2014 you want doctors that do this every day (100 or more surgeries a year), 3) follow your post surgery instructions to the letter and there\u2019s a very high probability you will get through it without complications.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1734, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Recent surgery", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qdl2hg/recent_surgery/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "brooklyndweller24", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_875axs14", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1634909392, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qdgz4f/obgyn_said_my_prolactin_was_high_and_only/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qdgz4f", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/qdgz4f/obgyn_said_my_prolactin_was_high_and_only/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1634909404, "score": 1, "selftext": "I know it\u2019s likely that elevated prolactin is from a tumor in most cases, but I do have PCOS.

I have what I think is complicated or messy medical history. In December 2020 I was diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (best way to explain my body doesn\u2019t clear CSF and I have that fluid build up in my head that creates pressure. Can/does mimic symptoms of brain tumor. Puts my vision at risk mainly which is how they found this) and ever since then it\u2019s been a whirlwind of doctor visits and being poked and prodded. Prior to this(2-3 years leading up to the diagnosis) I gained quite a bit of weight which led the doctors to believe what caused this issue and they want me to lose weight to see if it\u2019ll help. \n\nWell I\u2019ve had so much trouble losing weight no matter what I did. When before I would be able to train (weight training, CrossFit, calorie deficits, macronutrients tracking) and would be able to lose weight no issue. Plus I lost my period October/November 2020 (recently got it back end of july 2021). My sex drive was shot and still kinda is. Incredibly fatigued. I also have some nipple discharge/liquid when expressed or sometimes I see it on my nipples and I can clean it up a little bit like clear it from my nippes. I saw my pcp who transferred me to an obgyn who thought I had pcos but transferred me to endocrinologist and she said I do not have pcos. \n\nThey tested my hormones. And the endo says that my hormones are \"fine\" but at first the pcp said that my prolactin does seem elevated. Also the nipple discharge is alarming to me but the endo hasn't addressed it. I sent her a message this last week that I got a picture of it now and she said to just show her next time. I did get a brain MRI back in January or February which didn't really reveal any masses just revealed things common with intracranial pressure. They did find partial empty sella. My neurologist never addressed this with me and I don't know if my endo even knows about this. She just put me on Wegovy for weight loss. I am 5' 4\" 195 lbs 33% BF.

Prolactin was tested twice and was 21.1 and 25.6 ng/mL. Cortisol was  slightly elevated the first time it was tested and was normal the second  time. Thyroid function was normal. LH and FSH were tested twice and  were within the normal range but on the lower end. PCP referred me to an  endo.\n\nEndocrinologist is  concerned about elevated prolactin and cortisol. He  is also concerned  about low T and what he said were low LH and FSH (even  though they're  in the normal range provided by the lab).

I\u2019ve had high prolactin (100-250) since 2014 when I started lactating and lost my period. Around then, I also had onset of depression, GAD and just general fatigue/malaise. The MRI didn\u2019t show a tumor so the  doctor at that time suggested that I just refrain from nipple stimulation during sex (can you believe?!?) and sent me on my way. \n\nFast forward to 2016, I saw a new doctor, got another MRI where still no tumor was spotted, but was put on cabergoline. Medication made me super dizzy, with mega painful moody periods and gave me an uncomfortably high sex drive. But I stayed on it till 2017 when I got pregnant with my daughter. \n\n8 months after I had stopped breastfeeding, I was still lactating so I got back on cabergoline. In 2020, I asked my Endo what the end game was - stay on cabergoline forever for a medical mystery? And he said he honestly didn\u2019t know why I had such high prolactin and referred me to a pituitary clinic. \n\nNew pituitary Endo specialist looked at most recent MRI and the MRI from 2016 with her team and said she definitely saw a tiny tumor on both scans. \ud83d\ude29 \n\nSo now I have surgery scheduled for November. Very terrified of the risk that the surgery could cause more complications than I\u2019m experiencing with the tumor in my head. \n\nSurgeon wouldn\u2019t say whether tumor removal would relieve my mental health symptoms or give me more energy. But his PA said anecdotally people seem to feel better after. \n\nIs the anxiety and depression and fatigue connected to the prolactinoma? Has anyone had the surgery and experienced renewed mental and physical health? Are these symptoms all in my head? Or is it LITERALLY all in my head? \n\nThank you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1716, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is it LITERALLY all in my head?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/q89yv8/is_it_literally_all_in_my_head/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kngkhn", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5jkebyl7", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1634245045, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/q88nlv/my_doctor_asked_me_for_this_test_why_cause_i_have/", "gildings": {}, "id": "q88nlv", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/q88nlv/my_doctor_asked_me_for_this_test_why_cause_i_have/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1634245056, "score": 1, "selftext": "prolactin: 3 samples, one every 20 minutes, after having cannulated a vein for at least 20 '.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1715, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "my doctor asked me for this test why? cause I have already a prolactin trst", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/q88nlv/my_doctor_asked_me_for_this_test_why_cause_i_have/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Royal-Check6914", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_d1scxo1n", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1634218306, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/q7zs6g/did_cabergoline_give_you_anxiety/", "gildings": {}, "id": "q7zs6g", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/q7zs6g/did_cabergoline_give_you_anxiety/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1634218318, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm trying to te-trace my steps a little.

Again the results came back slightly elevated but even less than the time before. (36 ng/ml)  At this time it had been 2 months without a period. My doctor is really thorough and wanted to rule out a prolactinoma. We both agreed I was under a lot of stress due to work so I really went into the mri as just a measure of ruling something out that I knew wasn\u2019t there. I tried to see if there was anyway to do the mri without the contrast but I was told for pituitary tumors they really need to do the contrast. I started my period IN THE MRI machine which further validated to me that I didn\u2019t have the prolactinoma. Got my results the next day and there was the 5mm prolactinoma.

Three months ago I started seeing a down trend with a level of 64.\n\nToday I got my latest blood tests and my prolactin is at 36. \ud83d\ude42\n\nThe team that treated me from 2011-2017 is recognized as one of the best in the US for pituitary issues. However, they believed that lifestyle changes would have no impact on my prolacinoma. \n\nAfter a situation where I had to fight thousands of dollars in fraudulent medical bills, I was untreated for two years. \n\nThen I got serious about trying to heal myself without bromo or cabergoline in 2019. My tumor was majorly impacting my day to day (brain fog, exhaustion, weight gain, fatigue, y'all know how it goes). I didn't want to go through the side effects of either medication option but I also couldn't keep ignoring my situation. After reviewing new research about the gut brain connection, I decided to find a new doctor. \n\nI can't point at just one miracle or cure but here's what I've done to help:\n\n* found a really supportive functional medicine doctor\n* looked at all of my hormones in depth and worked with my doctor to balance estrogen, testosterone,  progesterone, and vitamin D\n* addressed my nutritional deficiencies (low: b12, ferritin, magnesium, protein, selenium) \n* removed dairy and gluten from my diet\n* diagnosed with dysbiosis, resolved with specific pre and probiotics \n* looked at my cortisol throughout the day instead of just one measurement\n* worked on lowering my cortisol levels with yoga, meditation, food, and a regular sleep schedule\n\nThis approach hasn't been easy but I'm finding a symptom free life and I'm excited to see what other progress my future holds.

I wasnt really aware I was that low but I'd been feeling fatigued almost all the time. Somehow, I still forced myself to the gym and was working out 5 times a week for more than a year before I saw my doctor about my T levels. It made so much sense as to why I only gained weight from training and was tired constantly. \n\nFrom there my doctor referred me to a urologist cause she was concerned I was having issues with my testes and possible pituitary problems too. I waited a month and a half till I got to see my urologist and she wanted me to get an MRI of my brain. I was already browsing this sub before I was officially diagnosed, but now I know I have prolactinoma. Apparently its about 11.7mm in size but my doctor didnt state if it was a micro or macroprolactinoma (pretty positive its macro!). My prolactin levels are around 352.32 ng/mL.\n\nApparently while viewing the MRI the radiology department was concerned if I had Chiari Malformation so now I'm going to see a Neurosurgeon and an Endocrinologist as well. I honestly didnt expect any of this. I didnt expect to be told no matter how hard I trained I would've gained weight, or the fact that I wasnt insane about having hypogonadism caused by low T. Or the chain of doctors I'm needing to see cause these issues need to be resolved. It's been a validating journey learning all of this in the past 2 months.

Below is a rundown of my experience. Please remember:  \n* I'm not going to go too much into why I decided to get the surgery, as it was a very emotional and hard decision. But I've tried to provide a little insight into my mindset. \n* This is specific to my situation, and should not be applied blankly to anyone else. Questions or concerns should be directed to your Doctors.  \n  \nDiagnosis and First Year (end of 2014 - 2015)  \n- Mid 20s, F  \n- I was diagnosed after sustained amenorrhea.  \n- My prolactin levels at diagnosis were 191 ng/mL.  \n- An MRI a few weeks later revealed a 9x7x7mm microadenoma.  \n- I was put on 0.5 mg Cab twice a week for the first year.  \n- Within 6 months, my prolactin levels were down to the appropriate levels.  \n- By the end of my first year on Cab, the microadenoma had shrunk in size to around 7x5x5mm.  \n- Feedback from my doctor was that you should take Cab as the first line of defense for treatment, and that things could be reevaluated in a few years, or if I decided to have children, etc. We talked about how hopefully, I would eventually be able to shrink my tumor to a more manageable size, or shrink completely, and eventually \"wean\" myself off of the Cab in a few years, as many people do.  \n  \nMaintenance (2016-2018)  \n- After the first year, I was able to decrease my Cab dosage to 0.5 mg once a week.   \n- I was really diligent about taking the Cab correctly for the first couple years. \n- However, as more time passed and other life/health issues arose, there were one or two times where I would forget to take my medicine correctly. Whenever I would mess up or miss doses, my Prolactin levels would shoot back up to the 60s-90s ng/mL.  \n- By the end of 2018 (four years on Cab), my tumor had never shrunk below the 7x5x5mm seen in 2015.  \n  \nTreatment Options &amp; Decision (2019)  \n- At my yearly check-in with my Endo, we began to evaluate the long-term outlook for my treatment. He was pretty convinced that Cab was not going to have any additional impact on the tumor size, and that going off of it would drive my prolactin levels back up.  \n- My only option from a medication standpoint was to remain on Cab \"until menopause\", and if I ever decided to have kids, we would put a game plan together at that time for how to deal. He had every reason to believe I could have a healthy pregnancy.  \n- While I know my situation could have been a lot worse, and there are many conditions where daily medication is required, the thought of having to take a medication for the rest of my life completely freaked me out. I felt a total lack of control and trust of my body, while also having to assert control in so many decisions that would now need to be planned out. I felt like I needed to take a more active treatment rather than passively managing, and we started to talk about surgery.   \n- I'm incredibly lucky that my Endo and my Neurosurgeon are very close, and work together often on these kinds of surgeries, along with a great ENT surgeon. All parties agreed that the location and growth of my tumor did not pose any added concerns for removing it. This is not necessarily the case for everyone, where the tumor may be hard to reach, may be wrapped around other things that make it hard to remove, where only a portion can be removed, etc.  \n- I asked my Neuro if he felt like this was an \"elective surgery\" and if I was silly for doing this when I could just take medication forever. He was quick to clarify that it wasn't an elective surgery, but rather one of several treatment options. I asked the age old, \"Well if I was your daughter, would you want me to have this surgery?\" and he said that in his opinion, ultimately things that shouldn't be in your body, like a tumor, should be removed if possible. That you never know in the future if that foreign thing could \"become an active player\" and cause me additional problems later. And that surgery while I was young and healthy is always better for recovery.  \n- So I made the decision to have the surgery.  \n  \nSurgery &amp; Initial Recovery (2019)  \n- I think pre-surgery was pretty easy. There were of course final check-ins with all my doctors and final MRI imaging.  \n- I don't really remember how long the surgery last, but I think it was about 6 hours. They were able to get all of the tumor out.   \n- They went through my nose to get to the Pituitary, so the ENT surgeon did that part of it, and then the Neuro did the rest. Endo was there for consultation.  \n- I was in the hospital for 2 days.  \n- I can't really remember the pain levels while in the hospital, but I don't think it was extreme, and I remember they had ice packs on my face which helped.  \n- While in the hospital, a lot of fluid/blood leaks out of your nose. I pretty much had what looked like a gauze mustache taped under my nose for the first week, which I would change out often as it became saturated.  \n  - For me the worsttt part of recovery is that you cannot breathe through your nose. It's completely packed. This will last for about a month. Initially it's awful because blood/discharge from your nose, along with saliva, go down the back of your throat, and if you're sleeping on your back you start to cough and choke on it. You basically are a mouth breather for a month, which is very hard, especially when it comes to sleeping.  \n- Eventually once your nose clears, I started rinsing with a nedi pot kind of thing a few times a day.  \n- I needed to closely monitor my levels after surgery, as the Pituitary is healing and it controls the output of so many hormones and things in our body. In my case, my Sodium levels went very low, and resulted in high blood pressure and high anxiety. I had to limit my water intake to basically one glass of water per day for the first week while those evened out again, but it was very strange to all the sudden have intense anxious thoughts that prevented me from falling asleep. This lasted about a week after being home from the hospital.   \n- I experienced the normal extreme fatigue and brain fog for the first month. \n- I was out of work for six weeks. I would say the first four were where I felt the most immediate side effects, especially as my nose healed and I finally could breathe through it, and the last two weeks I felt more normal and less fatigued. \n  \nOne Year Later (2020)  \n- One year later, and the only lasting effect I feel from the surgery is that I can tell the inside of my nose has changed. This sounds gross, but blowing my nose is different, and boogers get stuck in places they didn't get stuck in before. I attribute this to whatever scarring or healing from the surgery inside my nose. My ENT says to rinse with one of those nedi pot kind of things.  \n- At my one-year post-op, my MRI showed no signs of a tumor (there is always chance it could grow back), and my hormone levels were all normal. I will likely have an MRI and bloodwork done yearly for the next couple years.  \n  \nIn short, I'm really happy I got the surgery. I had an amazing care team of doctors who made me feel totally taken care of. After 6 years of treatment, I am happy to have this chapter behind me.  \n  \nI hope this perspective helps you.

Im still having nipple sensitivity and bloating... I figured the prolactin was causing the nipple thing and once it came down it'd be fine...

I've been taking cabergoline since September 2020, starting on 0.25 mg 2x/wk, then 0.5 mg 2x/wk after 4 weeks. Since taking this medication, I've experienced increased paranoia and anxiety. I ignored these side effects for some time, hoping it would just go away. It wasn't until December that I had my first panic attack, which I've never experienced before in my life. In general, this medication just makes me feel like I'm high all the time. I dropped my dose to 0.25 mg because I couldn't handle the feeling of being high all the time at 0.5 mg. Even with the decreased dose, I've continued to have unexplained anxiety as well as the following other symptoms: fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, pins and needles feeling on my left foot, visual disturbances (flashing lights when I close my eyes), irregular periods, and feeling like I have pressure in my head (usually a few hours after taking cab). \n\nI met with my endocrinologist via virtual visit today for the first time since starting the medication, and she was super dismissive of my symptoms, and claimed them to be unrelated to the medication. I felt like she wasn't really sympathetic toward my experience on this medication and only offered a blood workup and said for me to see a primary care doc for my anxiety. \n\nHas anyone else had similar experiences?

Its contributed to me being lethargic, depressed, gaining weight etc. I was just wondering when I can expect some relief for my symptoms?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1174, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How long did it take to feel better?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/l100d0/how_long_did_it_take_to_feel_better/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TheMadGraveWoman", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_795hqpe2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1611073104, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/l0n1yx/did_wellbutrin_help_you_with_the_symptoms_of/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l0n1yx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/l0n1yx/did_wellbutrin_help_you_with_the_symptoms_of/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1611073155, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1173, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Did Wellbutrin help you with the symptoms of hyperprolactinemia?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/l0n1yx/did_wellbutrin_help_you_with_the_symptoms_of/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "TheMadGraveWoman", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_795hqpe2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1611039163, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/l0ee6y/did_some_of_you_ever_had_a_double_vision/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l0ee6y", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/l0ee6y/did_some_of_you_ever_had_a_double_vision/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1611039174, "score": 1, "selftext": "Mine was short-lived.

So happy to have found this sub. It gets a little difficult sometimes trying to explain this to others and hearing actual advice.\n\nI (27F) have hyperprolactinemia. I first noticed symptoms while showering. I began lactating which freaked me out. I have no children and I have never been pregnant. \n\nWent to the doctor where my prolactin was tested results (130s range) and sure enough there\u2019s a tiny benign tumor hanging out on my pituitary gland. I was diagnosed mid 2019 and began taking cabergoline (.5) twice a week. The summer of 2020 I had to stop treatment for about 6 months due to an insurance change and the wait time to see a new endocrinologist was ridiculous! At this point, my lady blood work had my prolactin levels still high, but in the 60s range.\n\nI just got into see a new specialist, but I\u2019m not thrilled with the care I received. For one, I\u2019m charting back up in the 200 range for prolactin. She begin cabergoline again on me this week. No mention of wanted a new MRI scan, and she didn\u2019t really give me answers on some of the more significant issues that might arise. \n\nSo for the ones who have some knowledge and can help out me at ease:\n\n1) As my levels drop down, will I start losing weight? I\u2019ve put on a few pounds since the time being off the medicine and my prolactin levels increased. \n\n2) My libido is completely gone. Any advice for helping that return?\n\n3) I\u2019m also concerned about how this may come into play with infertility.

The doctor asked if I had ever had a blood test for prolactin. I said no and she said she recommends that I get one. \n\nMy the main symptoms I went in for are irregular period, (missing my period all together) acne, weight issues, and abnormal hair growth. All of this seemed to set in pretty bad after I got my birth control almost 3 years ago. I was on Nexplanon and was having major mood issues, weight gain, acne, and overall just didn\u2019t like it anymore, so I got it taken out about 2 years ago. After I got it out some of these issues continued, besides the major mood issues. I am 21 years old by the way. I have worked out, been eating healthy for most of my life and am still overweight. I decided to make a large change last year around October and lost 25lbs, my skin cleared up and my periods came back while I was on the diet, which is a whole grain, almost no dairy, no sugars and no salt or fat, high protein and high vegetable diet. Something really stressful happened so I didn\u2019t continue with it but still maintained my weight loss. I had a couple periods after that but to be honest I have never been great at keeping track of my periods. \n\nI also have really bad anxiety and have for most of my life and go in and out of depression depending on how bad my anxiety is.

I just discovered this sub and was hoping to get some input from those who are experiencing a similar situation.\n\nBack around 2018, I had some labs done for TSH and prolactin. I had been lactating since at least 2014, and my periods were becoming irregular (incredibly light periods with lots of spotting in between periods). I have had daily headaches for an incredibly long amount of time but always wrote them off to sinus issues. At that time, my prolactin was in normal range so no imaging was ordered.\n\nFast forward to this summer- my headaches were becoming more severe, I began shedding a concerning amount of hair, and I was still having lighter than normal periods. I was getting lots of flashes and snow showers in my peripheral vision, and I was also experiencing episodes of blurred vision. Because I was still lactating, my TSH and prolactin were tested again. TSH was normal but my prolactin was at 39 ng/mL. An MRI was ordered, and I was given the report yesterday. These were the findings:\n\n&gt; There is no normal pituitary gland noted. It is replaced by a cystic formation measuring 1.7 x 1.8 x 2.8 cm with displacement of the pituitary stalk and abutting the optic chiasm which is slightly elevated. There is no solid component or abnormal enhancement noted. There is normal size ventricular system and sulci. Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved. Globes and orbits are unremarkable. Venous sinuses are normal.\n\nI have already been referred to neurosurgeon at a nearby university, so hopefully I\u2019ll get a better explanation of what\u2019s going on soon. In the meantime, I was wondering if anyone else had a \u201cmissing\u201d or flattened pituitary gland.

So, I\u2019d like to continue my weight loss updates on this forum for anyone else who might share my concerns.\n\nI\u2019ve now completed 8 weeks of Cabergoline and have lost a total of 26.5 pounds. I only started working out yesterday, as I\u2019ve not had the energy to do it since starting treatment. \n\nIn the first two weeks of starting Cab, 10 pounds just dropped off. The weight loss slowed and after 3 weeks I had lost a total of 13 pounds. I believe it slowed due to my prolactin falling, as bloodwork would show a 0.9 reading (abnormal low). During this low period (~2 weeks), I stopped losing weight -I lost nothing. Therefore, my personal experience has taught me that when my prolactin falls outside of the normal range, in either direction, I have difficulty losing weight. Since reducing my Cabergoline dose to half, I\u2019ve lost an additional 13.5 pounds. This is pretty awesome, as it seems if I can keep my prolactin in a normal range, I can lose weight. It sucks that I missed out on two weeks of weight loss when my prolactin was low but I\u2019m happy to be back on track.\n\nPreviously, I thought a shrinking tumor was the answer to weight loss but now I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s merely the normalization of prolactin that is key losing weight. So, if you noticed weight loss at the beginning of treatment, but then it slowed down, I\u2019d encourage you to recheck your blood work and make sure your prolactin isn\u2019t now too low. Best of luck to those also looking to lose weight while dealing with a prolactinoma and Cabergoline. Please feel free to share your weight loss and workout tips and journeys with me, especially because I struggle with fatigue which makes working out difficult.

I also don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just my normal anxiety I\u2019m feeling or if the cab is making it worse. \n\nThanks everyone \ud83e\udd72", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1120, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cab and anxiety meds", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/kdhwa7/cab_and_anxiety_meds/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "92trashley", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3loz3ysm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1608017672, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/kdhak0/bromocriptine/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kdhak0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/kdhak0/bromocriptine/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1608017683, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey everyone!

After taking hormonal birth control continuously for 8 years I finally stopped it this past May because I was tired of enduring the negative side effects such as low libido/anxiety/brain fog/etc. Since then I haven\u2019t had a period and have still been anxious, having more trouble sleeping and still no libido despite being in a happy/healthy relationship. So, about three weeks ago I decided it was time to get some blood work done and figure out why I haven\u2019t gotten my period. My prolactin level in my first blood test was 53 and in the second after fasting was 43. My doctor is having me get an MRI with and without contrast this Wednesday. Honestly, I\u2019m pretty nervous as I\u2019ve never had an MRI before and I\u2019m claustrophobic. (Luckily, I asked for an Ativan to calm my nerves but any advice is appreciated.) I\u2019ve also set up an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist but I won\u2019t be able to speak with her until late February but I\u2019ll be seeing my PCP at the end of December for some more basic lab work. One question I have is whether nipple piercings may be the culprit of my elevated prolactin levels? I\u2019ve read that nipple stimulation can raise levels but I\u2019m wondering if they could be raising it enough to cause me all of these issues? Also, is there anything else I could be doing to get more answers? This is all very new to me and I just want to be the best advocate I can be for myself. I am not trying to conceive any time soon but I would like to get my period back so I can properly track my cycle as a form of natural birth control and just for obvious health reasons.

At that point, my Prolactin levels were over 100. I've seen endocrinologists since then, gotten many of the dreaded contrast MRIs, and taken Cabergoline intermittently. I've moved around a lot, and it's often been difficult to find an endocrinologist to prescribe the medication regularly. When I'm taking the Cabergoline, it keeps my Prolactin levels in check and I get my period. When I stop taking it, I stop getting my period. \n\nLast year, I began seeing a new PCP and she was able to prescribe Cabergoline directly, without going through an endo. This has been a real life saver for me, as I've been taking the doses as directed, uninterrupted for a year now. My period is normal. I just got my latest Prolactin panel back, and I'm at 26.2. My husband and I are looking to have a baby in the next year or so, and I've been on a health journey to prepare my body for pregnancy. I've lost a significant amount of weight. I'm very worried about my prolactinoma impacting my ability to conceive. I haven't received a straight answer from any endo or doctor I've seen.

I recently had an MRI and found out I have a Micro Adenoma (much like many people in this group!) I have been referred to an endocrinologist but my appointment isn't for another 2 months. Since the appointment has been booked more blood work has been conducted and my progesterone and estrogen levels have come back low. My doctor initially said that my tumor isn't likely to be causing my symptoms but after reading other peoples stories on here I am not sure that is true. I have gained 30 pounds in the last 3 years - 15lbs of that in the last year. I have always eaten very well (my mother is a nutritionist) and as soon as I started seeing weight gain I upped my workout regime and daily exercise without seeing any improvements... just consistent weight gain. For background, I have always been a very active individual and was athlete for much of my life but maintaining that active lifestyle is getting harder and harder due to my symptoms. I don't even recognize myself anymore. I suffer from headaches, fatigue, muscle and joint soreness, mood swings, anxiety, depressive episodes and brain fog.   \n\n\nI have so many questions, hoping someone here can help.   \n\n\n1. Could my low estrogen and low progesterone be related to my tumor?\n2. What are the effects/symptoms of low progesterone?\n3. What are the effects/symptoms of low estrogen?\n4. Concerned about not being able to conceive - is this something to even worry about?\n5. Could my symptoms be explained by my diagnosis and results so far?\n6. Any tips on dealing with exhaustion and feeling drained after blood tests? \n7. I am worried about waiting 2 months to see my endocrinologist - is there anything I can do now to start improving my symptoms? Diet? Exercise? \n8. Does anyone have advice on how to better prepare for my Endo appointment? Questions to ask? Things to ask for? \n\nSometimes I feel as though my doctors look at me and see a healthy 26 year old and don't take my symptoms and results seriously - perhaps I am partially at fault for feeling shame for complaining.\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1097, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New Diagnosis - Micro Adenoma 26f", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/k8jt1x/new_diagnosis_micro_adenoma_26f/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Saxamaphooone", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_yeuvc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1607352432, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/k8hw6h/hi_all_just_got_my_mri_results_back/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k8hw6h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/k8hw6h/hi_all_just_got_my_mri_results_back/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1607352444, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a 2mm micro adenoma.

Tons of fatigue. A lot of nausea, some of it debilitating. A few days after my period ends I get so sick that I can\u2019t eat solid food without throwing up and I can barely move, as that makes the nausea and the weird sick feeling in my body and head much worse. \n\nBut what confuses me the most is the vision changes. My adenoma is tiny - how the heck am I seeing scotoma in my peripheral vision? Why does my equilibrium sometimes feel l\u2019m walking around in a bouncy house?

I\u2019m injecting 5mg of Estrogen and taking 50mg of Cyproterone acetate. \n\n\nI desperately need help. For the past 3 months I\u2019ve been feeling awful. I went to 2 different ERs, they ran tests and said I was fine. I went to my family doctor and he said I had high blood pressure. It\u2019s odd because my blood pressure wasn\u2019t even high.\n\nSo, here is what is wrong:\n\n\u2022 About 3 months ago I was wiping the kitchen table and I suddenly felt nauseous. This feeling lasted for about 2 hours and went away. I then suddenly had a very dull headache. This dull headache hasn\u2019t gone away in the 3 months since it began. \n\n\u2022 I\u2019ve also been very weak and fatigued. Before, I could clean all day long without stopping. Now, I don\u2019t have the energy to even get off the couch. \n\n\n\u2022 My left arm has a numbing /tingling sensation from time to time. \n\n\u2022 I\u2019ve also been short of breath. Taking a bag of groceries from my car to my house takes my breath away.  Though, I do attribute this to smoking for 20 years. I have since quit. I\u2019ve been smoke free for 8 months.\n\n\u2022 I gained 50lbs within a couple of months. Again, I attributed this to no longer smoking.\n\n\nI think the Cyproterone acetate has had some severe side effects on me.  I\u2019m hoping I don\u2019t have a tumor because high dosages of Cyproterone causes prolactinoma. It would explain the dull headache. It would explain the seemingly change in vision. It would also explain why my right nipple keeps lactating without provocation. My right nipple leaks so much that it\u2019s ruined lots of my shirts.\n\nWhat do I do when Drs keep telling me nothing is wrong when I KNOW something is wrong?  A few days ago I was driving and I heard something funny on the radio. I laughed. I laughed apparently too much/hard and I nearly passed out while driving. It was scary to almost black out while driving on the highway.\n\nWhat do you suggest I do?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1096, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Doctors won\u2019t help.

The past month or so I have been experiencing increasingly worse symptoms which include brain fog 24/7, daily tension headaches(forehead and behind eyes) ,gynecomastia ,terrible anxiety, fatigue, and light sensitivity. Symptoms got so bad I went to the ER one night. This resulted in a CT scan and blood work which both came back normal. My GP has been absolutely useless and basically dismissed me as a healthy young man. So I decided to get a basic testosterone test and it came back as Total: 129ng/dl and Free: 20pg/dl. Basically the testosterone levels of an 80 year old man on a bad day. I have a telehealth appointment with an endo in a little over a week, just wondering what to expect and how to prepare. Should I push right away for an MRI and more blood work? I have a feeling she\u2019ll want to do more in depth blood work before an MRI, I should\u2019ve pushed my GP to order me one before seeing an endo but it is what it is. It\u2019s just very hard to get appointments with specialists, I don\u2019t want to wait months in between appointments and tests to figure this out. I know it doesn\u2019t help that the only numbers I have are testosterone. It\u2019s just a helpless feeling and it\u2019s hard to live everyday like this.

Each blood work showed that my prolactin levels were 30- 40 ng/mL (not that high). After my thyroid sort of stabilized and I was still having vision problems, I got a MRI and it showed that my pituitary gland is compressed with a microadenoma of 5-6 mm.\n\nCurrently, I am 10 lbs underweight and I have been on 0.5 mg of cabergoline weekly. It has been 3 weeks since I started taking it and I noticed my breasts have shrunk a little. Shortly before I started the medication, my bra size was 28C and now maybe barely a 28C. I am not even close to filling out my old bras and I haven't been for a year even though I've gained 10 lbs since last year.

I was also exhibiting severe fatigue, so my endo wanted to see if I react better to bromocriptine. I am getting a repeat MRI soon to see if the meds have shrunk the tumor. \n\nMy question: Has anyone had a similar experience where they switched from cabergoline to bromocriptine?

Sorry in advance, long post \nI am a 28 year old female, I have had acne and excess body hair since I was about 12 (amongst a lot of other issues) The hirsutism isn\u2019t too severe, I have a lot of peach fuzz on my face, with the occasional random dark hair on my chin, and around my nipple, nothing too bad, I do have a LOT of dark hair on my inner thighs though. (Thankfully nowhere else) Beginning of the year I was diagnosed with insulin resistance, late onset CAH and hypothyroidism. Started on metformin and l-thyroxine straight away. Both my endo and I expected the hair to go away with treatment but it hasn\u2019t. Fast forward to beginning of August, turns out my prolactin levels are off the charts, which initially we didn\u2019t think much of as it can happen with untreated hypothyroidism, but since that has been taken care of, the endo suspects I have prolactinoma. I am still waiting on an MR to confirm but I am almost certain she is right, as I have had awful headaches and vision problems since I was 15 but my old GP Just told me it was migraines and gave me prescription painkillers . (Yeah I know\u2026) so while we are waiting on the MR results the endo started me on bromocriptine (2,5mg per day), I have been taking it for about a month.\n \nSo basically my question is, did anyone with prolactinoma, or elevated prolactin levels in general have hirsutism as a symptom? It doesn\u2019t seem like a prevalent symptom from my research, I found a couple sources that mention it but nothing major. My acne has improved a lot but I think that was due to the metformin because it started getting better before the bromo. If you did have hirsutism, did it go away with treatment, and if yes how long did it take? \nI know it\u2019s just a bit of hair but I am honestly so sick of having to wax and shave and constantly worry about my legs and stressing about it all summer and not wanting to wear dresses unless I am freshly waxed. It would take off so much pressure to get rid of this issue.\nThank you :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1694, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hirsutism as a symptom?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/pzt60q/hirsutism_as_a_symptom/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Appropriate_Change18", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_aawakno2", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1633045655, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/pyvvbm/hyperprolactinoma_bromocriptine_side_effects/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pyvvbm", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/pyvvbm/hyperprolactinoma_bromocriptine_side_effects/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1633045666, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey Guys,\nAlmost a year ago we noticed an elevated prolactin level in my husband.

Half pills for two week, then a whole pill for three months.\nMy fear is I just read after the side effects and besides the nausea and dizziness I read more intimidating things, like depression, suicidal thoughts and anxiety attacks, at it makes me feel very nervous, I am not sure I would like to tell Husband these, because it will make him scared too. He is a nervous type anyway, usually he have a hard time to ease his racing mind and sleep poorly, if he will have these as a side effects too, well... I don't know. I also read that Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, which I am not sure what it means. If it stimulates the dopamine receptors, should be an antidepressant effect not the opposite isn't?

They are roughly at the same level as when my prolactinoma (4x6mm) was discovered. I was on bromocriptine for a year and my levels were too low at one point and I adjusted my dosage and they were within normal levels. At that time I had a repeat MRI and the doctor said that my prolactinoma had disappeared but there was a possibility of a small tumour. \n\nNow my doctor has left it up to me whether I want to go back on bromocriptine. I am scheduled to have a repeat MRI in May whether I want to take the drug again or not to check whether there is growth of prolactinoma. So should I go on the drug again until May and see whether I have a prolactinoma still and try again to cut the drug? Or should I not take it and have the MRI and see whether they do detect growth or not and take the drug after that?\n\nThanks in advance!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1650, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Should I continue bromocriptine or not?- doctor said it\u2019s up to me", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/poawpe/should_i_continue_bromocriptine_or_not_doctor/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PM_YOUR_PET_PICS979", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_44vldrnq", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1631632363, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/po4pyn/just_thought_of_a_weird_question_about_lactation/", "gildings": {}, "id": "po4pyn", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/po4pyn/just_thought_of_a_weird_question_about_lactation/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1631632375, "score": 1, "selftext": "So my levels were HIGH, 108, 98, 126.

After years of building up to this only to be let down once again by an absolute creep!\n\nMany of you who I've talked to know how hard it's been for me to find an endocrinologist who will answer my questions, take my symptoms/side effects seriously, and validate the mental health struggles that have come with having a prolactinoma. I have been lucky enough to find one who can really empathize with our plight and has tried their best to push for surgery. Lately I've been so tired of the meds. Sure, cabergoline is treating me better than bromocriptine... but should I be expected to stay on this medication for the rest of my life? Ugh. \n\nAnyway, we went in for my consultation with UC Health's \"star\" of Neurosurgery--Dr. Lillehei. In fact, my other neurosurgeon canceled his appointment with me since he said he would defer to Lillehei's decision in the end, though he would perform the surgery if I preferred and if Lillehei reccomended it. We discussed the symptoms I'm still having and how I manage (i.e. weight gain, fatigue, mood swings, depression... because well I have a dang tumor in my head). When I glossed over my mental health, Lillehei really got hung up on the fact that I previously dealt with depression and sometimes get depressed because I can't function the way I could pre-prolactinoma. At this point he frowned and said he needed to be in contact with my therapist/demanded to know why I wasn't seeing a therapist since I was so mentally ill. Between himself and his trainee, they berated/lectured me for the next 20min about my mental health and how all these symptoms have nothing to do with my prolactinoma nor my medication despite what multiple other physicians had confirmed. \n\nThis is such bullcrap, I was thinking the whole time. Like, I didn't come here to get yelled at and belittled. I came here to have a discussion. Not only that, but he kept putting his grubby hands all over his mask! I kept my mouth shut since there was no point arguing and let the \"discussion\" run its course. He wanted another MRI in 2 months and then \"maybe\" we could talk about surgery again... but it's \"unlikely\". He passed me his card and told me \"his girl\" would schedule something with me. I politely declined and passed the card back to him. Nothing has changed. No tumor shrinkage, no change in symptoms, no medication dose changes... sorry, I'll find someone else. He was super offended that I declined his offer and as he got up to leave, he patted my knee a few times before giving it a death grip squeeze for a few moments. I was horrified. \n\nGenerally speaking I don't like to be touched. By anyone. Even my partner asks before touching me because he knows how important personal space and consent is to me. I instantly froze up. As Lillehei and his trainee walked out of the room I calmly but firmly told him, \"Don't touch my knee, that's gross,\". They didn't even turn around, but the trainee audibly said, \"Ugh, really?\" as the door shut. My partner checked on me to make sure I was alright before finding a nurse to report the incident and terrible treatment. I mean, I was shook to my core that a medical professional could treat a patient that way. I had an anxiety attack. I know this probably sounds stupid and trivial and childish to a lot of people... so I'll probably delete this later. But it's not trivial to me and I had to tell SOMEONE. Nobody... not even a doctor should touch you in a NON-MEDICAL manner without your consent.\n\nTL;DR\u2014 Dr Lillehei is a creep who invalidated my struggles of having a prolactinoma and made me very uncomfortable by touching and squeezing my knee in front of my partner after I told him I no longer wanted to be his patient.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1614, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The UC Health Neurosurgery team is ridiculously unprofessional.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/pcfgeh/the_uc_health_neurosurgery_team_is_ridiculously/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "browndaal", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6ap26v2o", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1629952031, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/pbs6j0/surgery_vs_cabergoline_advice/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pbs6j0", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 24, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/pbs6j0/surgery_vs_cabergoline_advice/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1629952042, "score": 1, "selftext": "I (24F) have been on 0.5 mg once a week cab for 2 years now and have been experiencing nearly all of the side effects.

I was misdiagnosed on and off with PCOS since I was 16, and they found the tumor at 23. I never had polycystic ovaries, and the only reason they retested me and eventually diagnosed me was because I had extreme hair loss and kept pushing to get tests done. I went straight to studying about endocrinology since then and I got hooked. I'm now taking pre-req courses needed to apply to Physician Assistant school. My goal is to specialize in endo so I can help people like us. It's hard to study about something so close to home. But I'm a whole new person since diagnosis, in an amazing way. I thank my tumor for what it's done for me. I never would have started on a journey of healing had it not been for this. After 2 years of deep depression (mostly due to my hair loss as a 25 year old female, fatigue, other hormonal issues) I have worked so hard to rebuild my mindset to live a life I am extremely grateful for. I've experienced miracles in my waking life like never before because I completely renovated my mindset which was feeding my state of disease. I'm not claiming to be all done, and better and that you can \"achieve miracles.\" That's how I perceive it, and I don't go into religion at all tbh. I don't think my journey will ever be over, I love it! but I can say I feel so much better than when I was \"healthy\" and had no diagnosis to worry about. I can only speak for myself, but I was thinking of making a video series about a healing mindset for those with endocrine issues since they tend to be chronic or on and off and closely tied to stress. I do have other lifestyle practices that have helped me like meditation and yoga but overall it's more intuitive and I try to develop methods that I can stick to daily, are not too time consuming, and are sustainable. I hope to work in a functional endo clinic but that's a couple of years down the line for me. I want to begin to help people now if possible because I have seen such a change in myself that I hardly recognize my mindset from my darkest moments. So my questions are:\n\n1. Do you guys look for videos on pituitary or endocrine issues on YouTube? If so, what do you search?\n2. Have you tried therapy or searched for other mental health resources to help you when it comes to fear or worries about your health? If so, what steps do you take?\n3. Would you be interested in what I'm discussing on this post? Are there any specific topics you would be interested in hearing about from someone with a prolactinoma? \n\nThank you guys, I hope to use this discussion as a way to get the ball rolling on my videos. I already have a health YouTube channel but its very specific about functional hormonal therapies, I'd like to work on the mental health piece but I shied away because I don't want to make fantastical claims, yet I feel ready now to help since I wish someone had been there for me to tell me my best moments were yet to come.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1086, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Would you guys be interested in a video about mindset for endocrine issues?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/k3q756/would_you_guys_be_interested_in_a_video_about/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dapumpkinspicee", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8utch74d", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606590460, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/k2tiqz/cabergoline_and_prediagnosed_ocd/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k2tiqz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/k2tiqz/cabergoline_and_prediagnosed_ocd/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1606590470, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey, i\u2019m a 20 year old male with OCD and i started cabergoline this week, i have a history with OCD and i\u2019m a quite impulsive person already. i\u2019ve read all these horror stories about people going crazy on these meds and cheat and gamble. so i\u2019m pretty freaked out at the moment, i don\u2019t wanna become this unhinged person they warn about, i wanna stay me. could people with prediagnosed OCD/anxiety tell me how exactly cabergoline effected them.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Prolactinoma", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xv1l", "subreddit_subscribers": 1084, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cabergoline and prediagnosed OCD", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/k2tiqz/cabergoline_and_prediagnosed_ocd/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "carrito1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3b72xtjv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606581615, "domain": "self.Prolactinoma", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Prolactinoma/comments/k2qrle/at_a_dead_end_everything_magically_disappeared/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k2qrle", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Prolactinoma/comments/k2qrle/at_a_dead_end_everything_magically_disappeared/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1606581626, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I guess my diagnosis from all the years prior were all made up because now after my latest mri scan with my new doctor, my pituitary gland seems to be normal.

So it\u2019s higher than it is supposed to be, but compared to what I\u2019ve read about other people, it\u2019s not extremely high. \n\nSo - is there a cause for this more moderate elevation?  I have normal ovaries on ultrasound, do not take any meds that elevate prolactin, wear bras or tight clothing or pregnant.\n\nProlactinomas usually are significantly higher right?

I\u2019ve done this by making almost no changes to my routine. \n\nBefore Cabergoline I would heavily calorie restrict, intermittent fast, and workout, sometimes 2x/day. Despite this, I saw almost no movement on the scale. \n\nAfter starting Cabergoline, I still intermittently fast but I\u2019ve only worked out THREE times for about 30 minutes over the span of almost 2 weeks and the scale is MOVING!\n\nI want to put this out there bc before my diagnosis, I couldn\u2019t understand why I was gaining and unable to lose weight. I became a recluse and stopped living my life out of fear about how others would see me. I felt disgusting, often times laying in bed all day. Then, I felt frustrated, as all my efforts to lose weight were seemingly not enough. After getting my diagnosis, I have this new sense of hope. I\u2019m starting to lose weight, and as a result am going out more and seeing friends I haven\u2019t seen in a while. I think this will only improve as I get closer to my starting weight (pre-prolactinoma). Appearance isn\u2019t everything, but it was a huge insecurity of mine &amp; I\u2019m beyond happy to say things are looking up! So to anyone wondering if weight loss with Cabergoline really is a thing, I\u2019d say yes. For me at least, and it might be for you as well. Best of luck to those on a weight loss journey and those just trying to improve their overall health.
