I usually only have minor issues if I combine carbs with fatty meat, for example burgers, pizza or sausages in bread.  I can eat a burger patty on its own and I can eat the bun on its own, but if I combine the two, it will cause some issues.  Still, it's nowhere near the trouble I was having before surgery.\n\nThe biggest change for me has been the lack of spasms.  For 12 years, I would wake up in the middle of the night, probably 12 or 13 times per month, in so much pain.

I know this isn't really an active sub. Then again, how could it be?? After all, only one in 100,000 people are diagnosed with Achalasia!\n\nBut anyway, I just wanted to stop by and make this post for any future travelers who may stop by and have questions. I've been a redditor for almost 8 years now, and plan to be around for a long time. So even if this post gets old, please feel free to contact me!\n\n---\n\nMy story (for those who care to read it) \u2014\n\nAround 2009 I started noticing that I was having trouble swallowing. As with most Achalasians, it took me a long time to seek any sort of treatment. After 2 years, and losing about 100 pounds, I was urged by my wife (at the time she was my *very* new girlfriend) to finally go see a doctor.\n\nI went to a Gastroenterologist who ultimately ended up performing an endoscopy. He told me that I likely have Achalasia and then ordered a Barium Swallow test for me.\n\nAt the radiologist's office, they gave me 2 big glasses of a chalky, strawberry flavored liquid (the barium) which was not the most fun thing to drink. But as soon as I stepped in front of the X-ray, the radiologist said, \"Oh, yeah. Gotta be Achalasia.\" I had all the typical presentations, including the signature \"bird-beak\" esophagus shape.\n\nAfter getting those results, my GI doc ordered a Manometry (swallow pressure test). This was by far my least favorite of all the tests done. A sensor was placed through my nose and down into my esophagus. I was then asked to swallow at very specific times. If I swallowed without the tech asking me to, a timer was reset and I had to wait again. It was really not a good time.\n\nAfter the manometry, my diagnosis was confirmed by my doctor. He basically told me what my options were: \n\n1. Balloon dilation (which was basically guaranteed to not work in my case), \n2. Botox injections. Which he told me was not only a non-permanent fix, but would also decrease in efficacy after each injection, AND would make it more difficult to fix with surgery (due to scar tissue), or\n3. Surgery. A Heller Myotomy. The procedure involves cutting the Lower Esophageal Sphincter (just like cutting a rubber band) to remove the restriction between my esophagus and my stomach.\n\nI went home and started researching. I knew everything there was to know about my options, and I decided to go with surgery.\n\nI found a terrific surgeon in New Orleans named [Dr. Abbas Abbas](http://www.temple.edu/medicine/abbas.htm) (he has since become Chief Thoracic Surgeon at Temple University School of Medicine). We met for a consultation and he discussed the procedure with me in depth. He told me that the procedure would be done using robotic laparoscopy. I asked him about Fundoplication (a procedure in which part of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus to help prevent the possibility of acid reflux after the Myotomy). To which he replied \"A fundoplication can further restrict the transfer of food/liquid to the stomach. It's much easier to treat heartburn than it is to treat Achalasia.\"\n\nSo that was it. I decided to go for it.\n\nDay of my surgery. Nervousness. Blah blah blah.\n\nI woke up in post-op in a pretty good amount of pain. I was given morphine and I fell back to sleep for awhile. The next time I woke up, I was given a pain pump so that I could click a button to add a little more morphine whenever I was in pain. After a couple hours, I began to itch terribly all over my body. It was miserable. So I was switched off of morphine and over to Demerol. Not only did the itching stop, but my pain basically vanished. Demerol is amazing stuff.\n\nAt some point the surgeon came in and told me that although my surgery was 100% successful, there was a slight complication. The lining of my esophagus was accidentally knicked by a tool and I'd have to wait for it to heal before I could eat or drink anything.\n\nAfter 2 days of lying in a hospital bed, I was finally allowed to drink water and then ultimately eat some soup (just broth). I was STARVING at this point. 3 days after my surgery I was released from the hospital and I went to stay with my parents who live near New Orleans.\n\nRecovery at home was pretty easy. Certainly some soreness in my abdomen and the liquid food diet was really a bore. But after a week or so, I moved on to soft foods and was starting to feel much better.\n\nFast forward 4 years. I haven't had any complications from my surgery, and I'm able to eat and drink almost completely without issue. On occasion, if I take a big bite, or swallow to early (especially with bread and/or meat), I'll still get stuck. But a quick sip of water pushes things right along.\n\nI've gained back a lot of my weight (probably a little too much :D). And I would have the surgery again in a heartbeat if I had to. 100% worth it.\n\nI hope this helps some people.

It brought me great relief to finally know what was wrong with me and that I wasn't crazy, or stupid for not knowing how to swallow (I know). \n\nI've had trouble swallowing for as long as I can remember. I remember I could never \"chug\" beer, and realized I couldn't even chug water when I was super thirsty without this feeling of having to stop. I would always eat like a bird; I'm pretty skinny and I always felt hungry, even after eating, but being too \"full\" to eat more. \n\nAfter being misdiagnosed with GERD and acid reflux, I finally went to a even more specialist last year when I kept waking up in the middle of the night with a mouth full of the water I drank before going to bed... I couldn't cuddle with my girlfriend in bed, I had to get extra pillows. I couldn't have conversations while eating, and it made me uncomfortable eating out with people. My girlfriend complained because I would just read my phone while eating. She didn't understand how difficult it was for me to talk and eat in a reasonable amount of time. This also affected my ability to eat lunch at work. I mostly had to bring lunch back to my desk because it would take so long for me to eat it.\n\nI'm scheduled to have the botox injection surgery on Tuesday. I've been on a liquid diet since yesterday, and tomorrow is clear liquid diet only. I'm pretty nervous to say the least. I tell people about it but not much is said after I explain it. I feel like talking more about it. I'm really excited at the chance to be able to eat and hopefully gain some weight. I am honestly too afraid to get the surgery right now, and also it's super busy at work (the stress doesn't help with my condition) so I don't want to take that much time off.\n\nMy plan is to get the botox done once just to put off getting the surgery for a later time. I know there's increased risk in the surgery when you get the botox injection, which is why I plan to only do it once.\n\nRandom: Sometimes I wonder if drinking a bunch as a teenager and supressing the vomit reflex after drinking too much may have contributed. I also smoked cigarettes since I was 14 ( quit at 28, been vaping about 2 years currently) and I also wonder if that helps - or hurt rather. Also some other random thing that I wonder may have helped cause this... my sister used to push on that indented part of my throat to make me cough and choke, she thought it was funny. Later on in life when I was still smoking cigs, I would get respiratory sicknesses all the time that would make me have to cough, I would press on that indent in my throat to help me cough more. Stupid, I know, but I figured I'd share these little things to see if maybe anybody else had any similar experiences. \n\nThanks guys, hope to see some activity on this sub.

I thought I'd share my story.  For the main part it started in 2012.  I changed jobs in March 2012 and in my week off I went for a road trip with my mate.  We did about 800km and I ate a bunch of junk: McDonalds, lollies, potato chips etc as we took turns to drive and talk. \n\nThe next week I had bad pains in my lower torso area and went to a doctor who gave me some medicine. I took it for it's course but the pain didn't go away.  Like a stabbing sensation halfway between the navel and the groin.  Eventually, over a few months it lessened. I took another job a few months later and noticed food was becoming hard to swallow.  \n\nI changed jobs again a few months  after that and had the time to go to a gastroenterologist.  I had a endoscopy, which came back normal, no hietus hernia - I'm a powerlifter and it's pretty common with us.  I then had a barium swallow, which showed the classic sign of a blockage and the ballooned out osophegus.  I then had a manometry from the local Professor, who happened to be the leading expert on this in my country.  He said due to my osophogeal sphincter not being closed enough I didn't have achalasia, but another motility disorder and that I had no peristalsis after the initial motion at the top of my throat and food and water were getting trapped.\n\nHe recommended I sleep elevated and eat \"sloppy\" foods for the rest of my life, and to return in 4 years when I was 40 to check for cancer.\n\nA few months ago I took up throwing up just before bed each night because I was sick of waking up \"drowning\" on my own saliva and having water on my lungs for the next day.  It wasn't true regurgitation, was I was throwing up only the food still in my osophegus.  That at least helped me sleep, and the up chuck was very easy to do and painless thanks to the somac I've been taking since 2012, which reduces stomach acid by 90%.\n\nMy wife, not happy with my nightly ritual, insisted I get a second opinion.  I went to another gastroenterologist, who upon seeing who was my previous said \"he is the expert on this. there's no one else to see\". I insisted on a redo of the barium swallow.  \n\nThis time it came back worse and on reconsultation with the professor, he and my new doctor agreed that I do infact have achalasia and I am now a candidate for some treatment, be it botox first and then surgery.

I didn't have a formal diagnosis until about 5 years ago, even though I'd been to various doctors about it several times over the years.  \n\nFirst, I'm curious about \"the feeling\", even though it was my tacked-on also.  I know when I'm about to have an issue because I get a tightness/pain at the base of my throat/top of my breast bone.  In fact, for years, I mistakenly thought that was where the problem was.  My doctor did too, diagnosing as a hiatal hernia without testing, until he had me do a barium swallow  and realized that was not the case.  If I start feeling tightness there, or start making this weird 'squelching' noise, I know it's going to happen.  I'll generally try to drink a lot of water at that point or stand up.  Sometimes, these help, but other times, I wind up in the bathroom until it clears itself up (usually with digital assistance).  This can be anywhere from a minute or two, up to an hour or more.  If it goes beyond an hour and a half or so, I'll go the ER, which usually results in an IV and a visit with the ENT the next day.\n\nAs far as what triggers it -- I don't really have anything that consistently triggers it, except if I'm having a long grained meat, I can expect it to happen almost every time.  I have found drinking a warm/hot drink, such as tea or decaf coffee, with food can more consistently stop it from flaring up if I start to get the sensation.  I don't know if tricks the LES into relaxing or what, but it is more reliable than water or cold drinks.    Interestingly, sweets have never triggered it.\n\nSo what about  you?  What sets you off?

I definitely feel food trapped in my oesophagus and it comes back up often. I struggle eating full meals which has been really bad the past three weeks.

As time went on I also began to develop issues swallowing. At first it was only when I ate way too fast or ate too much, but slowly it has gotten worse to the point where I now have to drink lots of water and forcefully swallow any time I eat anything. For a long time it was just a minor annoyance, but in the last year or so it's become a serious concern. About a year ago I saw a doctor who, after talking to me only briefly, decided that the trouble swallowing was probably the result of inflammation from acid reflux. He put me on Omeprazole which did absolutely nothing for me accept give me stomach cramps and diarrhea. I decided to stop taking it, but I started taking Tagamet whenever I felt the first signs of heartburn. One Tagamet right at the first signs usually makes it go away completely in 30-45 minutes. I also started doing things like propping the head of my bed up a few inches, not eating too late at night, and avoiding certain triggers. My heartburn became a lot more rare and a lot less severe, but the swallowing issues continued and seemed to get slowly worse. I finally decided to see a new doctor last week.\n\nShe was much more receptive and patient with me. She listened to all of my issues, asked me important follow up questions, and examined my pretty closely. She felt that I potentially had a Hiatal Hernia and ordered an upper g.i. series. The UGI revealed that I had a pretty severely distended esophagus and what appeared to be a stricture at or just above the lower sphincter. So, today I had an upper endoscopy. The doctor said that my stomach and duodenum look normal and healthy, but my esophagus was dilated and the lower sphincter was tight. He said that these findings are suggestive of achalasia. He is recommending that I have an esophageal manometry performed to confirm achalasia.\n\nI'm 26 years old. I just want to get back to place where I can eat comfortably and not have to force food down with water and have people ask me if I'm okay when I'm just trying to eat. I really don't like eating around other people anymore aside from my parents who know what's going on with me, because to other people it looks like I'm choking or struggling and it's embarrassing to try to explain it to them. From what I can tell, achalasia isn't really curable, but it sounds like heller myotomy helps a large majority of people with achalasia. Obviously the next step is to confirm achalasia with the manometry, but it sounds like this is the likely result. What is next? What should I expect? Will I ever be able to eat like a normal person again?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just got diagnosed after years of

What I do have is what I have always called \"the funny feeling.\" I call it that because the first time it happened to me is was ~5 years old and I had no way how else to describe it to my parents. Im now 23. Ive always lived with the this funny feeling. It doesn't happen to me every time I eat, maybe once or twice a meal or sometimes not for a week. It the feeling like the food hasn't quite made it down my throat (really more my chest). Through my younger years the only thing I knew to do was go to the bathroom and gag myself until I threw it up. For the past 5 or so years I have taken to drinking large swigs of water or any liquid and that this usually worked in pushing it down. Because this works 95% of the time I have treated this \"funny feeling\" simply as an annoyance. Tonight I went out for dinner with friends and got some boneless wings. I had one of the more severe causes of the \"funny feeling\" I've ever had. I went for a glass of water, took a few swigs, only for the water too only what I can explain as \"layer\" on top of the food. I drank some more to the point where water was flooding back into my mouth and started choking. I threw up under the table. after maybe 5-6 attempts of trying to wash it down my throat and that water standing on top. I gave up, got my check early, and tried to awkwardly explain this whole thing I have always lived with but didn't have a real name for.

I remember I was at disneyland wait on gate cars ride when this intense pain came in my chest. It felt so bad that I thought it was a heart attack. It burned and it pinched like hell but it eventually passed. It was just heartburn but looking back, that was my first sign of something more severe...\n\nA few months roll off the calendar and I woke up to go to work with my usual routine of drinking a protein shake before heading out. Well, on my way to work I felt a gag coming on that was so intense that I pulled over by the side of the road and threw up my protein shake... I was thinking to myself \"what the hell was that!?!\" but I just carried on with my day not thinking much of it.\n\nNow months roil off the calendar some more and I notice that I have regular chest pain while I am eating so I start taking tums... it helped a lot to be honest. This was a stressful year for me as well (several key employees quit at my job and I had a pregnant wife with the baby due in a few months) so I just chalked it up to being stressed and gaining weight. But to be honest, I never felt too stressed it was just what everyone was telling me.\n\nThen the major moment hit for me. In early July 2015 I had a massive pain in my throat while swallowing food... Dear god it hurt so bad and I had no idea what was going on. I thought that maybe I burned my throat on some hot coffee or ate too much spicy food... I don't know.... But the pain was unbearable. And for about 2 weeks I couldn't swallow ANYTHING!! Not even water was going down. I put in for a doctors appointment but it was going to be a couple days before i saw him.\n\nSo my wife thought that I should take some allergy medicine as she thought that I had an allergic reaction to something that I ate... Coincidentally it worked to a degree! I was able to swallow food and it was... less painful. So I finally met with my doctor and he had no clue what was going on but orders me to take a barium swallow so he can track my esophagus movement. I went in for that test and let me tell you that drink taste like crap (I would have rather chugged milk of magnesia).\n\nSo I took this test in early August and I went a whole month without hearing from the doctor or the lab. During this time I was taking claritin-D because it helped but I still was not able to keep most of my food down. I had lost about 20lbs in the past 6 weeks (thankfully had plenty of weight to spare). I finally got to meet with my doctor and he had no idea what was going on so he referred me to a gastroenterologist. \n\nMy gastroenterologist was pretty awesome. In our first meeting he told me that he was going to use a balloon to stretch my esophagus a little bit to allow food to go down to my stomach. So I prepped to have a endoscopy done. This procedure was pretty smooth and basically it meant that I would go under anesthesia and the doc would use a camera to look down my throat and use a balloon to stretch it.\n\nSo I woke up and the doc told me right away that he didn't do the procedure and that it would not have helped... (I was thinking to myself that I hate this guy right now but honesty Im glad he didn't do it). He said that the problem is with my lower abdominal spinster and that it likely to be achalasia. So he scheduled another test for me to confirm....\n\nI am not into early October and I had a lot of traveling for work scheduled so I did not get the next test done until early November. So this next test was THE WORST! He ordered me to take a catheter (I think that is what is called) to test the muscle strength in my esophagus. All I have to do is swallow what this tube is down my throat. It sounded simple enough until he told me that it has to go through my nose, down to my thwart while I am awake....\n\nDear god this was a terrible experience. My nurse was awesome and he did a great job with it but it still sucked. Once the tube was down my nose/throat I had to dry swallow on command 10 times in 2 minute intervals. The test went well and my muscles were strong but the saliva was getting stuck in the lower sphincter...\n\n*Random thought, I also throw up foam pretty regularly*\n\nSo, now I follow up with my gastroenterologist and he tells me \"Yup, Achalasia\" but there is not a lot of surgeons in vegas that can do the procedure and he recommended that I go to USC (university of southern California hospital) to get the procedure done.\n\nThis is now the end of November and USC is in ZERO rush to get back to me. At this point I am down 40 pounds in total and I throw up constantly at work. In the mean time I run into a few people in vegas that had achalasia and told me similar horror stories... Which I find incredibly strange that I personally know 3 people in my life that had this incredibly rare disease... Strange...\n\nSo now we are in to January 2016 and I missed thanksgiving and christmas dinner :( but I finally have an appointment with USC doctors. I meet the surgeon and he was really awesome and he didn't make me re-take all the proviso tests in order to approve the surgery. He told me that he would do a procedure in that he uses a robot to make 3 small incisions in my abdomen and he will cut the sphincter to receive tensions to allow food to pass but will also cut a portion of my stomach to create 1 way trap door so food goes in but acid does not come out. He told me the procedure will take 2 hours and I will have to stay at the hospital overnight.\n\nIm back in vegas and I have to some tests but I should be doing the surgery in early Feb. Apparently USC hospital pioneered the corrective surgery for achalasia so they are the best of the best. They told me they are considered a high volume facility even though they only do about 15-20 achalasia surgeries a year.\n\nTL:DR I found out I had achalasia after having painful swallowing. Claritin-D allowed temporary pain relief and allowed me to eat a little more than I could without it. Doctors in Vegas are not well versed but USC hospital is. I did the barium test, endoscopy and catheter test and my surgery will take place in Feb 2016\n\nI am always open to talk to anyone about this. I hope this helps someone else struggling with this disease.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Story with Achalasia", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/41hvxp/my_story_with_achalasia/"}, {"author": "rebelterp", "author_created_utc": 1340477730, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_83ldw", "created_utc": 1452920666, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/416yhh/found_a_surgeon_for_my_procedure/", "gilded": 0, "id": "416yhh", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/416yhh/found_a_surgeon_for_my_procedure/", "retrieved_on": 1455005761, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I couldn't find a decent surgeon in Las Vegas to correct my Achalasia but my gastroentonologist told me that Univeristy of Southern California hospital was the leader in Achalasia surgery. \n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Found a Surgeon for my procedure", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/416yhh/found_a_surgeon_for_my_procedure/"}, {"author": "Freder1k0", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1528030930, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/8o8dn7/after_hellers_myotomy_what_do_you_do_to_keep/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8o8dn7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/8o8dn7/after_hellers_myotomy_what_do_you_do_to_keep/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1528030930, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 2, "selftext": "Dear all achalasians,\n\nI had HM 1.5 years ago.

Anyway, I had a barium swallow done recently and the pathology report said everything looked totally normal (esophagus is a normal size, no dilation or narrowing, no physical abnormalities, no cancer, etc.) and there was evidence of mild reflux.\n\nMy doctor's notes that accompanied the report said that the report \"suggests a motility anomaly.\" So he didn't use the word achalasia (and neither did the doctor who did the test), but he might want to do further testing before setting the diagnosis in stone. I'm currently waiting on pre-authorization of an esophageal manometry test. I had an endoscopy a few months back and it showed absolutely nothing aside from mild reflux (again).\n\nI've been trying to find out more about motility issues in general and achalasia comes up more than anything else. The thing is my symptoms sort of match, but they also sort of don't. I've had very mild indigestion for about a year now that didn't respond to any reflux medications I took. Then out of nowhere, last week my symptoms all got worse. I also developed a \"lump in throat\" feeling along with the sensation of my throat closing up. The lump feeling is usually a sensation of either a hair in my throat or post-nasal drip, which seems to be one of the most common achalasia symptoms. I've also been having a sore throat for the last couple of days. I blamed the new symptoms on the Carafate I was prescribed the day before the symptoms began and when I let my doctor know, he told me to go get an esophagram.\n\nHowever, while the heartburn is constant, the new more severe symptoms come in episodes. They might last a couple hours, a couple days or even up to a week. Last week my chest was so sore that I thought I was dying, especially paired with shortness of breath. My throat might feel closed or scratchy, but it eventually goes away and does not prevent me from eating or drinking. I have no vomiting at all and unlike what most folks describe, I can't stop belching. For some reason, my symptoms are worse on an empty stomach and seem to become more mild after eating. My heartburn also manifests as back pain more often than chest pain.\n\nI'm not sure why the severe symptoms came on so suddenly, or why this wasn't spotted during my endoscopy.

The final doctor that diagnosed me, recommended balloon pneumatic dilation as a first line of therapy and noted that I have options to have as much as three of them, after that i should be getting the laparoscopic HM. Anyways on the 11th of January I had the balloon PD (it hurt like hell, they didn't give me any anaesthetic, just some injections to numb the pain), and after one day I could eat soft food. After two days i could already eat much harder foods without problem. The thing is, it started getting uneasier this past month (2 months after the PD) to swallow food, especially liquids, it feels like the liquid just stays at the bottom of my esophagus for 10-15 seconds and then it goes down. With other harder foods, I don't have a problem, but sometimes when I don't chew the food enough it is a little painful until it goes down (thankfully, no regurgitations whatsoever). My question to you guys/girls is: has anyone had the same intervention like, without surgery and experienced these problems. If so, did you have repeated dilations?\n\nP.S. I am really scared of operations, because i don't think the doctors are really specialists in my country ( I am from a small country in the balkans). I read all the articles about POEM, but I know i don't have the money for that kind of operation outside of my country and somewhere in Europe :/ .", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 141, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Post balloon PD experience", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/891zsz/post_balloon_pd_experience/"}, {"author": "waffledave", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1519337636, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/7zivnr/what_causes_you_guys_to_relapse/", "id": "7zivnr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/7zivnr/what_causes_you_guys_to_relapse/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1519396403, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 2, "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI have read some stories here about some of you who relapsed after having an intervention or surgery to help with your achalasia.\n\nMy understanding of this disease is that the trouble swallowing comes from nerves in your esophagus dying.

Waiting on the monometry.\n\nI started having that feeling where food gets stuck in your throat about 2 years ago but it was only sometimes. I was suffering from awful heartburn all the time though, sometimes so bad it was incapacitating.\n\nWent to the doctor, had some tests done, but nothing showed up. My heartburn was happening right under my sternum, and was concentrated at the \"top\" of my stomach. In retrospect, it was probably food getting stuck there.\n\nI went on PPI's and there was no change. After a little while, the heartburn started getting better but the trouble swallowing got worse and worse. I stopped the PPI's and the heartburn was gone, but the swallowing issues increased even faster.\n\nWent back for more tests, including endoscopy and barium swallow. Endoscopy showed nothing but the swallow test came back showing high likelyhood of achalasia. \n\nDoctor has me on PPI's again (increased dose) but the heartburn has been gone for some time now. It doesn't seem to help the swallowing. I am waiting for the other tests and to see a specialist, but there is only one achalasia specialist in my city so it can take some time.\n\nThe swallowing thing gets worse on what seems like a day-to-day basis. I'm at the point now where I can't swallow anything. Even water. I have to force myself to throw up multiple times per day and I often find things in there from earlier in the day and even from the day before. \n\nI had a salad a few days ago for lunch... I was still throwing up lettuce the next morning. Even soup and yogurt is getting hard to keep down. The moment something gets stuck I need to try hard to not throw up because it makes me so nauseous.\n\nI wake up at least once a night coughing and choking violently on my own spit, and it's really scary every time. I end up throwing up a bunch of saliva that I guess just isn't going into my stomach.\n\nI am absolutely miserable at this point. I can't eat anything, I'm always hungry but have no appetite because I know how unpleasant it's going to be. I'm embarrassed to eat in public and I feel like everyone is looking at me wondering why I look so quiet/in pain and am taking over an hour to eat a small bowl of soup.\n\nI am losing weight really quickly. I feel tired and weak all the time. I miss food so much, I just want to eat normally again. The strangest sensation I have now is I'm not able to swallow air and burp like I used to. I did this all the time to relieve gas but now, I'm not able to swallow air anymore, it just doesn't work.\n\nThe only plus side is that beer seems to be the only thing that goes down easily so I've been milking that as an excuse to drink more.\n\nI don't know, I'm not looking for answers, I guess I just needed to vent a little. This last month has just been brutal and since I saw the doctor 20 days ago, I feel like it has been getting worse daily. I'm seeing her again next week and am hoping I can at least get some temporary treatment to help me get through my day-to-day.\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New to the club.

I have been stressing out about the possible diagnosis but after reading your stories, I'm not entirely convinced that I have Achalasia. Here are the symptoms I've experienced\n\n* Started around 10 months ago\n* Difficulty swallowing (feels like there's something at the back of my throat sortof like when you are sick and have phlegm) At rare occasions it would be so bad that when lying down I felt like I was choking. I used to try to cough up phlegm every night thinking that was causing it\n* IBS like symptoms (irregular, runny bm)\n* Hiccups/Belching (doctor and friends/family are unsure which one it is) constantly after meals and all day (probably 100+ times a day)\n* Loud noises from stomach and esophagus (gas escaping) after eating meal\n* In rare instances if a meal is extremely greasy (e.g. fried chicken) I would hiccup/belch to the point of dry heaving, after which I felt better\n* Gastroscopy came up clear\n* IBS &amp; Acid Reflux medication has no effect\n\nNow after reading your stories here on reddit it seems that the main symptom in common is the difficulty swallowing. I've never had regurgitation of food (can't remember the last time I threw up) nor have I been losing weight (could probably shed a few). I'm a university student who is relatively healthy who randomly started experiencing these symptoms. I'm not sure I have that \"funny feeling\" because I wouldn't describe my dysphagia as feeling like there's food stuck. What I'm wondering is\n\n* Does achalasia get worse over time? How long did it take? \n* Are these symptoms consistent with anything any of you had/started with?\n* For your difficulty swallowing symptoms where does it feel like you can't swallow (for me it feels like its coming from the bottom of my neck)?\n* Could I just be lucky that I have these minor symptoms and they caught it before it got any worse?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Minor Symptoms", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/7kqra3/minor_symptoms/"}, {"author": "Honkmueller", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1513006731, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/7j2xlt/how_is_your_energy_level_rachalasia/", "id": "7j2xlt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/7j2xlt/how_is_your_energy_level_rachalasia/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "hxCJi8qJHJJw2sLC_yHpu0HvCr2EnfbB88R2QC_OcDM", "resolutions": [{"height": 37, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/BiECksbEX6eVqY4OzKEtVQ5qF5aPZjrwQ7v4xjRDrVU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=986bfb7c2748dfdc4d11854a53aa2dea", "width": 108}, {"height": 75, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/BiECksbEX6eVqY4OzKEtVQ5qF5aPZjrwQ7v4xjRDrVU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=a631268c9898793340f35db4103701b9", "width": 216}, {"height": 112, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/BiECksbEX6eVqY4OzKEtVQ5qF5aPZjrwQ7v4xjRDrVU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=927b3d37bb451d0dd7874d3a00ccdad7", "width": 320}, {"height": 224, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/BiECksbEX6eVqY4OzKEtVQ5qF5aPZjrwQ7v4xjRDrVU.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=7d8a6fa5da7ea43fe6cd4c6fb068fce3", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 238, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/BiECksbEX6eVqY4OzKEtVQ5qF5aPZjrwQ7v4xjRDrVU.jpg?s=8c8946aee68e26a61f826523d8fd2c46", "width": 680}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1513055572, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI'm a husband of a wonderful woman, who suffers from achalasia.\nShe works part time (20hrs) in a book store and there still is our little girl (3 1/2 years) that keeps her busy.\nIt's basically every day that she is quite exhausted.\n\nHer energy level seems to be really low overall and after even a light day of work it's more like [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZHxMolFq0TU/UvvIshIDvtI/AAAAAAAAGJc/4VqdQ8C4WS4/s1600/lowbattery.jpg).\nHer supper then takes until 8:15pm - 9:00pm, while 10:00pm is her goto bedtime.\nSo it's me doing most of the housework on workdays.

In some ways it seems to be a good fit - a relatively normal endoscopy (revealing a small sliding hiatus hernia) and manometry showing problems with the peristaltic waves in the oesophegus. An older barium swallow showed dysphagia (trouble swallowing) and a 24h pH study ruled out GERD (chronic acid reflux). \n\nAnd some of my symptoms seem to match achalasia - trouble swallowing and a sense of regurgitation/lump in the throat. There is also a diffuse pain in the abdomen after eating that continues for several hours/until I've been to sleep.\n\nBut there's also some rather atypical symptoms. The trouble swallowing and abdominal pain is a lot worse during and after exercise, leaving me feel weak, drained and often lacking appetite. Some exercise is worse than others - swimming is the worst, running, cycling, hiking and rock climbing are all about the same.  The symptoms first became apparent when I started exercising (running) when I was 16/17 (I'm now 28). Does anyone else experience any change in symptoms during or after exercise?\n\nThere is also a link with constipation - the more constipated I am, the worse the symptoms get. This isn't uniquely dependent on stress. I can constipate myself with an excess of spinach (I am my own experiment) and get the same result. Conversely, defecation usually relieves the symptoms a bit. Has anyone else found anything similar, a link between bowel movements and symptoms severity?\n\nThings I've done that have helped relieve the symptoms include: \n- stopping taking Gaviscon at night\n- loading up on the ginger (in pretty much everything - so glad I like the taste!)\n- a lemon and ginger drink in the morning before breakfast\n- reducing sport\n- abdominal massage\n- mindfulness meditation\n\nHow helpful do you think these would be for your achalasia symptoms? Do these sound like the kinds of things that would help if it was achalasia? \n\nI'd be really interested to hear what you guys have to say - I'm not new to tummy troubles, but I am new to the world of achalasia, so any comments would be really important to me. \n\nThanks guys!\n \n\n\n ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Uncertain Achalasia Diagnosis - Looking to compare symptoms and share experience", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/7dvcti/uncertain_achalasia_diagnosis_looking_to_compare/"}, {"author": "Kidarcus", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1510782940, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/7d7knb/poem_procedureheller_myotomy/", "id": "7d7knb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/7d7knb/poem_procedureheller_myotomy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1510862910, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hello everyone, I know this subreddit is not really as active but I'm just trying to get as much information as possible from other people. I posted on this subreddit awhile back but basically at this point in time, the doctor recommended me to get the POEM procedure done. \n\nA little bit on my history with achalasia, I was diagnosed back ground 2008-2009 when I was about 12 or 13. I had a heller myotomy done in 2010 and back then, I never had the option for the POEM procedure. About a year or two goes by and I've never had any problems eating but at this point in time, It's happening again, I guess the Heller Myotomy is starting to wear off and what doctors said is that part of the muscle tissue around my esophagus scarred up, and This ended up developing a hiatus hernia.\n\nSo a couple of months back, I did some research on Achalasia after so long and that's when I came across the POEM procedure. That's what ultimately led me to this day to get a check up for my disorder after so long. I'm currently 21 now. After going through a couple months with procedures and follow ups, the doctor gave me three options;\n\n1. Get another Heller Myotomy done and at the same time, fix the Hiatus Hernia, but getting this procedure redone has a 10% chance of puncturing a hole in my esophogus. This can all be done at my clinic.\n\n2. Get the POEM procedure done which is what my doctor recommended and what I also want to get done but the thing is, the closest place that does the procedure is in Cleveland, OH. and I'm currently in KY so it's about a 5 hour drive. Another problem is that I'm not sure yet if my health insurance will cover the surgery as it is in another state. Also, If I get this procedure done, they're not going to fix the Hernia as my doctor said he doesn't think that is the problem causing food the get blocked but I can get another surgery to fix that later on if it actually is the problem causing the food to get blocked.\n\n3. The final option is to just get no surgery done and just live my life like I have been the past couple of years and just keep dealing with the food getting stuck here and there.\n\nSo I'm really trying to get as much advice from anyone I can, from anyone who has had the POEM procedure done, or from anyone who had a repeat Heller Myotomy done. And Has anyone developed a Hiatus Hernia from getting the Heller Myotomy? Any sort of advice or experience anyone has had will help.

I am a 20 y/o male that has been diagnosed with Achalasia for about 7 years now. I had my Heller Myotomy back around June of 2010. Back then I was about 12-14 or so. I first noticed something wasn't right when I was able to regurgitate saliva and is was all foamy. I tried telling my parents about this but they made nothing of it. Things just started getting worse from here on.\n\nI wasn't able to consume anything, neither foods or liquids as it would just get stuck in my esophogus and I would have to regurgitate instantly. I wasn't getting any nutrients and I was literally going pale. I was always sleepy during class and at one point I remember passing out in class for a few seconds. This is when I had to go see a doctor. That was when I was told I had this eating disorder.\n\nFor about a month I had a feeding tube that went from my nose down to my stomach. The only thing that was basically keeping me alive at the time was the drink Ensure. I had to gain some weight before I had my surgury. Back then I didn't have much options. It was either the balloon method to stretch the esophogus but that didn't work at all. Botox injections but you would have to do that ever couple if months and my dad didn't want that. So my only option was surgury; the Heller Myotomy.\n\nAfter surgury, I was eating normal again, but not for long. It only lasted about a year or so and my symtoms were coming back. Fast forward a couple years and now I'm 20. After having this eating disorder for years now I'm quite used to it. Food would get stuck a couple of times every week and only sometimes I would choke and have to regurgitate. Sometimes drinking water to try and push it down would make it worse as water would just fill up in my esophogus. But I'm able to make myself regurgitate naturally from the esophogus and not have to stick my hand down my throat.\n\nNow a days I still do get self-centered when I'm eating around people and would have to regurgitate. It's a pain dealing with this problems sometimes. Especially having heartburn. After coming across this sub I found out about POEM which some of you guys have gotten. Back when I was diagnosed this wasn't an option for me. I did some research and apparently it's safe to get even after a Heller Myotomy. So I finally went for a check up after so long and talked to my doctor about this procedure. I'm not sure what's going to happen yet but a few days ago I just did the Barium swallow test for x-rays. I'm trying to get rid of this problem for good and eat normally again.\n\n\nSo to anyone who is dealing with Achalasia, you are not alone. We are 1 in 100,000 dealing with this problem and I can only wish it gets better for you. How ever bad your symtoms may be, I hope you get a check up right away and get the right procedure done. I wish you all a good luck and if you have any questions feel free to ask.

I feel like half of the posts in this sub are seeking advice for their own personal symptoms or looking for guidance on next steps to take, and I know I personally felt a lot of comfort in reading other people\u2019s stories that were similar to my own. Therefore, I wanted to share my own experience in the hopes it will help someone else, in some way. \n\nI was tentatively diagnosed with achalasia in August after having experienced symptoms since March 2020. My symptoms were in line with the ones often described in A sufferers: \n*problematic swallowing, \n*regurgitation of whole/undigested food, \n*uncomfortable \u201cfull\u201d feeling in chest (feels like chest tightness, but... different?), \n*feeling of food getting \u201cstuck\u201d which often feels like choking and results in forced or involuntary vomiting\n*weight loss (likely due to the above)\n\nAs of today, I\u2019m down 35 lbs from June 1, but my weight loss has slowed - I\u2019m probably grossing 3500-4500 kcal a day, but I throw up at least once daily so a lot of that isn\u2019t retained. Overeating has been the only meaningful method I\u2019ve found to mitigate the weight loss so far.. so while not ideal, it\u2019s what I\u2019m sticking with for now. I eat very selectively but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter - between the tightness and the stuck feeling, nothing ends up being foolproof. \n\nI had a barium swallow and an endoscopy w/ biopsy - all results normal. They proceeded to schedule a manometry, which they still believe will show that I have A. Or at least did, until today. \n\nKnowing that achalasia has been reported to have ties to autoimmune issues, I decided to get a workup from a rheumatologist to either confirm or rule out the option. I don\u2019t have any family history nor really any reason to believe it\u2019s possible, but I figure I might as well give it a shot - I\u2019m scared to death of coming out of the manometry with no diagnosis and left to feel like all of this was for naught (and worse, that I\u2019m thousands in the hole for the medical bills with nothing to show for it). \n\nAnyway, results all came back and I have **Limited Scleroderma** (specifically **CREST Syndrome**) - essentially, my body is attacking itself and causing the lining of my GI tract and other various organs to thicken. \u201cCREST\u201d is actually an acronym, of which E stands for esophageal dysmotility - to what degree varies from person to person, but in my case, it seems that it\u2019s much worse than the typical heartburn/reflux that is commonly described. \n\nMy GI team was consulted and agree that this diagnosis lines up with my test results so far. We\u2019re still going forward with the manometry to see if I still have A as well, or if this is just severe enough to present the same degree of symptoms. \n\nI\u2019m hoping that, if anyone is feeling hopeless about their diagnosis or lack thereof, this provides a little glimmer of hope that there may be other answers out there - I\u2019m taking the news as bittersweet, as it\u2019s a chronic disease without a cure, but having AN ANSWER is a relief to some extent. \n\nI\u2019m still hopeful that i get an official A diagnosis following my manometry so I can explore surgical treatment, as I\u2019m not sure the same options exist if I only have CREST... and i really don\u2019t want to switch to a liquid diet for the rest of forever. \n\nTo everyone in this community that\u2019s guided me so far - thank you so much, i genuinely don\u2019t know how I\u2019d have done it without you. Even just lurking and reading your stories, seeing how you\u2019re so supportive towards every poster, and reading the individual research you\u2019ve done has helped me immensely in my own journey. \n\nAnd to those still suffering or searching for answers - I wish you luck and hope that you don\u2019t have to wait much longer to get the help that you need.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 597, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New development after autoimmune blood tests", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/jt8opi/new_development_after_autoimmune_blood_tests/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dudeguy81", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8le3w", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605205573, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/jt0014/just_found_this_reddit_my_story/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jt0014", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/jt0014/just_found_this_reddit_my_story/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1605205585, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi All,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust found this reddit and I'm glad.

These days I try to eat slowly and chew everything to a pulp before I swallow but as you all know sometimes you slip up and trigger an event. For me when the event starts I usually have about half a minute to grab something to drink that can relieve it. If I cant find a drink or its too late, well then I head to the bathroom as fast as possible while drawing as little attention as possible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a few occasions the regurgitation has started before I reached the bathroom. My god is that horrifying because you know while you're in the restroom people are going to be discussing what they just saw and inevitably come and check on you. Its embarrassing all around and difficult to explain to people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat usually works for me to end the event is slowly sipping on and regurgitating room temperature water. Any liquid too cold or too hot seems to make the situation worse. Eventually things open up. Sometimes it takes a few minutes and other times it's taken me half an hour to get past it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf i'm not in public at least without the embarrassment to worry about the thing that bothers me the most is knowing that my delicious food is sitting there getting cold while I sit in the bathroom frustrated and in pain. In public... well like I said before, that's just terrible all around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways. Thanks for letting me ramble.

I\u2019ve been having progressive difficulty swallowing for about 7 or 8 months now. I saw an ENT doctor over the summer who thought it was food getting stuck on my tonsils, so I had them removed in July (I also had chronic tonsillitis that led to this decision).

I have a follow up appointment this week.\n\n\nIf my barium swallow and endoscopy came back normal, does that rule out achalasia? Most of my difficulty is with food and small pills (although it does feel like liquids go down a bit slower than usual), but the only solid thing they had me take during the barium swallow was a very large pill, so I\u2019m not sure if that matters. \n\n\nThe worst part of all of this is when stuff just sits in my throat and comes back up later. I currently have a bite of pizza sitting in my throat from 20 minutes ago, and it is so uncomfortable! I also once had a pill get stuck without me even feeling it - it actually foamed up and came back out of my mouth 20-30ish minutes later.

I couldn\u2019t work anymore, my legs were going blue and I was getting this periodical sharp pain on the right side of my chest.. *couldn\u2019t explain the last one*\n\nI was still trying to eat and drink, come mid December I was finally given an endoscopy and all the doctor said was that it was *\u201dinflammation\u201d* and my throat is working fine.. but it wasn\u2019t.\n\nI was then taken to the hospital by my dad on my birthday.. 27th December. I became a patient. I was there until mid February and had a series of tests done on me.. Barium Swallow, another endoscopy and a camera through the nose and down into the throat meanwhile sipping water as part of the test.\n\nResults came back, I had Achalasia.. Doctor told me that there were two options, surgery or balloon but he advised to take the surgery. \n\nI was checked out of hospital for about a month, doctor told me that I had lost too much wait to be ready for surgery and that I try to eat and drink to get my strength back, he gave me muscle relaxers for the throat and by some miracle I gained a few pounds back on me for surgery.. I was eating copious amounts of Reeses pieces as they were high in protein and weren\u2019t hard to swallow.\n\nFive years later and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for the surgery and the work the doctors put in to find out what was going on. \n\nI have to drink a lot with my meals and heartburn can be killer but other than that, healthy. \n\nI\u2019m glad I found this sub as I thought it would only be me to get something like this but Im glad to be able to speak to other folk who have it.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for rambling here with a long post but I always find I bore people when they ask me about it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 591, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I\u2019m glad to have found this Sub..", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/jo6mrp/im_glad_to_have_found_this_sub/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Haskk2020", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4l6ba4dw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1604425571, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/jney3p/food_recommendations_for_a_newbie/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jney3p", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/jney3p/food_recommendations_for_a_newbie/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1604425583, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm new here! My GI doc highly suspects I have achalasia causing my swallowing difficulty. A barium swallow showed severe esophageal dysmotility with complete absence of primary and secondary stripping waves resulting in a standing column of contrast within the esophagus. Endoscopy showed mucosal changes including longitudinal furrows throughout entire esophagus, but biopsies were normal. So now I'm just waiting on manometry to confirm next week.\n\nI've had intermittent swallowing issues for years, but about 4 months ago it suddenly started getting a lot worse with most food &amp; liquid feeling like it's stuck, needing lots of water to get anything down or immediate regurgitation. I also have stomach motility issues (gastroparesis, which causes me stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting too).\n\nUnfortunately most of my \"safe\" foods that don't upset my stomach &amp; gastroparesis seem to be the worst for getting stuck in my throat! Things like protein shakes, Ensure/Boost, oatmeal, yogurt, bananas, cottage cheese, pudding, rice, bread, noodles, cream of wheat...  Clear liquids and well-chewed solid food seem to go down easier than thick liquids for some reason -- is that typical for achalasia?? Does anyone have any low-fat low-fiber food recommendations that they can get down (and keep down!)? I'm really struggling nutritionally.

Been through tons of diagnostics and tests and this and that and was diagnosed with Achalasia. Got in to a great surgeon and was scheduled for a heller myotomy for Oct 20. Light at the end of the tunnel, I was stoked. Counting down the days.\n\n2 days ago I got a call from the surgeon\u2019s administrative assistant with some not so good news. At the hospital I\u2019ll be getting my surgery, COVID cases have spiked causing the ICU to be over capacity. As a result, hospital administration had asked all the surgeons to reschedule every \u201celective\u201d procedure until mid November. So basically, any surgery that is not preventing somebody from getting extremely sick or dying in the short term is getting backburnered. Its tough because Deep down I know I\u2019m doing generally OK, better than anyone that needs intensive care... but I feel really deflated and frustrated by the situation. I was really looking forward to moving forward with my life, as it has felt so on-hold in some ways.\n\nYesterday the doctor himself called me, which was nice of him. He seems really determined to make sure they\u2019re able to get me in sooner rather than later and it\u2019s good to know he\u2019s in my court. He did say that I should still get my pre procedure COVID test done, as there is something of a chance that now that beds have been freed up that they may give him the greenlight to take something like 5 elective cases on as long as they don\u2019t require an extended stay at the hospital, and he said I\u2019d be on the top of that list.\n\nHowever today I read an article in the local news about my hospital, how the ICU is at 105% capacity and rising, and how they expect it to only get worse, throughout the end of the year.\n\nThis is a big problem for me, because it was really pricy arriving at my diagnosis, and I was really happy I could get it done before the end of the year so I\u2019d hit my insurance maximum and the surgery would be so much more affordable for me. But now I\u2019m discouraged and thinking they may just keep putting me off until it\u2019s too late to get the procedure done before years\u2019 end.\n\nI\u2019m trying to remain hopeful that I\u2019ll be able to get in soon, but the uncertain anticipation around it all is killing me over here.\n\nSo, I know there\u2019s nothing concrete any of you can really do for me here, but some friendly words of encouragement from some of you who have gone through this ridiculous condition would perhaps brighten my outlook a little.\n\nThank you all.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 573, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Discouraged- could use some positive words", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/jd6qca/discouraged_could_use_some_positive_words/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Noobneedshelp83", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5pf9df7k", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1602284882, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/j89i97/achalasia_and_spinal_issues/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j89i97", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/j89i97/achalasia_and_spinal_issues/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1602284893, "score": 1, "selftext": "After some extensive research on my end and visiting several specialists I kept doing my own research and thinking about my condition. After having issues since 2017, I received a diagnosis of achalasia via barium swallow test a few months ago. I tried everything except surgery and then I thought about it from a neurological perspective. I realized that I've have had upper/middle back pain for a long time in the exact area that a pinched nerve could possibly cause dysfunction in the esophagus. I don't want to get my hopes up, but I had a really good and specific adjustment in that area of my spine by my chiropractor recently and the symptoms are slowly but notably going away after 3 days. I was able to eat pizza without getting choked up once, which has not happened in years.\n\nHas anyone here looked at their achalasia from a chiropractic or spinal surgery perspective? I imagine an MRI might confirm or rule this out if any of you have had one looking at that area?\n\nMy achalasia is fairly minor compared to most I think, but it has still been very debilitating, frustrating, painful, scary, and embarrassing at times. I had to plan meals with others very carefully. I have been aspirating at night, losing some weight, and if it's been a bad heartburn day/week, I'd hurt for a long time. I suspect all of this stems from the dysfunction of the LES and the other symptoms are caused by that. Again, a lot of this is a guess and specific to my situation.\n\nI'm hoping that this isn't false hope or random, but that spinal adjustment has helped me more than anything so far, and I really don't want to get surgery.\n\nTldr; has anyone checked for spinal/nerve issues as the cause of their achalasia?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 568, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Achalasia and spinal issues", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/j89i97/achalasia_and_spinal_issues/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ProfessorSillyPutty", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9s8le", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1601942562, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/j5uwa8/father_in_law_with_achalasia/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j5uwa8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/j5uwa8/father_in_law_with_achalasia/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1601942572, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi. I don\u2019t know how to go about learning more of this. But because of Covid I am unable to go to the hospital where my father in law (FL) is after his latest time not being able to swallow food. Unfortunately, he has now been there almost a week. Some backstory. FL has been diagnosed with A for probably 5 years. A few times a year he would have an attack where he could not swallow food. Early on he was stubborn and would wait days before going to the hospital. Over the years he has learned the feeling and symptoms and acts quickly. Typically when he goes to the hospital they give him some muscle relaxers which within hours loosen everything up allowing him to expel the contents of the esophagus and he can eat again. This time has been different. \n\nDay 1 - recognized the symptoms and goes to the hospital and gets standard treatment. But food was still not going down. They put a camera down his throat and say there was so much food to clear out and the telephone game tells me that they \u201cstretched\u201d it putting the camera in. He has been in a lot of pain and difficulty speaking since this. \n\nDay 2 - try treatment again to no luck. They put a feeding tube in to get nutrients. But he  was immediately puking up everything they tried to feed. So they IV dropped him nutrients. \n\nDays 3 - 5 (today) - they were able to tune him 15 ml/hour but any more and he pukes it up. Suddenly his stomach refuses to digest food and he is not even allowed to try and drink. They have put him back in the IV and are hoping to get him in with a specialist in two days. \n\nI really don\u2019t understand how suddenly in a week his digestive system suddenly refuses to work. I understand how swallowing is an issue, I am even understand how his standard treatment may not have worked... but for his digestion to just stop makes no sense to me. And while I can\u2019t talk to the doctor directly I hope someone here may have a good idea or understanding and could explain it to me better than my stressed wife.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 567, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Father in law with Achalasia", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/j5uwa8/father_in_law_with_achalasia/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LittleGreenDreams", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_19qzbgyg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1601936080, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/j5t52n/they_sent_me_to_a_quack/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j5t52n", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/j5t52n/they_sent_me_to_a_quack/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1601936090, "score": 1, "selftext": "I recently had to have a scan for something not related to achalasia.

Usually a big gulp of water would push it down or on bad occasions I'd regurgitate everything and it would pass after a few minutes. Never sought medical advice or even properly googled it as it never really seemed like a big deal, and was always told \"oh you just don't chew enough before swallowing\" and never thought of it as a medical condition.\n\nThen today I was really hungry but rushed out and skipped breakfast. When I eventually ate, first bite got stuck, couldnt wash it down.\n\nThen ever since I've not been able to eat or drink anything at all, even the smallest sip of water makes its way down halfway then I have to throw it back up. Anyone experienced similar? Does it eventually relax enough to drink something at least? Am I ever going to be able to swallow again? I've gone to the hospital as I'm really dehydrated and starving hungry and didnt know what the hell else to do.. situation is complicated by the fact I'm a UK citizen travelling in France, it sounds like this is a rare and not particularly well understood condition, and its important to be seen by the right doctor it seems (only hospital in town is rated 2 stars on google, great haha).\n\nAnyway, any advice would be great, weird how its gone from 0-100 so fast.

Woke up this morning without feeling like I've had acid sitting in it all night. \n\nOnly bummer about not being on the medicine is that overall, my stomach does sting a little more (I can feel the acid, essentially. However, all the other crappy symptoms are gone. \n\nAnybody else decide to ditch the medicine and feel way better?

I\u2019 don\u2019t have a diagnosis yet. Just some questions about test results and how to approach my consultant on this.\n\nI didn\u2019t realise I could have this until yesterday (had a manometry and pH study for the first time). I haven\u2019t spoken to  \nmy consultant yet but I want to go in with as much info as possible so I\u2019m hoping I might get some help here! Historically I\u2019ve been fobbed off many times (symptoms for 18 years, only just tested yesterday). I\u2019m concerned I\u2019ll just be told \u2018ah it was a bit abnormal we don\u2019t know why\u2019 as I\u2019ve heard that sentence too many times in my life - I have maaaany issues going on.\n\nI had it done for suspected oesophageal spasm as I have dysphagia and also GTN spray being effective at treating my chest pain episodes. After the manometry part the doctor performing the test described my oesophagus as having \u2018no motility during the 10 wet swallows\u2019 and that it went down \u2018just by gravity\u2019 but motility was fine during the whole glass of water and even stronger motility with the rice. I didn\u2019t expect this results at all I\u2019ll be honest. I asked what that meant and she has said it\u2019s not a motility disorder but is indicative of damage after acid reflux. (Though after leaving my boyfriend pointed out she told me the findings perfectly fine then was complete vague and iffy at all my questions as if she was just answering to comfort me and didn\u2019t actually know much about the results which I hadn\u2019t noticed). She didn\u2019t tell me about my LOS at all either and I forgot to ask. I had the pH part done and managed to get my chest pains thankfully but I watched the numbers on the monitor which didn\u2019t show my oesophagus going more acidic at all. So I know that I don\u2019t have acid reflux before even seeing my consultant.\n\nSo I did some looking into \u2018lack of motility\u2019 on manometry and I was pointed toward type I achalasia. Am I along the right lines? Is this what I should be asking my doctor about? I have no idea what my LOS did so I could be wrong but I can\u2019t find literally any other answers for complete lack of motility at the point I had it.\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 550, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Manometry yesterday - preliminary results are confusing though, does this sound like Achalasia?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/im379k/manometry_yesterday_preliminary_results_are/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "haircombsnightmare", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ljhk6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1599160259, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/ilzyre/do_these_symptoms_sound_more_like_achalasia_or/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ilzyre", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/ilzyre/do_these_symptoms_sound_more_like_achalasia_or/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1599160269, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have booked doctor appointments but due to covid there is a delay, so I wanted to consult this community meanwhile.\n\nHere are my symptoms:\n\n- At times of the day I can't swallow food or drinks.

I've been basically on a liquid diet since the start of the year.   \n\n\nSo far, I've had a barium swallow, esophageal manometry, and a gastroscopy with biopsies. This has essentially ruled out a lot of physical conditions such as achalasia or physical changes to the esophagus which might be to blame. The only thing that showed up on the manometry was that the esophagus was unusually weak, but the LES opened normally.   \n\n\nThe docs are now just suggesting that it's GERD which to me feels a bit like they've run out of ideas? Partially because I don't have the sensation of reflux or heartburn very often. I've been on Nexium for a week or so now after I first took it back in January with little effect...  \n\n\nSo I want to ask - if anyone has GERD with dysphagia as the primary symptom, how does it manifest itself?  \n\n\nFor me, I can eat or drink a little - and then suddenly I'll get to a point where I will hold food in my mouth, but physically can't force myself to swallow it - almost as if there's a psychological barrier that prevents me from swallowing the food, which might be an option. I feel like dysphagia caused by GERD might involve more physical pain/heartburn, but I have no idea as I've not heard anyone else's experience. Does anyone know what might be going on and have any light to shed from their own experience?  \n\n\n  \nI also wanted to say how grateful I was to this community while trying to get my initial diagnosis and rule out achalasia. Like everyone else, I guess, achalasia was not anything I had thought of (nor swallowing difficulties at all, really) prior to them showing up in my own life.

Everything has been fairly smooth sailing since then. I still get esophegeal spasms from time to time, but my surgeon said that's still going to happen since the condition doesn't go away (it's just mitigated). I can swallow fine for the most part, but the final third of my esophagus' nerves are completely out of commission. Very rarely does anything get stuck. I've been trying to chew slower, and not dump liquids down my gullet. \n\nAnyway, my wife and I are considering going dairy free because I've been dealing with burping and excessive gas lately. So there's one of two things I need to troubleshoot:  \n\n\n1. I had a candida infection before and after my surgery, so I suspect that could be causing the issues with burping lately. \n2. I could also be lactose intolerant. It's never violently uncomfortable, but I experience regular bouts with inflammation in my body. \n\nHave any of you suffered from this condition and also been lactose intolerant? What has you experience been like?\n\nFor extra flavor: I can eat fine. But after a certain threshhold I feel like I've over eaten (usually if I eat too quickly). I *feel* like I used to when I had issues with regurgitation, but nothing ever threatens to comes up (hint one that it's inflammation). Occasionally, I find that my saliva gets stuck somewhere in my esophagus, so when I DO regurgitate it's just a pitiful amount of saliva bubbles. And I mean like a dime size (hint two it's inflammation or candida).   \n\n\nTL;DR: I still have weird achalasia symptoms after my POEM, and I think it might be inflammation caused by candida or

"selftext": "Hey everybody. I\u2019m new to this Achalasia thing. I haven\u2019t been 100% diagnosed yet, but I think I\u2019m on the verge. The GI doc was pretty sure it was Achalasia when he did an endoscopy, and ordered a barium study to confirm things.\n\nBeing able to watch what my esophagus was doing (or not doing in this case) was fascinating at first. But then it dawned on me that this important part of my body is now effectively dead and can\u2019t be fixed, and it\u2019s left me with a feeling of just loss, honestly. Like I\u2019ve had a friend die or something.\n\nAs for my current condition, thankfully water will push almost any food down. It\u2019s a little annoying how much water I need to be able to eat without choking/regurgitation, but it is what it is and I\u2019m glad water works for me. My esophagus/LES will even allow me to basically chug water which is a godsend for just clearing out anything left over after a meal.\n\nProbably the most annoying thing for me though is what Achalasia does when I\u2019m asleep. Even when I haven\u2019t had food for hours before bed, all the saliva I swallow while asleep just sits there and then I regularly wake up coughing and spluttering from it. This is the biggest concern I have at the moment.\n\nSo a few questions.\n\n- With how water works for me currently to push food down and flush everything in, is it likely that my condition will eventually worsen to where this will no longer be the case?\n\n- In your experience, am I at a point right now where it makes sense to get a surgery for this? I\u2019m still able to eat somewhat normally with lots of water, have no acid reflux, etc... would the surgery help with my nighttime issues or anything else? I\u2019m just trying to gauge risk/benefit here.\n\n- One thing ive noticed is that my singing voice is no longer what it was. I can no longer sing as loud or hit higher notes I used to be able to hit. I believe this is just because I always wake up with a sore throat from coughing and regurgitating and my throat/voice is just irritated from that without getting a chance to fully recover, but I still have this worry in the back of my mind that maybe something about Achalasia itself has just messed up my voice a little? Some insight on this would be swell, if any of you have noticed similar.\n\n- Is Achalasia ever one smaller symptom of a larger problem affecting more of the body or is it just localized to having an esophagus that doesn\u2019t function correctly?\n\nThanks everybody for your support.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 526, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hello all.

So I started a 3,000 calorie a day diet. I want to share how I\u2019ve been doing it with you all even if it only helps one person.\n\nI went out and bought a food processor and have been grinding all of my food down, mostly grilled chicken, beef, brisket, pork, everything. I get around 1,500 calories a day from this. I drink 3 protein shakes a day and that\u2019s around 800. Then I drink two Carnation Breakfast Essentials a day and that\u2019s around 525 with whole milk. The rest I get from drinking milk and eating small solids here and there. It\u2019s definitely tough, but I\u2019m already seeing weight gain. I like to think of my esophagus as an hourglass and grinding the food helps it go down tremendously.

Just wanted to talk to ppl who\u2019ve experienced this; don\u2019t have access to a doc rn bc of lockdown in my country and ive been very anxious about this for the past month or so.\n\nbasically, i started getting chronic acid reflux around two years ago, pretty out of the blue: had an endoscopy, x ray etc done and the diagnosis was just possible GERD most probably bc of anxiety/stress (i was diagnosed w general anxiety a few years ago). My symptoms would involve the classic acid coming up your throat, pain in stomach etc but also sometimes the feeling of something being stuck in my throat and sometimes, spasming in my upper oesophagus.\n\nin the last two months, that feeling of something being stuck is happening more often and when im swallowing it kinda feels like food is sticking to the wall of my throat if that makes sense? I haven\u2019t choked or vomited yet and the feeling comes and goes.\n\nI know that dysphasia is a symptom of many other things (including GERD) but i just wanted to know if anyone here experienced this in the early stages of achalasia? I\u2019m just scared that maybe I\u2019m developing this disease and honestly, don\u2019t know how much of it is my anxiety!! \n\nOne thing: I\u2019m able to burp, and it happens pretty often. Sometimes the spasm actually goes away after I burp and I also get a lot of pain in my stomach, like right under the rib cage. From what I\u2019ve read, these aren\u2019t really symptoms of achalasia right? \n\nVery sorry to bother you guys but quarantine is making my health anxiety a lot worse and I just need a little reassurance from someone who\u2019s actually experienced this:(", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 512, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Could this be achalasia?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/hc71kd/could_this_be_achalasia/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Faerla", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2jgvow38", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1592449150, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/hb6bfj/welp_here_goes_again_botox_or_poem/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hb6bfj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/hb6bfj/welp_here_goes_again_botox_or_poem/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1592449154, "score": 1, "selftext": "After being diagnosed with pseudo-achalasia a year ago (and not being able to eat solids for six months before that) I was given a Botox shot to see if it would work - it worked great until this week, and now I\u2019m fully back on liquids.

Originally I went to a surgeon in my hometown (small town), he did an endoscopy and dilation and told me I had a Hiatal hernia and that I shouldn\u2019t pursue surgery and just deal with it. \n\nFast forward 5 years, newly married, and it\u2019s getting noticeably worse. Wife is a nurse and basically forces me to go get something done. So I go to the GI doc, tell them my history (I had no records from old surgeon who retired), and they said we need to do an endoscopy to check. They do that and say, yeah there\u2019s no hiatal hernia. So they set me up with a manometry test. That was uncomfortable... but it confirmed Type 2 Achalasia. \n\nSo I meet with the foremost surgeon for the POEM surgery in Atlanta, GA and he recommends it to me, we talk it over, we schedule it. Insurance denies it. We appeal, the doc appeals, it\u2019s a whole big ordeal. Still denied. \n\nThat was back in January. Things have been steady for the most part other than the occasional 36-48 hours where I can\u2019t eat or drink anything and it usually clears up. (I\u2019m in one of those periods now and feel like I\u2019m losing my mind) \n\nSo my question to you, should I try fighting the insurance company more? Should I get the state insurance commissioner involved or maybe go to a reporter or is that just the way of the world, in which case should I seek out an HM?\n\nFrom what I understand, POEM is less invasive, quicker recovery, and less problems with GERD than HM. But I can\u2019t do anything about insurance and I\u2019m getting to the end of my resolve. I broke down crying this morning (which I never cry. I\u2019m one of those bottle it up or sweep it away guys, I just don\u2019t do it) because I just can\u2019t live like this anymore. My diet is so limited and unhealthy because of what works and doesn\u2019t work for me, I dread going out to dinner with friends/family for fear of it not going down, I hate having to think about it. I just want to eat and drink and live my life without constantly worrying about regurgitation or good being stuck. This condition is tough, very tough.\n\n\nEDIT: Currently, my regurgitation is thick, mucus-like, saliva. It\u2019s like it\u2019s never ending.

I fasted the whole next day and only ate 1 small meal the day after that. The feeling didn't go away. I thought it might be acid reflux or gerd so I bought a bunch of soft healthy non acidic foods to eat such as avocados, oatmeal, bananas and yogurt. Ate some tums but it didn't seem to help. I don't have the typical reflux symptoms such as heartburn or sore throat or anything like that. I don't feel like acid is flowing back up to my esophagus. My one and only symptoms since new years day is everytime I eat something it feels like a small part of the food is stuck at the lowest part of my neck right above my chest. I even ate some acidic foods recently to test if it was acid reflux but I didn't get any heartburn or reflux symptoms. I've still been eating mostly non acidic soft foods but it always feels like a small part of it gets stuck in my lower throat. I don't have any trouble breathing, swallowing, drinking liquids. My symptom usually goes away as I'm eating but 15-30 min after I eat when I swallow water or my spit it feels like it hits something (either a piece of food or a lump in throat) on the way down. I never fully regurgitated anything yet. Food never came back into my mouth. I never vomited or gagged. It just feels like everytime I eat some food particles get stuck at my lower throat right above my chest. I'm curious to hear your guys opinions on what this might be? And I'm also curious to hear what were your first symptoms you felt before being diagnosed with this rare disease. Prior to this I've never had any problems eating and swallowing. Never felt this feeling before but I'm worried that's its been 23 days and counting and it hasn't gotten any better.\n\nI have a doctors appointment with my PCP on the 31st (earliest available) but I'm considering making an appointment with a specialist and getting an endoscopy be done right away. My insurance requires me to go to my PCP first and getting a referral but I fear getting misdiagnosed with reflux and taking medication I don't need which might make this condition worse over time. So I'm thinking of paying out of pocket to go see a specialist right away for an endoscopy. \n\nAny opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 1024, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I fear I have Achalasia", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/sbe5qx/i_fear_i_have_achalasia/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PrincessTroubleshoot", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_771ljer6", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642713476, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/s8t7c0/curious_about_early_symptoms/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s8t7c0", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/s8t7c0/curious_about_early_symptoms/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642713487, "score": 1, "selftext": "I don\u2019t have a diagnosis, but my Gastroenterologist suspects it is either achalasia or EoE.

Freaked me out like crazy as I chugged sparkling ice and hot tea for 2 hours until I finally felt it pass down.\n\nSadly, this has become a near daily occurrence pretty much every time I've eaten since then, though with varying degrees of severity.  On the best days, I've been able to eat certain foods, sometimes even a meal's worth, pretty easily while only clearing my throat a bit throughout.  On the worst days (which has unfortunately been more of them,) I find that trying to eat four bites of something causes my esophagus to feel like there's a baseball shoved inside of it, and I'm violently hacking my lungs out for the entire rest of the day.  When this happens I pretty much just have to survive on little protein shakes for the next 48 hours or so until the feeling dies down to the point that I become confident enough to nibble something solid again.\n\nThe only other thing I've found that could possibly match what I'm dealing with is throat cancer, but I feel it's unlikely that I have that due to not having it in my family, and me being young and relatively healthy.\n\nMy doctor's office has been very unhelpful in helping me try to figure out what's going on, but I'm trying to get a barium swallow and possible manometry done.\n\nUntil then, do you folks have any tips on how I might better soothe/manage the symptoms myself in daily life?  Foods that are good/ones to avoid (what I eat has seemed to have a random effect on how bad the symptoms are, but foods that are very dry/grainy/stringy/etc are always incredibly difficult to swallow without fail.)?\n\nAlso, how dangerous is it to deal with this untreated?  There have been many times where I'm super afraid I'm gonna start choking and die, and I definitely think I'm at risk for aspirating food if it hasn't happened yet.

I know I\u2019ll have to not workout after an amount of time which is all good with me too.

Worst part is, because I've had a few drinks, I can't risk trying the calcium blockers the GP is trialing me on, to see if they work, because of the booze. It's one of the first proper nights drinking really in at least 2 and a half years since developing A (or when I noticed I was ill at least) wish a girl luck that this pain will fade soon.

Thank you for being here. I\u2019ve been lurking a while. \n\nI\u2019ve had trouble getting diagnosed but I think we\u2019re there- my initial manometry showed aperistalsis but a hypotonic LES , so there were a few months of wild goose chasing but a repeat EGD and a fluoroscopy seem to be smoking guns. Classic bird beak etc. and yeah, I have all the symptoms. Working theory is that the first manometry result was screwy. I\u2019m on deck for a repeat manometry but the equipment is currently belly up and the facility is awaiting new stuff. \nMy GI doc agreed to refer me to a surgeon instead of waiting for another manometry. She asked me which I wanted - a POEM or a HM. I said HM and saw that surgeon. That doc looked over all the test results and took a history and put me on nifedipine, and ordered the fluoroscopy and repeat manometry. The nifedipine is helping a tiny bit so I\u2019d like to try increasing the dosage. And also \u2026 maybe try the sub lingual since I CANT SWALLOW THE PILLS. Ugh. Sorry. Anyway that doc has been utterly unresponsive to all my efforts to ask a medication question so now I\u2019m rethinking working with her for the surgery. If she doesn\u2019t answer messages\u2026 this feels like a bad way to start. \nBut POEM\u2026 what about post op GERD?  Don\u2019t you end up needing a fundoplication eventually? Can a POEM alone be a long term solution? \n\nAlso - nifedipine users- what dosage were you on? How much did it help? I\u2019m on 30 mg extended release and I\u2019d say I am experiencing a 5% improvement in swallowing but the regurgitation is significantly reduced. \n\nAnd finally \u2026 are specific doctors, facilities, etc ok to discuss? Or is that against the rules? I\u2019m new to Reddit so \u2026 don\u2019t want to screw up. I\u2019d love to know if there\u2019s a doc or facility that folks have used near me (upstate NY - anywhere from Kingston to Albany, Binghamton to Syracuse). \n\nThanks folks.

However my dad has described all of the same symptoms as me, I have seen him struggle to swallow for years and it\u2019s getting worse, he says his food always gets stuck and he has to hit himself in the chest to help get his food down etc. He refuses to get help or believe he is sick even though he watched me basically lifeless in my hospital bed for a week. And my brother constantly \u201cthrows up\u201d (which I believe is regurgitation), could be achalasia or other serious GI distress, this has been going on for years. I have told them both to get help considering my case but they\u2019re convinced it\u2019s fine. I honestly believe we have a case of familial achalasia which is so discouraging because I have to watch them suffer and I can\u2019t help, and so little is known about the genetics of it.

It doesn't hurt, it just feels tight and eating more with this feeling is certainly out of the question. There's also a lot of burping involved along with a fluterring feeling in my chest and when it's real bad, my arms feel numb.\n\nThese episodes generally last a few hours and generally clear up when I wake up (although when it's real bad it takes a few days to feel normal again). \n\nCan some of you relate to this feeling?\n\n(On a sidenote, I'm currently going back to get a manometry seeing as it's been seven years or so since my last one, things are just very slow in the Quebec medical system.)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia",

I was a pretty irregular eater before, but am now on a normal eating cycle (breakfast, dinner etc.). My doc attributed it to food getting stuck after eating late, another said it's contractions, but no one is sure. Regular painkillers do nothing, and it only seems to calm down after getting an IV. It's nice that it stops afterwards, but I don't quite understand why. Does it relax my stomach or does it just straight up numb my pain. After the IV I'm pretty much immediately back on my legs, with a tired feeling in my chest. All of these incidents occurred between 2-5 in the morning (don't know if relevant). The pain doesn't go away and is constant for hours on end unless I decide to go to the ER.\n\nI'm interested if anyone has any similar issues? Any food-related tips?

I DO have an appointment with a GI specialist tomorrow. Just looking to share and relate. \nIn 2015 I started having heartburn and an awful gnawing feeling in my stomach. It was like a creature was trying to eat its way out of my stomach. So painful. I had both upper and lower GI scopes done along with a test that monitored my gallbladder function and ended up getting my gallbladder removed that Spring. They were supposed to also fix a hiatal hernia but when they went in that was gone. That helped for a couple years but then the heartburn and awful gnawing in my stomach came back. I was diagnosed with reflux but it never really seemed like anything helped. I tried an elimination/anti-inflammatory diet which proved absolutely nothing. Finally it was suggested that this was structural and not related to types of food. I had another endoscopy and a manometry (worst medical experience of my life-the trauma) right before I moved across the country and obviously switched GI doctors. The new guy was able to read the tests and diagnosed me with achalasia. The kicker is that by the time I saw him, I was fine. I had been prescribed Protonix before I moved to try to help with the pain and it worked. Since I wasn\u2019t symptomatic at the time of my visit I really didn\u2019t get a lot of info other than \u201cif it hurts, come back immediately or you could aspirate\u201d and that I would eventually need surgery. He made it seem dire that I get in to see him if my symptoms come back. \n\nIt\u2019s 2 years later and it HURTS. All of the sudden I\u2019m having heartburn whether I eat or not and that gnawing is happening throughout my stomach when I eat or drink anything. It\u2019s so tight in my chest and at the lower base of my esophagus. I feel like I could breathe fire. And there\u2019s other sharp pains in various places in my abdomen. The Protonix seems to have stopped working? I know it\u2019s for short term use but this guy has had me on it for two years. Or are there just phases of achalasia that come and go? I\u2019ve only had swallowing issues a few times and have only regurgitated (fully threw up) a couple times two years ago. It seems like out of nowhere I\u2019m rapidly accelerating towards the worst my symptoms have ever been. \nIs this just how it is??

Everything seemed OK until about three days ago when I started having violent hiccups after I walked more than 100 meters. I am thinking this is related to reflux where stomach acid is touching the bottom of my esophagus as I walk. I'm taking 40 mg of omeprazole twice a day at the moment. The hiccups tend to stop if I lay flat on the ground (hard to do in public), holding my breath etc. does not really help. Fortunately they do stop after about 15 minutes but it's very exhausting when it's happening. I'm on a liquid diet at the moment. Has any one had similar experience?

As of now, I have an LHM procedure scheduled for 10/19. This morning I met with a surgeon on the POEM procedure. My initial worry with POEM was the acid reflux and potential development of GERD. LHM procedure has a way to 'wrap' the area to help prevent this. After meeting with the POEM surgeon today, they've developed a way to do a similar type of esophageal wrap to help combat the post surgery reflux. \n\nThe 'new' downside I'm faced with is the wait. 2 weeks for LHM or 2 months (give or take) for POEM. POEM Surgeon today mentioned that with LHM, there will be scar tissue and fibrosis. If my symptoms come back, which I'd then need to do POEM, the procedure may be more difficult due to this. Whereas a POEM now would not leave this type of interference to deal with should POEM#2 become necessary in 10, 15, 20 years etc. \n\nLooking for peoples thoughts on this and if anyone else was faced with a similar predicament. The *obvious* answer seems to be to wait now, for potentially a faster recovery and 'future proof' my insides should the achalasia comes back. \n\nAlternatively, it would be nice to have this over and done with, fully healed, in the time frame I'm looking at to have the POEM surgery started. \n\nCheers.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 902, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "POEM vs LHM", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/q16hk8/poem_vs_lhm/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "njstce4a11", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_16nem8", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1633283344, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/q0mu0o/food_tips/", "gildings": {}, "id": "q0mu0o", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/q0mu0o/food_tips/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1633283355, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have type 2 achalasia.

I am 29.  My Achalasia seemed to start while in the Military, I was very stressed, got sick, and had a death in the family.  It seems I can trace back the issues to starting at this point.  \n\nI had a lot of problems getting food to go down, I would also get esophagus spasms as well.  I lost around 30-40 pounds and I was never out of shape.  That amount of weight was a lot.\n\nI have a few scopes with stretches done.  Had the balloon stretch done as well.  I had barium swallows, sensors down my nose and into esophagus, cat scans, well you get the point.  I had a lot of tests done, and non of it was fun.  \n\nI had my Heller myotomy with a Dor fund.....(the wrap of the stomach) just shy of a year ago now.  I am still not perfect.  I can't eat a lot of foods still.  I have to manage how fast I eat, how much I chew, etc.  It is a lot better then before the surgery though.  I can eat foods now that I could not eat before.\n\nAfter the surgery I still get my esophagus spasms.  I get on average of one a week.  They last from between 30 minutes to 3.5 hours.  \n\nAnyways on with this tips:\n\n\n**Spasms**\n\n* Water.  If you are getting a spasm try to drink a large amount of cold water without stopping.  This some how shocks the muscles/nerves I assume.  If you catch it fast enough sometimes you can stop a spasm\n* Try to distract yourself.  I find watching tv won't help.  I need to do something minor like going through the tv channel guide and reading something.  Anything really.  \n* Deep breaths.  You need to calm down to try to relax the muscles.  Take deep breaths and try not to panic.  Getting upset or angry only makes it worse. \n* If medications work for you, obviously take them.  I have not found a medication to help mine.\n* I have found that stress triggers my spasms.  Try to be aware of this and see if it is a deciding factor in your spasms as well.  If it is, try to learn how to deal with stress and eliminate stress from your life if you can.  That means certain people, set automatic banking setups.  Anything you can possibly do, it's worth it.\n* Write it all down.  I suck at this one, but when I do, it's very helpful.  Write down times, triggers, length, etc.\n\n\n**Eating**\n\n* Posture is very important.  Sit up straight, relax, and focus.  You need to pay attention while eating now.  It's important to not let your mind wander as you will go back to bad habits.  Slouching, not chewing carefully, etc.\n* Chew carefully and make sure your creating small enough pieces.\n* Don't talk.  Adding in talking while eating is sure to create problems.  \n* If food starts getting stuck, unclog it early.  Take a drink of water to push it down.  I also find if I arch my back backwards and take a very deep breath and hold, I can get it to go down sometimes.  \n* Focus is really the most important.  Pay attention if things are going down.  Help them down if they are not.  Pay attention to the chewing and the posture.  Focus will save you from throwing up that food.\n* Make a list of foods that consistently bother you.  Sometimes a food will bother you, but it won't the next time.  So maybe make two lists.  One for absolutely not, and one for if you really want to eat it. \n\n\n**Sleeping**\n\n* I used to have a lot of trouble sleeping before my surgery.  I would still have food or water in my esophagus that was stuck there. I would end up choking on it and waking up.  I found that putting my bed on an angle slightly helped for this problem.  Find the angle that works for you.  Raise the head of your bed about 6 inches and see if it helps.\n* Flush your esophagus with water before bed.  Roughly an hour I would say if possible.  So drink a glass of water.\n* Don't eat too close to bed time.  This is one tip I failed often.  Its a bad habit.  Don't eat 2-3 hours before bed is the suggested amount of time.\n* Make sure your wife/husband/etc knows your issues.  Be understanding to them too.  They hear you gurgle, choke, and almost die at night too.  That can't be too much fun for them.  It is important they know as well so they can help.  If you need a glass of water, or need them to help prop you up.  Don't be too proud to ask.\n\n\n**General**\n\n* Talk to people.  It helps, but will get annoying explaining your situation.  Just like any issue in life, you need to talk to someone and get some feelings off your chest.\n* Try to eliminate stress.  I can't push this one enough.  Stress makes everything worse. \n* Try too look on the bright side.  It could be a lot worse.  Sometimes it won't feel like it could be, but it really could.  You're still on the right side of the dirt.   \n* Help others.  This will help your stress and outlook on things.  If you can help someone else with the same issues, you will feel rewarded.  \n* If you have the surgery, don't expect it to be 100% better after.  I would say I was 50% better then before my surgery.  If you ask me, anything was better then throwing up every dinner in front of my kids.\n* Water will be your friend now.  I carry a 1 Litre container with me like its my security blanket.  It will help push things stuck in your esophagus down, it will help lube up the esophagus for food, and it will make you healthier.  \n* Try to put on some weight before your surgery or after.  Use skim milk powder to add to your normal milk for extra calories.  Anything you can do to add some weight.  I had a 5 day hospital stay after my surgery and I could not eat for 3 of those days.  I had some slight complications due to scar tissue.  You will need the extra weight to help you through the bad times.  \n\n\nI will try to think of more things to add to this.  I really hope this helps at least one person through this.  It does suck, we know.

It has made swallowing solids difficult, although I have been able to continue to swallow liquids and soft solids on occasion. Eating even the softest foods now takes an extremely long period of time. It has caused significant weight loss \\~2-3 stone since onset. When I try to eat too much, or drink too much, I seem to belch large amounts of mostly air back up again + I feel some swallowing of air is going on.\n\nI have seen multiple ENT doctors already and they have taken a look but seen no clear obstruction in the throat. Following this, I went to have a barium swallow as my ENT referred me to do so. This has been conducted, and the report from the swallow is at the end of this post.   \n\n\nAchalasia has been suggested to me as a possible cause, but I'm not sure it's necessarily the right fit. First off, the barium swallow does show that the pipe into the stomach opens slightly more slowly than you might expect, but there's no big build-up of stuff behind that pipe as you see sometimes in classic achalasia. Secondly, these difficulties seemed to come on pretty suddenly after November - before then I had no issues at all, and since then I've struggled to eat solid meals (only very slowly) and mostly been restricted to liquids. Thirdly is this regular belching of air, when as I understand it achalasia can stop this from happening at all.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, I'm pretty convinced I had a viral infection last November, so it may be that this was part of what damaged the LES.   \n\n\nI know no one here can give a proper diagnosis from this info, but any advice on specifically whether these symptoms sound like you, how to manage the condition, and what your barium swallows looked like if you had them would be very helpful. In light of the COVID situation I doubt I can see a doc for a while.   \n\n\nHere's the report from the swallow: I have footage if people want to see it. \n\n\"Barium passes from the mouth to the stomach. There is evidence of dysmotility with multiple tertiary waves and proximal escape of contrast. There is also delayed opening of the gastro-oesophageal sphincter resulting in air-fluid levels. A substantial volume of residue is seen throughout the pharynx and oesophagus. These findings are worse when barium was combined with the solid bolus of biscuit and also exacerbated on prone swallow.\n\nThere is no evidence of a mucosal or submucosal abnormality. The cricopharyngeus opens normally. No frank gastro-oesophageal reflux was demonstrated but there was marked proximal escape of contrast on prone swallowing.\n\nComment: The appearance is suggestive of dysmotility well beyond what would be expected for the patient's age.\"\n\nI really want to know what the problem is here, what the best approach is towards returning to ordinary swallowing, and whether there are any other steps that I should take to help me deal with this condition, medications, procedures... therapy... my approach at the moment is try to build back up my ability to swallow by going for progressively more difficult foods over time, as you would after a major accident, but I'm nervous about choking or trying to do too much.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 454, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "do I have achalasia?

Feeling very frustrated and discouraged as I thought that my problems were gone post-op. \n\nHere are some links to what I found on PubMed if you're interested: \n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21899655](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21899655)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23329193](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23329193)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28568312](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28568312)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 443, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Achalasia &amp; other Autoimmune Comorbidites", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/fcyy0a/achalasia_other_autoimmune_comorbidites/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ohknowletsgo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5bdbu1ho", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1583178084, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/fchmvn/anyone_not_had_weight_loss/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fchmvn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/fchmvn/anyone_not_had_weight_loss/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1583178093, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was diagnosed a couple of years ago with a barium swallow and an esophageal manometry. I had dilation (which only seemed to help for a couple of days), and my doctor said he thought the risk of perforation was too high to dilate any further. He said that he had worse patients, and didn't recommend surgery at the time, but mentioned that I could try a botox injection. I declined because I read that relief from that is often short term as well (if anyone has had long-term relief, I'd love to hear!), and I had an awful time coming out of anesthesia after the dilation. For the most part, I've been able to notice when the dysphagia is bad, and avoid having severe episodes by taking smaller swallows and waiting for food to exit into my stomach. \n\nAlthough I describe my dysphagia as mild to moderate (I rarely fully regurgitate food), I have noticed it getting a bit worse over the years. I often wake up with a sore throat and cough (many times during the night, making it difficult to get a good night's rest). Sometimes when I cough, food feels like it gets dislodged in my throat (often hours after I've eaten) and ends up back in my mouth. I get what I believe are esophageal spasms in the middle of the night (that at first I thought were a heart attack) about once every two months. While swallowing is almost always something I have to think about when I eat (attempting to swallow too much or in rapid succession is a recipe for disaster), I only have severe episodes about once a month (where food stays in my throat for a few minutes causing intense pain and trouble breathing). \n\nThrough all this, I've actually gained weight, not lost it, so I tend to think it's not severe enough to warrant going back to the doctor (the last time I emailed him, about a year ago, he didn't see any reason for me to come back in). I don't want to have unnecessary tests and procedures (especially when I have no trouble keeping weight on), but I also don't want to put additional strain on my esophagus. \n\nI guess am curious about how things have progressed for others? Was there a period where your symptoms were like mine, but eventually got much worse and weight loss occurred? Is weight loss the best metric for determining whether your achalasia is severe enough to return to the doctor?

I\u2019ve been suffering for about a year and a half or so. Formally diagnosed with type 3 Achalasia this past September. I\u2019m aware that I apparently have this disease- I have terrible symptoms, have lost over 20 pounds but I\u2019m still in some sort of disbelief or denial. I\u2019m depressed about it.

I have a medical background but it\u2019s very different when you are the patient... and it\u2019s something so rare. No one has really taken any time to really talk with me about this disease. I have done hours upon hours upon hours of research. I\u2019ve learned a lot about it and I\u2019m terrified. I feel very alone. I\u2019m desperately reading all kinds of health and healing books, watching the Heal documentary and I\u2019ve gone to a homeopathic/naturopathic, herbalist specialist ,(awaiting to receive my tinctures still) I\u2019ve tried acupuncture, I\u2019m trying to learn how to meditate- basically ANYTHING to try and magically heal. I have even tried medication to reduce inflammation which did help extremely well. Which proves this is inflammation.

I lost 22 lbs in 3 months and had more than normal difficulty eating almost all foods. Had an EGD performed were the gastro identified what he thought maybe achalasia due to difficulty with my LES opening during the procedure. I performed a manometry test in November and the results showed that I had abnormal results at the LES but not in the criteria for a diagnosis of achalasia. During this time frame, I met with an allergist and we identified that I have a Milk allergy. I've removed all milk proteins from my diet and I am going in for a follow-up EGD to identify if removing milk protein has cleared my EOE but at the same time, the gastro wants to inject botox into the LES to identify if this will help alleviate my difficulty swallowing. \n\nMy question is has anyone had a similar experience or know someone who has?

I know that achalasia is probably caused by a virus, but it's been hard not correlating it with vaping since it's a very big coincidence (someday soon, I could see the scientists learning that vaping causes esophageal nerve damage).\n\nAnyway, it all started out feeling like angina or other cardiac issues, but I had all the heart tests, followed by lung tests and a wide range of other tests (X-rays, MRI, CT scan, blood panel, upper endoscopy, barium swallow, manometry, etc.).\n\nAs of today, I know that I have severe ineffective esophageal motility (90% failed swallows) and I'm right on the border of functional outlet obstruction (EGJOO), which is a close relative of achalasia.\n\nI met with a GI doctor yesterday and he is going to recommend that I get Botox injections first, to see if it helps. And to repeat the manometry in two months. He thinks I'm in the early stages of full-blown achalasia.\n\nFrom there, they will get a better idea if I should pursue surgery.\n\nHere's the thing: Unlike people with official achalasia, I'm not choking or barfing or having problems swallowing liquids. My problem is that food feels stuck in my chest/esophagus for hours (not all foods, but many foods), which is just uncomfortable but not unbearable. I also have weird heart and left arm/rib pain that the doctors can't explain, along with an ongoing dizzy feeling that seems directly tied to swallowing. And now I'm having lower digestive issues that are probably related to all the medications and special diets I've tried.\n\nI think I will get another opinion before I do Botox injections, because I've read that can cause scarring and problems with surgery later on.

I apologize in advance for the long post. After five months of medical testing, it has been very hard getting answers from doctors so I wanted to see if anyone with achalasia can provide input. \n\nMy health background: I have Hashimoto's, which has yet to affect my thyroid levels, plus IBS and acid reflux, and now borderline \"type 4 achalasia.\"\n\nBack in April, after a year of incredible stress and vaping non-stop on the Juul, I started having left-side chest pain/soreness, left arm pain that radiated down my hand, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and other symptoms that felt like angina. I quit all forms of nicotine, because all nicotine was a trigger for these symptoms (including nicotine lozenges). Soon enough, I also quit caffeine. \n\nEventually it turned into trouble swallowing, feeling like food was stuck in my chest for hours, and feeling a pins and needles/itchy sensation inside my chest. I also started feeling more sensitive to medication, with dizziness, sore throat, and an array of other weird symptoms.\n\nI got all the cardiac tests and they ruled out cardiac issues (possible mild right ventricular hypertrophy, but nothing they were concerned about). Also saw ENT and pulmonary specialists, with no concerns from them (just a tiny lung nodule that I will get rechecked soon).\n\nNext, I saw a gastroenterologist and got an upper endoscopy. They found a small hiatal hernia and some esophageal thrush, but they didn't think this would explain all my symptoms. I took fluconazole for the thrush, and they told me to try a PPI, but taking the PPI wasn't helping and was actually causing weird collarbone and joint pain.\n\nAt that point, my primary doc wrote everything off as anxiety (I have since changed doctors).\n\nAfter pushing for a follow-up appointment with GI, they had me do a manometry. \n\nWell, this was the result from the manometry:     \n\n\"Your esophageal motility study was abnormal. The resting LES pressure was normal at 25.0 mmHg, but the residual LES pressure (IRP) was borderline elevated at 15.0 mmHg. There was no obstructive morphology at the GEJ, however. The esophageal body demonstrated 90% failed swallows and 10% normal swallows. This recording demonstrates ineffective esophageal motility and a borderline elevated IRP, with possible borderline EGJ outflow tract obstruction.\"\n\nApparently Ineffective Esophageal Motility is pretty common, but I have a very bad case of it and borderline EGJOO. \n\nAs a next step the doctor is having me take Bethanechol (50mg, 3X a day) and Protonix to help with the reflux symptoms. These things seem to be helping a little bit, at least, along with getting acupuncture and taking CBD for anxiety, eating slowly and very small portions, chewing very carefully, following a low-acid diet and avoiding gluten, dairy, and other triggers. \n\nHowever, whenever I swallow anything except for water and a few other beverages like chamomile tea, I still get that stuck feeling in my chest and lower sternum (food eventually goes down, but slowly), the achy (almost arthritic) feeling in my left chest and left arm/hand, and some various acid reflux symptoms. \n\nAgain, it seems to be a bit better thanks to the medication, but I can still notice it a lot, and I have to eat very small portions or it's way worse.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why everything started with just a mild pain in the left chest, and has now become this full-fledged swallowing issue five months later. It was almost like a series of symptoms that progressed into this -- as if I had some sort of virus that progressed to other stuff.\n\nMy doctor said I was not yet at the achalasia stage, and the only way to know would be to redo the manometry in a year.\n\n**QUESTIONS**\n\nCan you relate to any of these symptoms as your disease progressed?\n\nDid you have a series of symptoms that started out feeling like one thing (such as cardiac, or viral) and progressing to the swallowing issues?\n\nDid you try medication at any point?\n\nWhen did you finally get diagnosed and qualify for surgery? Did you have to wait a long time?\n\nI have a follow-up next week with the gastroenterologist to find out about the long-term plan, because right now, I have no clue what they are planning besides having me try pills.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 347, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Possible early achalasia based on manometry results, seeking input", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568916021, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/d61kpa/possible_early_achalasia_based_on_manometry/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "idontreallyknow5575", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3wb5d1rt", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568687080, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/d5aoo2/how_do_you_get_diagnosed_with_acalasia/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d5aoo2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/d5aoo2/how_do_you_get_diagnosed_with_acalasia/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568687083, "score": 1, "selftext": "what tests did any of you take? what did you do to get the diagnosis?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 346, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "how do you get diagnosed with acalasia?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568773468, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/d5aoo2/how_do_you_get_diagnosed_with_acalasia/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Amgar88", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_49drzb9h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568647467, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/d526i2/15_yo_son_to_have_poem_procedure_this_week_liquid/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d526i2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/d526i2/15_yo_son_to_have_poem_procedure_this_week_liquid/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568647468, "score": 1, "selftext": "My son is going to have a POEM procedure this week.

I am now 4 weeks post Heller Myotomy with wrap. Crazy that it's already been that long. I'm just going to provide a little summary of my experience to help anyone who is stressing about the surgery.\n\nI was so nervous going into surgery, but I resolved myself to shutting my mouth and being thankful for the anxiety meds they give you through the IV. I knew that I needed and wanted this operation. \n\nDuring surgery, I aspirated, which gave my surgery team a minor scare. Despite this, my surgeon reported the operation to be very successful. Because of the aspiration, I had a chest x-ray immediately after surgery and was put in the close observation ward for a night. They were very conscious and worried about my risk of developing pneumonia, so I was on breathing treatments every 6 hours and was only allowed 600ml of water for the whole day. To be completely honest, I didn't care about any of these measures. As in, I was unbothered and as comfortable as one can be when they're hooked up to three machines in the CO ward. I was just thankful to be out of surgery! The next day, I was moved to a regular recovery ward with a private room and went home after that night.\n\nI was myself very quickly after surgery. I remember the entire hospital stay and days following surgery. I was down to half doses of pain meds in three days and completely off in five. Of course, I am young and stubborn. I was sick of liquids very quickly but I am hear to tell you that the doctor does not put you on that diet as a joke. You CANNOT get out of your HM and expect to eat everything. It's hard! Because we're so tortured by this disease that we're hoping for immediate relief. But your esophagus and abdomen will be swollen for weeks, possibly months. This makes it easy for solid food to get stuck. My diet was 5 days of full liquids, 5 days of pureed food, 5 days soft food, then it was up to me and how I felt.\n\nOn Day 4 of soft food, I tried to eat teriyaki chicken and rice. Not soft. And NOT a good idea. I spent 30 minutes hovering over a sidewalk trashcan waiting to throw up the food that was stuck in my esophagus. It finally went down, but I learned my lesson. I went back to full liquids and some soft foods for 2 days. \n\nI had the most pain near my bottom left incision, which hurt like hell when I laughed, coughed, or sneezed. I was becoming concerned, but at about three and a half weeks, it faded. I am almost back to normal when it comes to physical  activity, just easily tired because I was on the couch for so long. \n\nBut the couch time lead to healing! I am at four weeks and I have eaten grilled chicken, salad, spaghetti, french fries, Goldfish, pizza, etc with little difficulty. But please, if you listen to nothing else I've said, go slowly and CHEW your food thoroughly. Set your fork down between bites. Go for a walk between bites, if you have to. Anything to keep from pressuring the surgery site. This is a reminder to myself as well, since now that I can eat most things I want to shovel them down my throat. \n\nThere are some foods I am avoiding just on intuition. Beef/hamburger, sandwiches, bagels, and apples all set off my spidey sense so I'm keeping them off the table for now. \n\nEveryone talks about their big relief moment when they get their first sip of water after surgery. I didn't think about much about food when I was in the hospital, since it was just water, Jell-O, and broth, and I was pumped with pain meds. But when I was eating little bites of rotisserie chicken at the dinner table with my family and I could feel it pass into my stomach as I talked to my dad, it really hit me that I might be OK. So far, it has only gotten easier. Granted, four weeks is no time at all, but I remain optimistic.\n\nGood luck &amp; don't hesitate to ask questions!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 330, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "4 Weeks Post HM Summary", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1565735633, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/cnyhdg/4_weeks_post_hm_summary/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sorryimizaak", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1630to", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564662306, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/cknp1i/does_anyone_know_what_event_triggered_their/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cknp1i", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/cknp1i/does_anyone_know_what_event_triggered_their/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564662308, "score": 3, "selftext": "I remember having a really bad bug which caused a lot of violent vomiting", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 324, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does anyone know what event triggered their Achalasia?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1564748695, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/cknp1i/does_anyone_know_what_event_triggered_their/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Archeelux", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_39pq0obs", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1564484214, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/cjq3rf/does_a_stretched_esophagus_cause_problems_for_hm/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cjq3rf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/cjq3rf/does_a_stretched_esophagus_cause_problems_for_hm/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1564484215, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI have been diagnosed in January of this year.

It\u2019s been huge comfort and help. I\u2019ve been lurking around this subreddit since my diagnosis (about 2 months ago), but finally found courage to post here myself. Here it goes: today is day 10 after surgery \u2013 Heller myotomy + Dor fundoplication. The procedure went smoothly, I was sent home the next day after the barium swallow test. The pain has subsided, and I feel almost fully recovered. Except for the eating part.\n\nI was on a liquid food diet for a week. They told me that after a week, I can start eating normally, but have to do so slowly and chew up everything thoroughly. That\u2019s the only way I was able to (sometimes) get anything down even before surgery, so no problem. I took it slowly and for the past 3 days I ate a diet of mostly liquids/soft foods, but I had at least some \u201cnormal\u201d and not-too-hard-to-swallow items, like scrambled eggs, pasta etc. Here\u2019s the problem - swallowing just doesn\u2019t feel that much different. I feel some difference with liquids, since I\u2019m able to do a couple of consecutive sips without liquid getting stuck. Still, I\u2019m being very careful even with liquids. But with solids, I still feel like I am struggling as hell. The swallowing does result in food eventually going down, but the discomfort and pressure I feel inside are still there and it still feels just the same as before the surgery. Yesterday I was craving potato chips and ended up regurgitating everything, just like before the surgery. I also still regularly have these powerful hick-ups when I eat. They feel sort of violent, but don\u2019t hurt and it feels like they originate from LES.\n\nI am feeling so frustrated and scared. I wanted to have that \u201ctears of joy\u201d feeling after you make the first swallow, but it just isn\u2019t there. I knew it was never going to be 100% okay after the surgery and I prepared myself for that, but I am really scared that the results are not what they are supposed to be, considering the results most of you guys are seeing soon after HM. Still, it\u2019s only been 10 days and I should probably give it some time and stay optimistic. I may be overreacting, since I know that the wounds need to heal and one can\u2019t be certain about the results before that.\n\nMy question to you guys is, has anyone else dealt with this? How long did you have to wait to see the results with normal, or even soft food?\n\nSome backstory: I noticed first symptoms (difficulty swallowing \u201cproblematic foods\u201d) 3 years ago, first sought help 2 years ago. Was misdiagnosed with GERB on my first endoscopy and prescribed PPIs which of course made no difference. 1,5 years ago the symptoms worsened significantly, to the point where not even liquids would go down. I was regurgitating 3-4 times per meal. Lost about 8 kilos, became anemic and dehydrated. I had a barium swallow that indicated severe lack of esophageal peristalsis (and apparently also GERB) but no typical signs of achalasia. After another endoscopy and manometry I was diagnosed about 2 months ago.

I found that many patients were particularly concerned about the exact causes of their cancer and wondered whether the same causes could provoke the development of another cancer or could provoke a similar cancer for the people around them. So I decided to create an app to adress those concerns!\n\nThe aim of the application I have developed is estimating the risk of cancer for any individual based on all the risk factors that can be found in the scientific literature. It includes 250 different risk factors and can calculate the risk for 26 different cancers. This includes achalasia. It also gives you a breakdown of each of those risks by showing you all the risk factors influencing it (both positive and negative) with detailed figures, possible lifestyle changes one could make and references. It is completely free and does not transmit any medical or personal information to us or any other party.\n\nTo be clear, the app is **strictly educational** and all information contained within **cannot and should not replace assessment by a physician**. It is aimed at the general public, to clarify exactly what causes cancer and give some idea which risk factors have a larger or smaller impact.\n\nThe app is called 'Cancer Risk Calculator' and is available for both Android and Apple devices. If any of you would like to see the effects of a condition on the risk of cancer or would like to calculate your own risks, please feel free to try it.\n\nAndroid: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.tdf\\_it.cancerrisk](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.tdf_it.cancerrisk)\n\nApple: [https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/cancer-risk-calculator/id1452067400?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/be/app/cancer-risk-calculator/id1452067400?mt=8)\n\n\\[Submitted to moderators before posting, no objections\\]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 320, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Educational: I'm an MD and I've developed a free mobile app, to allow my patients to calculate their personal risk of cancer, which includes the links between cancer and achalasia.

I wasn't properly diagnosed until about 13 years old.  HM at about 14 years old.\n\nI don't really remember how it started but I'm pretty sure it progressed quickly.  I described it as a \"stuck\" feeling.  My parents took me to the dr and I remember doing all these tests, first an x-ray and then and endoscopy.  I did several endoscopys and nothing ever came up...\n\nEventually my parents took me to see a psychiatrist.  Because of my young age, they thought I was anorexic and bulimic.  Puberty years are so hard, and I had to be sick through it.  It kept getting worst and worst.  Lots of tears shed over it.  It really messes with you to be told your crazy.  I'm sure my parents felt a lot of guilt after learning it was actually a physical ailment.  Lesson to parents.  If your child tells you their in pain, BELIEVE THEM.  \n\nI looked so sickly and terrible during that time.  I remember hating taking pictures and being afraid that people thought I was anorexic.  I was throwing up every meal and several times a meal.  It hurt so bad because I kept it secret from other people at school so when I had an esophageal spasm, would just hold it instead of throwing up.  It gave me anxiety to eat at restaurants, go to theme parks, be at friends houses.   It literally ruined my life during that time.\n\nOnce I was diagnosed, it didn't get better right away.  They did a dilation procedure.  It would work for a few weeks but always come back.  I must of had dilation at least 3-4 times.  In the end I needed a feeding tube inserted. I was so thin and weak, just basically waiting to die.  My face was gaunt and my arms like twigs.  I had lived with achalasia for so long now the spasms were constant.  I felt happy if I could get liquids down.  I hated eating in general.\n\nThe Heller Myotomy was a godsend.  It was a miracle.  I was fixed.  I could eat again. \n\nI don't get spasms that often now.  Maybe once a month or at most a handful in a month.  But I still hide it from everyone.

Says that although this is very rare, he has done the procedure a dozen times on infants with a good recovery rate.

Since you're here to find a quick tip how to overcome this, I'll give you my 5 cents on how to solve the unpleasant issues of food stuck in your throat/esophagus. \n\n1. Don't let it sit there. It's not going to get better. Either throw it up or drink a lot of water/hot water/soda/beer whatever works for you. \n2. If it's still stuck after 30min - 1h. Grab beer, soda (for me coke is the best option) and drink a bottle of it. Force it down, what ever you do, do not throw it up or spit it out! Just cram it all down there. The carbonated liquid is going to corrode the food and eventually make it easier to either throw up or pass through your lower esophagus muscle to your stomach. If you have issues swallowing the liquid, try this technique: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNDPbODWBwg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNDPbODWBwg), it actually works. Cred to: Tyler D. \n3. After you had a can/bottle of soda, wait a couple of minutes and eat a meal. Fatty and easily digested food, I just had lasagna at that did wonders. The fat will help lubricate your esophagus and make the food go up/down easier. The grease + gravitational force on a hefty piece of lasagna will hopefully help you out. \n4. Didn't work? Drink more soda! If you still can't get it out, seek medical assistance. Food stuck for long in your esophagus can easily damage otherwise sensitive tissue and cause more sever issues in the future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy story: I've had Achalasia for roughly 1 and a half year and was diagnosed 3 months ago. Going into surgery within the next 4 weeks. It's a shitty condition and especially when food gets stuck for a long time. It's mentally tough. \n\nThis time 24h, which means I couldn't drink/eat for one day and constantly throwing up everything I poured down my throat. I stuck my fingers down my throat to get it up, didn't help. Couldn't sleep due to suffocating on my own saliva + having the sensation of a golf ball being stuck in your throat the entire time. I had a time booked to the ER at 4pm, but managed to get it down at 3pm, exactly 24h after the incident. \n\nI searched frantically on the web to find tips how to cope with food that is stuck for a while when you're suffering from Achalasia, but couldn't really find proper guides/tips on it. Therefore, I hope these tips will come handy in your dire need of help. Hang in there buddy, it will get better!

I have been experiencing some scary symptoms for a few weeks now, went to visit my doctor and she believes I might have achalasia, and has referred me to an ENT, but since seeing her I have been madly googling (always a good idea right?) and I'm really unsure. What I'm experiencing doesn't sound anywhere near as bad as what some of you are experiencing, so I'm wondering, are there different degrees of achalasia? Does it get worse over time, or does it even come and go over time? What I've been experiencing over the past 3 weeks is:\n\n* Feeling like I've forgotten how to swallow. I'll be eating a piece of food, chew, chew, etc., I move it to the back of my throat ready to swallow then all of a sudden... nothing, it kind of sits there, then starts to slide down and the squeezy thing my throat is meant to do to push it down doesn't happen, and then I feel like I'm going to choke. I either concentrate really hard and make the swallow happen, use water to wash it down or manage to get it back to the front of my mouth so I can try again. I haven't completely gagged or choked yet.\n* Tight sensation in my throat most of the time, not necessarily linked to eating.\n\nThat is my only symptom! No spasms, no vomiting, no heartburn. Any other symptoms I'd say would be a result of not eating much at the moment, weight loss, dizziness, tiredness. \n\nThe weird thing is, this happened to me about 3 years ago, and lasted for a few weeks, then went away of it's own accord. Does achalasia come and go like that?\n\nI know what I'm going through is tiny compared to what some of you are, but I'm still getting pretty stressed out about it. I can't eat in public because I'm so scared that I'm going to choke or have to spit food out in front of people.

So much of the information on the web comes from clinicians who repeat relatively little information and instead focus on trying to categorize the symptoms and describe treatment options. But  I keep thinking there has got to be more than cutting muscles to allow a bigger passageway for food to travel into the stomach. Or use a balloon to stretch to LES. Or shoot it full of botox. Interestingly enough, a good source of information for me has been [youtube.com](https://youtube.com) videos from people who have Achalasia and have been nice enough to share their experience.\n\nAlmost 3 years ago symptoms began showing up. Why was I suddenly throwing up every night? It was weird because I physically felt fine. So began my journey, trying to uncovering the cause of my condition. When the first doctor told me it looked like I had Achalasia I was in complete denial, mostly because the treatment he suggested was surgery to cut the muscle that keeps the LES closed. Surgery seemed a little drastic given I felt fine. Was it perhaps Gerd or acid reflux or a hiatal hernia? There were many unknowns and I wasn't interested in finding out. Perhaps just ignoring it long enough would enable my body to just 'heal itself'?\n\nFast-forward to this year. Seems like things were getting better. I wasn't throwing up as much. I had developed a few 'eating strategies' which amounted to eating more earlier in the day, even skipping dinner. With our kids grown it was just my wife and I at home so having 2 separate main courses didn't cause a big disruption to meals. But I am tired of the blockage in my chest that I sometimes feel after eating and the trips to the bathroom to throw-up what just went down to stop the discomfort.\n\nSo I agreed to have a manometry exam, an Esophageal motility study, performed. The swallow test, as they called it, was very difficult to schedule. The entire process took 5 months between when I agreed to do it to when I got the results back, but eventually I was told by my doctor that the results indicated that food and liquid weren't being passed through the LES by muscle motion as they should. So they were remaining in my esophagus, which has become quite big.\n\nI would think that a combination of exercise and gravity would be sufficient for moving food into the stomach, but it no longer appears that the swallowing process is quite that simple. Drinking hot tea or just hot water helps me clear the esophagus. I just read about carbonated soda being another possible solution for the 'froth' that develops in my throat, so I went to the store and found that they are now selling 6-packs of cans that are half the size of regular cans. I'm going to test drinking one or more of them with some food the next time food gets stuck.\n\nI'm open to others tips and suggestions you may want to share with me.\n\nTony", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 235, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Trying to make sense of it all", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/a8n3yy/trying_to_make_sense_of_it_all/"}, {"author": "achalasiathrowaway", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2ttuhcj0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1545352969, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/a84lrr/advice_on_managing_spasms/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "a84lrr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/a84lrr/advice_on_managing_spasms/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1545352970, "score": 1, "selftext": "Using a throwaway here for privacy reasons.\n\nFirst time posting here, so here's my brief story:\n\nI have had achalasia since I was 7, and diagnosed when I was 12. I found a fantastic doctor, Dr. Samuel Nurko, at Boston Children's Hospital who I have been with since diagnosis. My achalasia is not as terrible as some of the other stories I have read on this sub, especially in terms of food getting stuck. After I was diagnosed, I was prescribed an antacid I take regularly, and have gotten dilation procedures every year or two since then. This has helped tremendously, and I rarely notice food getting stuck anymore. I still need to constantly drink with food. Only water helps. Sodas or juices actually create the stuck feeling as well. Acidic foods like fruits/berries are painful to eat, but not too bad. \n\nAlthough the food getting stuck does not give me much issue, spasms/reflux are a constant and horrible problem. The spasms cause the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, like having a really bad heart attack for hours. I believe reflux is the same, but I have a lot of trouble distinguishing between the two. It feels like one always accompanies the other, and that maybe reflux agitates the muscle and causes the spasm. \n\nDoes anyone else have an experience like this? Spasms and reflux are by far the worst part of my achalasia. When they occur, I take dicyclomine or hyoscyamine, however they don't seem to help too too much. Sometimes baking soda mixed with sugar in water can neutralize some of the acid. I was also reading here that warm water or milk helped someone with their spasms. Do any of you have any tips or methods you use to reduce the pain from the spasms or reflux?

I read the first article and started bawling. I AM NOT ALONE! I knew of course other people had this condition but to be able to read other peoples stories just like mine is insanely comforting. I am 24 now and was diagnosed at age 21. It took over a year to be diagnosed. Everyone thought I was pregnant and just having morning sickness because I was throwing up CONSTANTLY. I had to see MANY doctors to figure it out. I was down to 92 pounds before my first surgery. I was a miserable stick. My first surgery was a Heller myotomy with toupe fundiplication. That lasted for about two weeks and failed. I went back and ended up with the poem procedure. All is ok mostly. I still have esophageal spasms. For the most part drinking warm water or milk immediately stops them in their tracks but some times they are God awful. I also still have to drink a ton of water with meals as my esophagus isn't as open as it should be.\n\nOne thing I haven't seen anyone talk about is mucus. All the mucus that drains from my nose to the back of my throat sits at the top of my esophagus and doesn't drop into my stomach. Has anyone else experienced this?

It feels like someone is taking my oesophagus and squeezing and twisting it, and my whole chest gets tight. I always rush out of bed to get water to soothe it but lately it\u2019s been so bad that I get out of bed and feel so incredibly faint that I have to lie on the bathroom floor. I often find myself hyperventilating and it only really goes away after I drink a lot of water. It sometimes takes up to 30 minutes to soothe it. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this sensation? Do you have any idea what the cause could be? It\u2019s not heart burn because I\u2019m very familiar with that. Sometimes I\u2019m so confused by it I think I\u2019m having some sort of heat attack! It\u2019s truly awful.

After finding this study I believe Shingles (or possibly any number of the herpes virus family there are lots of different herpes viruses) could be the cause of most achalasia, maybe even 100% .\n\nIf a study like this were performed today the methods for testing and checking for the existence of certain viruses is far more accurate and we could see even more conclusive numbers.\n\nCurrently Doctors cite 3 etiological sources for achalasia:\n\n* Genetics\n* Auto Immune Disorders\n* Possible Viral Infections (specifically shingles)\n\nShingles is the progeny of Chicken Pox.  I have never met a person who did not have chicken pox at some point in their life.  This means that as the latent chicken pox virus becomes active again it could become dormant in the myenteric plexus causing achalasia.  Obviously the seriousness is quite apparent if I am correct.\n\nViral latency is a survival mechanism.  Once the immune system has targeted and started to attack a virus, the viruses will go dormant in the nerve ganlia.  This is especially the case with herpesviridae.  These viruses can lay dormant nearly anywhere in the body but if they land in the wrong spot (like the esophagus) they can be quite pathogenic.\n\n  \n**NOTE**:  Control Group had almost non-existent Herpesvirade\n\n* 1993 Study showing high levels of herpesviridae in achalasians esophagus compared to control\n   * [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1374131/pdf/gut00554-0027.pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1374131/pdf/gut00554-0027.pdf)\n\nPlease share your thoughts.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 206, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Herpesviridae: The cause of Achalasia?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/9u9nd4/herpesviridae_the_cause_of_achalasia/"}, {"author": "Faerla", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2jgvow38", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541377873, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/9u8sfl/does_this_sound_like_achalasia/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9u8sfl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/9u8sfl/does_this_sound_like_achalasia/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1541377874, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi all.

NOT DIET) have been shown to help* ***some*** *achalasians to move the food bolus past the LES and into the stomach.  I have personaly also used multiple types of Kombucha Tea with positive results as well.*\n\n**I** had some members ask me to post about using Coca-Cola to assist moving food boluses (large masticated/chewed food groups that accumulate in the esophagus during meals or eating) past the Lower Esophageal Sphincter muscle (LES).  I will give you my story and then references.  -- to see my full background please see my post [My Achalasia Story](https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/9mkax9/my_achalasia_story/)\n\nTo begin, I am Type II since about 2013.  I have never had a surgical remedy.  I use medications, diet and exercise (life style) to manage my achalasia.  Surgery may be in my future depending on the rate of degradation. \n\nIn my earliest days of achalasia I began wondering about different methods for assisting the food bolus past the LES.  Now fortunately [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://ClinicalTrials.gov) has a TON of human clinical trials (current and complete) that demonstrate multiple methods that have been tested... i.e. Hot Water, Dark Chocolate etc.\n\nI began wondering about the CO2 release from soda pop and if the release could occur in the esophagus. Essentially the same mechanism that causes persons to burp when consuming soda pop.  My thought was the release of CO2 could create additional esophageal pressure and push the food bolus past the LES.\n\nBut why use soda?  Why not just drink some water.  This is actually the case.  Most days I do really well with room temperature water and black tea.  But some days are tougher... usually following days of extreme high workload, stress  and **lack of sleep**.\n\nI began experimenting and right away saw GREAT results, but there was a problem.  I hate soda pop!!  don't like the taste and I don't want that garbage in my body!!!  Because of this I started experiment with many different carbonate drinks. e.g. LaCroix, Carbonate Teas, Diet Sodas, Orange Crush, Sprite, Root Beer.... I tried them ALL!!!\n\nAfter experimenting with many carbonated beverages I came to realize that Original Coca Cola and Original Pepsi in a plastic bottle (like a 1 litter) worked that absolute best.  Cans of soda worked, but it seems like the Coke or Pepsi in a plastic bottle had the most intense carbonation.\n\n**The typical process goes something like this** (this example will be breakfast that gets **stuck**):  I start with my cup of Coconut Milk Yogurt and about 2 cups of mixed berries. (blackberries, strawberries, blueberries).  Half way through the yogurt and berries I get to the point where my esophagus feels full.  There is a sensation of food being just passed my upper esophageal sphincter (UES) and I feel like if I push it further I might choke.  \n\nAt this point I go to my counter and take all of my morning pills and supplements and swallow them \"chasing them down\"  with a few gulps of water or tea (usually tea in the morning).  Sometimes as much as 16 ounces.  Now if the sensation doesn't go away I will crack open a fresh bottle of Pepsi and take about two big gulps and immediately swallow the gulps.  I don't want the Pepsi in my mouth for any length of time as the CO2 is coming out of solution rapidly at this point.\n\n***NOTE***: I rarely finish a 1 litter bottle of Pepsi.\n\nI can usually feel the food bolus move into my stomach and I feel like a new man.  The **stuck** feeling is gone.  The key though is moderation.  Eating smaller meals helps eliminate the instances of the **stuck** feeling.  I also practice a lot of intermittent fasting and usually try not to eat anything about 6 hours before bedtime.\n\nThe downside is on a bad day you can remain stuck and also you are usually left with some amount soda pop sitting in your esophagus.  This can generate a feeling like intense heartburn.  Antacids can fist this... I have also had luck with a little lemon water.\n\n***NOTE***: I have also been experimenting with Kombucha Teas as they are naturally carbonated.  They work wonderfully but you must be careful.  Aspirating Kombucha is far easier than Soda and far more dangerous.  I have aspirated carbonated beverages about 5 total times (in my early experimenting days).

I also have an excessive salivation, I constantly feel the need to spit out this thick, foamy and white saliva, especially while I'm talking. The sympthom that I can't wrap my head around though, and that is driving me absolutely insane, is this chronic, sharp pain in my throat. It's always there but it gets worse when I speak or even sometimes when I walk, get on a train or do any kind of phisical effort. I first attributed this to LPR, and I do suffer from acid reflux so it could be it, but it's so bad and it's making me miserable and I wonder if it's linked to achalasia in any way. Anyway, I'm currently on 80mg esomeprazole (maximum dose recommended) for the next 15 days, and if this doesn't work I'm gonna have to go for an esophageal manometry, which could confirm the suspect of achalasia or any other conditions.

So thank you all for sharing and making others feel even a little bit better about this garbage. \nI\u2019m Mike, in Alberta! I started having the usual problems in 2012-2013, diagnosed in 2016, HM surgery Feb 2017. Symptoms returned Jan 2018 ish, by April I was having issues daily again, by May liquids only and even then they don\u2019t always stay down...\nSo since then I\u2019ve had 2 rounds of Botox with absolutely no difference except it feels different to throw up, like I need more pressure from my stomach or something. Hard to explain. \nAnyways they said the balloon was next but not really an option, \u201cnot for my problems\u201d  (huh?) \nSo what\u2019s next? \nWell! Some more tests!! Yay! \nThis one is a nuclear imaging test? \nFancy dye in some scrambled eggs and watch me try to swallow it....fun! \n\nThe \u201cfunky\u201d symptoms currently? \n\nYup got all the good ones... the heartburn, popping ribs out from those wonderful porcelain convos, whole body hurts, mentally going nuts because I haven\u2019t kept food down in months and liquids are questionable on most days. \nBut the weird part...so they tell me is my Achalasia isn\u2019t consistent in where the problem is? (Dr words are hard to follow sometimes) But the weirdest symptom I\u2019ve had recently is I can have some mom made chicken noodle soup with everything as finely ground as possible to get some good stuff in me. It can go down okay, feels okay, normal acid throat feelings, and then 5-6hrs later it comes back! All of it! Not as soon as I put the spoon down like normal but hours and hours later...I thought food only spends an hour in the stomach, once it gets there....\nIt\u2019s not always like this, most of the time it\u2019s within 30 min or so.\n\nSo the specialists tell me that maybe the Achalasia is progressing to my stomach, stopping me from being able to digest properly....\nHas anyone had these problems and/or response from the dr\u2019s? \nThey didn\u2019t bother telling me what they do if that\u2019s the case just going for tests. Is that even a real thing? I thought Achalasia is only in the esophagus muscles affecting the sphincter? \nI\u2019m not a dr tho just (as I\u2019m sure a lot of us are)\nConfused and still waiting for answers...\n\nOh they want me to try the domperidone again...anyone have any luck with it? or even been told to try it? \nAlso saw the POEM surgery on here! That looks kinda neat and seems like a hit all areas at once thing. Going to ask the dr\u2019s about that cause this is the only place I\u2019ve heard of that so thank you for that knowledge! Closest surgeons seems to be in Ontario? \n\nAs we all hear from everyone who hears our stories, \nBest of luck to us all! \nSpeedy recovery to those going for surgery! Maybe as people who live with it we can figure out some answers! \nAt least it should\u2019t kill us? \nEven if you get \nreally really really really really \nsick of veggie juice... \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 174, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do our Dr\u2019s really know what they\u2019re talking about.... or are they just guessing?

Within the month I'm going for a surgery consultation and then POEM (if my insurance will cover it) or possibly a Heller's myotomy. Great to finally feel like I have a plan to start taking control of the situation. After a few years of it, I've learned to just ride out the painful spasms. Eating is still incredibly difficult, and it's awkward to be out with a group and constantly be keeping an eye on how full my water glass is, but again, I've learned to manage until I'm able to have the surgery performed.\n\nThe one that is truly crippling at the moment is the nighttime aspiration. Within minutes of falling asleep, I jerk myself awake again with violent (and worsening) coughs, and I honestly feel I haven't slept more than a full hour undisturbed in months. Once a week or so, I'll wake up feeling so wracked by coughing that I'm intensely sore and feel as though I've caught a cold, but it clears up by midday. My body seems to be overproducing mucus so much that it's no longer just a case of constant throat clearing. Now there are days where I'm so hoarse that it's difficult to make myself heard across a table or on the phone, which is affecting my work.\n\nI've been taking nightly omeprazole (left over from when I thought it was GERD) which I doubt is doing much, but probably not hurting either. Today, I'm going to try elevating the head of my bed 8-12\" to see if that helps. No pillow arrangement I've tried to date offered relief. Does anyone have recommendations of safe OTC medication I could try before bed, just to hold me over the next few weeks until surgery? I already avoid eating for a few hours in advance. As a final question, can anyone who's had Heller's or POEM weigh in on whether it stopped the aspiration?\n\nThanks, and glad to have found a community,\n\nIan", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 168, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to manage the aspiration?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/8zdo1v/how_to_manage_the_aspiration/"}, {"author": "gibberoni", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_id": "t2_17aip6", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1531416920, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/8ybvt9/time_for_poem/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8ybvt9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/8ybvt9/time_for_poem/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1531416922, "rte_mode": "richtext", "score": 6, "selftext": "Hi all, I started having achalaisa type symptoms almost 1 year ago today.

It was not until I had the manometry that it was confirmed that I had \"light\" achalasia. I use the word light, because my GI stated that my numbers were only slightly off of norm, but there was abnormalities. At that time, he did not suggest surgery, and had actually not even heard of the POEM yet.\n\nNow we are here, 6 months after that diagnosis and eating is hit and miss. Some days, like 2 days ago, I was able to eat pretty much like a normal person, albeit more slowly. Then I have days like today, where my co-worker went and got everyone lunch and I literally regurgitated it all back out. \n\nAnyways, my wife and I think its time to look into the POEM.

(Along with EoE) I have a hard time explaining my symptoms to people who have not experienced it so I'm hoping that if I outline the basic timeline here, people can give there insight as to if this is what they also experienced. \n\nBasically a few years ago I started noticing that bread and meat were getting harder to swallow and had the feeling of getting stuck in the back of my throat. It was infrequent enough that I didn't think too much of it and that I just ate too quickly, so I started taking smaller bites. One night I was out eating steak with a friend and that familiar feeling happened so I just tried to  breathe through it like I normally did and wait for it to go down but instead my mouth filled with saliva and I choked the piece of steak out. Super fun. Ever since then, this has consistently happened to me where I end up in the bathroom throwing up bits of food until I can swallow normally again. \n\nI ended up in the ER once because it got so bad I couldn't even keep saliva down, they gave me nitro glycerine to stop my esophagus from spasming. I've had a barium swallow test, and an endoscopy and my second one keeps getting rescheduled because of COVID. The barium swallow test confirmed that I have food debris stuck in my esophagus/stomach and the endoscopy results looked like they lined up with EoE but I've taken omprezal (sp) and that didn't seem to help. \n\nSorry for the novel! I appreciate this sub, even if it ends up not being my final diagnosis it is relieving to see others going to through the same sort of symptoms and being supportive. Anyfeedback is welcome.

I avoided the beef ones and stuck with the cream based hearty soups like loaded potato or chicken pot pie. I would also add some bone broth when blending them to make the consistency a little more liquid. Moving on to soft foods I am so excited to be having some tuna salad(no veggies) mashed potato, soft rice, all those wonderful things.\n\n**Recovery:**  \nIts hard to compare how each person measures pain but for me this procedure was up there. I was not really able to sleep the night of the procedure in the hospital, Every 2 hours I would wake up from the pain and have to call the nurse to give me another 2 hour supply. It took almost the entire next day for them to figure out what was an appropriate dosage of pain relief to send me home with as everything they tried was not working out.

Instead of the nausea coming from my stomach, it feels like it\u2019s in my throat or esophagus. There\u2019s no way the foods even hit my stomach. Is this possible? My trusty stomach nausea medicine is powerless to this. My doc said \u201cgastritis\u201d but it\u2019s been this way for a year......\n\nI used to be a steak and taco kinda guy a year ago. Everything I could get my hands on is food. About 3500-4000 calories a day, gym goer, active. \n\nI\u2019ve been depleted since covid in March, infection after infection. First I gained weight cus I stopped moving. Then losing weight , I\u2019m down to 180. I stopped tolerating more and more food. I\u2019d needed to rest after eating so I didn\u2019t vomit. When I did vomit, the  vomit was effortless and was basic (no acid). Didn\u2019t feel any spasm from my stomach and would come in spurts. Sometimes 15-30 minutes later and sometimes an hour+. After eliminating  and eliminating, I was down to plain potatoes for breakfast and kale shake for lunch (500 calories) about 2 months ago. Called my doc and told him, I don\u2019t think this is my (Almost but not quiet) gastroparesis he (almost) diagnosed me with 4 years ago.  I was tolerating liquids fine. I actually went through about a 12 pack of water a day. I could chug them laying down. \n\n6 weeks ago- So I\u2019ve already had a barium swallow. I have an abnormal swallow and I aspirate but they never mentioned this birds beak. Barium went down fine. At the time I was passing liquids fine. Doctor said we\u2019d do a swallow study with a speech pathologist next, I\u2019m waiting patiently  still..\n\n2 weeks ago, I stopped tolerating potatoes and smoothies. I started on about 10 crackers in the morning and 10 in. The evening. \n\n1 week ago- water won\u2019t go into my stomach, well, it does but if my esophagus fills up with water, it\u2019ll sit for about an hour. Gatorade takes a little longer- freaked and went to Er. They said my electrolytes were good and discharged me\n\n4 days ago- back to Er. Emergency Endo was clean-no obstruction- dr was pissed off he had to drive in the Texas snow storm to do it and he told me so. Everyone hated me after that... they literally called security as I was still under sedation and vomiting to help me leave. \n\n\nThis morning- Gatorade isn\u2019t going down- I woke up with about 6 oz on a empty stomach and 1 saltine cracker. It took 3 hours and 2 mini spit ups to pass. I have head pressure and twitching while this is passing. I\u2019m going nuts and feel so weak. \n\nRight now I\u2019m working on 6oz of water and it\u2019s been an hour and a half and I feel like I\u2019m almost there but I feel even more awful. \n\nI read through some of your stories and things don\u2019t seem so severe in some cases. Seems like most say to just eat little bites and drink a lot of water. Has anyone been this severe? Or must this be something else? \n\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out what constitutes as an emergency. I have immunodeficiency issues and lung issues. I\u2019d hate to show up at our recently thawed and likely packed Texas hospitals just to be dismissed during covid. When I was last discharged, my potassium was low, chloride was low and my blood sugar was 54. I\u2019m sure everything is so much worse. I feel very faint. \n\nDoes this sound like achalasia? If it were something else, I\u2019m sure the scope, barium swallow, chest ct I had (this was 2 months ago) would have picked it up? \n\nAny input or suggestions on anything is appreciated so much.

Man I was just going through this subreddit again and reading everyone\u2019s experiences and I love that I\u2019m not alone . \n\nI remember those spasms I used to get all the time , I remember after every meal I had to go outside and puke out whatever was stuck in my throat. I remember one time i was driving home from after work and I had to puke into a bag while making a sharp turn on the highway from acid and food stuck in my throat. Man I remember all those shitty times and thankfully I got the HM surgery and things are a lot better . \n\nThey aren\u2019t perfect tho. I still get spasms occasionally, maybe once every 2 weeks but still much better than before. I still drink a lot of water with my meals and I still burp after every bite unfortunately. I still have trouble eating bread, pizza, hard meat, and anything really rough. But I\u2019ve also gained over 20 lbs these past 6 months. I\u2019ve been a lot healthier. My skin is cleaner, and I actually feel full whenever I eat. Life is a lot better, and as much as I wish i was just fixed, this is still alright . It\u2019s nice to know you guys understand cause even my parents try to force me to eat everything , saying I\u2019m \u201chealed\u201d, but they don\u2019t know the struggle. I\u2019m grateful to have you guys, because especially days like this in quarantine , it\u2019s hard to believe there can ever be someone that understand what you\u2019re going through. \n\nBtw, anyone from toronto Canada please comment below!

Apologies for the long essay and any grammar errors.\n\nSo it start 2 to 3 years ago I kept getting thrush in my lower esophagus causing me to be very sick. It got treated and less than a year I started feeling nauseous and bloated when I woke up in the morning every day. I thought nothing of it until I started randomly vomiting after meals. Then after thinking maybe I ate something that disagreed with me and it didnt go away I tried changing diet stopping certain food groups even going gluten free for a while over sown of months. It got worse and my weight plummeted so I went to my gp and they said it was acid reflux gave me PPI medication it did nothing. So after it getting bad to the point I could hardly keep fluids down let alone food I went to AnE. The doctors there said it was reflux and to go back to my own doctor which was very very disheartening to me. After waiting weeks to go back to see my own doctor and I broke down and cried due to how upsetting this all way unable to keep most foods down they put me down for an urgent endoscopy. I got seen for the scope within 2 weeks they said internally everything looked normal but sent me for a swallow test. Within another 2 weeks I went for the swallow test under xray I did not know they shouldnt take over an hour but it took 45 mins for the liquid to enter my stomach!. This shocked me so then I got sent for the dreaded manometry worst thing ever so traumatic then after 3 weeks of waiting for the results achalasia was confirmed type 1 with no muscle contractions of esophagus and my lower sphincter was closed. Another 2 weeks and first treatment dilation of 30mm that have me 2 days of relief and I started vomiting again. I then got brought back a month later for my second which was 35mm my gastro dr said the times I got told it was reflux it was infact achalasia but as it's so rare not many doctors know of it. So fast forward to now 4 weeks after second dilation and vomited maybe 4 times I still get bloaty and food get stuck daily and I have to force it down. I had my follow up call and they want me to talk to the surgeons to see their opinion of i need surgery or not. This condition is awful evil and very very tiring I lost 4 stone in 4 months from it thankfully now I'm almost a stone heavier than before my treatment.

It happens at every mealtime, and for every type of food or beverage; I can't swallow pills or liquid medicine either because it worsens my condition. \n\nMultiple times, I've had emergencies that almost ended my life. I can't even sit down on a proper chair to enjoy my meals, because the food can't pass down unless I'm standing on my feet while I'm gulping down gallons of perfectly warm water, or I will have to throw everything back up. Therefore, I can really only eat when I am at home and when I feel safe enough to do so. \n\nI used to have extreme anxiety and belched on air a lot, because my nervousness was triggered by an origin of something unpleasant, like a snorting remark or innuendo from a popular classmate, or my heavy load of homework and time management obstacles: I used to live in the dormitories back when I was around 11 years old until 14-ish. \n\nIt made my life a living hell, mainly because the parents weren't around to witness the acts they paid for. I would never fit in, and I was called a 'Retard' behind my back; please excuse my vulgar language. All because I came from a different country and had a dissimilar background. \n\nBack to the story: After every swallow of whatever meal I was eating, I could feel the edibles slowly build up inside my lower esophageal sphincter. Eventually, when the food builds to a critical mass, it's heavy enough for gravity to pull down. A dull sting immediately arises and the pain only exacerbates from there until it is then relieved from a few gallons of lukewarm water, if I'm lucky. Other times, I am forced to regurgitate the food, and neither options are pain-free. Afterward, I get terrible migraines/ headaches and my nose starts running. I possibly lost a lot of weight from eating less over time. I enjoy appetizing foods, but I can't stand the pain. \n\nMy esophagus was much more sensitive to pain back then, but now that the nervous system has become jaded from each agonizing episode, I can't accurately feel the food go down unlike before. After I finished eating, I sometimes mistook my esophagus to be in a good condition when it was really the opposite, the esophageal wall would then bleed from expanding too far, and drastically worsens my swallowing for the duration of about a month, and I have to go to the ER to receive I.V. fluids. Due to this, I would also have a terrible time sleeping comfortably at night, as the remaining food edibles would come back up through both my nostrils and mouth. \n\nI really don't know what to do, living feels like a nightmare right now.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 648, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My insurance still haven't went through and my esophagus is progressively dying.

But now it's a really slow process to eat or drink anything. The other day I timed how long it took for me to start chewing a quarter inch square of a shortbread cookie, ending when I felt it move out of my esophagus into my stomach. It took 45 seconds to eat that miniscule bit of cookie.\n\nAs others have said, I have to chew everything into puree and swallow just a little at a time. It takes so long to get through a meal that I find I'm eating less because I'm tired from the chewing.\n\nLiquid wasn't a problem until a month ago. Now I drink a sip, hold it in my mouth, tuck in my chin and then finally swallow. Those are the directions from the speech therapist. No straws because it propels the liquid to the back of the mouth too quickly. No carbonated drinks. I do drink a glass of pop when I'm in a restaurant.\n\nLately I've been sensing a feeling of fullness, not in my stomach but higher up, after eating only a small amount of food. I'm not sure what that is. I've had two swallowing tests, but it was more than a year ago.

So, I tend to take things like this seriously because of how hard it was to watch her waste away. I admit to being a bit paranoid and OCD.\n\nBefore the swallowing problem started, I had been in therapy for several years for depression, anxiety, PTSD and suicidal ideation and attempts.

The only way to get any relief is to throw up the completely undigested food I just ate, that feels like it was sitting right under my tongue the entire time, never seeming like it made any sort of trip through my GI tract. I do have GERD, and the PPIs allow me to throw it up, as before that I would never throw it up because of the intense burning that would come with it.

I am desperate for answers and it seems like I cannot find them anywhere. So here it goes. \n\nI am a 26 turning 27 in 3 weeks, female. I have allergy induced asthma and pretty severe seasonal allergies (break out in hives when the season change). My allergies also used to cause severe tonsillitis and i had my tonsils removed at 23. (This is just a little context). \n\nThis year around April/may, i noticed a difficulty swallowing pills with plastic coding. It would feel stuck and then like 10 mins later i would regurgitate them. I didn\u2019t think much of it and just opened the capsules and mixed them in with juice. \n\nFast forward to about June/July, i noticed recurring episodes of acid reflux. Like 4/5 a month. Again, i didn\u2019t think much of it since pharmacy anti acids and tums helped. \n\nNow it\u2019s august and about three weeks ago i started regurgitating undigested food. It would feel like food was \u201cstuck\u201d and then 20 mins later it would come back up. Not much stomach acid like reflux though. Mostly food and saliva. There was certain things that were difficult to eat because i knew they would come back up. It got to the point where i was only eating soft foods and in small quantities because i didn\u2019t want to regurgitate. In this month i have lost a total of 15lbs. Now, i am overweight, so the weight loss isn\u2019t extreme however it is rapid. \n\nI finally went to urgent care and they suspected i had a hiatal hernia. I later followed up with my pcp and she did not think i had a hernia, but a stricture she ordered an endoscopy and a CT of my neck. I met with the gastroenterologist and they agreed that i could possibly have a stricture or eosinophilic esophagitis because of my history with allergies. \n\nThe endoscopy also looked normal. The doctor said he did not see a stricture or narrowing. He took a biopsy of my stomach and esophagus to test for eosinophilic esophagitis. Results come back next week. However, he said if the biopsy is clear then he wants to schedule a manometry because I\u2019m losing weight quickly. \n\nAny thoughts? I\u2019m a hypochondriac so my mind is going to the absolute worst.

Last year I got a celiac diagnosis and prior to that had major issues swallowing. Everything was painful and caused my stomach to feel way way full. I was on a liquid diet and more or less stopped eating. Since then my symptoms have improved but not entirely and seem to just be staying stagnant despite being gf. \n\nBasically I have trouble swallowing, when I swallow the muscles just feel weak and uncoordinated and weird and I often notice myself accidentally swallowing a lot of air. Every time I eat the food has trouble getting down, drinking water helps, but then the food just comes right back up into my throat and it feels like I just have to keep reswallowing it over and over for a few hours. I usually get a constant dull ache in my throat (kind of similar to the feeling like you\u2019re about to cry) and sometimes a dull ache behind my sternum. I also feel incredibly full after eating really normal/small meals and burp really loudly and uncontrollably and sometimes the burps sound weird and high pitched like they\u2019re struggling to get out. I feel like food takes a long time to digest since I\u2019ll stay really full from a small meal for 3-4 hours but then become intensely hungry. I also burp up food a bit but I never vomit (although after eating if I bend over I do have to swallow to avoid this) or have severe chest pain or anything like that and I can still eat, it\u2019s just a struggle. \n\nI just went to a GI and he didn\u2019t mention achalasia but now reading about it I wonder if it\u2019s what I have. It also seems consistent as autoimmune diseases go together and celiac has been known to cause nerve damage in the GI tract.

Sorry the post is going to be so long. \n\nStarting with the update: I got the HM done on Monday and was released on Wednesday, and have been recovering at home. Honestly, the worst parts were the catheter (a solid 11 out of 10 in terms of pain, from my experience) and the back and shoulder pain from being stuck in one place. I was surprised how little the incisions have bothered me thus far, with the only time it's hurt beyond a 2 or 2.5 out of 10 being when I'm being helped up. I didn't realize how much achalasia had prevented me from getting water into my system until I felt like I had to use the restroom every couple hours since the surgery, though I guess that would explain the kidney stones.\n\nBeing on full liquids is definitely better than clear liquids, but I'm still feeling so hungry and can't wait to get soft food in starting Sunday (and other foods hopefully in September). It's going to kind of suck being stuck not being able to have bread or spicy food on my birthday, but hopefully that won't be a problem for long.\n\nWhich leads to my questions:\n\n- What are some good soft foods for easing back into food? I'm feeling pretty good, but I know that I'm impatient, so I don't want to rush and cause myself more suffering. \n\n- What are some ways to incorporate more acidic foods into my diet again?

It got worse and I tried taking an antacid, but ended up trying to puke (which I can't, due to the surgery, so I just strain and break blood vessels in my face).\n\nAfter 5 hours of that with non-stop nausea and quite a bit of pain in my chest, I decided I should go get help and drove myself to the ER, for fear that if this kept up I'd damage either my face and eyes or my esophagus.\n\nAt the ER, they ran an EKG for my heart, and an abdominal MRI. The results of the MRI showed a possible rupture of the esophagus or ulcer or diverticulum (like a bubble that develops with excess pressure). Fearing a rupture, and with the on-call gastroenterologist declining to make a definitive decision due to not being an expert in this area, they were discussing transferring me to Stanford medical for a consultation and possible emergency surgery.\n\nLater on, they conducted an esophagogram and concluded that no rupture had occurred. Just in seeing my esophagogram, I could see that distinct pinch where the LES is, along with a massively dilated esophagus. It's now on me to follow up at Stanford for an eventual surgery.\n\nLesson to learn here: don't keep ignoring the condition and follow up with your doctors!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 866, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Last Sunday in the ER...", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/p7ph76/last_sunday_in_the_er/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "larrym614", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_a620e", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1629402153, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/p7m1yo/well_after_everything_went_to_hell_finally_got_a/", "gildings": {}, "id": "p7m1yo", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/p7m1yo/well_after_everything_went_to_hell_finally_got_a/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1629402164, "score": 1, "selftext": "TLDR; Been messed up for years Docs attributed issues to other things.

It was a fun 11 days with a NG tube (*pulling it apart makes really neat noises and ticks people off; great way to smile when you feel like crap).\n\nThat was all 2 years ago.

Things got to the point I started eating 1 meal a day. That meal took me an hour or more to eat.\n\nAfter awhile I couldn't eat some foods like bread without feeling like it was stuck in my chest. Then I couldn't drink anything carbonated due to extreme pressure and pain.\n\nA VA specialist thought I had this abnormal disorder right from the beginning. He was right. Then damn COVID hit.

My spouse and I have just recently been informed of this disease and we strongly feel that this is what I have but all tests I've done (x-rays, ultra-sound, endoscopy, barium swallow, and manometry) have come back showing nothing's wrong. I've been experiencing symptoms for nearly 2 years now. Started in June of 2019 with excessive burping and chest pains. After having an x-ray and an ultra-sound done, the doctor I was going to at that time determined it was gallstones so I had my gallbladder removed that following November. This worsened things tremendously. Then another doctor did the endoscopy ruling out acid reflux and GERD, but couldn't find anything abnormal except for slight inflammation in my stomach which they said is common. Then Covid happened adding to the delay in a diagnosis. Finally had the barium swallow and manometry tests done only to be disappointed and further frustrated. Fast forward to this month, I've finally found a PCP who listens to me (and hasn't treated me like a hypochondriac). They've recommended me to a gastro that is going to perform a capsule endoscopy which my spouse and I haven't heard of before surprisingly after all the research we've done and doctors I've seen. I can't seem to find this test mentioned by anyone on here yet either. I also can't find anyone having trouble getting diagnosed even after having a manometry test done. So I'm just wondering if anyone who has taken this capsule test and/or has gone through a similar ordeal getting diagnosed wouldn't mind sharing their experience and/or any advice they have? I've listed my symptoms and lifestyle changes below...\n\nAs I'm eating, it feels like food piling up and drinking water as I eat helps. I don't know what I'd do without marijuana. Helps with the pain and loss of appetite. I've lost a lot of weight. Doesn't ultimately matter what I eat although some foods/beverages are worse than others. Definitely can't eat spicy foods and drink alcohol. I tend to stick to having mostly smoothies, soups, salads, and anything alike. I excessively burp nonetheless just not as bad with these foods. I have to eat at least a good 3 hours prior to going to bed. Along with having peppermint tea. This combined with marijuana helps my chest feel like it's deflating/relaxing helping me get much better sleep. Yoga helps too (after waking up and before going to bed). Fortunately I don't vomit too often but when I do it's sometimes food and sometimes yellow bile, and it typically occurs around 2 or 3 in the morning. I'm still waking up some mornings around 2 or 3 just to burp excessively. This maybe happens a couple times, give or take, throughout the week. Additionally, I sporadically experience a spasm-like sensation in my esophagus along with back pain even if I haven't recently eaten. This happened seldom in the last 2 years but has started to happen more within the last 3 months or so. \n\nThank you for taking time to read this and for any help you're able to provide!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 868, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can anyone share if they've experienced difficulty getting diagnosed for Achalasia?

This was way back in 95 so it's been a good long time I've been coping with this.  \n\n\nSo- sometimes when I eat the food sticks, it's like my esophagus is closed and the food sticks somewhere between my throat and sternum and I can't swallow, not even a liquid, but I can breathe but not talk. I start foaming at the mouth and I have to run to the washroom and spit the food up and sometimes I have to slam my back on the wall really hard or I'll choke.   \n\n\nIt makes eating at restaurants really iffy and once it was the kind of place with a single person bathroom and both were busy so I had to run outside and do the thing and it was so humiliating and I had to try and wipe my mouth with my hand and then wipe the slimy foam/spit/mucus grossness on the foliage.  \n\n\nI've had two barium swallows but they weren't able to initiate it and a really cool animated x-ray of me chewing ans swallowing where they said I chew about 30% more than other people and just to \"chew your food more, I guess\".  \n\n\nI also have an hiatus hernia that i got from my main pain condition where I was trowing up so hard from pain I get the hernia so that's fun.

I was 15 at the time and I don't remember much nor did my symptoms bother me too much. \n\nNow that I'm 25 years old, I've been experiencing a lot more difficulty swallowing than before. It's been almost 2 years since my swallowing got worse. I need to chew triple the amount of times and/or have a sip of water to liquefy the food inside my mouth before I feel comfortable swallowing it. This results in me needing 40 min to an hour to finish a meal. \n\nI don't have this problem as much when it comes to hot/warm oatmeal, and most fruits. I get a tight/choking sensation in the back of my throat which makes me feel like I can't swallow solids for whatever reason. I don't even bother trying to swallow solids when this happens. And if I do swallow something that wasn't chewed well enough by my standards, it feels like it goes down very slowly. With certain foods, I get a full feeling at the bottom of my esophagus until the food makes its way down properly. This doesn't happen with all food, just with things like sweet potato and avocado. \n\nAnyway, I've had no evidence of Eosinophilic Esophagitis during my most recent endoscopy. I've also had two balloon dilations done to increase the size of my esophagus since the mid to lower portion of my esophagus was half the size of a normal esophagus originally. Now that I've recovered from the dilations, I still can't swallow normally. \n\nIs there a chance this could be achalasia?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 842, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does this sound like achalasia?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/onnx0t/does_this_sound_like_achalasia/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mmmalloryknox", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_bwk2zhz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626726091, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/onmcvx/almost_six_weeks_post_op_from_hm/", "gildings": {}, "id": "onmcvx", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/onmcvx/almost_six_weeks_post_op_from_hm/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1626726102, "score": 1, "selftext": "My incisions are still sore but I am better every day, eating more and more foods, inevitably gaining back all that I lost sadly, but I digress. \n\nI am a lover of good beer, and have had a few in the past week or two, mostly because they were given to me by work after a long shift.

I turned 26 this years, and it's mind-boggling to see some of you share that you've been living with achalasia since your teens. Thank you for sharing your stories. \n\nIn May 2021, I went in to see a gastroenterologist after symptoms like acid reflux and regurgitation/choking at meal times became a daily struggle rather than an occasional occurrence. I'd been experiencing symptoms for a year or two, but chalked them up to eating too quickly or too much in one go. I finally stopped ignoring things, and I had an upper endoscopy performed in June. The scope confirmed the acid reflux as well as what appeared to be slowed esophageal muscle activity. It ruled out cancer, Crohn's, and Celiac's, which to me was a relief based on family history. Later in June, a gastric emptying study also confirmed that I was not experiencing gastroparesis. \n\nTomorrow, July 15, I am going in for an esophageal motility study to gauge my esophagus muscle functioning. I'm so relieved to get this last leg (hopefully) of diagnostics done. The past couple months have been marked by very little sleep, very little socializing and lots of frustration finding foods I can  safely eat. I'm ready to get back to living my life, but I know that it could still be a while before I find my new \"normal.\" I'm also ready to finally have a diagnosis, or to rule out more things this thing I'm experiencing is not. That way, at least when I explain what's happening with me I have more info to tell people that eating slower, taking smaller bites and drinking water alone aren't going to cut it for me. \n\nWhat advice do you have for someone going through this arduous process?

It has all started 4 years ago with a mild regurgitation when i was out with my friends having lunch at a restaurant and i had to quickly rush to the restroom to vomit all the food from my esophagus because i had been completely shocked by the pressure and the feeling of stuck food in my food pipe. I thought it was normal and my mom said that i should drink a lot of liquid with each every bite to swallow the food all the way down. At that time it was still manageable and i kept living my regular life. Slowly but surely the symptoms have gone worse and worse. \n\nOne night before i went to bed i had had a severe spasm in my chest and my upper back, i was really scared and i thought it was some muscle cramps from physical activity. I tried everything to make the pain go away and after some time i noticed that when i drink water and lay down on my back the symptoms disappear, although it was slow, it was still very effective. When i was sleeping i started to choke on water that had been stuck the whole evening because of water that i had been drinking to ease the pain with, it was really shocking and my dad came to check me if i was okay and i said that i was just choking on my spit. I still have ignored all of the symptoms and eventually it became worse in which my swallowing has come to the point where i had to drink a huge amount of water to make the food go down. And yet my dumb self of me has still ignored the symptoms and continued like this for another 3 years. I've managed to control this inconvenience, though it was at some times difficult and annoying, i have still lived my life with this on a daily basis. I could write down all of the difficulties i've experienced but that would be a long ass story. Ultimately i consoled myself that this was probably normal and that i'm dealing with heartburn. (LMAO)\n\nLong story short, in April 2021, i visited my pediatrician as told her that i've been dealing with swallowing difficulties and with food coming back up etc. and she said that i might have an acid reflux so she prescripted me Pantoprazole if it cures me. And it didn't obviously. \n\nConsequently she recommended me to make an appointment to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopic checkup. The doctor said that my esophagus was full of water and saliva and that the esophagus in the distal area is widened and the lower sphincter was tightened thats why i struggle with the food going down, eventually she sent me for an X-ray barium swallow test where i had to drink a contrastive white liquid that when i swallowed it showed them how my swallowing act works. And it confirmed their suspicion, in June 2021, i was diagnosed with Achalasia. The doctor said that this disease is incurable and i have to undergo a symptomatic treatment which were Heller myotomy - the classic surgery or a rookie type of surgery, that is less invasive, POEM. I chose the less invasive one and before i had to be hospitalized for the treatment i needed to undergo a manometry. While consulting with an endoscopist, he told me that the POEM, doesn't do a fundoplication, which prevents the acid reflux so he offered me a esophageal rehabilitation and physiotherapy after the surgery that may cure the acid reflux, which is really interesting and in which i may participate in. \n\nI'm getting the surgery next Monday and i'm very hoping that it'll turn out well, been kinda stressed and scared throughout this journey but with the support of my family i've been getting is astounding, which i'm very thankful for and i believe i'll be fine. I had doubts that it won't work and that it won't be effective but i trust the professionals \ud83d\ude4f \n\nIf you read this till this end, thank you and i'm definitely gonna update you guys!

My husband (30) I believe has achalasia. He has dealt with it the past 15 years. The first several years he was in college and didnt realize it was a real issue. He would shove his food down constantly, despite the pain. Until he finally tore a hole in his esophagus. He was life flighted, almost died, had an emergency $100,00 surgery (after insurance). For the past 10 years since then he's been managing it by not forcing food down and constantly regurgitating it back up. He takes an antacid daily but it doesn't seem to help in any way.\nMy husband is convinced that seeing a Dr. Is pointless. He says he doesn't want surgery and frankly doesnt want to hear my input. I understand how frustrating it is for him to deal with a rare disorder, and have this terrible issue to battle everyday. Times when something is stuck very low and painfully he will punch his chest as hard as he can again and again, and I can't help but yell for him to stop, and lately it just makes me burst into tears. I support him best I can, but I'm so worried he's going to tare another hole and die. I just delivered our first baby 10 days ago and I cant imagine our life without him. What can I say to persuade him to see a professional? What can he do here at home other than a daily antacid? How can I be supportive during one of his spasms?

I had a HM with a fundoplication and a pyloroplasty for the gastroparesis. The surgeries went well, I had no issues with swallowing, and besides maybe one or two minor spasms each month I was able to live normally up until the past few years.\n\nGradually my spasms have become more severe, often, and lengthy then ever before. I went to see a gastroenterologist at Vanderbilt this past spring and had a barium swallow and an endoscopy. Both tests determined that it was time for me to have a repeat HM as well as to have the fundoplication taken down (yay being able to vomit again!). The hope was that the surgery would also lessen the spasms. I had a successful surgery a month ago - my swallowing has never been better, even after the first HM, but unfortunately the spasms have persisted and are just as painful as before.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m averaging 2-3 bouts of spasms a day. They last 2 hours at their shortest and up to 16 hours once they really get going. At their worst, the pain causes me to have nausea, hyperventilate, and have my chest and extremities go numb. No amount of pain killers, PPIs, antacids, Levsin, weed, or eating/drinking can touch the pain once the spasms really take off. I swear it feels like Thanos is trying to crush my esophagus with the infinity gauntlet.\n\nI\u2019m also unsure as to what is the cause of them. The endoscopy showed that my pyloroplasty is still working well, ruling out gastroparesis as the culprit. The endoscopy also showed extremely little scar tissue in my esophagus, meaning that my acid reflux has been under control and is an unlikely cause. If you\u2019ve got any ideas, please feel free to couch diagnose.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s lived with achalasia for 16 years, spasms these intense and often are fairly new to me. Does anyone have similar experiences and tips for combatting the pain?\n\nI\u2019m tired, sore, and would love to get a good night\u2019s sleep in. Thankfully I\u2019ve got an appointment to see my surgeon to discuss options on Thursday. \n\nI appreciate any insight you fellow Achalasians are willing to share!\n\n\nTLDR: Had achalasia for 16 years, spasms have become out of control recently, can you relate?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 834, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How painful and often are your spasms?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/of38j2/how_painful_and_often_are_your_spasms/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Jubbity", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_l4lqf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1625436708, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/odu7xp/recent_success_eating_out/", "gildings": {}, "id": "odu7xp", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/odu7xp/recent_success_eating_out/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1625436719, "score": 1, "selftext": "Just wanted to share this small success, as I'm sure plenty of you do, I hate eating out, I hate being constantly worried about throwing up and about grossing people out with the noises I make.

Spent the morning of my surgery in urgent care making sure I didn\u2019t seriously injure my eye and having it numbed because it hurt so badly ANYWAY surgery went great. I had a considerable amount of pain afterward for the first ~24 hours but the pain medication I was given (morphine) helped dull it. Didn\u2019t get my post-surgery x-ray until late afternoon the next day, and didn\u2019t start on any clear liquids until about 8pm the day after surgery. As a precaution they kept me in the hospital an additional night to ensure I tolerated things well and because my potassium was low. Next morning I got a potassium drip and was discharged by afternoon and at that point in time I was in no pain though my chest still felt uncomfortable depending on how I was positioned or moving. \nClear liquid diet was fine but I didn\u2019t have much appetite at all. Not sure if it was being on liquids or the antibiotics but my stomach was seriously messed up until I started on soft foods 4 days after surgery. \nI started soft foods Monday and it feels amazing to be eating again! I will say that it doesn\u2019t feel how I expected it to feel. I\u2019m not quite sure how to describe it other than food just feels odd going down. It\u2019s such a weird sensation to not be regurgitating everything I eat or drink. While I\u2019m not in pain, I can definitely feel like I\u2019m still healing. My doctor said I could start working into normal foods tomorrow but I\u2019ll likely just continue taking it very slow.

Basically, has anyone has bad experiences with either? I've heard some people needing a second POEM, and it being fairly new doesn't help my trepidation.\n\nSecond, and this is the dumber question- any recommendations for wedge pillows? I have no clue what to look for, and since it's Prime Day, it's probably the best time to buy it.\n\nAlso, what foods tend to work best? I've been trying to eat, but it keeps coming back up, and I've lost probably 65 ish pounds since this started, and have been to the ER for dehydration and kidney stones from dehydration several times.

The hour or so before was putting on a hospital gown, putting in an IV, and getting a pregnancy test. I met two gastroenterologists before my surgery. One wanted to do a study on me and I signed a consent. Then I was wheeled into the operating room where I was put to sleep. I woke up in the recovery room with a bunch of other people recovering from their surgeries. I had a little bit of pain, like heartburn, and I requested some pain medicine. They gave me some Dilaudid. I napped a little and was wheeled to my room. The first day I was NPO which means nothing by mouth. The nurses gave me little ice chips to chew on. I slept a little but was up walking around with my IV and drip bag the same day. That night I felt a little achy and my room was cold so I asked if I could shower. The nurses had to disconnect and wrap up my IV so I wouldn't get bacteria in it. The shower felt really good. I took my medicine and went to sleep. I was woken up in the middle of the night for a blood draw. The following morning was very non eventful. I kept wondering when I would be discharged. I didn't see the doctor until about 3 PM. He gave me some juice and changed me from NPO to clear liquids. I drank all the juice but did end up regurgitating some of it as well as a plastic thing that I am not sure how it got in my esophagus. He finally discharged me at 6 pm. A nurse walked me downstairs and I was picked up by my boyfriend. Since then, everything has been pretty normal except being on clear liquids. It's looking promising. I wasn't able to tolerate Gatorade before, and now I don't seem to have a problem with it. I'm excited to move onto non clear liquids.

My doctor hasn\u2019t mentioned anything about surgery although it sounds like this would be a viable option to decrease the likelihood of issues down the road?

I\u2019ve been given nitrogen pills before for spasms, but I still come right back for the Benadryl. Actually, they gave it to me intravenously in the hospital once when I was having spasms, and it worked IMMEDIATELY. It was amazing. Usually I have to wait 20-30 mins for it to kick in. Makes me want to have an intravenous option at home. Anyway, just wanted to share that Benadryl works for me. I don\u2019t see people talk about it a lot, but it\u2019s been part of my life for so long now, I should really buy stock or something.

I\u2019ve never heard of that before until he preliminarily diagnosed me after the barium. What am I to expect? Why in the f*ck did this happen to me, and how the f*ck is it not directly correlated to acid reflux?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 798, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just diagnosed", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/nh6f7y/just_diagnosed/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "healthmma", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_t98tj2n", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621492997, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/ngt0zg/home_posthm/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ngt0zg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/ngt0zg/home_posthm/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1621493011, "score": 1, "selftext": "Had HM with wrap 2 days ago.

I will explain all the details in my post, but you might want to get comfortable, because this might end up being a lengthy post. The following message is a plead for help that I am broadcasting across the Internet with the hope that, eventually, a qualified doctor will see my post and reach out to me.\n\nFor several years prior to this incident, I had a nasty cough that I just could not get rid of. The cough did not really bother me, so I largely just ignored it hoping it would go away. Well, the cough persisted for a year or two and it showed no signs of going away. At around the same time I noticed I would choke on certain types of food occasionally. I honestly did not think much of this, because the food would pass within a few hours, so I just tried to be more careful and take smaller bites. As time progressed, I seemed to choke more frequently and easier on many different types of food and the choking sensation would last longer and longer. However, the choking was still a rare enough occurrence that I did not think it was a serious issue and I largely ignored the problem. Do you see a trend here? Before all of this happened, I largely ignored medical problems because I hated seeing a doctor. This was very dumb and irresponsible of me, but eventually problems would seem to sort themselves out and I did not see the point in wasting time or money. \n\nFast forward to the night of February 8th, 2021 and I am standing in the kitchen having a sandwich and some chips for a late dinner. While I am eating, I start feeling that choking sensation after eating a few bites, but I get my next bite down and everything seemed to pass. So, thinking everything is okay, I take another bite, but I end up spitting the food out because the choking sensation came back much stronger than usual. I did everything I could to simply calm myself down and get the food to pass, but none of my usual tricks were working. Sipping on water, putting my hands above my head, walking around outside to get fresh air, nothing worked. Thinking this was just another episode, I eventually calm down and get through the rest of the night until I fall asleep. Usually when I would wake up the next day, the choking feeling would completely subside. However, this time, I still felt like I was choking. Except now it felt more like a ball of mucus was stuck in my throat, so I tried taking allergy medication and cough suppressant that also dealt with mucus. None of that worked, so I was legitimately worried that I was choking on food from the night before and went to the emergency room. \n\nMy first emergency room visit was a total cluster. The doctor felt my throat and told me he did not think I was choking on anything since I was able to sip water sometimes and it would go down. He asked me to drink this mixture that contained lidocaine to numb my throat to see if the feeling went away. Once my throat was completely numb, the feeling that there was a ball of mucus stuck in my throat became much more pronounced and worse. It was like the numbness erased all the \u201cnoise\u201d and now that choking sensation was all that was left. The doctor never came back to check on me after this, so I was never able to tell him about this, but the male nurse came back and listened as I explained that it made the problem worse. The male nurse tested me for strep throat, but my gag reflex is so sensitive that I would almost vomit every single time he put the tongue depressant in my mouth. After many failed attempts he eventually got a swab from the back of my throat and the test came back negative. After all of this they sent me home and told me it was probably just reflux. So, I went home and did my best to go to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling a little better, but as the day progressed that choking sensation came back with a vengeance, so I went right back to the emergency room.\n\nThe second emergency room visit was a little better than the first. This time they performed a barium swallow test but told me everything looked normal. I complained that while the liquid I swallowed during the test felt like it went down fine, I was having trouble even sipping on my water because it felt like of jagged and like it was not going down cleanly. This doctor was honest and just told me there was nothing he could do. He said it was probably reflux and prescribed me a PPI and told me to check up with my primary doctor.\n\nA week has gone by and I am still feeling this choking sensation. I see my primary doctor to discuss the problem and she changed up the PPI I was taking and told me to continue taking it and see how things progressed. After taking the new PPI for a while, my symptoms went away, and I felt a lot better. However, I was still unable to eat much, and drinking was also difficult because it felt like stuff was getting stuck in the back of my throat. I made another appointment with my primary doctor and she referred me to a G.I. so I could get an endoscopy. \n\nThe G.I. scheduled my endoscopy and cut a small piece of my stomach to send to the lab for testing. The results came back normal, and he said everything looked good other than some slight irritation of my stomach lining. So, I go home, and I try to force food down, since he said there is no reason why I should not be able to eat, but things were still \u201cgetting suck\u201d in my chest and the back of my throat. I made another appointment where I told his assistant who is a practitioner about the persistent issues with eating and she told me to take some over the counter Pepcid before bed at night and scheduled me to get a manometry. \n\nAfter adding the Pepcid to my list of medications, I start to generally feel better. I can consistently drink two nutritional drinks each day and even eat some Ritz crackers if I chewed them up into a liquid consistency, but it was better than nothing! I eventually get in and have a manometry performed and they called me back a week later saying it showed signs of \u201cEsophageal Dysmotility\u201d. The lady on the phone said they usually refer people to the Mayo Clinic for this type of issue, but my insurance refused to cover it, so they sent me to someone in my state located in Little Rock as UAMS. I begin to get excited and see light at the end of the tunnel, because I finally felt like we were getting closer to figuring this issue out. However, this could not be further from the truth.\n\nAt this point I am still able to mostly drink a few nutritional drinks each day and eat some crackers. After two months of struggling, I was at least able to consume about 550 \u2013 600 calories every day. While this is not great, it was at least sustaining me for the most part. Keep this in mind as the story progresses, because from here on out, you will see this progress take a nosedive.\n\nOkay, so UAMS calls me the next day and schedules an appointment for the very next business day. So, I call my sister and ask her to drive me 4 hours for the visit. I told them I was 4 hours away and this would be a difficult trip, but they told me to come on in, so I naturally thought they were going to hospitalize me and get to the bottom of the problem. Well, I get there, and the doctor is an hour late to the appointment, which is not a big deal, but an important part of the story since they did not even have enough time to answer my questions or address my concerns before kicking me out of the office. When the doctor arrives, she seems like she is in a hurry to leave, but she sits down and asks me to explain everything that has been going on. I told her everything that I told the readers of this post, and she tells me she needs to go get her supervisor for help. Her supervisor comes in and tells me we will need to redo all my previous tests because they must be performed by qualified technicians. I ask him to at least look at the test results because the manometry was so difficult on me physically and mentally due to my extremely sensitive gag reflex. I tried to tell him that I was dry heaving the entire time the test was performed, so if he could just look at the results and he cuts me off. After he cuts me off, he says: \u201cWell, we can just stop everything right now and you will probably never get any type of surgery because no surgeon will touch you without these tests\u201d. So, I submit to him and tell him that I am more than willing to do the test again, but I just wanted him to look at the results from the other doctor without dismissing them entirely. He tells me to go in the lobby and wait. The first doctor came out about sixty seconds later and simply said \u201cthe test results don\u2019t make any sense.\u201d. She then tells me to go home and wait until someone calls me to schedule both tests.\n\nSo, on the same day I arrive in Little Rock to see my doctor, I am turning around and going home with nothing to show for it. I go home and notice that I am starting to eat less than before, but I am still mostly eating decent enough. A week later UAMS calls me to schedule an endoscopy for July 1st, 2021. I then get an email telling me that they have scheduled a follow up appointment for mid-August of this year to discuss those results. No one ever called me to schedule a manometry, and to this day I still do not have an appointment to have one done, which he said was the most important test to have done because it could confirm if I have something called Achalasia or not.\n\nI am now at home waiting for July 1st to roll around so I can drive another 4 hours and have a second endoscopy done. Who knows how long I must wait for the manometry I am thinking it will be sometime next year before I can even begin to address the problem? Meanwhile, over the last two weeks, I have been unable to consistently get down even one nutritional drink a day. I am no longer eating any crackers, and even that one nutritional drink is a real struggle to get down. On my best days I get 240 calories for the whole day, but for the last week I have been getting 100 calories or less per day.\n\nWorried about the damage this is doing to my body, I contact my doctor through the UAMS portal not once, but twice, just for her to completely ignore me. Below are screenshots of both messages I have sent to her. I know she has read both messages, because when I first sent them a little piece of text would show up saying \u201cthe medical staff has not yet read this message\u201d and that text is now gone from both messages. Please take a moment to read each message and you will see that I am basically pleading for help and she just ignores me.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[First message](https://preview.redd.it/fj8f5dv5gex61.png?width=1138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f9e417e52ecc000fc4ddea6fcfee147b0adbe4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Second message](https://preview.redd.it/cy31f607gex61.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a0c887ecb40aba5e8f2215a4494336b7beaa8da)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My inbox as of today](https://preview.redd.it/zxamst1fgex61.png?width=1145&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9df96b78125ac767ca683eb7fd458f6f409fe1d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen this all started on January 8th of 2021, I was morbidly obese weighing in at 263lbs at 5ft 8inches. Today I am down to 185lbs because I cannot eat. I am also extremely dehydrated because I can barely drink water. My weight is sinking like a rock even further because my eating is getting progressively worse. It is at the point where (as you can read in one of the messages) I ask about having a long-term feeding tube put in because of how malnourished and weak I am. However, since my doctor only ignores me, I have no idea what my options are.\n\nMy name is Michael, and I am living in the United States of America in the year 2021, but I am literally sitting at home and slowly starving to death because none of the doctors I have access to really have any idea what is going on with me. I believe the only reason why the new doctor is having the same exact tests done is because they honestly do not know what is wrong with me and they are just trying to start from scratch, assuming that my original GI and hospital were not competent enough to perform these tests. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I FULLY understand the need to redo the manometry, especially since I had such a hard time with the first one, but I don\u2019t understand why they are making me wait months for a endoscopy just to turn around and make me wait months for the manometry after that. \n\nIf you manage to read all of this, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Now, here is the reason I am sharing this with you: I am trying to get a qualified doctor to see this message and hopefully reach out to me. I know there are doctors out here who can deal with this type of problem. I just don\u2019t have access to them. I am begging you, please share this post with anyone you feel comfortable sharing it with, because if I can get my story to circulate around the Internet, I feel like there is a real chance that a qualified doctor will read it and reach out to me to help!\n\nAt this point I am terrified that I am going to die from starvation in my own home due to my inability to eat and the fact that my doctor ignores me when I ask for help. I will never ask anyone for money or anything like that. This is not a scam. I am just desperately trying to find a doctor who is capable and willing to help me so I can go back to having a normal life again. I am truly a victim of our \u201cadvanced\u201d and \u201cmodern\u201d healthcare system. Because my insurance is not the best, I am slipping through the cracks, and told to sit at home and waste away while I get the bare minimum care they are required to legally put forth.\n\nIf you decide not to share this post with anyone, I fully understand and hold no ill-will toward you. I am at least happy you read my post and another soul in the world knows my story. At least this way if I end up dying from malnutrition, there will be people in the world who knew my story.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 780, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/k-N0vPxEYa9nJi-YtbcCvXEHA8X7h9a-WnbDPm6MCtA.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 101, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "I am starving to death at home in 2021", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/n5vl2m/i_am_starving_to_death_at_home_in_2021/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "winchester6365", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9mo4iue6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1620239067, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/n5mtvq/share_some_good_stories_related_to_this_awful/", "gildings": {}, "id": "n5mtvq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/n5mtvq/share_some_good_stories_related_to_this_awful/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1620239078, "score": 1, "selftext": "After the last 4 nights of regurgitation, choking, and minimal sleep, I need to hear some good.\n\n*I am NOT trying to get anyone to say Achalasia is good/a blessing/whatever other extreme!

Since then, I've had two balloon dilations done with no result and just had another manometry done last week.

The lower sphincter area, which is what I was really interested in, has a pretty low pressure, which is what we want, but you still are not moving things through despite this low pressure (ie, it takes 2 swallows to get things down). \n\n We have a couple of options at this point - we can do a POEM, with the hope of getting the pressures even lower at the lower sphincter, or we could do another, bigger, balloon dilation.  I think that maybe the POEM has a better chance of success, since we have used a pretty big balloon on you (30 mm) without much improvement.\"\n\nMy question is, what have people's experiences been having had a POEM done after HM? For those who have had both, do you see big improvements?

I had the HM surgery with a partial wrap of my stomach and was put on a PPI ever since having the surgery. The surgery went great for me and I never had any issues for the first 8 years after the surgery besides the occasional heartburn (once every 2 months). As of the last couple years I have had a lot more issues with heartburn as well as developed asthma which seems to trigger after eating or after bouts of heartburn. \n\nI know overtime the surgery might not hold perfectly and especially for me, my body was still very much growing at the time of my surgery.

I was also curious if anyone else has suffered shortness of breath/asthma since the surgery and had anything that helped you regain more of a normal lifestyle. \n\nUp until the last couple years I had absolutely no problems and lived that sort of less healthy college lifestyle.

Going through my first year in college constantly vomiting in dining halls was absolutely traumatic, and i definitely developed some food anxiety and a terrible relationship with eating. However I still can not eat without immediately losing my appetite, having trouble breathing while i am eating, and feeling a general sense of dread when i need to eat. I hate food, it no longer brings me any joy (i often say i wish i could photosynthesize LOL).

Was diagnosed with Achalasia just this past March. BUT THAT WAS SURELY NOT THE BEGINING OF MY ACHALASIA JOURNEY!\n\nIt all started about 2 years ago. I got my first episode of heartburn while sitting in class. I thought I waz dying since I had no.idea what heart burn felt like. I went to.the nurses office clutching my chest and she just sent me home. I went to the doctor immedietly and theh just told me it was acid reflux. I just went with that.\n\nAbout 3 months later I.had a spasm. I had no.idea what spasms were other than that fact that it felt like.someone.was taking a knife and stabbing me in my heart. IT WAS TOO PAINFUL. Again I went to the emergency room and they could.find nothing wrong with me. At this point I knew something was wrong. I was getting spasms so much that ut just wasnt normal. \n\nI started having trouble swallowing and id tell people about it. People would tell me it was probably caused by stress and that It was ALL IN MY HEAD. I started to.believe it could be all in my head. But as time.went by I just could.not.take it.anymore. Doctor after.doctor would diagnose me with things I KNEW I DID NOT.HAVE!!! Doctors would ask if im.purposely mot eating or if im throwing it.all.up.because I want to. \n\nMentally I was exhausted from having to explain myself each time when my food would be thrown up because I couldnt keep.it down and it was SO SO PAINFUL TO.EAT!!! I hated eating infront of people. I had panic attacks each time. I would throw up almost every time I went out with my friends, sometimes directly on their food. I FELT HUMILIATED BY SOMETHING I COULD NOT CONTROL. Sometimes I could tell.they would.move their plates away from me.slightly. That would hurt a lot. \n\nAFTER 2 years of suffering I was referred to a professional.who knew what Achalasia was. When I first heard about Acahalsia I thought \"PLEASE LET ME.HAVE ANYTHING BUT THAT.... PLEASE LET IT BE JUST CAUSED BY STRESS... I DONT WANT A LIFELONG ILLNESS\" \n\nFast forward 4 months later and 5 PAINFUL DREADFUL MANOMOTRY TEST LATER..... I was diagnosed with Achalasia. It was a lot.to take.in. but I got through it panic attack after panic attack. LOL\n\nGot my surgery in July and I feel.okay now I guess. Barely have spasms and heartburn but things are.still hard sometimes. \n\nI hope my story helps someone out there.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 611, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Achalasia Story", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/k1bxch/my_achalasia_story/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SadHenLem", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_er3kk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606329871, "domain": "self.achalasia", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/k0y2ge/covid_and_achalasia/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k0y2ge", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/achalasia/comments/k0y2ge/covid_and_achalasia/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1606329881, "score": 1, "selftext": "Curious how people who have achalasia are feeling about covid.

I am going in next month for another botox/dilation and I keep telling the Dr it doesn't really help that much. He said I am not a candidate for surgery. I do not know if I am explaining my symptoms correctly or not. My 2 year old son can swallow larger pieces of food than me and faster.

To sum it up, don't go to a boarding school when you're 11 years old.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, I was lucky enough to be remove from one hell of a playground, and moved 550km away, where I attend my first high-school, the home environment (not the school, and never the school) assisted me to emotionally relieve myself, but in turn it spiked up my swallowing problems, which was already there to hug me unconditionally.\n\nwOndEr hOw it WenT? On a beautiful sunny day of the October in 2019, exactly half a year after I left that damn school, I regurgitated my food during a tasty cereal breakfast on a freshly fixed lawn; the milk temperature wasn't how my stomach wanted.\n\nUnfortunate events began crumbling after, a month later, I couldn't swallow as properly (not saying that swallowing didn't hurt a year ago) and every bite was like a trip to the ER after breaking your legs from the third floor, nothing helped nor relieved my pain: Medicine (it made the situation worse because of the hard tablets), therapy, special \"fluid\" diets, etc, nope. It gradually went from eating a proper thanksgiving meal with a die-hearted chicken broth in the heaven of 2015, to something that had to be carefully prepared and scheduled or I will die on a hospital bed, nevertheless, those options never benefited me in any way.\n\nI've had a GI done while I was back in China, but they couldn't find anything and weren't convinced that I needed to get a Barium Swallow done. I had \"mysterious\" stomach aches whenever the food lingered in-between my esophagus, and more often than not I would find myself waking up in the middle of the night having to blow my nose with mucus full of what I had ate for dinner. Sometimes I couldn't breathe whenever I had food stuck, and etc, etc. The list goes on for so long I don't even recollect most of them.\n\nFor months, we visited doctors, and somehow none of them recognized that I had Dysphagia. Eventually, we found one, because the symptoms were becoming prominent, and so my father applied the treatment from the Medi-Cal insurance, and we waited. Fast forward to 2020, a year after, the insurance was still pending, as if praying that I would eventually forget about this and leave it alone. Spoilers, we didn't. We called them, and they told us to wait, but we already did. We still haven't found the resolution and I've visited the ER a couple times already.\n\nThere isn't anything special about this essay that I'm doing, I'm writing this because I'm desperate, I really want a solution, I feel suicidal sometimes because of this. The pain is unbearable; a needle poke felt like a gentle pat on head compared to my swallowing issues.

alchalasia type 2 this week.\n\nBefore my official diagnosis noone believed the amount of pain I was in while eating. Gastroscopy showed minor hiatal hernia, and my doctor focused only on that. She said I can fix everything with better posture and that if I decide for surgery I'll get huge scar across my body. I got perscription for pantoprasole.\n\nI started regurgirating.. but as a 19 yo female with a fear of getting that scar I didn't go back to my doctor for two months. My condition became unbearable I couldn't eat, I could feel that something is stuck in my throat and I couldn't sleep anymore... I told her what I'm going through, she checked my blood and said that she sees no infections and that maybe it's just from stress. She reffered me to a psychiatrist and sent me home. \n\nI returned a week later, after I didn't sleep for three days straight. I had full on panic attack in front of her. And again... she said It's really just stress and perscribed me with 0.25 xanax which didn't even help me with sleep.\n\nI described my eating problems to psychiatrist and explained that I'm sad since I'm losing connections with acquaintances/school mates because I really don't want to eat in public. He said, citing: ''what you're describing is sadly not possible\" WTF. He gave me mirtazepine for sleep, but it increasses appetite so it seemed like a bad joke and I was never diagnosed with depression so I really really didn't want to use it.\n\nPeople just didn't get it. \nDad said that he sometimes have problems with acid too.... \nI lost it. \n\nI seriously considered suicide.. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat and it seemed like I'll stay like this forever. And noone was taking me seriously.\n\nI tried one last time to see my doctor and told her that I want to see gastroenterologist again. She said \"no.\" (It's a law in our country that if doctors send their patients to a specialist when there's no need too they're financially responsible). I called my dad crying on the phone. He sat into a car and drove 1,5h to my doctor. Somehow he convinced her.\n\nWell, Gastroenterologist in contrast was a really great doctor and said that he seriously thinks I have achalasia. 2 weeks later and I've done manometry to confirm it. Since the very first swallow it was very apperent that I indeed have this illness.\nI'm beyond relieved that I finaly got my diagnosis. \n\nI felt like I complained too much - in retrospect it seems like I haven't complained enough.\n\nSorry for the long rant it was a very rough year. \nI'm getting balloon dilatation in two weeks :)\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "achalasia", "subreddit_id": "t5_2unsf", "subreddit_subscribers": 158, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "To the suffering undiagnosed, I know you aren't crazy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/achalasia/comments/8swc7b/to_the_suffering_undiagnosed_i_know_you_arent/"}]
