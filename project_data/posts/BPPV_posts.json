First post!\n\nI'll try to keep this brief.  I work in law enforcement and about 6 years ago I took a really hard hit to my head at work.  Didn't lose consciousness, but I ended up with BPPV.  Thing is, I didn't know what BPPV was at the time.  All I knew was that I would wake up at night falling out of the bed, room spinning, panicking, not knowing what was going on.\n\nEventually my wife convinced me to go to the hospital.  Cue a littany of tests by doctors who weren't sure what was going on but wanted to protect themselves from liability in case it was neurological.  CT scan, transfer to a bigger hospital, MRI, visit by a bunch of neurologists and specialists who seemed to just want to put their name on the bill.  Finally they discharged me and just told me to see my primary care physician.  Luckily, he had had BPPV before, performed the Epley maneuver and I haven't had an episode since.\n\nProblem is...now I can't sleep.  I have panic attacks trying to go to sleep without the assistance of a Zzquil and bourbon cocktail.  It's as though the BPPV has made me afraid of going to sleep.  Anyone else had this issue?  Did anything like therapy or counseling help?\n\n**TLDR:  Had BPPV.  Epley maneuver fixed it.

I'll spare you of the bad stories I've had with ENTs for years trying to diagnose what I have and not being able to run any test at all because of said vertigo.\n\nAnyway, the other day I went to the doctor and this time he suggested me to do the Brandt-Daroff exercises as they're running out of things to try with me. Now, I really want to do something about this, but just the thought of triggering my vertigo, having to stay in positions that trigger it for a few minutes, thrice a day for a few days makes my eyes teary. Even writing this is painful to me. Back when I didn't know how it was triggered and rolled in bed, I'd have attacks that would leave me extremely nauseous for about 24-30 hours. Just existing was agonising, and I couldn't entertain myself with anything. Watching TV, reading, listening to music, standing, being in bed, practically everything made my nausea worse. All I could do was sit and daydream my day away. A couple of times I didn't have the luxury to do that and had to attend class/exams, and they're some of the worst experiences I've ever had.\n\nSo, with those kinds of memories in mind, just thinking of constantly triggering it for days in a row makes me extremely nervous. I'm not sure what my goal is with this post. Perhaps I'd like to listen to people with similar stories who decided to go with it, or get some insight on whether I should try at all, because this particular ENT doesn't really pay attention to what I say, and has made mistakes in the past, such as saying that I could get a head scan at the hospital without lying on my back (nope), so I'm not fully convinced by his words.\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading this wall of text.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 79, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Scared of trying Brandt-Daroff", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/8fbb2d/scared_of_trying_brandtdaroff/"}, {"author": "snatch_138", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1523916354, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/8crhb1/2nd_time_aroundlong_recovery/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8crhb1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/8crhb1/2nd_time_aroundlong_recovery/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1523918939, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "TL;DR- Diagnosed with BPPV, 3 months later...still have some \"symptoms\".

So, I thought I would lay it all out here: how I got it, how I dealt with it, and what I do today to avoid it. Feel free to just ignore it, but it was really hard for me to find information at first and I felt hopeless; I would like some of you to potentially avoid that feeling and maybe draw some insight from my experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Beginning**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn August 2017, I had to move to a new apartment because my previous one had sustained water damage from a leaking roof. \nI moved into a new school-provided apartment (I was living in South Korea) which ended up being in a building full of university students. Over the course of maybe 2 or so weeks, I began to realize that I couldn't fall asleep until about 1 or 2am due to loud neighbors and paper-thin walls. And I had to wake up for work at 6am every day, thus making me severely fatigued. I wasn't able to get any cooperation from my neighbors no matter whom I talked to, but that is another story for another time. *Basically, I was fatigued and sleep deprived which set the stage for my stress.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**More Stress**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAmidst my sleep deprivation, I was also forced to work about double my normal teaching hours due to a colleague being out of work. This lasted from September to November, and this is where my stress got extremely severe. I essentially experienced burnout as a result of lack of sleep and overworking. One night, I went to sleep with earplugs in and slept on my left side. When I awoke, I felt extremely dizzy and had a ringing in my ears. Luckily, the extreme dizziness went away in a matter of hours, but I felt constantly lightheaded for weeks to come. (edit: The ringing in my ears lasted about a month.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Diagnosis**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBecause I remained lightheaded all the time, which got worse when I stood up to teach, I decided to go to a doctor. I went to the ENT and explained that I had a constant ringing in my ears and dizziness. He told me he believed it was BPPV but we would have a test to determine it. I took a hearing test, which turned out to be fine. I then took the [Dix-Hallpike test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dix%E2%80%93Hallpike_test). I was given some goggles (similar to the oculus rift) that have cameras in them and told to put them on while I sat on an operating table in the dark. The doctor came in and moved me all around in different positions. Afterwards, we watched the footage on a monitor. The cameras filmed the movement of my eyes as I was moved in different directions. Because my eyes darted to my left when I was moved into different positions ([nystagmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus)), the doctor said that this indicated I had BPPV in my left ear. He then performed the [Epley Maneuver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epley_maneuver) but it didn't have an effect on me. He tried it a second time but I still couldn't feel a difference. Eventually, he gave me a prescription for diazepam which helps with dizziness. However, he said that using that prevents BPPV from healing in the long term, so to only use it in emergencies (such as at work).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Improvement**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI avoided taking the diazepam when I could, as I was hoping my BPPV would simply be healed away. However, I still felt dizzy when I moved my head quickly or stood up from a chair. I watched some videos on YouTube and tried to perform some maneuvers to dislodge the crystals in my ear, but nothing worked; in fact, it made it worse. So I gave up on the maneuvers.\nAs for my living situation, I moved in with a friend and was finally able to get a proper night's sleep. *I cannot express how much this helped me feel better in general.* As for my work situation, I finally stopped having to work overtime as we hired a replacement for my colleague who left. This also helped me de-stress A LOT. I was now able to get proper rest and work normal hours. By trial-and-error, I realized that sleeping on my right side, and never sleeping on my left side, allowed me to not feel lightheaded or dizzy. To this day, I think I have felt dizzy maybe twice since November and it was due to laying on my left side for a period of time.\nAs for the ringing in my ears, it might have been caused by my earplugs being too deep in my ears. **I do not think that the earplugs contributed to my BPPV because I still sleep with them in.** I have read that the main contributing factor for BPPV in people under 50 is head trauma. I suppose it is possible that I hit my head against my wall in my sleep, but I don't remember it at all; **therefore I cannot say with certainty what brought on my BPPV besides stress and sleep deprivation.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I did not get enough sleep\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I had burnout from overworking\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* This gave me a lot of stress\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I went to the doctor and found little reprieve other than diazepam\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I made big life changes\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I only sleep on my right side\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSorry for the long post but I literally do not know anyone who has experienced this, and you guys are the only people who can relate to my suffering. I just hope this somehow helps you guys out.

I haven't had any vertigo since I've done this. I know this is a very simple solution but it is the only way I could find relief. I hope that this will help someone who has it in only one ear.

So, I got pushed to the ground a few days ago and hit my head really hard on the ground. I got very dizzy immediately after and felt sort of like my ears had popped. My jaw was very sore for a day. Anyway, the people at the hospital ruled out a concussion and sent me on my way, but I've had the worst vertigo of my life ever since.\n\nI'm pretty sure I have BPPV because the vertigo comes on when I move my head fast or lie back in bed, and it is especially bad on the left side. I'm waiting for a GP appointment, but I feel so frustrated that I have done some reading on my own (damn you, Google), and learned about the different kinds of BPPV and all the repositioning techniques. I was desperate enough to try out the Epley maneuver at home yesterday. Not sure if I did it wrong or what, but not only was it the worst experience of my life, I felt absolutely drained afterwards -- it didn't fix anything. To make matters worse, now I am absolutely terrified of going to the doctor and having them trigger the vertigo.\n\nIs this normal? I read that if you have horizontal BPPV the Epley maneuver might make things worse, but is there another way to know what kind of BPPV you have other than the way your eyes twitch?

Two doctors said i might have BPPV and the last one said it might be Meinier or because of my spine. I had an eye doctor that said it might even be migraine vertigo.\n\nIt all started 2 years ago when i had a very very bad vertigo. I was just coming from two 2 days in a raw dental work (3h in the chair each day) when i was just sitting on the couch with my gf and watching a movie. I felt like a head ache so i went to take a pill. When i got back to the couch the whole world started to spin counterclockwise. I was so dizzy that i was throwing up continuously and i had to call the ambulance (i fel very scared as well). The whole thing passed in around 2-4 hours. I don't remember. After that i started a treatment for two months with Betaserc and some other supplements. After that episode i had a few vertigo attacks (first of them where a bit longer 2-5 min, now i only get brief vertigos for about 15-20 sec) but all of them once a few months and they keep coming in rows. My last vertigo was 5 monts ago, and now i started having another episode. I mean i usually get 1 vertigo per day out of nowhere and for something like 3-4 days in a raw and then it stops. \n\nWhy i don't think is BPPV. I did some tests myself ... after having my vertigo started doing movements ... first slow then almost like jumping being at a rock concert :) nothing happened. Usually it start when i stay motionless with my head extended and i do a slight movement. Oh and the reposition maneuvers don't really do anything. \nWhy i don't think is Menier. Since this one usually triggers long episodes not just 10-20 secs ones. Though i might be wrong. Maybe is just an easy form.\nSpine and migraine vertigo seems more plausible from my side.\n\nBut i usually have the common symptoms: lightheaded, when i have the vertigo it feels like i get a bat in the head (with no pain though, just a strange feeling) and some light sensitivity (difficulty reading far away text - when i take serc it evens get worse this one). I think that for one year or a bit more than 1, i was really terrified and had even small panic attacks and feeling very down. Slowly i manage to get over this, but i still remain a bit hypochondriac .\n\nWhat other medical conditions i have:\n\n1) I am half deaf - not hearing with my left ear possibly since i was born. That's why is hard to tell if it's Menier or not.\n\n2) Ringing in my ear - i start having this one after i spend some time in the hospital doing a treatment for vertigo ... yay.\n\n3) Vitamin D deficient - big deficiency \n\n4) Poping/ cracking sound in my neck when i swallow - i don't know if it's related but it started appearing in the same period.\n\n5) Tachycardia (usually my heart beat rate is over 100) but my blood pressure is between 12 and 14 \n\n\n\nI did head and neck MRI, multiple dizziness/positioning test (they said i have a Nistagmus in my left eye), blood tests ... \nI am not sure if i should just leave it like this and try to live with it or i should continue doing other appointments.

I played racketball through the last few bad bouts, which has been tough because sometimes I fall and sometimes I see the ball go through my racket.\n\nThese last few weeks, my vertigo has been getting bad again. I chalked it up to stress and mayber allergies. I have sleep apnea, and had my septum fixed 3 years ago. Most of the time, vertigo doesn't feel like vertigo anymore. I get dizzy, but more often I find it hard to look directly at certain things, kinda like it's hard to look at the sun. Also, dealing with a low-grade migraine (hurting, nausea, can still function).

I've been told my entire family on my dad's side has symptoms.  Father, uncle, grandma and great grandma.  \n\nI had an occurrence a two years ago that lasted a  week and went away.  Now I'm back in the same boat and its been about ten days.  I work with heavy machinery so I cannot be at work unless I'm sure I'm free of symptoms.  \n\nThe way I experience symptoms is constant mild dizzyness with periods of more intense off balance feeling.  Sudden head position changes seem to make it slightly worse but bending down and standing back up make it much worse.  \n\nI guess the reason for my post is that I'm not sure what's happening to me and what to do about it.  I feel like a moron sitting at home for days at a time because \"I'm kinda dizzy\" I'm not positive my symptoms match bppv and sometimes I'm not certain there's anything wrong with me at all until I get a \"break\" where the dizzyness goes away from a moment.  \n\nI do smoke pot and that does seem to help if only for the fact that the nasea is less prominent and pot kinda rules.  The Betahistine dihydrochloride or \"serc\" they put me on doesn't help. I've tried about every epley manouver to zero effect.  \n\nI guess maybe just getting my thoughts down somewhere has made me feel better but if anybody can relate feel free to comment or pm me.  \n\nSorry for the great Wall of text.  \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "25 year old possible bppv.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/6igg8h/25_year_old_possible_bppv/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "sdchironeuro", "author_created_utc": 1492242020, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_173c0s", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1497387060, "domain": "youtube.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/6h2rsg/vertigo_relief_san_diego/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6h2rsg", "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "San Diego Chiropractic Neurology", "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWW3URPFa3EKvXRBOgKr3lg", "description": "Vertigo Relief San Diego - http://sdchironeuro.com John's story of how SDCN helped him get his life on track.

I've never had this thing called \"BPPV\". So anyway, I wake up on Saturday morning. It was a different feelings, for some reason I woke up 5 times, each filling super dizzy like the world was spinning. I immediately sat up and it was fine. Like I said, I did this about 4-5 times and the last time I did it the world world flipped. And I struggled to the reach the door, calling for my brother to help me. I thought I had a stroke, I had no idea what happened.\n\nI finally laid on my back and it settled a bit, but I could not look any direction or the vertigo came back. I had to call the ambulance and have them take me to the ER. The anxiety left me numb and tingling, and over stressed. I spent a while in the ER while they did some tests, Dix Hallpike, MRI, etc.\n\nI was released that day still not being able to stand, and had to be carried/wheel chaired out. I had an appointment on Tuesday, which was three days later, for my physical therapist. I went to my physical therapist appointment and they did their black goggles/ eye nystagmus test. I ended up having an anterior canal problem in my left ear, and a posterior canal problem in the right ear. Anterior canal only has approx. 1% incident rate. While 90-95% people get the posterior canal. We ended up fixing my anterior side, but It made my posterior right canal a lot worse.\n\nSkip to Saturday, I'm still feeling almost no relief. Constantly dizzy, sick to my stomach, and bed ridden. I ate maybe a piece of toast, or banana a day. My back constantly hurt from laying in bed all day. I attempted the epley maneuver that following Saturday, and completely botched it but somehow fixed it. I felt relief! It was amazing. I was obviously still really sick, but it didn't feel quite as bad. I had my second appointment that following Monday and we confirmed I fixed my vertigo.\n\nAll in all, worst week of my entire life.

Immediately it felt like the room was spinning and I fell back onto the bed rather forcefully, almost like I was shoved. I took a moment to gather myself and very slowly sat up, and then carefully stood up. After cautiously walking for a few minutes, I felt nearly back to normal. I was fine the rest of the day and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nThat night I woke up at 1am when I heard my son on the baby monitor. The room was spinning and I felt nauseated. Luckily he was still asleep, and I made my way to the toilet by supporting myself on the wall. I was able to walk back to bed normally, and I settled back to sleep and woke at 5:30am because of the room spinning. I tossed and turned and fell back asleep when it subsided. I woke at 7am when I heard my son on the monitor. I sat up, momentarily forgetting to be cautious, and was again \"thrown\" back onto the bed. I felt awful. Room spinning, upset stomach, and I wasn't sure I was going to be able to make it up the stairs to get my son from his crib. But I again sat up and then stood up as slowly as possible, and again the intense dizziness abated pretty quickly. Throughout the day I did feel fatigued and a bit off balance. At one point that afternoon I had to sit and rest because I was starting to feel dizzy again. And I began to feel worse in the evening. \n\nI realized that I couldn't lay on my back or my right side without the room spinning. Looking up and standing up too fast caused the dizziness as well. I have continued to feel woozy, mild headache/pressure, and generally tired for days.  I can function, but I have no desire to do anything and am cautious to avoid causing more spinning/dizziness. \n\nOn Tuesday I felt almost back to normal, and hesitantly tried laying on my back and right side when I got into bed that night. No room spinning, so I assumed whatever caused it had resolved. Unfortunately I woke in the middle of the night on my right side and felt as though the bed was tipping and I was about to fall out. I returned to my left side and Wednesday I was back to the same general blah feeling. \n\nToday is Thursday, nearly a week since this began and I am already tired of feeling like this. I have looked up vertigo and  BPPV really fits, but is it usually temporary? I want to try the maneuvers but I am honestly afraid of making it worse. I am a stay at home mom and it has been rough enough with me feeling lousy, but if I wasn't able to walk without the room spinning or something like that it would be detrimental to caring for my son. \n\nAt this point, do I need to see a doctor? A specialist? Or should I wait it out and only sleep on my left side or even sitting up? I have no idea how difficult it would be to get an appointment, and I don't want to take my son out unless absolutely necessary (especially to a doctor's office) as he is too young to wear a mask. \n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 749, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Pretty sure this is BPPV, and it sucks.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/jszttf/pretty_sure_this_is_bppv_and_it_sucks/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "redwinggianf", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2jm6n18n", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1605114452, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/jsc0av/feels_like_im_on_a_boat_still/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jsc0av", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/jsc0av/feels_like_im_on_a_boat_still/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1605114463, "score": 1, "selftext": "My boyfriend just ran out to get Dramamine for me.

I didn\u2019t have the best eating habits when I was stressed so maybe it was out of the blue (I skipped on dinner to study and focus on assignments...). However, a week after I fainted, I started experiencing regular symptoms of what felt like my head spinning or feeling lightheaded. I couldn\u2019t tell. And usually when I was just sleeping and would get up. Also, specifically on the right side. Every now and then all through one night I\u2019d experience episodes where I\u2019d feel dizzy and it would wake me up. However, usually when people experience this type of vertigo it would usually be the world spinning around them. In my case it seems like it\u2019s inside my head. I don\u2019t see it, but I feel it. \n\nI would also have problems with getting up from bed as I\u2019d feel really dizzy, almost like it was motion-sickness. On the other hand, on the left side, I didn\u2019t have it at all. I still continued to sleep on the right side until I got fed up and slept on the left side ever since April of last year, and I am way to afraid to change sides at night. I do have a bit of weird chest pain on my left so that\u2019s why I\u2019m concerned. Sleep has become torturous since my BPPV started. Even when I wouldn\u2019t be doing anything but talking to someone with my head turned for a while I\u2019d feel dizzy after some time and even just sitting/doing nothing with my head but keeping it forward. What\u2019s worse is that sleeping on the back for my fused back (spinal fusion) and chronic post nasal drip that drives me insane (That happens on my left side as well).\n\nI\u2019m super afraid of starting to sleep on my right side again, only because of this BPPV. I felt like I haven\u2019t really had a good night\u2019s sleep since high school, and I\u2019m worried about my heart and whether or not it\u2019ll do damage to my neck, which it most likely will.

Were you guys able to lie down flat? Roll to the sides? And enjoy those 4D immersive rides in theme parks?\n\nIf you have the time to ready my experience below with BPPV since 2014, could you say my first Epley in 2014 was successful? Or was it not successful since I couldn't lie down flat, roll to the sides, and enjoy those 4D immersive rides in theme parks without feeling unstable and getting dizzy?\n\nThank you! \n\n--------\n\nSo I had my first BPPV attack in 2014. I rolled to one side and was jolted awake with the world spinning. Went to an ENT who did the Dix-Hallpike test and saw that it was my left ear that had the problem. He then did the Epley maneuver. I immediate felt better. I can't remember if I had like vestiges of dizziness or something.\n\nBut since then, I have never tried lying down completely flat. Closest was 1 pillow flat during massages. I always slept with 2 pillows or a wedge pillow. I also have never slept on my sides ever. I sometimes get close to lying on my right side, but only when I'm awake. I've never turned to my left while lying down ever. I have built the awareness to never roll to my sides when sleeping.  A handful of times I've felt suddenly steady when looking sideways too much, but no spinning attacks. I also noticed I get motion sickness easier after getting BPPV. I couldn't read while in a car, and felt highly unstable when watching swooping camera movements on medium to big screens. But apart from these position limits and random moments when I felt suddenly unsteady, I was \"normal.\"\n\nUntil the evening of October 2, 2020 that is. I had my first spinning vertigo attack in 6 years. It was the same spinning I experienced in 2014. I think I tilted my head a little to the left downwards. So I immediately scheduled a consultation with an ENT. A different one because I'm now an expat. After my attack subsided, I continued doing things, but I kept my head and neck stiff, steady and upright. Ialso slept a little bit higher that night. When I woke up, I felt normal. So normal that I even thought of canceling my ENT appointment.\n\nI still went to the ENT, and the doctor couldn't elicit vertigo on me after doing the Dix-Hallpike twice. She decided to do it a third time and I felt a jolt that told me it was about to start, but everything stayed normal. She then did the test again and on that fourth try, everything went spinning. So after looking at my nystagmus, she did the Epley on my left ear. I was so nauseated at that point, and I still felt dizzy on the way home like I was not on steady ground. This persisted for  a week. \n\nDuring that week, it was so easy to trigger the start of spinning with my usually normal actions. I felt so anxious and frustrated. I was so tired of feeling dizzy and I always had to snap my head back to upright because small movements felt like they will trigger a spinning attack. I also slept much higher than before because 2 pillows still felt like I'm at the start of a spinning attack. I didn't feel this way after that first Epley in 2014. Then one day, around 12 days after this second Epley, I picked up something from the floor, and suffered another spinning attack. I wasn't quick enough to stop and correct that head position so the spinning occurred.  I visited the ENT again and Dix-Hallpike was performed again.\n\nThis time the doctor said the nystagmus was stronger on the right side, so an Epley on the right was performed. This time, it felt better after compared to the second Epley. I didn't feel dizzy going back home. I thought I was back to my 2014-2020 self. But after trying to wash my hands with just the normal level of looking down at sink, I had to snap upright my head because I suddenly felt the start of a spinning attack. Worse, reclining back on my wedge pillow with a normal pillow on top of it made me feel like I was again at the start of a spinning attack.\n\nAlso, I have so many unstable or like jerking/sinking feelings everyday. The world felt so unstable. Hardest part now is sleeping. I'm sleeping almost around 70 degrees up and I feel so unstable. Like I'm on a boat. I will also experience sudden jerky feelings of movement. Or feel like the bed was tilting down to one side. I only felt normal standing up looking straight ahead. Before this third Epley, I could still enjoy reclining on my wedge pillow around 70 degrees upright. But now standing up and looking straight ahead is the only steady position. So I began researching for a different ENT today.\n\nI felt so frustrated that I just want to share here my experience, and verify as well how normal I should actually feel if an Epley was successful. Were you guys able to lie down flat? Roll to the sides? And enjoy those 4D immersive rides in theme parks? Because I couldn't do those 3 things since 2014 even after the first Epley I considered successful. But I was able to live with those. It's just this 2020 that everything is so bad with the constant attacks.\n\nThanks for reading and replying! \ud83e\udd17", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 732, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do I know if Epley is effective?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/jm90i0/how_do_i_know_if_epley_is_effective/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "sandersidle", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_smxjj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1604154083, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/jlj663/bppv_or_something_else/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jlj663", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/jlj663/bppv_or_something_else/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1604154094, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nMy mom (70 years old) started feeling dizzy 3 days ago. I actually ended up calling an ambulance because she looked so terrible and exhausted. She looked like she was going to collapse and I had to help walk her to bed. I thought it was a cardiac issue as her heart rate felt irregular when I palpated it (I\u2019m a nurse). They ruled out any cardiac issues at the hospital and was diagnosed with BPPV. I\u2019m just not sure if she\u2019s fitting the criteria. She told me this morning she had a dizzy episode while laying in bed that lasted 6-7 minutes. I\u2019m reading on UpToDate (an app that doctors use with current diagnosis information) that BPPV should only last for up to 1 minute at a time. She also gets quite dizzy lying down. And it happens randomly even when she hasn\u2019t moved her head.

In adulthood I mostly forget that it exists, although tipping dentist chairs make me nervous and disoriented, it's not near the severity of an actual episode.\n\nBut last November I woke up with the worst adult episode ever, maybe worse than most of the childhood episodes, and I was stuck in bed for a week, barely eating and constantly vomiting. \n\nI lost weight (I'm already naturally a bit underweight so I became a bona fide stick) and after a few days considered asking for an ambulance because I was desperate and wasting away from vomiting, even though I don't have much faith in medics helping me. It's not a wound they can staunch. I honestly craved death, I thought the dizziness would never end.\n\nIt shook me out of complacency and reminded me that this sh** is basically lifelong and I have to treat it as a chronic illness.\n\nI don't drink caffeine and don't have crazy salt spikes. The only identifiable trigger is sleepiness before bed, for some reason the natural melatonin spike(?) confuses my vestibular system, but it doesn't trigger full on episodes. I can't identify many ways to prevent actual episodes, except extreme positional/sleep caution.\n\nI woke up with it today and immediately attempted the Epley Maneuver because it seemed to help last time but it hasn't worked so well, maybe it's just residual stuff and I'll push myself a little harder to walk around later, but I feel so nauseous and miserable. I don't want this to be another long episode, I'm so frustrated because I had plans for my day and now I'm stuck in bed.\n\nWhen this strikes I make bargains with myself that I'll never toss and turn ever again because nothing is worth getting bppv, but I can't sleep deeply or comfortably on my back so that rule always goes out of the window. \n\nI can't swallow nausea pills so I rely on mints. I just had to pause to vomit into a bedside bucket while writing this, so I'm officially categorizing it as Pretty Bad. I might try Epley again later if I have the wherewithal or desperation. Right now I just wanna go into the flop response and give up for a bit.\n\nBppv is so frustrating, it can destroy my life in an instant and all I can do is wait for recovery. There's not much more advice I can apply to my situation, I can't see a specialist for various reasons, I just thought venting in this community might make me feel a little better.

At first people told me that it was my anxiety, and since I'm a VERY anxious 23yrs old guy, I believed it. I ended up not going to a doctor because it simply disappeared. But well, some time later it came back.\n\nIt varies A LOT. Sometimes it can happen as soon as I wake up and last throughout the day, other times it happens during the day and lasts even after I wake up. And then, it can go away for days, weeks, months and... come back.\n\nWhen I'm 'Dizzy', I know for sure that if I look down fast, or do sudden movements with my head, I'll have a very short episode of vertigo, like less than a second, not enough for me to fall or anything. It's more like a scare. When I'm not, I can do whatever the hell I want and I won't get dizzy or vertigo. Now, a few times I actually got full on vertigo (everything spinning). It NEVER lasts more than 10-20 seconds at most, but it is scary as hell. Also, it's very rare. At first I thought it was random (and I developed a fear of it being Meniere's) but I realized the full on vertigo would only happen with head movements, that's what kinda keeps my hope up that it is just BPPV.\n\nBecause of the quarantine, I decided to wait to go to my doctor (things are real bad where I live), but few weeks ago I manage to schedule with him and I'm going this 15th. But the problem is that I'm really really scared that it's something worse. I'm very anxious and I'm hypocondriac and fear is basically overcoming me by this point. Somehow I think anxiety makes the 'Dizzy' days worse.\n\nLast week I discovered some maneuvers that can help with BPPV, I have not tried the Epley because I thought it was too complex, but I tried the Half Somersault and after 3-5 minutes, the dizzyness actually kinda of went away. But it comes back. Is this normal?

I got tested by a PT (Dix-hallpike test and I had no nystagmus), by two ENT docs, and by an audiologist (who tested my hearing and said my hearing is 100% functional on both ears).

I'm new to this and I have a question that hopefully someone can help! A few years back I went to an ENT for dizziness and was diagnosed with BPPV. It hasn't been too much of a bother since except in the past month or two I have had a handful of extreme dizziness. Until today, they only happened when I was in the car and looking around or when I was tilting my head a certain way.\n\nHowever, today I had a sudden episode while I was just sitting at work, looking at my laptop.

If this is early on in a persistent episode then I will most likely feel very nauseous and anxious. However, if after 10 min I still feel imbalanced then I repeat the Foster maneuver until everything feel exactly balanced. \n\nThe turning point for me was finding the right set of maneuvers and performing them until everything felt completely balanced.

What came, and stayed, a few days after was way worse: near constant dizziness (different from vertigo) and lightheadedness, with many ever fluctuating symptoms: a very strong sense of imbalance, often light/visually triggered (neon lights in grocery stores would make me almost faint, I was terrified of going out), ever-present pain and tension in upper back/shoulders/neck/head (including increasingly frequent and painful tension headaches) and after a few months anxiety/panic disorder (palpitations, fast hart beat, constant anxiety, and creeping depressive feeling). \n\nI did see my doctor multiple times and all tests (blood, heart ecg/ultrasound/holter monitor) came back okay. She tried to put me on Zoloft to help with anxiety, which backfired and made me 10x more panicky even at the smallest dose. I'm currently waiting for MRI (takes months in Canada). I've also tried a variety of physiotherapy, massage, chiro and osteopathy therapies, and none really helped. Overall, I lost the ability to live normal life and was in permanent state of dizzy anxiety and pain. \n\nCurrently I'm still seeing two physios (one specializes in TMJ, the other in vestibular rehabilitation) and a massage therapist who does myofascial release.  Nothing seems to help, except for CBD that helped with anxiety and panic - did not remove them, but made them manageable.  I'm also currently waiting for a cervical collar ( [https://www.mywellcare.ca/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product\\_id=820](https://www.mywellcare.ca/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=820)), in case that helps with my cervical spine (I developed big postural issues, especially in upper back and neck, as I work in IT).\n\nAnyhoo, as none of the above resolved my issues, I kept googling. I wouldn't recommend it, and you're doing it at your own risk. :) A few days ago I came across a comment by someone saying she resolved her problems by applying hot packs to her neck. I was using heating pads for my back and neck for months, but it never seemed to help. It turns out I was targeting wrong muscles.\n\nFour days ago, I started applying heat to **SCM**, **suboccipital** and **scalene** muscles, as well as side of my face/jaw/under ear and temple/forehead areas. See this article ( [https://myopainsolutions.com/treatments/case-studies/dizziness/](https://myopainsolutions.com/treatments/case-studies/dizziness/)) for a reference, as it mentions other upper back muscles that might be of interest - they are definitely tense and painful for me. I use combination of different heating packs 2-3 times a day, for between 20 and 60 minuts. And just like that, 90% of my dizziness and headaches disappeared after more than 8 months of this nightmare. It might be too early for me to declare this as The Solution, but the improvement is so significant, and explains why nothing so far worked (none of them addressed extreme tension and issues in these groups) that I felt like sharing. \n\nI do not think it was a single muscle that was responsible for my sitaution. Rather, it was a bunch of them working together: over a year of prolonged and extreme work-related stress combined with extremely bad posture (my neck folder on itself, like an S) and 12h+ work days, total lack of physical exercise, bad diet (high in caffeine and sugar) and bad sleep habits. Then a cold hit, probably triggering BPPV initially, and then the entire set of symptoms came down on me like an avalanche. \n\nHopefully this helps someone.

He got up to the bathroom and I was quickly turning my body to the other side of the room. And boom! I felt like the room split into five like how it looks in Doctor Strange movies and started to turn crazily. I thought oh I turn too fast... probs gonna go away in a bit. \n\nNope. The spinning last for over 20s ( but I didn\u2019t know at that point it has something to do with my head positioning yet). I try to adjust myself in bed to other positions and it kept going, every time I even tilt my head the slightest I feel a strong wave of spinning. \n\nMy husband quickly ran back to bed since I was kinda screaming at one point. He sat on the bed, that caused some bed movements and boom the spinning hits me again. He tried to touch my head and boom I felt like I need to throw up right away... \n\nThen I started to sweat like crazy, my heart beat is going super fast and my whole body was shaking. ( I had panic attacks before, which lasted 4 months last year. So I was experienced in dealing with the dizziness that caused by panic attacks) but no matter how I try to calm my brain, my breath and my body down, the spinning goes off if I am not staying perfectly still. \n\nNot gonna lie at one point I thought I was dying or I needed to call for emergency medical care. \n\nMy husband put down the shades and made the room perfectly dark; put some blankets on me; stand by the bed instead of being on the bed and held my hand. I could barely speak... and felt extremely nauseous. Basically stayed perfectly still for 30 mins until I feel like I can attempt to get up from bed. (That\u2019s the worse 30 mins in my life!!! This is so much worse than panic attacks!!!) \n\nI got up, used the bathroom with my head tilted exactly like how it was in bed. At this point I realize as long as my head is position in a certain way I am free from the violent spinning. My husband literally walks me back into the living room which he made it pitch dark for me ( seems like bright light definitely make me super dizzy)\n\nBut I still feel SO SICK. I had bad flue before and this is worse than anything I ever felt. I constantly feel like I am uneasy. I am nauseous and feel heavy headed; I wanted to lay down but I can\u2019t. I try to sit up right to meditate and it works for a bit and then I feel dizzy again. ( not vertigo spinning just dizzy) Husband made me drank lots of water and I eventually puke my lunch out ( which I ate 6 hrs before the episode happened) \n\nAfter four hours of uncomfortableness finally my first episode ( and its lingering effects )went away. What a relief.....\n\nI feel woozy for the rest of the week, completely dropped my exercise, constantly battle the feeling of it\u2019s coming back, done some manuver on my own( seems to work but not fully), done tons of research online and now I am more educated about my situation. I will see a physician once my insurance kick in next week. (bad luck I was switching insurance this month and the episode literally happened in between time when I am not covered) \n\nDefinitely going to a balance center. \n\nTo everyone who\u2019s that\u2019s trying to tell us don\u2019t lose hope, thank you!

I get out of bed to use the restroom and realize it's still there when I get up from the toilet.\n\nI'm still not too freaked out at this point so I lay down quickly thinking it would help and get a violent spin for 30 seconds and it's at this moment I'm freaking out telling my wife that the room won't stop violently spinning. I have no idea what's going on.\n\nI hit up YouTube and discover that I may have BPPV due to crystals getting dislodged. They probably got dislodged when I did a fast head maneuver to look at the other side of the room. Thankfully I found some relief by doing the half somersault. I've been repeating the exercise every 15 minutes. Things seem to have gotten much better but every now and then when I do the final position I get a very quick bout of vertigo, lasts like a few seconds. I'm not sure if it's because the crystals are now in the correct place or if they fell back down and caused dizziness.\n\nMy case seems rather mild compared to what I'm reading but the damage that's done mentally is probably worse than the vertigo itself. I'm worried about triggering it again so I've been limiting my movements. Every time I go to do the somersault I'm more scared every time because I don't want to trigger it.\n\nIt's been about 2 hours since my episode and I'm feeling a better but I can't shake the feeling of it not being completely gone.

It was early morning, and I was sleeping on my bed where I instantly rolled over from right to left, and felt that room around me is spinning for 3 seconds. I though it\u2019s nothing serious. Then I heard my phone alarm, and instantly sat down (from laying down position) and I had another vertigo for 3 seconds. Since that time, I\u2019ve had no vertigo anymore but I\u2019ve been constantly lightheaded like 24/7. It\u2019s like somebody is shaking my head all the time (or like I\u2019m on a boat all the time). I get a bit better when I\u2019m laid down.\n\nThe day after vertigo attacks, I went to urgent care and the doc told me that my left ear is full of wax. She washed it and removed the wax, and examined both ears and said that there are some liquids there that shouldn\u2019t be. Prescribed Amoxicillin and Meclizine. I took them for about 6 day, but didn\u2019t get better. Went to an ENT doctor. He examined my ear, nose, and throat. Told me there is no infection, inflammation or anything. An audiologist also tested my ears and my hearing was 100% fine. The doc had no idea. Told me that these constant lightheadedness might be due to the vertigo attacks. So told me that this is BPPV and referred to a physical therapist. I want to the therapy twice, but no help. The therapist tried epley maneuver and no help. Also he put some vibrating device on the back of my head behind each ear to check if it\u2019s making me more dizzy. And it was, specially when vibrating on the back of my left ear. He said he thinks it\u2019s not vertigo and might be some allergy. Suggested me to take antihistamines, which I took for a few days after that, and no help (so I stopped taking them)\n\nThis lightheadedness gets better some time and worse some other time. For instance, when I look down (while sitting at the dining table to have lunch or dinner) or when I work with my laptop for 5 minutes. It gets so bad and remains so bad for a few hours. Then it gets better a bit, but it\u2019s still there and I can feel it. \n\nReally worried now.

TL;DR at the end if you wanna skip the play by play, however last paragraph has most of my questions in ramble form. \n\n\n\nThis was absolute hell. It started back in end of May early June. At first I just felt nauseated and out off whenever I'd go outside to smoke and then I would feel a little off after. Then one day I woke up and moved my head and everything moved with me. I started throwing up and couldnt stop. The whole room would spin and the only way I got relief was to lay on my left side. I ended up going to hospital after a week of being unable to keep anything down where they did some blood work, xrays on my stomach because apparently me saying my stomach doesnt hurt was not believable and put me on fluids and gave me an IV with meds to help stop the vomiting. The Doctor there said it was vertigo gave me a 2 week prescription and sent me on my way with no other advice on what to do. \n\nI had to send my son to stay with family because I couldnt take care of him. And when I filled the prescription the pharmacist told me what to do so I called my family doctor and made an appointment with a physiotherapist. \n\nFast forward Eply(sp?) Maneuver was done at multiple visits. I was constantly asked if I hit my head or if I was in an accident and I wasnt this happened out of no where. \nI went to the PT 4 times and was given exercises to do. \n\nTowards the end of July I was able to start sleeping on my right side again. Moving more. Feeling better. Made an appointment for in person with my family doctor who said there is still some vibration in my eyes but how well I am doing is really promising. \n\nI've gone a week now without the pills or gravol. I'm having a hard time getting up and moving again after being bed bound for 2 months. It takes me a lot of time to do anything, and then I am super sore the next day like I did a full body work out. I also still get a bit dizzy when I bend over or do too much or do stuff for too long. \n\nThe only upside to all this is I quit smoking because I was too sick to do so. \n\nSo my son has since come home and life is starting to get back a to normal a bit. However I'm constantly scared. I'm a single mom and being away from my son for so long was awful. I put on weight because once I was taking gravol every day I was able to eat but was too dizzy to cook so ordered in every day for 2 months. Im also petrified that this is going to come back because we dont know why or how it happened. I have a referral to an ENT that I'm waiting for an appointment so now it's just a waiting game. \n\nSo what do I do now? How do I stop this from happening again? Is there anything else I should be doing to make sure I'm see everyone I should? How do I get back to normal as in doing things like i used to? I think I'm afraid to set it off because I dont know what caused it to begin with... I just.. I dont know what to do or how to progress from here... I'm constantly scared... I dont know how to move forward. I really dont want to go through this again... I really dont some days I even had suicidal ideation to make it stop...(I'm bipolar 2 so this really pushed me off my routine and being alone so sick with no answers really pushed me into a low) anyone who's been through this... any advice.. I'm just scared... \n\n\nTL;DR : recovering from BPPV, need advice on how to not be scared anymore and on what steps I should be taking to ensure recovery sticks as well as how to not be scared to get back to normal life because I dont want to cause symptoms again and we dont know what caused it to begin with as I didnt hit my head or have an accident. \n\nIf you read the whole thing, you the real MVP.

I am a 37yo male currently on medication for diabetes, asthma, and anxiety disorder. I did some research on vertigo and it does point out to bppv as the symptom only happens when I turn my head to the left while lying down. So I went to see an ENT today, and she said she suspected bppv and prescribed Betahistine 24mg (Betaserc) to be taken for a week. However the ENT didn\u2019t want to to do the epley manuevre until next week. I tried to do the epley before seeing the ENT and freaked out when the vertigo started to happen so was a bit dissappointed that the Dr didn\u2019t do it at the office. My question is, does anyone have any success while being on this medication without doing the epley manuevre?

Not that healthy, but not unhealthy either, with slightly low BMI. \n\nWhen i was 15 (student), one midnight when i was using the toilet i was hit by intense feeling of spinning. I fainted and hit the wall hard. Weeks after the incident I would feel spinning on daily basis. I could only sleep on one side because it was less dizzy on that side. Went to a few clinics, some said it was vitamin B lacking, some said it was due to lack of sleep, some said i was faking it to skip school, etc. None helped. But it eventually went away after weeks. I am still able to recall those weeks so clearly in my memory. \n\nEver since that, I have been haunted by constant dizziness (not spinning). There were days when i  was totally fine, and there were days when i was dizzy for a few days, totally unpredictable. And there was no early symptom before the attacks.   \nAnd sometimes (also at random), I had this serious spinning sensation when i laid down trying to sleep. I had to sit up immediately and hold onto something and turned on the light as it will ease the spinning a lot. I will in a dizzy state whole day the next day. \n\nSometimes (randomly) the spinning sensation came when I was using the monitor (for works, movies etc).\n\nAll these seems to get worse in recent years, with some minor changes in patterns. I get this dizziness almost every morning now. And most of the times it only happened when I woke up early (like 7am). I usually sleep at 10.30pm-11pm.  It will have a sequence like this: Woke up7am (feeling OK) - breakfast (feeling OK) - go out for work (feeling slight dizzy) - at work (feeling dizzy) - lunch (feeling dizzy) - the rest of the day (feeling OK until evening) - on my way home (feeling slight dizzy) - at home (feeling OK).\n\nFrom time to time, im unable to walk in a straight line.  I tend to walk toward the side further away from the road. (i.e road on my right side, i tend to walk toward my left)\n\nBesides the dizziness, sometimes i got hit by symptom similar to panic attack.  It happened out of nowhere, at random time. Dry mouth, serious dizziness like fainting, lose of appetite, blackout vision, shaky, etc.\n\nI also started avoiding to go outside because im afraid of all these issues strike me at random time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to general hospital and had my blood taken for check up. Everything came back healthy (thyroid, blood sugar, mineral etc). I have a higher heart rate though, roughly 85-90 bpm at my age. \n\nNow should I go for mental checkup? or ENT? or others?

Full fledged spins when lying down, and feeling wonky for two weeks straight when walking or sitting upright. After about a week and half I did the Epley maneuver which reduced my dizziness dramatically (thank goodness) - but I still suffered residual dizziness when looking down or going down stairs etc. \n\nMy second bout of BPPV was Oct 2018. I was in the middle of interviewing for jobs, and also balancing hard deadlines for a couple of freelance contracts I had at the time. I was incredibly stressed and I think it's what triggered my vertigo for the second time - this time much worse than the first. I was unable to walk (!!) and had to postpone almost everything I was doing. I tried to Epley on my own again but with no success. I then sought the help of a physio specialized in treated BPPV. The first time he tried the Epley we could not trigger my vertigo - so he did the maneuver anyway and told me to come back in a couple weeks. I improved a bit and went back, we did the Epley again and the second time he was able to trigger my vertigo. I improved drastically after this second maneuver and went back again to get some exercises for the residual dizziness. He explained to me that he suspected this second bout of BPPV was more aggressive likely bc two crystals were dislodged in two different canals in my left ear. \n\nSo now, almost 8 months later, I thought I was doing well. I was on a trip to the Rockies (Alberta) and got back from my flight to Ontario last night around 12:30a. I was to wake up at 6:30a for work today but was awoken around 4:30a with, you guessed it, vertigo head spinning. I was desperate to catch some Zs so I propped my head up with a  wedge to sleep through the night. In the morning I didn't feel my usual \"wonkiness\" but am starting to feel it seep in - likely as I grow more tired in the day. I'm not sure what could have triggered it this time. Since occurrence #2 I've been working on managing my stress levels. I'm going to get in touch with my physio to make an appointment but I'm just wondering what triggers other people's vertigo. \n\nWe've been dealing with a lot of rain as of late where I reside and a few people have told me their vertigo has been acting up recently because of the weather. Could this be true? \n\nCould it be the plane ride? The high altitude of the rockies? \n\nI notice drinking alcohol impacts me a lot and I've cut that down and am thinking of cutting it out entirely. \n\nWhat are some triggers for others on here?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 229, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "BPPV triggers?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1561253488, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/c2wz14/bppv_triggers/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "SpikeXena", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_qfcvqcd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1560478826, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/c0en8z/not_sure_if_this_is_bppv/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c0en8z", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/c0en8z/not_sure_if_this_is_bppv/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1560478828, "score": 1, "selftext": "I will have the quick bouts of dizziness with certain head movements at times, but I will also get hit with quick dizzy spells when I am reading/scrolling down a page.

We both assumed I had done the Epley correctly and cured myself and she sent me home saying to call if there were any other problems and that she would check on me next week.\n\nI slept on the recliner last night.  During the night, my right ear (bad ear) popped and I felt like I was falling.  I thought I was okay this morning, even worked out, but then when I went to lie down. It came back, worse than yesterday.\n\nI did the Epley on myself again.  I did two round and wasn\u2019t sure if it was doing anything (I had vertigo the first time I lay back but not the second).  I sat up and wasn\u2019t sure if anything had happened.  About a minute after I sat up, the worst wave of vertigo I have ever experienced happened.  I lasted close to a minute and I had to have my daughter call my mom to come help.  I vomited profusely for quite a while and am\nStill very nauseated.\n\nDoes this mean it\u2019s not BPPV if the Epley doesn\u2019t work and I had a negative test.  Should I be looking at something else.\n\nThe PT was pretty concerned that it came back so fast and said that if it happened again, she wanted me to see an ENt and maybe neurologist for more testing.\n\nMore information: I did my own research and found a link to low vitamin D, osteoporosis and BPPV.  I do have osteopenia and always have low vitamin D, so I have decided to increase my vitamin D supplement to see if that does anything.  I am 41 and struggled with an eating disorder when younger.  I thought maybe my bones are getting worse and then is an indicator of it.  On the other hand, if this is not BPPV, then I\u2019m back to the drawing board.\n\nI know this is super long, so I appreciate any thoughts.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 203, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It\u2019s back!", "updated_utc": 1555256931, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/bcruqx/its_back/"}, {"author": "ruthcd", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_z3fno", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1554378315, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/b9bnkm/is_this_bvvp/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "b9bnkm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/b9bnkm/is_this_bvvp/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1554378316, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'm just looking to share my experiences to see whether people think this is BPPV, or whether anyone has experienced anything similar. \n\nEvery year or so for the last 5 or so years I have gotten episodes of vertigo which last seconds.

I can't seem to see any trigger as they happen when lying in bed (sometimes when asleep), standing up, sitting ect. \n\nI have very bad anxiety which I have been treated for, so realise the arm pain could be related to panic symptoms.

I got a cold that wasn\u2019t anything special, but I was stuffed up and didn\u2019t really take any meds for it. It went away just like every cold does, but two weeks later I started getting really bad headaches in my sinuses, so I was pretty sure I had a sinus infection. Again, didn\u2019t do anything about it and it went away. Then one day, I woke up and I felt like I was going to have nystagmus. It never happened, but it felt like it. The next few days I started feeling kind of dizzy and floaty, so I went to an ENT. He said he believed I had a inner ear infection (which I was prone to as a child) and prescribed me antiviral medication and anti inflammatory as well. The next day, I was in for one of the most difficult weeks of my life. \n\nI was sitting at my computer playing video games and I suddenly felt the dizziness and lightheadedness and  floaty. I got pretty tripped out and took 6mg of Valium (I was prescribed 2mg of Valium to help rescue Incase it got bad), when the recommended dose was only 2-4mg twice a day. I felt horrible after, and I tried to make myself sick but it didn\u2019t work. I just went to bed and felt like I was on a violently rocking ship. \n\nThe next few days I was bedridden, rocking and stoned from the anti viral. I could hardly walk, (probably from the meds) and the only time I got up was to use the bathroom. The next few days got better and on day 5 or 6, I was able to get up and return to my office. The next month of August I still had the rocking feeling. Each day got better. At the end of August, it was gone. \n\nMid September I got a strange feeling in the back of my head like the rocking would happen again, so I tripped out and asked the doctor for more treatment. I got prescribed another anti inflammatory, which is now one of my biggest regrets. \n\nAfter a few days of using the anti inflammatory, I noticed when I turned my head I felt like it was dragging and made me dizzy, and was quite uncomfortable. I figured this would go away, but it is now March and has been five months of feeling that and movement/lightheadeness/floating, and I am so fucking over it. I had a VNG last week, and I called my doctor to schedule an appointment to talk about  the findings. I never felt spinning like classic BPPV has, but at night time when I lay down sometimes I do feel my body rotating and that can cause nystagmus. \n\nWhat do you guys think? I had a breakdown today about it, I just want to feel normal again. \n\nTLDR: Had a ear infection last year that caused vertigo that wore off in a month, wasn\u2019t fully gone so took new meds that threw everything off since October  \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 189, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My story: do I have BPPV?", "updated_utc": 1554079710, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/azpzvt/my_story_do_i_have_bppv/"}, {"author": "ABDULfromhere", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_skjkhkw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1552152305, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/az5rlx/do_i_have_vertigo_and_what_should_i_do/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "az5rlx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/az5rlx/do_i_have_vertigo_and_what_should_i_do/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1552152307, "score": 2, "selftext": "Hello\n\nI'm 21 y.o. male.

About 2-3 years ago I got my very first BPPV. I felt a little dizzy for two days. My partner and I read up on what was going on and set up to do the epley maneuver. There was no warning at all that in doing so, you often get more vertigo because you are moving the otolith crystals through the canal. So, when the real vertigo (nystagmus and all) hit my like a freight train, I started screaming and closed my eyes (don't do that, but it was the natural response to feeling super dizzy and terrified). We went to the ER and they told me what it was. By then, I was a nervous wreck. Even if I understood what was happening, my anxiety was so completely through the roof that my hands were nearly numb and ice cold.   \nI remember when they did the moves on me, the room spun so much and so fast on all sides that I gripped the bar of the bed I was on and just cried while it happened. The nurses have seen some crap and my partner let me know that the nurse watching the whole thing pretty much said \"poor girl\". I happened to have an extremely bad case on both sides of my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the past few years, I've had small bouts of vertigo, likely caused by anti-depressants. Generally called brain zaps, but the room definitely spins, it's not just a dizzy spell, I see what I call snap-back relay in my vision, going from mid point all the way to the side over and over like a bad movie reel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not okay to get this kinda thing twice a year. I know that doesn't seem like much, but this thing terrifies me. I'm pretty sure I got PTSD from my first time having it and am horrified that it ever reoccurred.  \n\n\nIt's always activated laying on my left side, either outright laying on my side, or my head tilted to the left while laying on my back. It can happen when I am perfectly still. Twice it as woken me up mid sleep with an attack. Also, all day I feel quite dizzy and as if my vision just isn't focusing correctly (I know this can be anxiety too, but I can't be sure). In this particular bout I've had, it's not always there. For a few days I felt all day mild dizziness, but I could sleep on my sides with out a re-occurrence. Then two days later, I woke up today with a bout while having laid on my left side for some time with just full room spinning. Laid on my other side and felt the same thing, so I immediately just laid on my back, which always makes it stop. Nausea kicked in and then tears, because my god I hate this more than anything I've felt. I'd rather have a broken bone.  \n\n\nI'm going to tell my doctor of all this and say I would like a surgery to prevent this entirely, as in the little area where the otoliths SHOULD be, they stay there. No more adventures out into the semi-circular canals. I don't understand why the body wouldn't just have that area closed off. Why is it even an option for something that while benign, is can be severe in the fact that you don't know up from down and fall when you get vertigo? I mean, I know it's because it's fairly rare and because of that, people who got it didn't die out thereby those with a more closed pocket breeding, but I'm still so frustrated and baffled that it's a possibility. There seems to be no reason that the otoliths should ever be able to leave their little house. I want it plugged so that they can't escape. I read that there are surgeries, but I couldn't quite tell if any of them were about just plugging up the minuscule opening where the otoliths escape, or if it was about closing off certain parts of the canals so they can't affect the perception of them bouncing around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the maneuvers will help, but I am infuriated that this can and most likely will happen again and again randomly. With all the other crap I deal with (I have a pokemon catch 'em all list of mental health issues) I can not deal with this on top of it all. I need it to be gone for good, not just pop up outta nowhere and disable me physically and mentally from living life for a month while the stupid crystals dissolve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologies for the rantness of this post, I'm just sitting here crying in frustration and had to get it off my chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, is there anything that has helped you guys? The nausea and constant slight dizziness even when still is driving me crazy. That and I'm absolutely afraid to move around much because what if there is a new position in which the vertigo is triggered? Anxiety is already an everyday thing for me, this just bumps it up to 11.\n\nIs anyone else also as sick of it as me? Even if the maneuvers work at that time I don't understand why it comes back. I don't hit my head anymore than anyone else, I get colds sure, but no more than most people. I just don't get what is causing it.\n\nI also hate having to sleep for weeks totally on my back, with pillows to prevent me from turning my head on the side.

We were going to visit my family over Christmas but now he is afraid to go with me for the six hour drive (I would drive). I\u2019m afraid to leave him home by himself.

I had recently moved into a new home, quit my job to start my own business, and entered into the spring semester of school. I'm unsure if my level of stress could have been related to my vertigo.\n\nI awoke one morning feeling like my eyes had rolled back in my sleep. When I opened my eyes, I experienced the worst spinning imaginable. It felt like I had to grip the bed to keep myself from falling out of it! The rest of the day I was extremely nauseous, my eyes ached, and everything just felt \"off.\" The residual dizziness stuck around until about a month later when I was hit with another episode after waking up in the middle of the night. Google is leading me to believe this is classic BPPV, but I feel like I'm slightly dizzy all the time and have been having recurring episodes for months with little to no relief. I thought this was supposed to clear up in a few weeks!\n\nI have made certain adjustments that have seemed to prevent the full-blown spins from happening during the night like sleeping on my right side with my head elevated, however the residual dizziness has still continued. \n\nI have been experiencing these short and intense \"bursts\" of dizziness if I tilt my head down to take notes in class or while bending over. I have to bring a clipboard to my exams to keep my head in an upright position. Although it's been almost two months since I've had the spins, these short bursts of dizziness have gotten more intense with changes in head position. Laying on my back and tilting my head back will easily trigger a spinning episode. I even sometimes feel dizzy just by seeing other people in those positions. \n\nI have always been a pretty uptight person and carry a lot of tension in my neck and shoulders. I run my business from my cell phone so I'd imagine that I'm always a little hunched over. In addition, I have a terrible habit of clenching my jaw that sometimes will leave my face feeling tight and sore. This makes me wonder if I am actually suffering from cervical vertigo rather than BPPV. I'm terrified of the Epley, I've tried it at home and it's made me insanely sick. I don't want to have to suffer through these exercises if it's not going to help in the end. \n\nVertigo destroying me. I'm afraid to leave the house, exercise, or travel. I'm depressed and I feel helpless. I worry that this is forever and I don't know how I'll cope if it is. I just want my life back.

Caffeine and weather systems were definitely triggers. \n\n**July 2018**  \nGetting fed up, a friend referred me to an Osteopath. The osteopath did some preliminary work on my spine, organs (adjusting liver, kidneys), craniosacral therapy (which is \\~ controversial, and painful) as well as work on my jaw. \n\nMy body reacted immediately. I had the most insane migraine that radiated through my head and jaw after an osteo treatment. As soon as I started the osteo treatment I stopped getting the 8 hour long vertigo episodes, but I was still getting vertigo here &amp; there. It kind of shifted into what my Osteopath thought was *vestibular migraines* \\- some ocular migraines, haziness, difficulty focusing my eyes, lots of weird stuff.  I am skipping some of the fine details for brevity, but I'll say that I was not feeling good. I could not sleep on the right side of my head, I couldn't walk straight, and my ears were crackling all the time. Vertigo was becoming all-consuming. \n\n**August 2018**\n\nA bit of a shit show of weird vestibular symptoms, until the end of the month - my osteopath said I was now ready for vestibular therapy. She figured out I probably had a rare form of vertigo - *Cupulolithiasis*. She did a specific maneuvre during a week I was dizzy and then my dizziness stopped and has not returned.  \n\n\nI spoke to a friend who's a Naturopath regarding my experience, and she said I may have gone through a \"healing crisis\" - when things get worse before they improve. I've gotta say, I'm not sure what to make of any of this but I am grateful that the vertigo has stopped. It's been 40 days without any vestibular symptoms.  \n\n\nI want to encourage y'all to keep seeking treatment and to not live with vertigo. It's kind of a puzzle, figuring out what is happening with your specific ear canals - and I had to go through three physiotherapists, my doctor, an ENT (who was 100% useless) before I just happened to know someone who recommended this Osteopath. She said that my type of vertigo is extremely rare - so much so that her professor said \"ah, you'll never see this in person\" but she guessed correctly and probably fixed my vertigo, for the time being at least. I just know that I feel VERY different now. I can walk straight, I don't feel that fullness in my \"bad\" ear anymore, I can sleep on my right side and not worry about waking up dizzy, it's a relief.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 123, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I may have cured my BPPV (for now)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/9n5s6v/i_may_have_cured_my_bppv_for_now/"}, {"author": "FangedMink5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ezdun", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1538552770, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/9kz3k7/relapse_is_thia_bppv/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9kz3k7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/9kz3k7/relapse_is_thia_bppv/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1538552771, "score": 1, "selftext": "Basically over a year ago, laying in bed moved to my right and had my head tilted back.

Thank you, everyone, for sharing your experiences with BPPV. They've really helped me put things into perspective because this condition is so terrifying!  Although I think my BPPV is \"cured\" -- as in the crystals are out of wrong place-- I'm still feeling quite nauseated and I feel like I'm constantly on a boat, plane, or roller coaster. \n\nHere is my experience with BPPV. I had my first bout on July 7, 2018; I woke up at 4 am and turned my head towards my husband and suddenly everything was spinning uncontrollably and had to vomit. I stumbled to the bathroom, in total fear, and didn't have the confident that I would make it there at all. After that, I tried turning my head again and the spinning came back. I was so scared so I went to the ER. The doctors did the Epley and the spinning would happen again and I needed to vomit so I don't think it was successful. I didn't move my head much after that, but I could feel that turning my head left or right would trigger the spinning sensation again. I went to two ENT doctors, the first one didn't do much for me except give me anti-dizziness medicine and said I need to wait it out. The second one took video recordings of my eye movements and said I had horizontal BPPV because the spinning occurred when I moved my head both sides. The nurses there taught me to do the BBQ roll and that made me feel much better. I went back to the ENT two days later and did the hallpike test, and there were no longer eye movements no matter which side my head tilted. \n\nBut now I believe I have residual dizziness (probably?), and it's really bad when I'm sitting still or laying down flat and looking straight up or when I close my eyes. It feels particularly bad at night or when I'm trying to sleep. I constantly feel like I'm on a boat or a ride at the amusement park (which I don't think I'll ever go on anymore...) When I'm walking or on a train, I feel much better, though. Being tat work has been difficult as I can't concentrate at all in meetings or at my desk when I'm sitting down and not moving.  I'm hoping it'll go away soon but it makes me feel completely helpless. I want to get off this ride of terror! Did anyone else experience residual dizziness, and what did it feel like?\n\nIt's horrible living like this. I hope everyone with it feels better soon! \n\nTLDR: BPPV, cured by maneuvers, but now constantly feel like I'm moving/floating, feel nauseated.

Went to college and I couldn\u2019t even look at my work because every slight head movement would cause me to feel as though I\u2019m spinning. I was ok whilst my head was level. \n\nThe next day (Thursday) I went to the doctors and he told me he thinks it\u2019s labyrinthitis and gave me some anti-sickness meds as the spinning made me feel sick. The same day, in the evening I began to come down with cold-like symptoms which lasted from about 24 hours. Then on Saturday I was throwing up but I don\u2019t know whether this is to do with the dizziness. \n\nBy Monday, my symptoms were virtually gone and I was completely clear of it for about 2 weeks. Then two weeks later, I wake up and get out of bed and everything is spinning again. It wasn\u2019t as bad as last time and I didn\u2019t feel sick either. \n\nUntil now, I still have the dizziness when I get into and out of bed and sometimes when I turn my head. When I lie my head back hanging down the end of the bed, I get so dizzy and can\u2019t stand up without feeling like I\u2019m going to fall. I\u2019m almost on week 7 of this and it isn\u2019t getting a ton better, the only improvement over 7 whole weeks is that I don\u2019t feel as dizzy when turning my head. \n\nDoes anybody have any experience or any idea how long this will last?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 379, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "When will BPPV go?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/eyttup/when_will_bppv_go/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "bthug27", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8sloc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1580760816, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/eyd3a5/my_bppv_jumped_from_one_ear_to_the_other/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eyd3a5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/eyd3a5/my_bppv_jumped_from_one_ear_to_the_other/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1580760823, "score": 1, "selftext": "Has this happened to you??

Today I had tingling in my bed, but I could move my fingers and they didn't stiffen up, I vomited today unlike yesterday (yay!). I'm so upset this keeps happening. I went to bed last night feeling good and I woke up fine today.

Vertigo was there, did Epley didn't exactly help first time.. I got the tingling sensation throughout my body, I could separate my fingers.. The vertigo wasn't as intense as yesterday morning, but my head was extremely light, I didn't turn cold/hot while this episode happened.. I could focus a bit on a single object but moving head up, down, side to side, was bad. I was in a bed for 3hrs or so and now.. I could walk a bit but didn't want to risk too much falling over so I stayed a bit longer..i drank ginger tea and Gatorade.. Right ear is ringing like always.. I guess it's residual vertigo I have, I'll do the Epley tonight like I do every morning and night.\n\nMy episodes used to never be like this. It was always just, intense spinning, right ear ringing, vomiting. Now a days I get tingling sensations throughout my whole body from my mouth to toes, I can't move my fingers because they get paralyzed and are stiff as fuck, sometimes I get really hot and cold, then there's loss of general strength in my hands and I feel weak. Unbelievable, my episodes are getting worse as time goes on.. First one was when I was 13/14 years old.. Now I'm 25 and it's not getting better.\n\nWho else gets these feelings? The thing that scares me the most is when my hands stiffen up so much, that I can't separate my fingers or move them.. I encourage everyone to write down how they feel throughout the day, if you can't, record a video and voice what you feel to write it down later, I personally am forgetful.

I'm sad to see that others are dealing with this that are similar in age, however, it is slightly comforting to know that I'm not the only one.\n\nEach time I get BPPV, it is different lengths of time and the severity is also different. The last time I had it was when I woke up last Friday (Dec 13th). However, it didn't affect me while doing normal everyday tasks like in past times (only while sleeping on my right side). I went to physio twice and now it is gone again.\n\nI was just wondering how many times have you had BPPV reoccur? Have you only had it once? Or have you had it multiple times? For me, it was May-July 2016 (2 months roughly), Dec 2017-January 2018 (1 week), July 2018 (1 day), and Dec 2019 (6 days). \n\nI hope I don't have to deal with BPPV for the rest of my life but a part of me feels like this might just happen every year or so.

That episode lasted for about 2 weeks and after it went away it didn\u2019t come back for a long time. I was 26 when I got my second episode it was bad, nausea and vomiting. Had to come home from work, went to the doctors office my family doctor in fact, I know a lot of people here don\u2019t trust them much but mine was on the mark the first time I mentioned my symptoms, he did a quick test laying me down with head turned and boom diagnosed with vertigo in less than 10 mins.\n\nHe told me that there are drugs I could take but that I should see a physical therapist and an ENT that he knew specialized in this subject. I didn\u2019t go to either because I had just started my new job and though I had insurance even just the copay would\u2019ve set me back. I looked around on YouTube for some physical therapy exercises I found one with a female doctor that had figured out how to do these exercises on herself one morning when she had woken up with vertigo. I did this exercise one time on each side  and it was like a miracle, it went away so quick it was surreal. After finding this exercises and moving the crystals back I could literally feel when the crystals would, what I call \u201cdrop\u201d, because my world would spin instantly. I would do the exercise though and it would go away. Now after trial and error I figured out that my trigger was in fact a mix of mushrooms supplements I was taking that had a combination of lions mane and few others that were supposedly good for brain health, I stopped taking these and it went away no more reoccurring episodes. \n\nNow I\u2019m 28 I got an episode last week and every morning since I\u2019ve had to the exercises they help but no where near as helpful as last time. I lead a healthy lifestyle, I eat well and I exercise but in the last few weeks I haven\u2019t had the chance to workout as much as usual, there\u2019s been a cold going around in my family that I suspect may be affecting my vertigo due to congestion,  the weather has turned cold where I live, and I\u2019m getting married in a couple weeks. Reading your comments and posts would lead me to believe that any of these could be a trigger this time around.\n\nSorry if it was a long one, but reading your stories has helped to make me feel something good. So I hope mine does too. What I plan on doing is going to the ENT and seeing if he/she can get to the bottom of the cause I also plan on fighting through like I did last time and still go to the gym on a daily basis because that seemed to help a lot, I\u2019m also going to add yoga to my regime because I suspect that the fact that we don\u2019t usually ever move our heads in the way yoga makes you move it might have something to do with it. Like maybe our crystals are weak from lack of movement kind of thing. I\u2019m not a professional in the least but apparently no one really knows what cause this shit, so I will try my best to figure my own out at least.

Im a 32 year old male. This story all started with a bout of bronchitis. A severe bout that went to my lungs and clogged.my left ear. After the bronchitis went away I was left with a clogged ear for a few weeks and went and saw an ENT to clear it up. Now I assume most doctors are professionals but this one was definitely not. He looked in my ear and immediately ordered a hearing test in which i had some low frequency hearing loss. 40 decibels at 250hz or something. He announced I had Menieres disease but wanted more tests to confirm. Now, I had never had any vertigo symptoms and I've always had a little bit of tinnitus occasionally as a child. His practice was terrible and so was his staff so I do not take anything he said to heart and left pissed off. Took a couple weeks but my ear cleared up. But I was stressed out by the interaction and work stress built up. \n\n6 weeks after the ENT i start getting bouts of lightheadedness when I looked up. After a week I went and saw my GP. He comes in and sees on my record that I saw an ENT for MENIERES cause that asshole put it on my record. So he told me to go back to the ENT. I waited 3 damn weeks with panic attacks and anxiety while stumbling around at work and with pressure on my head and bouncy vision. All so that the ENTs assistant would be the one to see me. Took an audiogram and passed it no problem. The assistant said there was nothing about my previous audiogram that would show Menieres and I didnt have the classic vertigo attacks so she chalked it up to allergies and sent me back to my GP.\n\nGP prescribed me meds for allergies. I went 6 weeks and 3 return trips to the doctor with no relief of symptoms. \nI get a referral to another ENT. One MRI later no answers. Clearly this ENT is only interested in sinus stuff. Tells me it will go away on its own.\n\nI hear about vestibular therapy through a friend and start seeing a physical therapist. She has hard time diagnosing me the first few times with goggles but then sees a nystagmus. She lowered my dizziness about 50 percent of what it was over the course of a month with maneuvers and vestibular exercises.\n\nShe doesnt see anymore nystagmus and clears me and convinces me my symptoms are all residual. I leave. An entire month has passed while I am losing my mind. I turn my head different directions and feel a spell hit me. Again, no wild vertigo, just dizzy signals that are basically starting to hurt. Headaches, throbbing left eye. No end in sight. I can barely work and I cant watch my daughter as per me and my ex wifes agreement so she is currently seeing her the most. My depression and anxiety is eating me alive. I start to convince myself this is the end of my life. Since no physician seems to care and I have no support at home then there's really no reason for me to continue on. \n\nI find another physical therapist ag the same facility. Shes slightly more personal in her treatment. I tell her all my symptoms and she goes over all the tests shes gonna do. As soon as she puts on the goggles she immediately sees nystagmus and says its definitely BPPV. So she performs maneuvers, schedules more appointments. I've been there a total of 5 times with my new physical therapist and each time theres a new nystagmus, a different maneuever, and send you on your way feeling like absolute shit and have to wait another 3 or 4 days or sometimes a week. I will say something changes each time. But anyone and everyone I've talked to has had theirs successfully fixed wothin a few sessions and are living normal lives. Performing the maneuvers on themselves even. And I try to be polite and ask WHY IS THIS STILL HAPPENING and the only answer I get is that I still have crystals out of place. I can't get a clear answer of what's going on. So I made an appointment with an ENT out of area on my insurance of course, that specializes.in balance and dizziness. This is 24/7 off feeling, tinnitus louder than usual, and driving me nuts. Its causing me to clench at night from the stress so I had to pay a lot for a mouth guard. \n\nI just needed to vent my story. This is ridiculous. If I'm feeling this bad then why am I not being treated or held somewhere until this is resolved? This is like having a shoulder out of socket and uncomfortable pain and each session they try to get it in and if it doesnt, we'll try again next time. Go about your day.\n\nAm I the only one suffering from this chronic dumbass condition and who do I have to kill to get some relief?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 330, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "5 months in.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/e40tta/5_months_in/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tinarileyjones", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_538sk1wm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574838987, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/e2cf41/doctor_said_i_have_bppv/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e2cf41", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/e2cf41/doctor_said_i_have_bppv/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574838990, "score": 1, "selftext": "Did a post the other day about my experience with what my doctor believes is BPPV.

I thought it might be because of stress so I slept in the next day and I felt better although I felt a bit off balance when walking etc... \n\nFast forward to the beginning of October, same thing happened again, I.e I woke up at night and the room was spinning. Felt alright the following day. A week later same thing again and it has lasted now for like 5 weeks. Symptoms have waxed and waned but the worst episode was 2 weekends ago where I nearly threw up because of the vertigo and nausea. I could barely move my head in bed without starting the vertigo. Also have a heavy feeling in my head as if it will roll off with the slightest of movements. Other than this I feel of balance while walking and sometimes it feels like the ground is moving and I sometimes feel like my head is being pushed or pulled from behind. \n\nI have been to my doctor and he said that it sounds exactly like BPPV and has referred me to an ENT but I have had to wait like 2 weeks and seems like I\u2019ll have to wait longer.

I woke up with vertigo one morning and for about a month I would continue to get it when I tried to lay down, Or lay on either of my sides. I would also get it when I moved my head from looking straight up to down (chin to chest).\n\nI\u2019ve gone to ENT\u2019s, Physical Therapists, Chiropractors, and primary care doctors and they all say it\u2019s BPPV but others say it\u2019s a neck issue (Myofascial pain syndrome, Cervical Vertigo, etc)... \n\nFor the past month I haven\u2019t gotten the vertigo but also have not laid flat on my back or on my sides. I sleep slightly elevated on my back. The constant dizziness has subsided a lot but I still have the worst neck stiffness and pain. I actually have knots on the base of my skull right on my occipital nerve. Ever since the beginning I would get electric shocking pain from my neck down to my back. This has also subsided this month since I\u2019ve been taking muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatories but still have the feeling that the vertigo is about to happen....but it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s random, like when I move my head fast. Which I can\u2019t do....my neck muscles on the left side are so tight I can\u2019t turn to the left without pain and dizziness.\n\nI was treated for BPPV by the Pts and I would feel slight relief of the vertigo but it never went away. The constant headache and dizzy/off feeling stayed constant for about 6 weeks.\n\nI\u2019m just curious to know if this is normal BPPV behavior? Or if I am indeed dealing with a neck issue. It\u2019s so confusing and frustrating. \n\nI am going to a neurosurgeon in a few weeks for an MRI to see what\u2019s going on in there.

I went to my bed and did the half-sommersault manuever, it didn't help, I sat down in the chair, had to vomit. Spent the next 3hrs in my chair puking and getting hot then I would get really cold. The final time I puked, I felt better, and had some sense of balance back and went to the clinic but they didn't attend me. \n\nI couldn't sleep all that well, my eyes couldn't stay still it felt like if I left my eyes closed in a certain \"feeling\" I would fall into an episode, I had to find the good feeling, which means trying to keep my eyes focused on something, while closed, so I make an imaginary point of reference I can focus on. If I move my eyes around too much it could lead me to an episode. \n\nI have tinnitus mostly in my right ear, it's always ringing, last night small noises would give it a weird twitch. \n\nLast time I was prescribed Meclinze it wasn't that helpful (it was the yellow pill version), the blue pill was much more helpful to me when I was 13, I'm 25 now, I've been dealing with this off and on since then. \n\nI know I should make some lifestyle changes, spending less time on phones and the computer, no more video games or watching them, and sleeping on my back propped up with my travel neck pillow, bend at the knees. It's just so hard to change, i like sleeping on my stomach and video games.

So far, pretty much no one has helped me. They've diagnosed it as vestibular migraines even though I have no history of migraines (besides that prior incident but that was definitely BPPV) in my life and my neurologist gave me Topamax to try to treat me (which I am NOT happy about and don't really want to be on). It's been almost SEVEN weeks and my job has been really cool about everything but I feel that it's at risk. I can't work from home much longer. Why hasn't this gone away yet?\n\nMy current symptoms include: dizziness (pretty much around the clock), getting very light-headed when standing or changing positions, fatigue, tinnitus, jaw pain, trouble sleeping. It should be noted that I am an athlete and was in very good shape prior to this and now I am struggling to get up and down the stairs of my apartment.

I'm a 31 male mostly healthy. So after crawling under a truck and changing a starter on it, I experienced lightheadedness with head movement and overall fatigue. This was about 80 days ago. I remember because i spent the rest of the weekend thinking i was sick and laid up in bed. Went to GP, and he told me I had allergies. 3 times. I would take meds for 3 weeks and come back and he would say allergies, wait another 3 weeks of dizziness and come back and finally referred me to an ENT. I've had hearing tests come back perfect. Again was told allergies. Now at this point I'm losing my mind. I finally got referred by a friend to vestibular rehab facility and i just started there last week. Just got an MRI as well and am waiting on those results. \n\nSo here were some of my symptoms.in the beginning. I would feel lightheaded anytime.i looked upwards like i was gonna fall. And overall disequilibrium. No falling, no rotational vertigo attacks, just consistent disequilibrium and lightheadedness when looking upwards.\n\nWhen i was scheduled to see the ENT my GP threw out the term MENIERES and scared the shit out of me. I had to wait 3 weeks to see the ENT and I actually took off from work from the panic it caused. I was reading people with Menieres suffer from this type of dizziness for life and all kinds of things even though I didn't fit the classic symptoms at all, I assumed I had a different variation of it. I was basically bedridden and wanting to die. During that time, I couldnt stay sitting up for more than 10 minites at a time because of the pressure on my jead was so severe. When I walked around outside it felt like an anvil was on my head, and when I tried to watch an action movie, the fast movement would actually hurt and strain my eyes and head. \n\nAfter the week off i forced myself to go back to work. I am in sales and travel around quite a bit and driving does.not affect me one bit. If anything it makes me forget i have an issue until the car turns off and the vibration stops.\nAfter a couple weeks I noticed that I can stay up and walk around without having major pressure but still some pressure. My vision bounces with my walking and certain head movements give me a dizzy spell. And my left eye constantly throbs. Again no rotation nothing like that, just the feeling of dizziness. Very aggravating and scary.\n\nSo finally meeting with the ENT he more or less said i dont think you have Menieres but idk and scheduled an MRI. In the meantime I got hooked up with a vestibular therapist who has been doing this for 25 years and sees dizziness everyday. She hooked up the goggles on me to watch my eyes. Did the whole BPPV thing and saw a slight nystagmus in my left eye. I did not get dizzy from any of the maneuvers. She said I may have cervicogenic dizziness, so she massaged the neck, put a heating pad on it, and even laid my neck on a hoist and had me sit for 30 minutes. Felt weird when leaving but no difference later that day.\n\nI've been doing vestibular exercises for over a week now. It seems pointless sometimes because idk if they are helping or its just so gradual its hard to notice. I can now look at an object and move my head back and forth and not get dizzy. Grocery stores still give my head confusion and disorientation but not as bad.\n\nSo second physical therapy appointment yesterday. Let me know if this seems normal. My therapist has 3 people in a room at a time and bounces from room to room to room and quickly asks how you're feeling and then has the assistants put you in various positions and then she comes back and checks on you. I get it, bringing a lot of money in but I can't help feeling like my dizziness is different from those people. \n\nHooks the goggles up to me again and the therapist starts the manuevers on me. This time she sees something. Both eyes have slight nystagmus today. And even though my eyes are covered in darkness i see the blackness start to swirl just a little bit. Not a lot. So she puts me in different positions I've never been in before, one with my forehead facedown on a towel and then I finally got hit with a small vertigo movement while in that position. \n\nAfterwards I left feeling all kinds of weird but feeling like some kind of relief was lifted off a bit? I was told to baby my head, no quick turns or bending over or extending my neck. \n\nWoke up this morning, walked around, got dressed, hit with a few light spells. I'm at work, walking around the warehouse, experiencing pressure in head, brain fog, and basically hardly any difference at all. I go back again tomorrow morning.\n\nSo based on what I have so far any kind of reassurance or similarities to someone else who has this would be helpful. I'm gonna stay after it, I'm just frustrated and depressed from it.

(Chest pains, nausea, vertigo, lightheadedness). \n\nThe one symptom that I get, which is ussualy triggered by changing positions, is severe morning nausea. \n\nMore info, my first trigger for my insane morning nausea began a few years ago when I was 14. After a full day of rides at Disney, I went on the tower of terror (drop tower) and began feeling very nauseas afterwards. The next morning I was nauseas, and the morning after that, and for months. My nausea slowly got better over time, but it lasted for about 4-5months. Severe morning nausea that got better as the day went on.\n\nFast forward to last year now 23, I joined an upside down silks class. A lot of movement and a constant up and down motion. I got severe morning nausea again for months. It slowly got better, but it took time.\n\nI used to assume it was because of POTS, but after talking to A LOT of other people. I realised no one had the same symptoms as me.\n\nI'm naturally prone to vertigo, and get it frequently. I sometimes even get a random ringing in my ear. A lot of POTS symptoms can be similar to BPPV, except the morning nausea.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone has ever experienced this?  Does this sound like BPPV? I'm trying to find answers, after living nausea for years I want answers.

How long does it take?\n\nI can\u2019t help but think there is more to it because of other symptoms, mainly sensory and sore legs.

I couldnt look up without feeling like i was going to pass out/vomit.\n\nWent to the ER same day, did CT scan, blood tests, everything basically came back and nothing was wrong. Diagnosed me with BPPV. Ever since then i have always felt \"Off\". I don't get dizzy but i just feel out of myself. Bending down, moving my head too fast makes me feel woozy. I also think this is giving me very bad anxiety, as its been 6 months and i have had another incident a few weeks ago.\n\nI have had two real vertigo incidents total. The second incident i woke up laying on my back, looking at the ceiling and the whole room was spinning. Once these episodes hit, i am done for the day. I basically have to lay on my side and sleep it off. The next day i felt better.\n\nI have seen two ENT's, chiropractor, cardiologist, optometrist (generic eye doctor), and i have went to vestibular therapy once. Everyone keeps giving me the same answer \"Just give it time you'll feel better\" and that just makes me even more anxious. Because here i am 6 months later still with these issue. Im tired of wasting my money seeing doctors. I've spent over $1000 in medical bills this year.\n\nAdding i have also have had 3 epley maneuvers done, they dont seem to trigger my bppv.I have notice caffeine makes it worse, my eyes kind of twitch if i lay on my back and close them, same thing if i am sitting down and close my eyes, they twitch or pulsate. I sometimes get minor ringing in my left eat but it only lasts about 5 seconds then its gone.\n\nJust trying to get some more guidance on next steps...it has really impacted me mentally.

I can now lie on my right side without triggering an episode, so I thought it just went away on its own like it did last time.\n\nHowever, ever since the recent episodes subsided, I've been feeling unsteady, like I'm on a rocking boat. I don't need to be lying on my right side to feel this way; it's constant. The feeling seems to get worse and more dizzying when I sit or move my head in certain ways, but it isn't that vertigo sensation with involuntary eye movements anymore. Like I said, this is my second time having those vertigo episodes and I don't remember experiencing this constant dizziness after the vertigo stopped last time.\n\nSo, does this sound like it's BPPV? Can BPPV cause dizziness/unsteadiness outside the vertigo episodes? I'm seeing a doctor soon to answer these questions but I was curious and wanted to hear opinions from this community too. :)\n\ntl;dr Ever since episodes of vertigo with involuntary eye movements (triggered when I turn onto my right side) seemingly went away on its own, I have felt unsteady due to a moving boat sensation and occasional worsening dizziness that isn't vertigo.

Its not an ear thing since the vertigo is the same frequency other than lowering my neck, so is it probably a c1 c2 spine thing? How should I get it fixed after quarantine is done? I already had a chiropractor awhile ago that fixed most of the disks in my neck( alot of it was stiff) but the c1/c2 was still pretty stiff by the end of it when we checked the xrays which may explain why my symptoms of vertigo only improved slightly after the session.

I'll try to make this as short as possible.  Last year, on 6/2, I wake up in the middle of the night and felt really nauseated.  I thought I might have the stomach bug but I opened my eyes and realized the room was spinning extremely fast.  I'm not talking, spinning when I moved or something, this was extremely fast and non stop.  My husband hadn't come to bed yet so I tried to go get him and fell on the floor.  From there I couldn't move my head at all.  Luckily he was downstairs so I hit the floor until he came up.  I also started throwing up but was so dizzy,  I couldn't even lift my head to do so.  He called an ambulance and they ended up giving me meclizine and I felt better within a half hour.  Had a CT scan too and it showed nothing.  I took the meclizine for a few day after but felt fine after.  A few months later I got in with the specialist and my hearing test was normal and since nothing had happened since we didn't do anything.  There were a few days maybe 2 months ago I'd feel the spinning a little when I moved my head quickly but it went away.\n\nFast forward to this week.  5/26 I woke early and realized I felt the spinning every time I moved my head.  It was not nearly as bad as last year but the right side of my head felt heavy and it sounded like white noise in my left ear.  I was able to walk around but definitely felt the spinning when I moved my head, plus the heaviness I mentioned and nausea.   I took meclizine and felt better within the hour.  Last year I took the meclizine for a few days so I've been doing that but less each day and am planning on not taking it this weekend.\n\nSo, I reached out to the specialist who is recommending I do the Cawthorne exercises.  I am wondering if it could be connected to allergies though since the episodes were almost a year apart.  My allergies don't bother me like they used but I'm wondering if this could be how they present now?  The doctor (who I love by the way) thinks it just a coincidence.   My right ear has been sore since the incident though and feels kind of blocked. I also have a mild sore throat on that side.\n\nAnyway, I've upped my allergy medicine just in case (was just taking Flonase but have added zyrtec) and will be doing the Cawthorne exercises but I'm wondering if anyone else has had success with those exercises.  My only hesitation about them working is that at least the first time it was a one off incident.   If it was the crystals wouldn't I have continued to have symptoms?  I'm also curious about the allergy piece.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 498, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for advixe", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/gst1l8/looking_for_advixe/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "timtamcookies", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4gpsi33l", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1590679884, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/gs8dvg/seasonal_bppv/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gs8dvg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/gs8dvg/seasonal_bppv/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1590680492, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi folks.

This wednesday was a normal day for the most part. Had some slight dizziness the week before but went away usually within 5-10 seconds. No problem. I got home from work and instantly felt like I just was on a nonstop rollercoaster. Went to the bathroom and threw up my lunch and kept dry heaving for the next half hour. I was sweating buckets of sweat and my wife said I was paler than snow. No matter which way my head was I felt like was going to die. I finally got the courage to get into my wife's vehicle and she drove me to the ER.\n\nWhen I finally got there they had to put me in a wheelchair to go anywhere and I was breathing heavy from panicking and the intense nausea and dizziness. I waited what felt like hours to realize I only waited 10 minutes due to how bad the nurse said I looked to them. They wheeled me into a room and helped me make the adventure to the wheelchair onto the bed.\nHooked me up to an IV with valium, fluids to rehydrate me due to all the vomiting and sweating (which was still happening) and diagnosed me with bppv. I refused the epley maneuver at the time due to how bad and intense everything was and was terrified of going back in that state once I started improving a small bit. They had me take some meclazine, prednisone,and anti nausea then told me to see an audiologist. \n\nIt's now sunday and I am only now able to get out of bed and not feel like the world is going to kill me, but I am still dizzy as hell after a few minutes.

I guess my question is, has anyone had it as debilitating as this?\nAny tips or tricks to help alleviate it?

I went for a swim two days ago, felt great, then shaved and showered yesterday and used a Q-tip for the first time in a while, felt fine. A few hours later in the evening I started to just feel like my balance was off, then started to get some random dizziness. Thought maybe my blood sugar was just low or dehydrated or something, so I ate and had some water, felt a little better for a while but still just off.\n\nI went to sleep thinking it would be gone in the morning, but it was still there when I woke up. I went to the bathroom, came back to bed, laid down and rolled over and all of a sudden got very dizzy. Most dizziness yet and felt like I might pass out. I didn't but it took a while to subside. I looked into the causes and found out about BPPV. So I've seen some of the YouTube videos on the Epley maneuver but I'm not totally sure which ear is likely affected. I think it's my left ear because that feels like it could be slightly irritated but it was nothing I noticed until really focusing on it today while reading up and I can talk myself into it being either one.\n\nI tried to evaluate earlier by doing the test, lying down on my bed with a pillow under my back. Turning my head to the left, I did have some dizziness but nothing major. I sat up and still had a bit more dizziness. I then did it again turning my head to the right this time. It wasn't too much dizziness while lying down, but when I sat up it was then extremely severe sitting up straight, the most that I've had. I've been dizzy since and my balance has been very off. So does this mean that it's actually my left ear? That maybe turning to the right afterwards could have moved the crystals back into a bad spot on the left side? I don't want to try to test again for a while because it sounds like you shouldn't do it again too soon afterwards?\n\nDoes anyone know if this would indicate one side or the other, having that severe of a reaction after sitting up straight after turning to the right side?

So I got out of the bathtub, and my girlfriend helped me to the bedroom where I basically collapsed in bed, and fell asleep almost instantly for 2 hours.\n\nI was extremely unbalanced, and my eyes could not focus on anything. That night, and the following day anytime I tried to focus on something, it would be like my vision kept wanting to move to the right and drag whatever I was looking at along with it creating the visual to look like a wave of whatever I was looking at to be shifting to the right.\n\nThen April 16th, last Thursday, I went to the clinic to see the ENT (Ears, Nose, &amp; Throat) doctor who checked my temp., looked into my ears, and eyes, and listened to my chest, back, &amp; heart.\n\nThe doctor then made me hop up on a table, and pulled out this extender where my knees were, which made me go into a sitting position with my legs extended outwards. The doctor tipped me backwards, then forward again (my guess some sort of attempt at the Epley manuever), then had me hop off the table back intonthe chair by her desk.\n\nShe diagnosed me with BPPV, but I wonder if she just did that because at the start of the appointment she asked me what I thought might be going on with me, and I said maybe some form of Vertigo, and at the end of the appointment she concured.\n\nI guess I'm asking you all if maybe she diagnosed me with what I was just able to gather, or if she would of legit came to this conusion on her own as well if I simply said I couldn't give her an idea.\n\nI'm still wondering if I did not have a mini-stroke, or heat stroke in the tub with warm water while being dehydrated.\n\nI've been at home since resting, and performing the Epley manuever about twice a day since.\n\nIt's now been a week + 1 day, and while I certainly feel better since Day 1, and Day 2, my vision, and balancing issues are still problematic, and disruptive of my everyday life that I was living before all this started. I haven't drove, or been able to walk really without complications of being off-balance.\n\nAlso my vision seems to be wonky lately. If I look to my right, and slightly tilt my head back I can see whatever I am focusing on clearly, however if I go to look to my left, or over my left shoulder, it is **extremely** blurry, and I get some heavy double vision that does not seem to go away.\n\nI guess I have the following questions:\n\n1.) Could it be something else rather than BPPV?\n\n2.) How long does it take for me to get back to the same level of vision I had before this started?\n\n3.) Will I ever have the same level of vision, and balance as I did before this started a little bit over a week ago?\n\nThis has caused some quite a bit of anxiety as I have a job I will need to eventually drive to on my own to save money from not taking cabs, etc.\n\nThank you for your time reading this, and any future comments.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 447, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Recently diagnosed, but still not completely sure..", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/g6gadj/recently_diagnosed_but_still_not_completely_sure/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1587576141, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/g659mo/is_it_normal_to_have_bppv_at_a_young_age/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g659mo", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/g659mo/is_it_normal_to_have_bppv_at_a_young_age/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "deleted", "retrieved_on": 1587579353, "score": 1, "selftext": "[deleted]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 446, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Is it normal to have BPPV at a young age?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/g659mo/is_it_normal_to_have_bppv_at_a_young_age/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "autumndanny13", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1cwzllq2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1587493400, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/g5kkzu/bppv_posterior_canal_occlusion_surgery/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g5kkzu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/g5kkzu/bppv_posterior_canal_occlusion_surgery/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1587496471, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello Everyone! \n\nBackstory: I had my first bout of BPPV in the middle of Nov 2019, which took roughly 4-5 weeks for symptoms to totally resolve. I went to the ER because the first episode was awful, and me not knowing what it was, kept looking around and triggering it. They diagnosed me with BPPV, healed up, went back to work, it was history. \n\nFast forward to 3 weeks ago, I woke up in the middle of the night from a nightmare, super hot, flipped over and BAM, vertigo. Dealing with this before, I got up and stabilized myself, went for a walk. Weird thing: this episode was not nearly as disorienting as the last, but has lingered far longer.  Most of you probably have the symptom of after having the episode just constantly feeling like you're floating, everything is not quite right, but it's manageable. Issue is: my symptoms have almost healed up twice now and then I'll get another bout of vertigo, and back to felling like I'm floating and everything isn't quite right. \n\nI've done the repositioning methods, and they don't seem to help. \n\nMy question to you: has anyone here heard of posterior canal occlusion surgery? Also, has anyone had the procedure done? I'm calling a balance center today to see what they can do for me, I'm hopeful. \n\nCurrently I'm in the mindset that this isn't the worst thing that could be happening to me, it's very disorienting and I'm tired more than I usually am, what's helped me most is going on walks and staying active. After much research and many long nights lying awake at the fact this may be a recurring issue for me, the best comfort I have found is to keep living life as normal as possible, the more walks I go on and the more active I stay, the better I feel.\n\n For you first timers experiencing BPPV, I am so sorry that this is happening to you, yes it sucks, and yes you are valid in feeling like your world is crumbling around you. My first episode was so awful, and I cried so much because I thought it was going to be my reality, but it went away. Yes it came back in my case, but here's the deal at least for me: Accepting that this may be something I have to battle potentially the rest of my life and just accepting that almost as if it were a fact, gave me great comfort and control over it. There was a point for me where the nausea has pretty much subsided and I'm just left with dizziness/floating feeling. I can handle that, you can handle that, it sucks, it's disorienting, it's a invisible \"illness\" that no one can see the struggle of dealing with, but you're alive and for the most part, healthy. Stay active, stay present, and do the best you can. Go to the doctor and stop googling horror stories. \n\nSorry this was long winded. \n\n\n\n\nSummed up: second episode of BPPV in a 4 1/2 month span, has anyone had posterior canal occlusion surgery, or considered getting it to fix your reoccurring BPPV.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 443, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "BPPV - posterior canal occlusion surgery", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/g5kkzu/bppv_posterior_canal_occlusion_surgery/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "paintballerzz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1h6pz2fq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1587388867, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/g4snq6/bppv/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g4snq6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/g4snq6/bppv/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1587388868, "score": 1, "selftext": "Had a similar experience one time last week.

Unfortunately, this quarantine isn't super great for my physical health. I was hoping to find answers online as I don't want to risk COVID by going to see a doctor for something I can fix myself right now.\n\nIs this Cervical Vertigo?

Three days of taking that and throwing up every time I took it and I went and saw another doctor who diagnosed the BPPV and told me not to bother taking the Serc anymore. I told both doctors that I also had pressure in my right ear and a jabbing pain every once in awhile. Neither one checked my ear. I had vertigo once, 9 years ago and it was due to an inner ear infection and was given an antibiotic that helped. \n\nOnce I was told about the BPPV I performed the Epley a couple times and spun out of control. I did it again last night and barely felt anything, and like I said the spinning has pretty well stopped anyway.

And I spent about 3 months playing it for hours every day before the dizziness and nystagmus started. Head/neck at an awkward angle to look at my fingers. \n\nThen I got hit with dizziness. The funny thing is the Epley maneuver was like a miracle cure. \n\nThen I would get dizziness swimming. Thought it was water in my ears.\n\nOr I would get dizzy after a workout. Thought it was sudden head movements. \n\nThere\u2019s no direct or easy to identify trigger, it seems to come on gradually and then stick around for a while. So I didn\u2019t connect it to the following:\n\nBad posture while sitting at a computer for a long time OR! Use of my left upper trapezius muscle. \n\nSo deadlifts triggered dizziness, but I thought it was the valsalva maneuver and did a bunch of research on a perilymph fistula. \n\nBut then sitting and watching TV or working triggered dizziness so I thought it was computer vision syndrome. \n\nAnd after over a year of chasing my tail here\u2019s what happened. I settled on cervicogenic dizziness as the cause. So I fixed my posture. And that has helped, but not removed it completely. \n\nOne night I slung that heavy guitar over my shoulder and played for about 2 hours right before bed.

Within a minute of having that guitar on my shoulder the nystagmus and nausea had returned. \n\nSeems like I have a pinched nerve or blood vessel somewhere. \n\nI still have some ear symptoms. Likely because I\u2019ve been popping my ears obsessively for the last year. You see when I get dizzy I feel like I can\u2019t feel my inner ear. Like it\u2019s clogged. My left nostril (effected side) gets clogged up. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just that simple.

This time it persisted, so on December 30th I had my doctor do the Epley manoeuvre on me.  The actual vertigo went away immediately after the procedure, but I seem to still be getting some kind of dizziness.  I've heard residual dizziness is common after being treated for BPPV, but I was wondering if someone who has had residual dizziness after BPPV could tell me if what I'm experiencing is the same thing.\n\nThe dizziness I'm getting is not light-headedness or full on vertigo with a spinning sensation, but more like imbalance and spatial disorientation.  I'm OK when sitting or standing still, but when I move around, I feel off-balance and slightly disoriented.  If I turn my head quickly, it feels like the sensation of turning continues for about half a second after I stop, which sometimes causes me to stagger.

It's almost like lying down for a long period is what sets it off.\n\nIs this what residual dizziness from BPPV is like, or is it possible that I'm still experiencing very mild BPPV due to the otoconia not being completely cleared, or does this sound like something else?

I'm hoping to see my doctor soon to get a proper diagnosis and/or referral, but it's been difficult to see a doctor for anything that's not considered super serious during the pandemic and I've also kind of been putting it off as long as possible because I'm not super comfortable with medical environments/tests (trauma-related.) \n\nBut anyway, I was wondering if anyone else experiences this symptom or other signs of an impending vertigo episode a few days or hours before the symptoms start. I've had enough episodes at this point that I can usually predict when they're about to happen because I get this prodrome phase or something where I feel kind of floaty and dissociated for a few days, will often walk into door frames and railings as if I'm just *slightly* off balance, but not quite enough for me to notice it consciously during normal walking yet, briefly feeling like I'm falling through the floor, kind of similar to that falling sensation a lot of people get sometimes when you're just about to fall asleep, and a sense of impending doom or something being very wrong, but not being able to explain exactly what it is.\n\nIt's the last one I'm most concerned about because of course it's most commonly associated with life-threatening health issues like heart attacks and I'm not sure if it's common for people who experience benign vertigo to have these feelings before an episode or if I should be concerned about it. I'm also kind of nervous to bring it up to a doctor because I've had a lot of medical professionals dismiss my health problems as \"just anxiety\" in the past and I've had to suffer through a lot of pain and discomfort on my own without any kind of real assessment or treatment so I'm debating whether to just not bring it up if it's normal because if I say the wrong thing, I could end up being sent home without answers again. I've had my fair share of panic attacks and generalized anxiety and it feels very different\u2014I don't feel very panicked when it happens, just a sense of \"something is very off and I need to do something about it\" and when I've had panic attacks in the past, my fear of hospitals/doctors tends to become even *more* heightened, whereas in these \"impending doom\" moments I feel more dysphoric than afraid and the uneasiness is enough to make me almost *want* to go to a hospital\u2014so I'm pretty confident what I'm experiencing is not related to my normal anxiety, but I don't really trust doctors to trust me to know the difference, if that makes sense. \n\nSo far this feeling has always led to a vertigo attack and nothing truly disastrous has happened so I assume it's just my brain picking up on changes in pressure or balance that I'm not consciously aware of or something, but I'm curious if other people experience something similar or any other kind of \"prodrome phase\" before an episode. Or if you've experienced something like this and it turned out to be something more serious (although I'm assuming most of you have benign vertigo, considering where we are.)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1677, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does anyone get a sense of impending doom before an attack?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/rtp8yi/does_anyone_get_a_sense_of_impending_doom_before/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AudioKrack", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_726i6mk0", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1640931245, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/rsn7zo/seeking_advice/", "gildings": {}, "id": "rsn7zo", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/rsn7zo/seeking_advice/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1640931256, "score": 1, "selftext": "I'm beyond confused.

I apologize in advance for the long post, but I am hoping that there is somebody out there who has experienced the same as me or has some input/advice on what I should do.. \n\nI have always been a healthy adult. Back in March/April I started getting feelings of my ears being full. Almost as if they were full of water. This wouldn\u2019t happen all the time, but often enough for me to feel a bit uncomfortable. I resorted to cleaning my ears out, ear cleaning kits, etc. which seemed to help. My symptoms were so minor that I didn\u2019t really see a need to go to the doctor. \n\nFast forward to September - I get a super intense UTI. I had never had a UTI before.. lots of pain, lower back pain, fever, headache, chills. The first round of medications were not clearing up the infection and my doctor placed me on another antibiotic which is actually used for kidney infections (which was a concern because of my high fever). I finally got over the UTI. About a month or so later, I started experiencing the ear fullness feeling again. I felt like I was under water, balance was off, I felt like I could not pop my ears. My equilibrium was just totally off. \n\nI went to the doctor last month because my symptoms were starting to affect my day to day. They found that I had severe fluid build up in my ears, which explained the ear fullness and feeling of my balance being off. I was put on a prescription nasal spray. No luck. Still had discomfort in my ears and the vertigo I was experiencing was out of this world, sometimes lasting days. I felt like I had a constant hangover. When I would sit at my desk at work, I felt like my surroundings were moving so much to the point that I have to grip the sides of my chair to keep me balanced. \n\nObviously not feeling better, I went back to the doctor almost two weeks ago now. She said that I had clear fluid in my ears and ended up putting me on pseudophedrine to try to help dry up the fluid. After explaining to her my vertigo symptoms, she put me on meclizine, which does help but temporary and put through a referral for PT, although she basically ruled out BPPV. \n\nI was never actually diagnosed with an ear infection. I\u2019m wondering if somebody the infection from my UTI is related? My symptoms of vertigo are so bad to the point where I\u2019m afraid to drive. I can\u2019t work without feeling like I am going to fall over. Since then, I have also noticed night driving really bothers me and flashing lights (ie. camera flash) trigger my vertigo. My first PT appointment is tomorrow and I am praying for relief but I am nervous that they are going to brush it under the rug because it is not diagnosed as BPPV. Since my symptoms have gotten so bad, I cry out of frustration from not being able to do things that I normally would do. I have multiple breakdowns a week. I feel like I\u2019m having panic attacks and anxiety. I have a follow up with my doctor next Tuesday and she said if my symptoms are not better that she wants to refer me to an ENT. My Mom is a retired nurse and she said that I have the worst case of vertigo she has ever seen. \n\nHas anybody experienced anything like this? Has PT helped you?

Every March/Early April and early November since I've had an episode, but not nearly as awful as the first time. So I'm writing my vertigo off as seasonal. \n\nThere is little research on seasonal vertigo, however the studies done show influx in attacks in spring and fall and small correlations with humidity/barometric pressure/temperature change, but correlations nonetheless.  \n\nThere's a study about vitamin D helping to improve vertigo symptoms. I started taking Vit D/magnesium religiously last summer and the past two spells I had were not bad at all, very manageable compared to the first two I had. To my surprise, I talked to some family members and my Grandpa experiences seasonal vertigo, and his mother also struggled with it as well. So I'm not convinced I didn't inherit this.\n\nI'm honestly about to start taking Calcium and see if that helps any. I feel like I'm getting close to making these spells even less drastic by getting the vitamin combo right, considering that ENTs are at a complete loss on this. \n\n\nGood luck to everyone out there. After going through 4 spells now, one lasting 2/3 months (intense residual dizziness), the words of advice I can give you are this:\n 1) BREATH.  No seriously, breath bc this shit is scary, and world altering. But you'll be okay. This WILL pass. \n2) STOP reading shit on the internet after a certain point. Please. I had myself convinced I had Menieres and other diseases. Get yourself to a doctor to confirm it's not the big shit and then STOP. after I did this my life got better. \n3) If needed:therapy.

Whenever you get an episode, trust that you now know what to do to help and not help. Breathe through this. You got this. \n5) last but not least, WALK OUTSIDE. I swear to you, all I wanted to do was sit in a ball and feel awful. During the vertigo spell that lasted 2/3 months, about halfway through I had a breakdown and said fuck it. I started walking outside everyday, even though nothing looked right. When I tell you this changed everything for me. It's like moving/walking outside was the only thing grounding me. I felt so much better and took 3-2 mile walks a day. Get yourself moving, you have to tell your brain to adapt and re-adjust. You're only hurting yourself by staying stationary, load up on some meclizine and go for it.

Heart check. aRe YoU sUrE yOu\u2019Re NoT pReGnAnT? (I know they have to ask, but it makes me sigh when they do) \n\nAnyway, I had two pretty severe nausea/vertigo episodes while waiting for tests to come back. One was in the vicinity of some nosy equipment at work. The other was triggered by a small earthquake in a VERY non-earthquake prone area of the world. It made headlines because the quake was actually in one capital city, but the after-shocks were felt in another capital city, where I was. We were on the 6th floor at the time, which is why I suppose I felt it so severely. Both episodes caused nausea that lasted for about a day. During the earthquake, I thought I was going to pass out, while everyone else just felt a little wobble. It was really not fun. \n\nSo when I rocked up at the practice to get my test results back I decided to tell my doctor about these episodes because he was clearly out of his depth. The conversation went like this. Subtext embellishments for humour purposes added in brackets: \n\nD: So your test results came back normal. \n\n\nM: That\u2019s frustrating. I had more episodes. One was near noisy equipment at work. The second one was during the earthquake. \n\n\nD: Right. (WTF are you talking about, you crazy) \n\nM: You don\u2019t believe me.

I discovered the Epley manoeuvre the first time, and that has usually worked quite well for me, without any residual dizziness and it's never made me ill.\n\nLast week I identified a bout of vertigo and attempted the manoeuvre. The first two times the nausea was so bad I ran to the toilet, but did not throw up. The next two times I did. Somehow I did manage to get through the full manoeuvre and I thought it had worked since doing the test did not start any nystagmus. Over the course of the weekend I was still feeling off balance and on one occasion nauseous. I figured this was residual dizziness.\n\nThis morning, which is five days after the initial onset, I was feeling particularly off balance. I tried the test again, which indicated bppv on the left side and I then did the manoeuvre on that side. I did the test again and it then indicated the right side. I tried the manoeuvre on that side and got sick again. I have not attempted anything since, but still feel quite off balance.\n\nI have an appt booked in with a vestibular therapist later this week, but I am hoping for some insight from the community in the meantime. I don't know what's going on, the vertigo seems to be switching sides and is more difficult to clear than I've ever experienced. Any tips are welcome!\n\nOne additional note, since the past year I have been diagnosed with chronic migraine and am on two medications for this: Candesartan and Aimovig. The former can cause light-headedness, the latter nausea.

After a few times i tested myself and it was gone to almost 98% yesterday, but today i was sleeping in the right side( supposedly the good ear)and got up slowly and the room was spinning mildly for a minute.

I realize not all have experienced complete resolution of their BPPV, but I believe hope can be a game changer for some.\n\nI've only had one bout of BPPV, and it has resolved to about 98%. (I have subtle balance moments.) Before my bout, I figured my lifestyle choices (e.g., dehydration, malnutrition, lying around for long periods of time) would catch up with me\u2014but, boy, did I not appreciate how they manifested through BPPV. Thankfully, the BPPV was short-lived:\n\n1. The BPPV began, and, since I didn't know anything about BPPV, I monitored it over a week to see if it would resolve itself.\n2. It didn't (and, in fact, worsened), so I began researching it online in earnest.\n3. I self-administered the Epley maneuver (see the [quick reference guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/km1vv6/bppv_a_quick_reference_guide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) \\&gt; Treatment for more maneuvers).\n4. I experienced [terrible residual dizziness](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/kb8mfa/transition_from_spinning_to_exaggerated_motion/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and began spiralling.\n5. I [called the doctor](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/kb8mfa/comment/gfgqdg5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), who suggested some basic remedies, but whose positivity, I think, did more for me than her recommendations. Her positivity reminded me that there were solutions I had not yet tried (see the [quick reference guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/km1vv6/bppv_a_quick_reference_guide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) for solutions from this community and beyond).\n6. I took Gravol and slept off the residual dizziness, which lasted a day.\n7. I began upping my water intake (i.e., one cup per hour), taking vitamin D supplements, and taking better care of my head (e.g., not jostling or knocking it around needlessly). I haven't experienced another BPPV episode since.\n\nIf you have stories of hope, please share them below.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1558, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Recovery Stories", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/qtbhul/recovery_stories/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "humanonymous007", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_cixl7ic2", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1636823620, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/qt5lmp/mildness_vertigo_last_week_off_balance_while/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qt5lmp", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/qt5lmp/mildness_vertigo_last_week_off_balance_while/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1636823631, "score": 1, "selftext": "Had mild vertigo last week when I lay down.\n\nHad a panic attack due to it.\n\nAfter that while I was walking felt out of balance.

I figured that was that and went on with my life. Then last Friday it happened again and this time I saw my doctor about it. She thought the wax wasn't the issue and that I might have BPPV. She wants to wait and see if it will resolve on its own but, though I haven't had the vertigo again, my balance has been bad. Not rough seas bad, more like walking on the deck of a passenger ferry. Thing is, I have a history of anxiety and panic attacks so I'm not sure if my balance issues this week are because of BPPV or just anxiety...It seems strange that I wouldn't have these balance issues after the first instance, but have now persisted after the second instance when I realized this vertigo could happen again!

I went for a run last night and felt okay, this morning and all today I\u2019ve been crazy busy again. Is it possible that running is making my vertigo flare up?

I am very new at dealing with this and I\u2019ve only ever heard of what bppv was a couple days ago. About a month ago I had my blood work done, everything was normal. During my follow up I was given a flu shot and moved on with my life as normal. Days following I experienced dizziness spells on and off, intense brain fog, and nearly blacked out in a gym class. Because I just had blood work done i thought everything was caused by my vision. After going to the eye doctor everything seemed to be normal. I then went back to my general practitioner who diagnosed me with bppv. I explained to her my concern about my different symptoms occurring days after getting the flu shot, but she immediately denied it was from that. Being someone who happily took the Covid vaccine, I am mainly confident in its safety. (And the safety of vaccines in general) However, I\u2019m concerned that somehow the mixture of the two or this years flu shot alone might have triggered me to have bppv. \n\nI am simply wondering if anyone else has had this happen to them following either vaccines - or if you know what triggered your bppv to begin. I have never dealt with this before or have had any medical issues before. I know this is a tough topic and often a political one but I just feel scared and would like an open and honest conversation about this.\n\nThank you in advance for understanding &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1526, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Open to any advice or insight", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/qm1hbz/open_to_any_advice_or_insight/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "newuser201890", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_zf7kvfy", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1635955092, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/qlxjlh/bppv_and_flying/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qlxjlh", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#46d160", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "90f16e50-68aa-11eb-b182-0e6fa56733bf", "link_flair_text": "Tip", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/qlxjlh/bppv_and_flying/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1635955103, "score": 1, "selftext": "Worried about getting on a plane and having an attack, anyone know if flying can bring them on?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1525, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "BPPV and flying?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/qlxjlh/bppv_and_flying/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "little_pimple", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4e9jdp2j", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1635872054, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/ql8mr9/watching_my_mother_with_bbpv/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ql8mr9", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/ql8mr9/watching_my_mother_with_bbpv/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1635872065, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi all\n\nYesterday my mother experienced her second vertigo episode. Watching her go through with this was the most heart breaking, stressful and panic peaking period of my life. Im a 38 year old male and I brokedown and balled my eyes out several times during the day because of how helpless I was and watching her suffer so much. It felt much worse dealing with my father's death or any other major life changing stressful events in my life. It really breaks my heart to see so many people go through this .\n\nFor my mum, she says she gets a \"warning\" before the spinning room sensation starts. She can avoid the spinning sensation if she lays down, closes her eyes and stays still for a few hours. \n\nOn this occasion, there was no warning and the room span at 6am.. She called me at 8am because she felt cold from the sweat and was lying down without a blanket on the floor. I could feel the sensations of knee crumbling dread engulfing me and I cant imagine how scared my mum would have been.\n\nI suggested I try the Epley manuevre which I have been somewhat practicsing for this day but she wasnt really convinced. She was too scared to move even 1cm let alone go all the way to the bed to get into position.\n\nHalf of the battle I realised is convincing the patient to try to get into position because for them, the price they have to pay for getting into position is another intensified session of room spinning. \n\nAfter managing to convince her to do it, I performed the EM and it felt like it worked. She had to vomit due to the \"price\" but felt ok afterwards. After 10 minutes, she moved her head again and it came with avengence. It felt like the sky was falling down around me. This is suppose to work? What is left that we can do? Did I do it wrong? How can I convince her to let me try again?\n\nWatching mum violently dry heave and then close her eyes in agony repeatedly for hours will haunt me for the rest of my life. \n\nI called an ambulance who took us to hospital but no one came to see her in her bed for like 4 hours. There is no threat to her life so I understand but god damn its soul destroying seeing her struggle and watching a bunch of nurses chat about non-work stuff around us and get annoyed when I ask for help.\n\nEventually, on my 5th Eply Manuerve, it was successful. Her spinning sensation stopped and the doc finally came to give her Stemitil and Fluids. This was at around 8pm if I recall correctly. We both just crashed into sleep until 11pm and got discharged.\n\nIn total, she was experiencing vertigo from 6am to 8pm - 14 hours. Not every minute was as intense. There were peaks but every moment was a moment she couldnt open her eyes. Every second was a battle for her.\n\nThat was yesterday. She seems fine today. Today I still feel this horrific sensation of dread all over my body. I constantly ask mum if shes ok. I panic seeing any discomfort on her face while she is sleeping. My body has this base level of anxiety, fear and sadness that wont go away. The world seems like a scary place and I feel scared to face it. Its fascinating to experience how much stress hormones can impact my outlook in life and thoughts.\n\nToday, I have repeatedly watched Epley Manuevre videos on youtube so becomes absolutely ingrained in me. Im going to watch the same videos every day for a while. The videos dont show the insane pressure youre dealing with when you need to do it. The mental cost of it failing and the resultant hesistancy of the sufferer. \n\nI really wish you all the very best.

I don\u2019t look to be mean-spirited in any.  I\u2019m just looking for other people who may have similar feeling as mine.   I\u2019m desperate so I thank you in advance.\n\nHi.  So I had flu-like symptoms back in January.  Mucus, fever, cough etc.  As I was getting over it I developed slight vertigo.  It would come and go for the next couple weeks.  Some days hardly noticeable (although I was starting to get really fatigued at the gym...odd).\n\nOkay. \n\nBut then in February, I developed ear fullness and facial tension.\n\nThat\u2019s when the vertigo came back.  And it came back stronger.  I eventually developed a heavy head with so much pressure that sometimes it felt like it was going to explode.\n\nIt got me lightheaded and sent me to urgent care.  \n\nI eventually was given a comprehensive blood panel which came out just fine (except for a tad bit low on Vitamin D and a tad bit high cholesterol.\n\nThe doctor said it could be possible I have a middle/inner ear infection.  \n\nNow it\u2019s been over a month since these symptoms began.\n\nNo more vertigo.  Well at least not from my eyes...(when I close my eyes, I do sway a bit.  So there is still imbalance there?).  \n\nHowever I still have a heavy head and ear pressure/crackling! Like heavy head sensations.  The head pain moves around, sometimes feels like a wooden block is in front of my face or I\u2019m being squeezed from my temples.  \n\nI also feel most lightheaded when I lean forward or stand up too quickly.\n\nNow I\u2019ve had migraines growing up.  This feels different just cause I feel lightheaded and the pain and nausea are ever constant.\n\nOn top of that, I\u2019m beginning to have odd sensations in my body too...Burning hands when it\u2019s just a tad bit cold outside.  Throbbing fingers at random times.  And burning feet especially in the morning when it\u2019s coldest.  Also today for about an hour my legs were non-stop tingling and numb.  \n\nThere seems to be some peripheral neuropathy going on here but I\u2019m not sure why.  Can an ear or possible sinus infection cause the nerves in my body to go haywire?? \n\nOr is this something else? Anxiety? MS? Fibromyalgia? \n\nI also have aches developing in random places in my body  (mainly in chest/ribs \u2014 throbbing sensations in back between shoulders in the morning) + developing shortness of breath with heart palpitations.  Almost like I can\u2019t take a full breath.  Maybe 70%.\n\nI have been googling my symptoms everyday.  And I did have a few panic attacks early on.  But as of now, I\u2019m not even anxious.  Just frustrated.  Is it possible for panic attacks from before cause me to have physical symptoms subconsciously to this day?? \n\n\n29 year old male\n5\u20197\n175 lbs\n\nI was healthy leading up to the new year.  Now I\u2019m ill and every little thing that hurts my body instantly sends me to google.  \n\nIt sucks.  \n\nOn a side note: Loud sounds do make me lightheaded.  Almost as if any startling sounds brings pressure to my sensitivity.  Could be an ear issue? \n\nAlso, I did score high blood pressure the last few doctors visits.

He looked me over asked me questions about pain and what was going on I gave him the backstory, this took about 10 mins. He then said we\u2019re gonna fix you up I need you to go see this person (an audiologist). I didn\u2019t even know they existed but this lady tested my hearing to make sure I had to hearing loss which could indicate a bigger issue, then she took me to an adjustment table and through testing by moving my head and asking me when it was induced she was able to pinpoint in which ear  canal and where in said canal the crystals may be. She made me do a few very specific head movements and then she said (here is the important part I believe) Do Not move your head for at lest 24 hrs and if you can manage it 48. Apparently when your crystals are loose even if they place them back where they need to be they remain loose for some time so the least amount of movement is necessary for them to \u201csettle in their home\u201d. Now this fixed my issue for about two weeks and then I had a milder episode, I went back to her and explained she explained that just like crystals \u201csettle in their home\u201d they also could settle in the wrong place so sometimes it takes time for all of them loosen up from where they shouldn\u2019t be and this causes the milder episodes the amount of misplaced crystals is less therefore the episode is milder. This made sense she did another specific head movement or crystal adjustment and same procedure no head movement for 24 hrs preferably 48 including while you sleep so I slept upright for two nights. Now I\u2019m 3 months out and no more reoccurring episodes, I\u2019m very happy with my results and I am thankful that I was able to find someone that is very knowledgeable about this issue.

I went to the doctor and he said it sounded like bppv, so he told me i should see an ear doctor so he could do the epley maneuver. There where 2 months waiting time so I just searched youtube and did it myself, so i guess i didn't really got confirmed 100% if it was that. but after about 2 weeks and doing the maneuver everday it was completely gone!\n\nNow a couple of months later i got it again on the same ear, did the maneuvers, and again gone after a couple of weeks. \n\nThen all hell broke loose at the end of last year, and it came with blasting force 300% worse than the other times on the other ear. I tried to do the maneuvers but it was so horrible i screamed and had to stop, and vomited the rest of the day everytime i moved my head an inch. I got really scared because it was so much worse than the other times, but i really didn't dare to move so I didn't see a doctor. after about a week or two it only came when my head where below my neck, so regular head movements where fine thank god. after about three-four weeks it was also gone.\n\nBut on the 5th of January i woke up in the middle of the night, heart pounding and room spinning again, and i could not sleep again because my whole body had some kind of anxiety attack from this and woke me up every time i was almost asleep. After this I have gotten anxiety about sleeping as it always happened when i moved from one side to the other in bed, and it feels like it is not completely gone, but it feels different than the other times because it only really happens when i lay down. During the day i just feel kind of off but not dizzy in the same way, and I have been sleeping on like 4 pillows and a neck pillow to not lay my head down and not move around (which i normally tend to do a lot). But a couple times a week it feel like my head is heavy, feels off, and making my heart pound and that shock through my body when i move the slightest while in bed. I am so scared of sleeping but I can't tell that a specific ear is affected because it just feels like my whole head. And again it's really only when i'm lying down, during the day it's just that small off feeling that I guess i have gotten used to know.\n\nBut it's now almost been three months with these symptoms and I am freaking out, does it sound like normal residual dizziness after the last really horrible episode of \"real\" bppv or does it sound like something else?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 409, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Three months of hell, but is it BPPV?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/fmnqjm/three_months_of_hell_but_is_it_bppv/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ragubear", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2vn2bzko", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1584164396, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/fidqux/is_this_bppv/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fidqux", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/fidqux/is_this_bppv/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1584164397, "score": 1, "selftext": "So lately for about a week I started to get the slight vertigo feeling and now it just seems to get worse everytime I feel conscious of it.

Over the past few months, I\u2019ve been dealing with some hamstring pain/tightness. I decided to go get some treatment from a family friend who is a chiropractor. \n\nLast Monday was the first day of treatment. He explained to me that everything connects back to the brain and we are going to work on some stuff to help that hamstring. Some of the things that were done during the treatment were a sitting neck adjustment, and some rapid eye movements. Since that day, I\u2019ve been dealing with some dizziness/lightheadedness. It\u2019s not severe but it\u2019s enough to bother me and really stress me out to the point where I feel like I\u2019m never going to get better and the stress also causes some shortness of breath. \n\nI have gotten many treatments and adjustments from chiropractors in the past. But is it possible that this neck adjustment caused me to feel this way? It\u2019s been well over a week.\n\nI\u2019ve still been going to work, and it does not bother me much during exercise. But when I\u2019m alone, or when I am at working looking at a computer, or sometimes when I\u2019m just standing talking to somebody it really does bother me.

At times I've felt the dizzy after effects for months.  But for the last 6 years it was basically gone.  Then last September I slept in an unusual position because of a bad cough keeping me awake.  I woke up with a terrible vertigo episode.  I had convinced myself that the vertigo I had before was all caused by anxiety, which I have also recovered from.  But nope, apparently it is an actual physical issue.  \n\nAfter the first spin I had a day of feeling on the verge of it happening again anytime I looked up or down, but after 2-3 days it went away.  Then I woke up with spinning again 6 weeks later, had a day of residual, then fine again for another 6 weeks and repeat.  \n\nAfter the most recent bout I've been afraid to sleep flat at all. I have returned to my old system of sleeping almost straight up and using a travel pillow to keep my neck straight.  Then yesterday after 2 weeks with no issues, I tilted my head back in a meeting and had a couple seconds of vertigo and still feel the after effects a day later.  \n\nMy issue is that I've never had a spin last more than 20-30 seconds and once it happens I've never had it happen again for at least a few days and usually weeks to months.  So I'm not sure if it is worth trying the Epley when the descriptions I have read sound terrifying and I don't want to give myself a panic attack or PTSD.  \n\nBut at the same time I don't want to have to keep sleeping upright, and having trouble getting to sleep out of the fear of waking up with vertigo in the morning.  It has always resolved with an Epley in the past, but I've never before had so many spinning episodes, with the frequency seeming to increase from every 6 weeks to every couple weeks now.  \n\nI really just don't know what to do. I've never had vertigo episodes last more than a few seconds and I have always been able to stop them simply by standing up, legs wide apart and staying mostly still for a minute or two.

All of the tests came back without issue.  We saw the GP, the cardiologist, the ENT, and 2 optometrists.  She went through an ultrasound, CT (or was it an MRI?), some kind of \"table test\", and some kind of torture called an \"ENG\" I think.  Other than a small prescription for her eyes, all tests came back with no issues.\n\nI suggest that if you suffer from headaches and dizziness and have reached dead ends with your medical professionals, try to do some experiments to see if the lighting around you is triggering your symptoms.  A lot of modern lighting, along with some device displays, will \"strobe\" at a level that usually is not perceived by the conscious mind.  Best we can tell, this was causing an overload of her visual cortex.\n\nWe're going to try some lenses tinted to help people with migraines next, since we found some similar reports of strobing sensitivity in those communities.

I hit my head back in July of 2020, recovered from the concussion just fine. I did have vertigo that I got treated with the Epley maneuver, and it worked great. I didn't let vertigo stop me tho while I lived with it for 2 months. I still worked out with it, I didn't care. But then slowly before I got it fixed, I noticed anxiety? It started creeping up on me until one day I had a full blown panic attack that made me disassociated and struggle with Derealization. I thought fixing the vertigo would help. But I'm still struggling with the Derealization. I don't get dizzy anymore though. I did have a bad bout again where it came back in my sleep in December, but I just had epley done again by my husband and it was gone again. \n\nI do still struggle though with Derealization, anxiety and the odd sensation that pops up. This sensation I can describe. I'll be sitting totally still, then I will get a jolt of anxiety in my head and then it will feel as if I'm falling for half a second, then my body will get really hot from the anxiety and weak. I usually go outside when this happens and then I'm totally fine. I've been to a vertigo specialist and she did a multitude of tests on me (the same lady that actually cured my vertigo) and she told me I don't have it anymore, it's not coming up at all, and suspects that it's just bad anxiety from trauma. Could this be all it is or is it still vertigo? I'm not dizzy. But I still have the other issues from before. I can't figure it out. I am seeing a natrupathic doctor too and she's helping me alot. I'm taking magnesium supplements now and they do help reduce the fog. I just don't know what is happening to me. And obviously after googling lingering vertigo, I'm very anxious now and freaking out.

I was the worst 24 hours of my life. I at uni, setting in the class when I noticed everything was spinning lightly, and I was sleepy at that time, so I thought of taking a nap in class during the break time. Little did I know, I soon as I tilted my head down and everything went spinning around endlessly, I ask classmates for help, the helped me go to the med's office. I throw up constantly, and they ordered a taxi to take me home, the spinning lasted all day and didn't stop so did the throwing up. I threw up that day until I felt that my organs are coming out. \n\nI couldn't move out of bed the next day and barely managed to force myself to get checked, the doc ruled out that there was nothing alarming and this is BPPV. He did the epley  maneuver, and asked me to keep my head steady, avoid sudden movements and sleep on my right side. He advised taking Magnesium supplements and some anti-nausea medicine. \n\n\nDays went by, I started noticing my head is feeling less and less light and floaty. Everything was back to normal. I started forgetting about it. \n\n4 Days ago, I woke up in the middle of the night. I found myself sleeping on my left side (I avoided doing that since the doc visit), no problem I told myself, I turned to sleep on my right side and BOOM, vertigo!\n\nIt was very mild lasted for half a minute, and although I was alarmed, I slept no more than a minute later.\n\nNext day and the following, and the next... for the next 4 days, up to this moment, my heads feels floaty. It is as if walls are moving but then they are not. So subtle I feel like it is not there, but it is.

And then another two weeks to get into a ENT\u2014 so altogether, from attack to ENT it was 3 weeks. The ENT said it must have been BPPV and checked my ears, then said come back in four weeks to check in but there\u2019s nothing to do but take some allergy meds and it will probably resolve by the follow-up.\n\nFour weeks comes and goes and while the spinning and vomiting are gone I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m on a tiny boat in the middle of a hurricane most of the day, nauseous all the time but forcing myself to eat. At the follow-up appointment my ears are checked again, a discussion of lingering symptoms, and I inquire about the Epley (after much Googling, probably like many of you). He says he can do it, and then proceeds to have me turn over while he taps on the back of that bone behind your ears on both sides, and has me look to one side for a minute, then the other side. Then sends me home with a list of \u201cnot-to-do\u2019s\u201d for following the Epley; in addition, he gives me a page that says to do the Brandt-Daroff with directions, but the page itself literally reads that it has a low success rate most of the time and includes a full explanation that the Brandt-Daroff is for when you don\u2019t know what canal is affected, but he saw with my second appointment (when he finally checked for nystagmus that I have been complaing about and still have\u2014 he never checked at the first appointment) that it was my left ear. \n\nI am trying my best to have faith in whatever treatment he is experienced with and I\u2019m no healthcare practitioner\u2014 but after looking up \u201call\u201d the different maneuvers I have NO clue what he did. Has anyone had someone tap on the bones behind their ears? Is this a variation of the Epley\u2014 or ANY of the maneuvers??\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I should get a second opinion. \n\nI have followed his directions to a \u201ct\u201d though... taking allergy meds and started doing the Brandt-Daroff, in hopes that there\u2019s a reason he would have me do those instead of at-home Epley?

somewhere without a rail to grip) i get extremely lightheaded to the point that i can\u2019t feel my body below my head really. it feels like my legs have gone numb and i can\u2019t walk properly. i have noticed i have lost coordination to some extent and, when it happens, i panic and make it worse. it\u2019s very alarming. it also seems to happen more often when i think about it rather than at random - it\u2019s a LOT better when i\u2019m with someone who\u2019s walking next to me.\n\nthe thing is, i rarely ever grab onto something to stabilize myself, even when it\u2019s right there. i\u2019ve questioned whether it\u2019s a panic symptom rather than actual vertigo, because it\u2019s never been accompanied by a feeling of the room spinning or nausea. it just feels like i\u2019ve lost my ability to move without feeling like i\u2019ll pass out if i take another step. \n\none thing i know triggers it badly is smoking weed, which i\u2019ve cut down on (unless i\u2019m inside for the day). even without it, i still sometimes experience this feeling. another issue that\u2019s accompanied it is extreme neck stiffness and pain when moving my head from side to side. even when i\u2019m propped up on pillows, the pain in the back of my neck and the headaches that often come with it are uncomfortable (though i wouldn\u2019t say excruciating or unbearable).\n\nother factors i think could contribute:\n-low iron (though i\u2019ve had this for a while and this started recently -

I had recently began sleeping on my right side for the first time in years for no particular reason, and I had slept on my left side pretty much every night up until that point. I believe this is could have triggered the first attack because when I woke up and whipped my head around to turn off my alarm which is on the left side of my bed, the room started spinning which I had never experienced before. For the next two days, I would feel extremely off balance and the spinning would occur whenever I laid down to sleep and woke up, and I would run to the bathroom with nausea. I have moderate to severe anxiety and this experienced caused me to have panic attacks whenever I tried to sleep, which would exacerbate the dizziness. \n\nThis spinning sensation eventually stopped, but I would still get dizzy whenever I laid down or tried to go to sleep. I still felt extremely off balance and had vertigo everyday to the point where I couldn't walk down a flight of stairs without having to hold onto the railing. I still had panic attacks almost every night and got only 4 hours a sleep a night if I was lucky. At this point I had no idea what BPPV was and that this was what I was experiencing, and attributed it to my anxiety disorder flaring up due to other stressors in my life that were occurring around this time. I restarted therapy, hoping that alleviating my anxiety would make it stop eventually. I now know that I was experiencing residual dizziness after the initial BPPV attack.\n\nAbout a month later, I came across this sub after some googling and wondered if maybe I had BPPV. I made an appointment with an ENT and he performed the Dix-Hallpike test on me, but I didn't get dizzy at all. I was referred to an audiologist, where I did hearing tests and a VNG/dizziness test. My hearing was normal but the VNG test showed that I was severely off balanced in my right ear. I then had an MRI done but the results didn't show anything out of the ordinary. My ENT told me that there wasn't anything he could diagnose me with, and that my anxiety was likely the culprit of the dizziness. \n\nBy this point, I had been living with residual dizziness everyday for so many weeks that I had accepted that it would be my \"new normal,\" and continued living my life trying to not stress about it too much. By the time I attended all the doctors appointments and received the MRI results, it had already been three months since the initial attack. I had gotten so used to the residual dizziness that I hadn't even realized that I no longer had it. I sometimes still felt a bit of vertigo when looking down for too long at my phone, but otherwise things had pretty much gotten back to normal. \n\nIt has now been about 4 months since my initial BPPV attack and I woke up this morning with another BPPV attack. I performed the Epley maneuver several times to my right ear and immediately the dizziness subsided. However, I am now dealing with residual dizziness again. It doesn't seem to be as bad as it was after my first BPPV attack, but it could get worse in the next few days since that seemed to happen the first time around. \n\nAlthough the residual dizziness can be hard to deal with, being optimistic and knowing that it will eventually go away, even if it takes time, definitely helps ease my anxiety. After my first BPPV and residual dizziness experience, I've learned that the stress I caused myself from worrying about it hurt my mental and physical health way more than the actual BPPV/dizziness itself. This time around, I don't feel as anxious about it because I know what is going on and I'm optimistic that things will get better, as it did the first time around.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1069, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My experience with BPPV, residual dizziness and anxiety", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/mvkqeh/my_experience_with_bppv_residual_dizziness_and/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "whiskeyriveroats", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8o0mo7o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1619009782, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/mvf34b/residual_dizziness_blues/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mvf34b", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/mvf34b/residual_dizziness_blues/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1619009793, "score": 1, "selftext": "In need of some moral support this morning.

I had been kind of afraid of it recurring, but the fact that it's actually happened now is causing me immense anxiety. \n\nAnd the weirdest thing is... it almost feels different from last time. It doesn't get triggered as easily -- it happened a couple of times when rolling onto my left side, but not always, and a few times when I sat up from a horizontal position. I can mostly move my head around when standing up, but I have had some lightheadedness all day. I tried the Epley maneuver a few times, and it didn't trigger the vertigo at all! \n\nI am at a complete loss now... does this sound like a recurrence?!

The abdominal pain is like cramps basically, which could be from BPPV if my body is off balance. I am getting checked out by a gastroenterologist in parallel, so I also had a barium swallow test today. Don\u2019t have the results yet but they might find nothing at all\n\nAfter today\u2019s therapy session, I feel particularly fatigued and a tiny bit lightheaded. The therapist mentioned that while I do feel good during the exercises and during the therapy, it\u2019s normal to feel pretty awful for a little while after.

I hope in a few weeks or so I can say that I'm back to normal.\n\nAnyway, back a few days to Sunday when this all began. I had a few small instances of dizziness Saturday night that I thought were weird but they were short and relatively mild. I woke up and went to get a shower. I turned the shower on and sat down next to it to let it warm up and was reading something on my tablet. Then, out of nowhere, I got incredibly dizzy. The room was spinning intensely. It came on in the span of seconds. I crawled to the bedroom, threw up several times, called my dad to come pick me up and take me to the ER.\n\nA few minutes later I stumbled out to the living room where I threw up a few more times and called an ambulance because I couldn't stand. I was sweating. The 911 operator made sure I could unlock the door and sent an ambulance. The paramedics helped me get dressed and helped me stumble out into the ambulance. They shot me up with Zofran I believe (anti-nausea medicine) and an IV as I was already feeling dehydrated from throwing up so much.\n\nThey dropped me off at the ER and they gave me some more anti-nausea medicine and a dose of meclizine which I would continue to take for several days until my first therapy appointment. Later on they would give me a few doses of Ativan/lorazepam as well as it was supposed to help with the motion sickness.\n\nThey did the Dix-Hallpike test to confirm nystagmus and then did a bunch of cardiovascular tests to confirm I didn't have a heart issue. I had electrodes all over me. I found that if I kept my eyes closed, I felt pretty decent. As soon as I opened my eyes and the room started moving around, I got pretty sick. My eyes seemed to trace out an oval shape that was oriented diagonally down and to the right.\n\nBy the end of the day I could at least take some pills and could drink a little bit of water. They had talked about releasing me as I was less dizzy by the end of the day but I could barely walk and asked to stay overnight.\n\nThe next morning I felt a bit better although turning from side to side gave me a huge amount of motion sickness. I had an MRI done which showed no brain issues which was good. They had me keep taking meclizine and by mid-morning I was able to walk/stumble around a bit. I ate breakfast and lunch and by early afternoon I could look at my phone for a few minutes at a time but would have to stop and close my eyes to help with the nausea.\n\nAbout 4pm they took my IVs out and released me and I went back to my parents place.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1025, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "3/28 - The Beginning of my (potential) BPPV issue", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/mi73wt/328_the_beginning_of_my_potential_bppv_issue/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ToughBagel88", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1z232w3v", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1617229165, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/mhh81r/331_first_visit_with_vestibular_therapist/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mhh81r", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/mhh81r/331_first_visit_with_vestibular_therapist/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1617229176, "score": 1, "selftext": "So today I went for my first appointment with the therapist and while she was nice and confirmed that I have an inner ear issue, she wasn't able to work out what was causing it.

The first time, I couldn't go to the doctor, but over the phone, I got the diagnose that it is \"probably\" BPPV (only symptoms were spinning sensations and nausea, caused by the constant spinning).  \nThe symptoms were quite extreme, I was tied to the bed and felt really nauseated, the spinning almost never really stopped. I couldn't sleep because of it. I did some of the maneuvers, and after 1,5 weeks, the symptoms just sort of faded away.   \nNow, a few months later, I just woke up feeling dizzy once again. I went to the doctor this time, again the diagnosis of \"probably\" BPPV. Even though I keep telling him that the dizziness occurs no matter the position - if I sit, walk, lie down... it's just there. Granted, it usually gets worse when I sit for a while, then get up to do something, and sit down again.

I just discovered this sub Sunday night after going to the ER when I got vertigo for the first time ever. It was really scary.\n\nI was putting a bookshelf together for a couple hours so I had my head at every angle imaginable. But it didn't hit then. It hit an hour or so later when I sat down to watch some TV and eat...and bam. Out of no where I got really dizzy and had an immediate panic attack. Laying on my back was when it was the absolute worst. I didn't have any balance problems though. It was probably stupid, but I drove myself to the ER.\n\nI went to the ER because I read (and watched) that BPPV episodes only last a few minutes or seconds and if that isn't the case something else is causing your vertigo. All in all I was dizzy for around 4 hours but it only stopped because I was give meds. They gave me some anti nausea meds and anti-dizzy meds and ordered a CT scan which came back unremarkable. That was it. No Epley maneuver, no examination by the doc, no anything. Just told me \"yeah sometimes crystals get loose and cause random vertigo.\"\n\nIt's 2 days later and I'm now having a pretty strong headache, and I almost never get headaches of any sort. Can't remember the last time I had one in fact. Still feel pretty off. Some seriously bad fatigue. Kind of feel like I'm hungover and didn't sleep well. Some residual dizziness is still going on but I can't find a position that makes me dizzy anymore. From what I've heard and read it doesn't really sound like BPPV. I mean the vertigo went away on its own and now I have some strange symptoms still lingering. Anyone have these symptoms days after?

How have you guys handle reoccurring experiences and how often are they? What are so of your guys experiences? What are some of your guys precautions when dealing with bppv? I\u2019m just trying to distract myself and find comfort.

The anxiety, hopelessness, fear-inducing, overall negative energy on here set me back in my recovery probably for months. \n\nI (20f) would get vertigo when I tilted my head downwards to eat sometimes, other times if I was laying on my bed looking at my phone, and then once I woke up to the spinning sensation and it was bad enough to make me throw up. I felt crappy until I went to a vestibular therapist and she treated my left ear, I left and felt good for about a week. Then I felt dizzy again, not vertigo, but enough for me to do the epley on myself and figure it out. This time it was in my right ear. I decided I didn't want to go back to the PT and just manage it on my own. That was a mistake! That month of trying to \"live with the dizziness\" I experienced every symptom in the book, even the ones that people on here will say are \"definitely not BPPV\". I had regular high pitched tinnitus, pulsatile tinnitus in my left ear, a few ear aches, headaches, dizzy sitting still, sleeping was a nightmare, and on top of that I run for my college's cross country team, so I was running 5-10 miles a day for this. Also the anxiety that came with all of it, the google searches to figure out what's wrong with me, it just makes everything worse. I went back to the ENT to make sure it wasn't anything else, he said no but forced me to go back to vestibular therapy. She treated my right ear, and since then I haven't had any more vertigo, tinnitus, etc. (this is a good time to add that if the epley eases symptoms then it's BPPV, but if it does nothing then cross it off the list) There was still residual dizziness, and my balance was horrible, so she gave me exercises for that. \n\nAt this point, I'm comparing it to the last time I had BPPV in my left ear, and how I felt better immediately and had no problems afterwards. So since the recovery was different this time, it created an anxiety problem for me that it would never get better, and I was permanently going to feel dizzy even though there weren't any more loose crystals in my ears. So I go on another google search (are you noticing a pattern emerging here? lol) and my anxiety skyrockets when I come across PPPD. My opinion is if you're scared about having PPPD, you probably already have it because it's literally a manifestation of your anxiety, in the form of something that's previously caused you distress. \n\nSo here's where my advice comes in, for BPPV: go to a doctor, and get referred to a vestibular physical therapist. Even if the doctor gives you some pamphlet to do the maneuvers on your own, insist on the therapist. After you're treated keep your head upright for 48 hours, even when you go to sleep keep your head propped up like you're balancing a book. \n\nfor PPPD: LOG OFF OF REDDIT, first of all. Take it from me the \"chronic dizziness\" posts are an anxiety attack waiting to happen, and they'll convince you that you're gonna feel dizzy for the rest of your life if you let them! You WON'T! Trust that. Let's say you're like me and have no more signs of vertigo but still feel dizzy. That means you're improving! Period. Keep doing exercises with your physical therapist, and let them help you. Then when you get home, what helped me was making an effort to go in the positions that I would previously avoid. I would never lay flat and stare at the ceiling, so I started doing it to prove to myself I was fine. I would never do stretches where I stared at the ground, so I started doing that too. I'd spent so long avoiding certain tasks to prevent vertigo that my body would go into a panic mode when I started doing them again. The more I did it, the less my body reacted. Closing your eyes and breathing, let your body feel all of the false senses of movement. Sometimes it would feel like I was on a rocking boat that was so violent I'd get nauseous, but slowly I built my tolerance until I didn't feel it anymore. The more you work with your physical therapist and stay present during the exercises, the more you will improve. It's true that sometimes it takes months to a year, but that's ok. Yes, PPPD is real dizziness and you're not crazy, but it's fed by your anxiety. Stop giving it fuel, and remind yourself you're improving everyday. \n\nAs previously stated, I'm not coming back on this subreddit again so I won't see any replies lol.

I was bed ridden for months and to this day I can't be bent over for more than a few seconds and I can't be on a step ladder without experiencing some slight wooshiness. \n\nNow when I was bed bound for those 4 or 5 months I ate a lot of take out. I have a son and rarely got a home cooked meal and he had to eat so take out was the go to. \n\nBecause of this I put on quite a bit of weight. So much so that it's pressing on a nerve in my leg that causes thigh to tingle and start to go numb (I have talked to my doctor about this and she agrees that's the issue). On top of that I can't be standing for very long other wise my lower back starts to ache and feels like its going to give out. \n\nI was already over weight to begin with so I am concerned for my health. \n\nSo my question is, does anyone have any BPPV friend exercise tips? I'm afraid of setting it off again so I don't want to be rolling around and jumping and all this stuff. I've never been very active so I know its best to start easy and slow. I don't have a lot of free time to get out and go for a walk some weeks I don't even have a spare 30 minutes until I go to bed.. so things I can do at home?

I felt a strange falling sensation in my head before the room started spinning. I was already very much stressed from my student teaching at the time and had never felt vertigo before, so I panicked and started crying because it was such a bizarre and nauseating experience. I figured it was a one-time thing... an anxiety attack from stress I'd been feeling at work.\n\nFast forward to today, about five months later. I am no longer a student teacher, and I have pretty much been relaxing at home while unemployed. I wake up this morning, turn to my right side and look up to grab my glasses, when I felt the strange falling sensation again. Now that I was familiar with this feeling, I knew what was coming next and closed my eyes immediately. Though my eyes were closed, I could feel the spinning sensation. It made me feel sick and nauseated. I slowly turned my face to face up while lying down and kept my eyes closed. I opened my eyes when I felt the spinning was slowing down in order to confirm that yes, the room was spinning just like 5 months ago.

I never got tested for COVID-19, though I doubt it was that since I still had my sense of smell and taste. Anyways, at first, I thought it was just because of the fever medicine I took to make myself feel better. However. It's been a stopped taking the meds and I still feel like I'm swaying back and forth. While I'm typing this, I'm thankfully not feeling it, but I did feel the sensation earlier today.\n\nThe last time I experienced this was over a year ago and, if I'm not mistaken, it also lasted a week or two then went away on its own. That wasn't the first time though. The first time I felt this sensation was around four to five years ago, though the sensation only lasted a minute or so and went away after I went outside and took a walk. Thankfully though, dizziness the only symptom I have. No puking, no eyesight problems, no migraines. At this point, I'm not even sure if it's vertigo, because I've went to a few doctors already and they also said that it's probably not that.\n\nLong story short, I just want to ask: Could it be triggered by computer posture? or maybe a vitamin deficiency?

I\u2019m really really hoping this is the right place.  Let me share a bit of background first!!\n\nSince the age of 17 (I am now 22) I\u2019ve been suffering from the RANDOMEST dizzy spells that have taken a huge toll on my life and i currently cannot work.  It has ruined two long term relationships.  I\u2019ve had every blood test known to man, ct scans, ekgs, and an mri when i was roughly 18.  No answers.  I eventually was able to make it to an ENT who said my sinuses were VERY inflamed and did an audio test to apparently check for inner ear problems but that\u2019s about it.  They said even the inflammation shouldn\u2019t cause it but the inflammation is chronic and will probably need to be eventually surgically removed. Presumably caused by allergies even though i scored low (1 or 2 on a 1-7 scale) on everything they tested for.  They referred me to a neurologist but it will be MONTHS before i can get seen.\n\nPlease tell me if my experiences sound familiar!!  I have a few triggers that i\u2019ve noticed which are drive thrus, driving (or being in a car in general tbh), storms, and sometimes video games.  Which sucks because video games are such a big part of my life.  But other than that, sometimes they just come literally out of nowhere like a clap!  I will be completely fine and then suddenly my whole world is spinning and i have to crawl to bed as soon as possible.  Sometimes they last just 30 seconds, sometimes they last 3 hours.  My world is spinning, i can\u2019t move my head, and i feel like i\u2019m on the verge of passing out!  All i can do is wait for it to pass.  My heart rate and blood pressure is always fine.  My anxiety DOES spike very high because of it but it is not the cause.  I\u2019m honestly at the end of my rope, it\u2019s so so so hard to live with.  I have trouble going to the grocery store with it, i feel hopeless.  I have no other symptoms when they happen.  \n\nYesterday i felt it coming a little bit, but managed to sleep.  However when i woke up this morning i literally could not walk and it felt worse than it ever has.  I was genuinely scared for my life.  I had my mother take me to the ER where they did a ct scan, ekg, and blood tests.  Sent me off with meclizine (which i still haven\u2019t tried because i\u2019m scared of feeling drowsy and more dizzy) and a \u201cidk, could be bppv or your period\u201d and that was it.  I was discharged today roughly 10 hours ago and am still struggling :/ have yours ever lasted this long??  Does meclizine really help?  Does this sound like bppv?

Truly appreciate it \n\nFirst week of august is when I first experienced what I believe is bppv or some type of vertigo. I have been a mess due to a back injury involving a few disc bulges in my lower back mentally and physically, mentally it has shaped me to something I can\u2019t believe. I was having a break down one morning  almost two months ago in tears mad and afraid due to my circumstances and how my current quality of life was being lived. You can say I was extremely depressed anxious and in pain due to this injury. After breaking down I hear my phone ring and immediately lift my body from  my bed.\n\nThat\u2019s when I first had a taste of whatever this may be I stood up in bed and immediately felt like I was falling back in bed  then the room was spinning and spinning fast. I call for help I\u2019m currently staying with my parents and was taken to the Er. They did blood work and a ct scan of my head I explained how I felt this severe dizziness keep in mind I\u2019ve experienced dizziness in the past due to anxiety but never like this. In the past the dizziness was more of a passing out feeling now this is far worse. While in the Er bed the room is spinning I  have no control whatsoever and if I lay flat I can feel myself sinking in/falling back fast. If I turn my head while laying down the room starts to spin, when I stood up the room will spin for a few seconds 10-20 secs. \n\nThe results came back negative on the ct and they sent me out with iron tablets, my iron was low. I was told to follow up with my primary but no real answer as to why this happened. \n\nA few weeks of dealing with the similar symptoms getting up from bed or getting up from a chair or sometimes sitting down in a chair I would feel the same issue the room will start to spin fast and aggressive or when I would stand up it would feel like if I was on a boat rocking back and fourth.\n\n\n\n\nI dealt with this issue for about 2-3 weeks and felt like the symptoms were getting better. They had lasted for about 3 weeks mostly the month of August yet the month of September I was clear from the symptoms. Suddenly middle of October I fall asleep with minor anxiety  yet I was excited due to a new mattress for my injured back. I wake up suddenly around 5am to use the restroom and bam\nI fall back into bed I could not control myself from staying up in bed. \n\n\nThe room is spinning even more aggressively then the first incident almost two months ago. I want to yell for help but I don\u2019t want to wake my family members up sadly I lay there in disbelief why would this come back as I\u2019m laying down flat I feel myself\nFalling back but I\u2019m in bed already so it\u2019s not making sense  now around 9 am my mother wakes up and I\u2019m in tears I\u2019m sure this is something here. I start to think of the ct scan that was done two months ago and a mri I had done back in late 2019 for dizziness and headaches/migraines  not the same type of dizziness but in a way similar just less extreme. I have had several ct scans and mri in the past and all come back negative I am lost here and what to do next.\n\nThe first day of this return I lay in bed depressed and desperate wondering why. The next following days I experience the same symptoms while laying in bed or turning my head in bed . Again it feels like if I\u2019m rolling back I could feel my eyes rolling back as I sink down in bed while laying flat  or when I turn to my right side the room would spin and spin fast. Now last night I experienced a severe headache almost around my neck and lower back of my head. My brain automatically thinks it\u2019s a brain aneurysm a blood clot of some sort and my time is coming to an end. The headache seems to come and go  yet when it comes it feels like my death is close by. \n\nCould this be a brain issue?  Brain aneurysm or something similar related my head or perhaps heart? But then again if it were serious in that sense it shouldn\u2019t come and go? If it was \n\n I\u2019ve never had this issue  in my life up until 2-3 months ago and now every time I get this I feel like I\u2019m drying", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1498, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Any help here, desperate", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/qefb71/any_help_here_desperate/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SomeonehelpfixmyOW", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_fp4tpice", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1634913684, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/qdidgw/drinking_with_bppv/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qdidgw", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/qdidgw/drinking_with_bppv/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1634913696, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve been having vertigo for about 5 days now.

I have not had an episode with the carousel feeling since July. But I do struggle with vertigo, it is so bad that I feel like I am falling backwards and that there are huge waves on a boat.\n\nI went to see a chiropractor that specializes in bbpv and dizziness. \nHe said that I have nystagmus when I am lying on my left side and when I\u2019m leaning forwards and that I most likely have an atypical bbpv, and that I am probably very dizzy because of my brain gives signal to my eyes that I am moving to the left (nystagmus) \nHe also said validated all of my symptoms and gives me exercises. For the first time I had hope \n\n\nToday I went to see an ENT doctor and he told me that I have to stop seeing the chiropractor because you should not do those sort of exercises unless you have an acute attack with carousel feeling, and that it also might make it more chronic and even worse because of over treating it.\nHe basically said that I was perfectly fine \n\nI have no idea who to trust or what to do.\nI think my country also may be a bit behind when it comes to knowledge of bppv", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1484, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I am devastated after appointment with ENT specialist", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/qb8xdb/i_am_devastated_after_appointment_with_ent/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SumVelvet", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_a0dyfrg4", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1634547068, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/qaiq4m/bppv_and_covid19/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qaiq4m", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/qaiq4m/bppv_and_covid19/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1634547078, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys, so I had BPPV January 2021, lasted roughly about one week, I was bed ridden and it pretty much traumatized me.

Spouse agrees to try and treat at home based on my schedule and the fact that our insurance is something of a barrier- we have it, it just costs upward of $200 some visits if they do the Epley twice (each time I had it come back before, they did it twice in a row, then held me for \u201cobservation\u201d).\n\nAny thoughts on going right to home treatment? And reasons with a mild relapse for still going straight to the doctor? It is the same side that I\u2019ve already been dealing with, so I am confident in what side to treat.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1465, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "At home v.

About 4 weeks ago I developed a sickness which caused dizziness, headache, lack of strength, and a little vomiting. At first I thought I had a cold so I just stayed home to rest, but a week later the dizziness still remained. I went to the emergency room and the doctor give me a CT scan for my brain, blood test, covid test , and etc. The all came back negative so the doctor said I might be too stressed so  just go back home to rest. It's been almost a month now, all the other symptoms have been cured except for the dizziness. This dizziness only occurs when I change in position, usually normal when I'm lying down and sitting. But when I'm standing up I feel really heavy in the head and light on the body. The dizzy feeling doesn't go away when I'm standing up unless I sit back down. The dizzy feeling isn't that significant, it just feels really uncomfortable and it gets worst if I start running.

But it got to a point when i had my lunch I can\u2019t eat anything, i feel so dizzy and nauseous. I have to use one hand to put on my head and try to eat something but I still end up vomiting it all. \nLong story short, i fainted at work, got into the ambulance, they did the X-Ray, MRI and finally they said i got BPPV.\nI do not know what is BPPV is so i look it up, it\u2019s been really hard every single day coming to work feeling like you\u2019re drunk, like your head is spinning. When i\u2019m back at home, if i lie down, my heart beats so much, i shake and feel so scared, probably anxiety attack. I\u2019m not sure which side of my ear is the cause because when i look left and right it\u2019s spinning exactly the same.\nThere\u2019s one time, I can\u2019t stand it anymore, i decided to run into the public toilet and vomit. Then I google, i found the Half Somersault Maneuver. I did it, in the last bathroom of the toilet so no one thinks that i\u2019m a creep trying to stare at the next toilet room but all i\u2019m trying is to get rid of it. It got better right away.\nWhat helps me is Half Somersault, I think whoever created this Maneuver is brilliant and she saved me. I did it so many times at work.\nSecond is Epley, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite helping.\nAfter I did quite 10 times with the Somersault Maneuver, i think Vertigo is quite gone, i think if it\u2019s gone why the \u201coff balance\u201d feeling still exists so i still did it again sometimes. I still can talk to my customers but the feeling of being on a boat, shaking nonstop whenever i\u2019m standing doing anything.\nAfter that one day, the residue feeling is all gone.

I have recently developed vertigo and am trying to figure out if it is possibly BPPV or something else causing it. I am 25, M, and generally healthy. No head trauma that would cause a crystal to become dislodged. No past ear infections (that I am aware of) either. I will try to outline my case in as little text as possible.\n\nAbout 1 week ago, I wake up at about 3am with horrible spinning. Every time I roll to the left, sit up, or stand too quickly the room spins at 100 mph. I get extremely nauseous and end up vomiting once. Pretty quickly, I can tell it's my left side as I am not experiencing the same vertigo when I roll to the right. I book an appointment to my general doctor that afternoon.\n\nI get to the doctor, and explain what has happened so far. He lies me back and turns my head to the right. No vertigo to speak of. Turn to the left, it comes on pretty hard and fast. He says that it is definitely my inner ear on the left side, but says it should resolve on its own in a few days. Advises that if it doesn't to call back to be referred to a PT to do the Epley maneuver. Perscribes Meclizine and sends me home.\n\nThe next few days I notice that it has slowly improved, but not completely. Took one Meclizine the day after they were perscribed, but didn't notice much of an effect so stopped taking them. Each day is gradual improvement, the spinning shifts to a general unsteadiness akin to a boat rocking back and forth. I am able to sleep more on my left side without difficulty.\n\nThe only kicker is this - about 3 days after the spinning started, I developed symptoms akin to a viral infection/sinusitis. Pressure right below and behind my eyes, stuffy nose and I can feel what seems to be sinus drainage down my throat. Now have a slight cough/chest congestion that is barely noticable. Took benadryl for a couple days until the sinus pressure resolved.\n\nThe rough timeline would be this to help with outline of symptoms:\n\n- early Mon. AM - violent spinning on left side, nausea, vomiting\n\n- Mon. PM - visit GP, confirmed left side inner ear issue. Perscribed Meclizine\n\n- Tue. AM/early PM - slight improvement, one Meclizine taken but no real improvement noticed\n\n- Wed/Thurs. - development of symptoms of sinusitis/viral infection, Benadryl taken every 6 hrs. until sinus pressure resolved\n\n- Fri/now - vertigo greatly improved but still present. More like a boat rocking/general unsteadiness unless I lie down on my left side extremely quickly, and even then the vertigo is not instant. It takes about 5-10 seconds to kick in, lasts about 30 seconds and then I feel fine.\n\nCould it still be BPPV?

Chiro suggested it would probably take 3-4 treatments over a few weeks. After a few treatments, I have none of the lingering mild symptoms I've had for several years and no recurrence so far. For first time in a few years, I've gone back to everything I'd put on hold including yoga!

The doctor sent me for a cat scan, which was normal, and prescribed meclizine. I tried the med but it didn't do anything for me, in fact I felt worse. I went back to the doctor, and he suggested I see an ENT.  I saw an ENT, who sent me for an MRI and several other tests. Everything came back fine. The tests occurred over a period of weeks, and by the time I had my final visit with him, the spells had gotten a lot better and were almost gone. To describe how it felt - especially at the beginning - I would say it felt like the inside of my head was spinning very briefly. The more it happened in a day, the more my head felt like it was stuffed with cotton and it was hard to concentrate. I did not get nauseous  or sick. By the time it started getting better, it felt more like the inside of my head was a tuning fork. No sound, but the best I can describe it is as if there was a silent vibration that only lasted a few seconds and got less and less as the episode ended. It's so hard to explain. I told my husband it was as if my head was a bell that was rung  - again no sound, no pain, just this weird sensation. Eventually it went away and I was fine.\n\nI had thought for sure I had BPPV, but after all was said and done the doctor wasn't completely sure, but said it was possible it was vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis, but my symptoms didn't all fit with either one. He said to come back if it got worse or came back.\n\nSince then, it has come back a few times, but never lasting more than a couple of weeks and never getting as bad as that first time. It would feel more like the tail end of whatever I had before - just that weird \"tuning fork\" sensation rather than any real dizziness. I haven't been back to the doctor because it went away so I didn't worry about it.\n\nThen, it came back again a few months ago. Again I figured it would go away, but it hasn't. Some days I hardly have an episode, and then some days it happens more often. And then a few weeks ago, a new symptom started along with it. When I get the weird episode, as it goes away, I feel a weird sensation in my left lower leg. I haven't been able to put into words what exactly it feels like. Almost like a flush? No pain, no cold or warmth, just this weird \"release\" kind of feeling? It's so hard to describe. Anyway, I know I have to see the doctor again, but I have been putting it off, which I know is SO not good. But I guess I'm worried that's it's something bad. Which I know, I need to find out one way or the other. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this?  Also, I am unsure as to whether to go back to the ENT or if a neurologist makes more sense.\n\nOne other thing to add - and I have NO idea if this is related. Over the last 2 years, my lower legs started bothering me - they had this weird sensation anytime I wasn't moving. I talked to both my cardiologist (I have an arrythmia) and my regular doctor about it, and both thought it was from not moving enough during the day (I sit a lot for my job). I started thinking maybe it was restless leg syndrome. About 3 months ago, I had my regular cardiology visit and bloodwork and the cardiologist   \n said I was very low in Vitamin D and prescribed a 3-month course of prescription vitamin D (you take one wafer once a week for 3 months). I only have one more wafer to go, and Just recently, I noticed that my legs are feeling better - not perfect, but not as weird. They still bother me when I fold them under myself, say while watching TV. It's like i can't keep them in any one position for too long.\n\nAnyway, if you've read all this, thank you so much.

Had vertigo for a few years now. It started after I quit taking an antidepressant cold turkey..one that is notorious for major, long-lasting withdrawals if not tapered properly. My symptoms are: when I'm standing or sitting I feel super spacey and out of it and every once in a while I get the spins and a little disoriented. I also have the constant feeling of rocking on a boat. When I lie down or have my head in any kind of reclined position the rocking and spinning become SO intense. It's like I'm on a boat violently rocking at sea and spinning in circles at the same time. It never changes until I stand up. This makes it so difficult to sleep and I feel more like I'm blacking out drunk every night rather than just falling asleep. It wakes me up during the night and I feel so tired and disoriented in the morning and awake still spinning and rocking.\n\nMy vestibular testing showed borderline abnormal for the sensory organization test. ECOG is normal, ABR normal, rotary chair abnormal due to reduced gain across all frequencies accompanied with asymmetry. VNG was abnormal due to presence of bilaterally reduced responses for caloric irrigations..suggestive of bilateral vestibular dysfunction which may be peripheral or central in nature but no nystagmus. \n\nI do not know what most of that means but neuro sent me to vestibular therapy. The therapist is having a hard time figuring out exactly what to treat as my symptoms present differently than what she's used to. She's trying different maneuvers for BPPV but as there's no nystagmus she doesn't have a guide to go by. My eyelids actually start violently twitching rather than my eyes moving. This is the same feeling I get when I lie down. My eyelids start twitching and my eyeballs feel like they're going crazy but they're not actually moving. And it doesn't feel like the room is spinning..it feels like I am rocking and spinning. Sometimes if I'm watching TV the whole TV will look like it's moving with the rocking sensation. \n\nBut the therapy makes me feel worse rather and I'm not getting any answers.  I am in a complete fog all the time, can't think straight, and just exhausted. I think I am going to lose my mind if this doesn't stop. It is having a severe impact on my mental health and I have literally wished for death just to make the violent spinning stop. \n\nNeuro now wants me to go back to ENT because I'm having ear pain/pressure that feels more like maybe the nerves are inflamed. She couldn't see well inside one ear cause there was a piece of wax. So I used ear drops and it just feels like it's irritating things more. My ears also seem to hurt more when I lie down.

Since 2019 I started to experience visual vertigo, as in feeling dizzy in large open spaces , for example at the airport,  large train stations , wide streets, certain floor patterns etc. But this summer in 2021 I started to all of a sudden get the same sensation when I'm on a moving vehicle, car and train especially, which in the past 6 years of feeling dizzy 24/7, has never happened before this summer of 2021. It does not matter where I sit, and does not matter if i drive or not, i start feeling dizzy , especially if i move my head. So i have to keep my head dead still looking ahead all the time which is very difficult if you are driving, even then I still feel dizzy. I especially feel dizzy when the vehicle starts picking up speed and watching everything go by fast, especially on the train. I have seen all kinds of specialist over the years from ENTs to neurologists, have done MRIs CTs , all normal. Have even seen ophthalmologist. All normal there aswell. I dont know what to do anymore. I cant go far from home anymore especially if it involves using transportation, whether it's a car or train or bus. I rely on walking everywhere now, and even that is troubling for me, i also feeling dizzy while walking, cant move my head around etc. I feel it's getting worse day by day. I will be seeing an ENT soon just in case. Also I should mention that taking stemetil (prochlorperazine) seems to prevent my symptoms somewhat at the moment, especially when I'm in motion (car or train). Otherwise I feel dizzy with it in mentioned situations. Still feel dizzy but not as much and as intense when taking stemetil. \n\nI hope someone can shed some light on this. Any suggestions?

There's so many great resources and I commend this community for helping each other out so much.\n\nI just wanted to reach out to hear a bit from your experiences as my doctor has not been very helpful in answering my questions.\n\nI had a few brief episodes of vertigo 3 days ago, each lasting a few minutes, and being a few minutes apart. By the 4th or 5th attack, it stuck around and the whole world has been spinning for me continuously for 3 days now. I saw an ENT doctor who said he can't find any inner ear infection, but prescribed me Serc for the symptoms. I haven't seen results yet.

Afterwards everything is wobbly. I tried to the half-sommersault and checked Dix-H, but nothing like the regular spinning - just kinda like the room is tipping or always just about to spin. I think I tried Sommersault at least 5 times but couldn\u2019t provoke an episode. This morning the feeling came back while looking slightly down - I made epley with my dad, and even did the BBQ-roll to rule out the crystals should be in the wrong canal. I get very uncomfortable/dizzy when sitting upright afterwards, but still no spinning, just intense pressure and that \u201calmost spinning\u201d sensation :( \n\nI visited my ENT and left an hour ago, we checked my canals and did the Epley - she said that there was slight movement with my right eye, but nothing that got worse after testing twice + Epley. So she said to come back in a week time if I still feel off, but we agreed that she probably got the crystals back in place - if they were ever out :( \n\nSo in conclusions I\u2019m very anxious and scared.  I\u2019ve also gotten checked late August, where they found no signs of nystagmus either - so I\u2019m beginning to think that I\u2019ve gone very paranoid and am mistaking the residual dizziness for a new episode. \n\nWith this in mind, is there anyone who has a similar experience? Will the room keep tilting when doing the Epley for you, even after it has successfully returned the crystals back to where they belong? Do you get these weird \u201crushes\u201d?

I noticed it shortly after I took an edible for the first time as I thought my dizziness was residual from the edible. After a few more episodes, I saw a doctor who prescribed me Meclizine and did some bloodwork (everything seemed to be ok with that). After that point, I never really had an episode again. \n\nA year later, I move into a new apartment and a couple of days later, the vertigo comes back and progressively gets worse. I've been living in this new apartment now since July 15th, and have needed to take Meclizine on 3 separate occasions. I try not to take it unless I feel nausea that I can't manage myself. Fed up with this feeling, I make an appointment with my doctor again, who refers me to a PT and a neurologist. I went to the PT who specializes in vestibular therapy, and she performed a set of tests which surprisingly did not make me feel dizzy at all -- all expect the one where she turned my head side to side really fast while i was sitting up. She determined that there are no issues with my crystals in my canals, but prescribed some homework. For homework, I have to do Brandt-Daroff exercises. She did not do the Epley maneuver on me because she determined that it wasn't necessary since there were no issues with the crystals. \n\nWhen we practiced them at PT, I felt fine afterwards. Now, a couple of days later, I've done them at home twice and I feel absolutely terrible. I feel bouts of nausea which normally I don't feel when I get vertigo, but now it feels constant. I have no appetite to eat and I haven't done the exercises since. I am scheduled to see the neurologist on Friday so part of me wants to stop doing the exercises until I see him (in case something else is wrong).\n\nI am also due to see a dentist in a couple weeks because I have TMJ (I'm also thinking this could be an issue as well that contributes to my vertigo).\n\nI guess I want to know, is this normal after PT, is it one of those \"it'll be worse before it gets better\" type deals, or is this just my life now?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1351, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Feel more dizziness / nausea after Brandt Daroff exercises?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/pdwvsd/feel_more_dizziness_nausea_after_brandt_daroff/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "macka654", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_55e1b", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1630114512, "crosspost_parent": "t3_pd0o49", "crosspost_parent_list": [{"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "approved_at_utc": null, "approved_by": null, "archived": false, "author": "macka654", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_55e1b", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "banned_at_utc": null, "banned_by": null, "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "category": null, "clicked": false, "content_categories": null, "contest_mode": false, "created": 1630114481.0, "created_utc": 1630114481.0, "discussion_type": null, "distinguished": null, "domain": "self.Menieres", "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "hidden": false, "hide_score": true, "id": "pd0o49", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "likes": null, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": null, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": null, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": null, "media_embed": {}, "media_only": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_pd0o49", "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 1, "num_reports": null, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/Menieres/comments/pd0o49/free_vestibular_rehab_program_for_those_suffering/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "dTNhD0FSkaGHB5vp_qSA9wSeOYbGxu5-V3hL3uFIofI", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/eBcdS2OkAWZqCoLLI2EfV4zvKxSpPT8wYvVKxYBpeDM.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b726a740aaeebf6df8cd4897969a8f54880a400e", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/eBcdS2OkAWZqCoLLI2EfV4zvKxSpPT8wYvVKxYBpeDM.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57100d90a341beda74304bbd70c7d8822eeb6c5f", "width": 216}], "source": {"height": 225, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/eBcdS2OkAWZqCoLLI2EfV4zvKxSpPT8wYvVKxYBpeDM.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=99723ff5294f8df72c23668a5b058e04421e3656", "width": 300}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "quarantine": false, "removal_reason": null, "removed_by": null, "removed_by_category": null, "report_reasons": null, "saved": false, "score": 1, "secure_media": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi Guys,\n\nI [recently asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Menieres/comments/pb9f4w/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_free_vestibular/) if people would be interested in a free vestibular rehab program, given that a lot of people don't know where to start and can't afford a physiotherapist.\n\nI've spent the afternoon putting it together.

I later realized that I only got vertigo when sleeping on both of my sides with my ears pressing on the pillow. Went to urgent care a few hours later and the doc diagnosed me with BPPV and said I had fluid in both of my ears (no idea how I got fluid in them, maybe from my dust allergy? I think he said the fluid was behind my eardrum but I don\u2019t exactly remember), but since I didn\u2019t have any signs of infection, he didn\u2019t prescribe me antibiotics. He instead prescribed me meclizine (which I haven\u2019t taken because I\u2019m scared it will give me extreme fatigue + tachycardia and also because, like I said before, I only get vertigo when I lay on my sides, so I thought I might as well just sleep straight on my back) along with otc Maximum Strength Mucus DM Extended Release Tablets from CVS, since according to him, my Eustachian tubes are probably clogged which is preventing the fluid from draining. I guess that theory makes sense because even though my ears don\u2019t feel clogged/full, they pop when I swallow. He also gave me a packet that had diagrams of how to do certain maneuvers (like the Epley maneuver) that I could do at home. \n\nHere are the main concerns that I have:\n\n1. How would this doc know that I have BPPV rather than vestibular neuritis or Meniere\u2019s? From what I\u2019ve read, people with BPPV don\u2019t have fluid in their ears but instead have a problem with the crystals in their ears, while people with Meniere\u2019s do have fluid in their ears. I\u2019m so confused lol\n2. How would this CVS version of Mucinex DM help get rid of the fluid in my ears? I am definitely not a doctor by any means, but after doing research, I couldn\u2019t find anything that supports this idea, especially since the description of the OTC product indicates that it is used mainly to alleviate coughing: \u201cThis cough suppressant and expectorant helps loosen phlegm, thins bronchial secretions to rid the bronchial passageways of bothersome mucus and makes coughs more productive. These extended-release tablets also provide 12 hour relief of cough due to minor throat and bronchial irritation\u201d\n3. Why didn\u2019t the urgent care doc perform the Epley maneuver on me? Most of the stuff I\u2019ve read from people who\u2019ve had BPPV is that when they went to a doc, they had the doc perform the Epley maneuver on them, and they later learned how to do it themselves. I would have no problem performing the maneuver if perhaps the urgent care doc performed it on me and showed me how to do it, but because this is my first time with BPPV, I am very reluctant and scared of performing it myself in case I make my vertigo worse.\n\nFor those who've had (or currently have) BPPV, what should I do with this vertigo and how can I potentially get rid of it?

There was a powerlifting meet being hosted at my college on April 1st, 2021 which was announced in October of 2020, so naturally I'm excited and want to get ready for the meet. I trained at least 2 hours a day for 5 days of every week except the final week. That was when the worst illness pretty much killed me.\n\nThe Attack: So a couple days before the sickness, me and my roommate wanted to grab something small to eat the night before his birthday at Dollar Tree (dumb idea, I know). The following evening I went out to have my roommate's birthday dinner at Texas Roadhouse where I had a 6 ounce sirloin (medium), mashed potatoes, and broccoli (important for later in the story). I hang out with a girl I was dating at the time and she spent the night and everything felt normal. Following morning (March 23rd, 2021), I suddenly wake up early already feeling off. It wasn't until I got up that I knew something was wrong. The room was spinning violently and I had a hard time making my way over to the bathroom to then heave and vomit into the toilet every hour for a day and a half. This was my first time feeling anything like this, but the vomiting felt almost forced to where when I couldn't vomit anymore I would dry heave for minutes at a time. In between the times of the excessive vomiting and dry heaving I was trying to figure out what I possibly could have had. At first, I thought it was bad food poisoning from either of those two places I ate at. I also thought of the probability that it was vertigo, even though I haven't had it before. After all the regurgitation ceased, I was stuck in bed for several days because the room wouldn't stop spinning and my balance was severely compromised. After about a week and a half, I was feeling better, and my roommate took me to the campus clinic to see if they could figure out what was wrong with me. The first doctor said it could possibly be food poisoning given the time frame of when I ate and when I got sick. At that point he just told me to wait it out and brushed me off. I went back again and the second doctor said that it was gastroenteritis which I knew was complete bogus because I have had a stomach bug before and that was nothing like it. Yet again I got brushed off. Third times a charm right? At the point of the third appointment visit, the spinning was gone, but still occasionally had balance issues.

The two days prior to yesterday's episode,I had been spinning a bit in my room because I could feel the sensation of being \"off\" in my mind. I was gauging how off I was, I felt like was on rough seas, I would walk or turn my head and everything would move up and down. Thinking that it was just minimal vertigo, I went about my day, still feeling \"off\" in my head. \n\nThroughout the yesterday, I was able to walk, no nausea, able to eat. With every change of direction I made with my head, things moved up and down but I was able to walk anywhere in the house. Then in the evening, the spins started, the actual vertigo sensation of things spinning and nausea and eventually the 4 hrs of vomiting had come. I rested in my reclining chair, with a trashcan next to me, and vomited everything out.\n\nThroughout those hours on my chair, I got a bit hot but I was mostly (very) cold, I had a tingling sensation all throughout my body(mouth, legs, hands, gums/teeth), my fingers became hard to move and to control, they became stiff but definitely not due to the cold I felt. Even while having a blanket over me, I was still freezing. I felt my abdomen(below the chest) start to feel stiff and it was heavy,but I could breathe in and out fine with my chest. \n\n\nThe spins were going from right to left, titling my head back and looking at the ceiling things were moving closer together and while looking at the ceiling, something I wasn't focusing on, outside my corner of my left eye, were moving to the right. I felt the tingling sensation on the back my head, I felt the tingling sensation make a 'U' shaped tingling sensation it made from the back of one ear to the top of the back of my head to the other back of the opposite ear, very weird and scary. \n\nI had trouble keeping down fluids.. Ginger tea, Gatorade and green tea with ginger.. I couldn't keep it down and vomited it all up. \n\nI decided to do the Half somersault exercise on my bed, but it did not lessen my vertigo, then I followed up with the epley maneuver and still no luck. After finishing the epley maneuver, my whole body got the tingling sensation and then I vomited and called it quits and headed to the ER. \n\nI was given fluids, meclizine(antivert) and something else for nausea(I think it started with an \"A\" and was hooked to my arm. My blood was drawn and so was a urine sample. \n\nThe Dr. attending me said this vertigo was not caused by dehydration, And that he wants me to get my crystals readjusted once every 6 months so it doesn't happen again. \n\nMy prescriptions are: meclizine(anti vert) 25mg oral tablet and ondansetron (Zofran ODT 4mg oral tablet, disintegrating). \n\nI vomited Gatorade twice last night after leaving the hospital. Today I still feel \"off\", walking wise is at a much slower pace and things still move. Shaking my head feels off as well. I'm sure if I did the half somersault or the epley maneuver I'd feel the spinning sensation. \n\nI do have tinnitus, in my right ear and it comes and goes in my left ear as well. My right jaw sometimes get stuck and then it pops, so it might be related to my tinnitus. \n\nMeclizine hasn't really worked for me in the past, I figure I'll still feel this residual for a while. I have no nausea this morning. \nI'm really bummed..ive had this for such a long time since I was a young teenager now I'm 26 and I still get it. My vertigo did go away for some years, but these last 4-5,6years it's been back. \n\nI figure I should see a ENT, maybe it's linked to my tinnitus, maybe it has to do with my jaw.. Eyes.. Ear crystals.. I'm not sure. \n\nAny advice? Where should I go from here? Any similar situations you've been in? \n\nTLDR: Went to ER last night, after 4 or so hours of vomiting, got the vertigo spins, did half somersault and epley maneuver to no success and called it quits and headed to the ER. I had tingling sensations throughout my body, trouble moving fingers at times, felt a 'U' shaped tingling sensation behind my head from ear to ear. I felt hot and then very cold. I had trouble keeping fluids down. Dr says he believes this wasn't caused by dehydration and it is instead something else. I was prescribed meclizine and Zofran. I think this is related to my ears, my tinnitus. I figure I need to see an ENT and find the cause to this, because it's terrible.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1277, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Another episode 26M.

So this is my story short...\n\nWhen I was a teen (like 12-13) I started having vertigo episodes. I would wake up one day with vertigo and couldn\u2019t get up at all for the whole day sometimes two day. I honestly loved it cause it meant no school and tv all day with no moving lol. Went to the doctors they told me it was probably from puberty. It disappeared when I was 17-18yo. A year ago I suddenly, literally out of no where developed a panic attack disorder. I started taking antidepressants which cause vertigo eeevery morning. I stopped them after a month cause they made me feel way worse. So since then I\u2019ve been having the occasional vertigo episode where I just randomly wake up with it. Or sometimes a panic attack would bring it one which I have no idea how it works. So I went to a neurologist and they did all vestibular tests but all was fine (I wasn\u2019t having a vertigo episode when they did the tests tho don\u2019t know if that counts). I have since realised that doing those head movements from YouTube to move the crystals really helps me and that the problem is always in my left ear. I still don\u2019t understand why it only happens to me sometimes and how can a panic attack cause it?

Genuinely thought the bed had somehow flipped over. Since then I've had that feeling lots and have managed to narrow it down to (generally) happening when I get up from a lying down position. Doctor was pretty clueless and said I may have vertigo and then kind of shrugged and offered me some travel sickness tablets.  \nAnyway, been reading up on it and I think I have BPPV. I tried the Dix-Hallpike test and it went absolutely crazy for my right ear. Then did the Epley a couple of times and whilst it stopped the lurching sensation when I got up off the bed (which was great!), I still had a light-headed feeling for the rest of the day. D-H test didn't give any wild sensations so thought I'd healed myself, apart from general light heatedness.  \nThing is, I went to bed last night (after a bit of wine) and when I woke up this morning, the full-on room-sliding-away sensation was back and the D-H was like before I did the Epley.\n\nSo, I would like to ask...\n\n  \n1. Is it usual for the Epley to sort the BPPV out but for it to return the next morning/ soon after? Am I doing it wrong?\n\n2. Is general light-headedness to be expected, I guess a bit like a cough after flu?\n\n3. Is it generally acceptable to have time off work for this?\n\n4. Could my bike ride have caused the BPPV?

It gets more severe when I am sitting down and more severe when I am lying down in bed. This has been happening all day long every single day for the past five months non stop. My doctor prescribed me Meclizine which I was hesitant to try at first because I typically have anxiety due to the side effects I have been reading online. I eventually gave in and took the Meclizine for about two nights in a row but wow did it make me feel like a literal ZOMBIE.

Can't really enjoy much, I dread going to bed and due to that my sleep has been suffering. Same with taking showers, etc.\n\nI've been already struggling with anxiety and depression for quite some time now and this has made me break down in tears a couple of times (yes, I'm that sensitive lol) because it triggers my anxiety even more which doesn't help the dizziness/unsteadiness.

She said she had the worst headache of her life (she doesn't even usually get headaches) and was dizzy. She was acting confused and mixing up words (\"Can you go get my purse under the car in the kitchen?\"). She also said she needed to put her cell phone in her purse but then grabbed the landline phone instead. Obviously we were extremely concerned that she could be having a stroke.\n\nShe also started feeling nauseous on the way to the hospital, and once she was there for a few hours, was complaining of chest pain. She was admitted to the hospital overnight for lots of tests and they determined she didn't have a stroke or heart attack. They gave her insulin because her blood sugar was really out of whack (she has been prediabetic for years). She was feeling good enough to be released yesterday (Monday).\n\nThey said her dizziness and nausea were caused by crystals in her ear. They're not sure about her chest pain and blood pressure but think it could have been caused by stress. I did some online research, and it looks like her vertigo, nausea, and confusion can be explained by BPPV, but what about the headache? I'm having trouble finding much info on that. The websites I found said BPPV isn't associated with headaches. My sister, a nurse practitioner, says it can cause headaches, but shouldn't cause severe ones. My grandma is used to high levels of pain because of her sciatica and doesn't usually even mention feeling pain most of the time, so I wouldn't think she was exaggerating.\n\nDo any of you get severe headaches from this condition?

I\u2019d get dizzy, sound would all of a sudden go into the distance and it was like I was underwater, then everything would go white and spinning my family started taking me to EMTs and after being thought to possible be diabetic, brain seizures or have a brain tumor, I was diagnosed with BPPV on my 12th birthday after he saw my eyes twitching during a dizzy spell, then released from the hospital after having my ear crystals repositioned and told it could come back sometimes or may not ever. \n\nThe white outs came back sometime after, I don\u2019t remember exactly but I\u2019d say less than a year, but then I wouldn\u2019t have one for months so we never went back to a doctor. In my high school/college days it got worse. The white outs became drop to the ground out of no where spells. Either that or I\u2019d throw up. These lasted for so long. Hours at times if I didn\u2019t pass out or throw up yet. These happened probably 4 times a month. \n\nI\u2019m currently almost 27 and still have my pass out spells but maybe only 10 a year now. They\u2019re all the same, I get dizzy and I know it\u2019s gonna get bad the second my hearing switched to me in a glass box, or underwater. Then I know I\u2019m passing out within seconds, or suffering absolute hell for hours. I had a giant pass out while walking into my apartment last year in the middle of the street, but this one one different. I felt like I had the best sleep of my life when I came to it and also peed myself. Of course I thought this was a seizure, got an EEG and mri, all normal. Not epileptic. \n\nEven though I\u2019m having less passing out spells, I\u2019m now having really really bad regular vertigo that can  last anywhere from an afternoon to a week long.

I wake up laying perfectly flat or on my side though just due to moving around in my sleep with no residual affects when I wake up.  You can get through this.  You will get through this.

So I went to a pt who preformed the maneuver and the test and absolutely NOTHING triggered my vertigo, went to an eye doctor and she said my eyes are healthy 20/20.

The problem is that now I feel I'm too anxious to even go in to see someone, because part of my issue seems to be visual vertigo, and I'm afraid that office buildings would make me pass out or something.\n\nI've had some unsteadiness for awhile, not super bad, but that feeling of not being quite balanced. Sometimes I'd get it if I stood too long in a store without moving, like at the checkout, but popping a mint would help me get through it. A little over a week ago, I rolled over in bed and got a vertigo spell. Everything was spinning, even with my eyes closed. I slept propped up which sort of helped, and the bad spinning was pretty much gone by morning. But ever since then, I've dealt with this weird off and on headache (feels almost like pressure behind or near my eye), and overall some balance issues. \n\nThe worst for me is that I now can't seem to go into a store without feeling like I'm going to pass out. I went into a new grocery store last week, and there was something about the lighting or something in the store that made me have to walk out after about 5 or 10 minutes. I've never had to do that before. Once I was outside, I started to feel better, and I was able to make the trip home. I went into a farmer's market the next day, and did okay, and I thought maybe it's just the fluorescent lighting. I tried wearing some Theraspecs into another grocery store, but although I didn't get as dizzy as I did at the initial grocery store, I still had to leave after a few minutes. Yesterday, I went to Bath and Body Works, which involved walking into a mall first. I did okay in the mall (normal slight-dizziness) but once I was in B&amp;BW, I had to leave within about a minute. The B&amp;BW was definitely brighter and more chaotic than the dimly lit mall, and I started feeling better once I left the store and went into the mall, and even better when I was outside. What happens is that it almost seems like everything around me is moving, or maybe I'm moving, I can't even explain it. It just feels like I can't focus on anything and like I'm going to black out or fall over or something. I've tried not really looking at things on shelves, tried not moving my head too much, tried focusing on something in the distance. I've tried Bonine to see if it helps with vertigo/motion sickness, Klonopin to see if it helps with anxiety, and Mucinex/ibuprofen to see if it helps with any eustachian tube issues or any kind of weird inflammation causing it. Nothing seems to help or prevent it.\n\nI have an appointment with an optometrist in a few weeks, and I know I need to make an appointment with a doctor. The problem is that I'm now TERRIFIED to go into any office building because I'm afraid that I'll just get really dizzy or disoriented or black out or something. I'm thinking about making an appointment with a vestibular rehab PT, but I'm afraid that even their office will trigger my symptoms. \n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this? Does anyone have any advice?

It was the first time I heard of it and I was shocked how difficult it was for me to follow her finger. She told me I have vertigo and gave me meclizine and that was it. I came home research about it and did that maneuver where you lay down and extend your head and nystagmus was present on both sides.

Below is an exact copy and paste. I hope this helps someone.\n\nHey guys. I had BPPV ~~last fall~~ in Fall 2019. It was completely debilitating in my case. The experience was very traumatic, and I lost much hope in my life at first. However, over the course of several months and many doctors visits, I began to learn a lot of useful information to understand, manage, and prevent it. I want to share this info. My heart goes out to all of you suffering. But I believe this can be managed and don't lose hope. Please take everything in this post with a grain of salt as I am not a professional. I would recommend seeing a professional.\n\nA little back ground: i had BPPV very severely. After a lot of struggle, I finally found a physical therapist trained specifically in vestibular disorders who was able to correct it. After this, I also had an appointment with an ENT. He specializes in dizziness, and also himself struggled with BPPV. I learned a few things from both of these resources, that I did not know before, that were invaluable to me. I hope this information might help somebody else, too.\n\n\n******************************************\n\n#What I learned from the ENT: Things to help prevent BPPV.\n\nMy ENT was amazing.\n\n**He told me to specifically avoid 3 things if I want to avoid BPPV: caffeine, high sodium, and nicotine. These can bloat the inner ear and cause the crystals to come loose. As in, one single sodium or caffeine spike can cause a BPPV episode.** (I think with nicotine actually it restricts flow of a blood vessel within your ear, I don't know the mechanism there). About high sodium he told me this: \"don't change your whole life up. But if you bite in to something and it's very salty, spit it out, and drink a lot of water\". In fairness, I did change my entire life up. I haven't had a drop of caffeine since he told me this, and I have not eaten over 1200mg of sodium even one day since. (I don't know what amount to use, and this might be obsessive, just explaining that I carefully regulate it.)\n\n**I want to provide some anecdotal evidence to support this**.\n\nFirst is myself. After my ENT told me this, I thought back to what had happened in my case. Now, I tended to eat the exact same thing every day with no variation. (I ate nutritional supplements for 100% of my nutrition, so it was very regimented). But **the night before I got BPPV badly, I had an entire frozen pizza and some popcorn.** I remember it distinctly because I actually thought I had food poisoning at first because of the pizza and even contacted the company. (Sorry company...) I had the foods that afternoon and evening and in the middle of the night I got BPPV...\n\nSecond piece of anecdotal evidence. I know someone else that struggled with BPPV. He was getting it about once a month. When my ENT shared this with me, I immediately shared the info with him and his parnter. When I did, I learned that they had already noticed a link to caffeine: apparently, he was occasionally drinking energy drinks (those drinks with tons of caffeine) to get through his night shifts, and they had started noticing a few months prior, that his BPPV kept happening the days after he was taking the energy drinks.\n\n**I wanted to recommend to all of you to simply cut caffeine entirely out of your diet (that can only benefit you anyway), and also to watch your sodium intakes. I sincerely hope this helps someone**.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n#What I learned from the physical therapist: General info about BPPV, habitual symptoms that can occur TEMPORARILY after it's cured, and exercises you can do to help manage them.\n\n\n1. **The inner ear has three canals (horizontal, posterior, and anterior). BPPV can occur (the crystals be loose) in any one of those 3 canals (though the majority occur in the posterior canal). The treatment/ maneuver to fix BPPV depends on which canal the crystals are in.** [See this doc to back this up.](https://www.earscience.org.au/sites/www.earscience.org.au/files/field/pdf/benign_paroxysmal_positional_vertigo_bppv.pdf) This is one reason why it might be useful to seek out a trained physical therapist who is trained in vestibular disorders, rather than trying to handle things on your own. Something else interesting: The nystagmus (those rapid eye movements that occur for some people when they're getting vertigo) actually help identify which canal the crystals are in, based on the direction the eyes move. This, I believe, is one reason the physical therapists advise you NOT to take an anti-motion sickness pill prior to treatment; it can limit the nystagmus and prevent proper diagnosis.\n\n2. **Even though you shouldn't take motion sickness pills prior to going in for treatment, you CAN take an antiemedic (pills which prevent nausea and vomiting, like reglan or zofran).** These pills are incredibly effective, believe me. It doesn't just prevent vomiting but prevents the sensation of nausea. [Here's another link which mentions taking an antiemedic as an acceptable thing to do: \"Use of an antiemetic prior to the maneuver may be helpful if nausea is anticipated. \"](https://www.dizziness-and-balance.com/disorders/bppv/bppv.html)\n\n3. **Once BPPV is resolved, you can still experience residual symptoms for a while (dizziness, unsteadiness, etc. not vertigo itself.) THIS IS TEMPORARY, DON'T LOSE HOPE.** For a layman like myself, they described as \"'this is like your brain re-adjusting to correct orientation\". (My neurologist also said this was a fine explanation so it is backed up by more than one professional.) **So if you've eliminated your BPPV, but are still getting lingering dizziness, don't worry or lose hope. These symptoms are TEMPORARY, EXPECTED, and pass on their own.**\n\n4. **There are habituation exercises you can do to lessen these residual symptoms once your BPPV is cured**, and make them vanish quicker. [Here is some general information on this if you are curious. Expand the article then ctrl+f for 'habituation exercises', it will explain about it](https://vestibular.org/understanding-vestibular-disorder/treatment/treatment-detail-page).\n\nIn case anyone is interested, [here is a comment I made with information about the habituation exercises I did, and scans of the pdf handouts I was given](https://old.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/iiftlu/i_want_to_share_what_i_learned_about_bppv_that/g39jhkk/). Please heed the warnings given at the top of the comment, such as, not doing this the day you get treated for BPPV, not doing them too quickly, and realizing that these particular exercises and instructions might have been tailored specifically to my situation...

I got my first vertigo attack 3 days ago. I was sleeping on my right side, and suddenly in my sleep I felt like spinning, then I opened my eyes and the room was spinning so fast. I went to ER, the doctor said I got BPPV and told me to go to ENT. After that I did some research about BPPV. I tried to do half somersault maneuver, but the moment I put my head upside-down it was spinning so hard and my body fell to the right immediately. It was so horrible that I decided to not do anything before going to ENT.\n\nSo yesterday I went to ENT. The doctor examined my eyes with goggles, that time when he turned my head 45\u00b0 to the right there was no nystagmus, but when turned to the left there was a bit of nystagmus and I felt dizzy a bit. So he said the problem is in my left ear. He told me to do maneuver like in the photo (sorry it's in Japanese) at home everyday.\n\nActually after going to ENT I was not really dizzy. Then before sleep last night I tried to do the maneuver. When doing sitting-lying down and facing downward-upward position I didn't feel any dizziness, when lying on my left side I felt a bit dizzy but it went away within 5 seconds. The problem is when I lied on my right side, everything started spinning hard. I couldn't maintain the position and my body just fell on my back. After I calmed down, I did Dix-Hallpike test to make sure but I didn't feel dizzy on both sides. Then I lied on my back without pillow and turned my head 90\u00b0 to the right, and the spinning started again. I got the after effect dizziness again even until now.\n\nI wonder which ear and which canal is actually affected. I want to do the maneuver but I'm so afraid of the spinning feeling and worried it might get worse. I will go back to my home country in about 1 month so I want to resolve this faster, but I can't find BPPV therapist here. I'm thinking to just wait it out, but I'm worried what might happen if I board a plane with this BPPV.  I need advice. Anyone here ever waited the vertigo to resolve itself? How long did it take?\n\n\\*sorry if my English is bad\n\n*Processing img mm9wul9a4sh61...*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 934, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Afraid to do the maneuvers myself, not sure which canal is affected", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/lkz7s4/afraid_to_do_the_maneuvers_myself_not_sure_which/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "yeahDOT", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8pn6wdnr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1613444027, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/lku116/questions_about_bppv/", "gildings": {}, "id": "lku116", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/lku116/questions_about_bppv/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1613445242, "score": 1, "selftext": "I asked around for what is going on and people are telling me I might have BPPV.

At first I thought it was just lack of sleep but now I'm more concerned. It's like not my entire body feels like it is moving. It Just feels like my head is in a... rocking chair and it seems to get more pronounced when night falls and I get tired. Also there is ringing in my ears constantly as well that of which can be drowned out easily though by external noises.. \n\nOther info: When I wake up, I don't feel the rocking as much until I actually decide to get up (I think I've gotten more lucid dreams since I got it which is a weird side bar) and I notice the spinning less if I actually move around. Some noises sometimes seem to make it worse a bit.. and I'm at a loss of what it is. I feel the effectscmost when I try to do my work and focus on my computer screen.\n\nThis never happened to me before until well, a few days ago. I think it's directly related to me starting my 2nd junior semester in college and the actions I took to handle the workload of 7 courses. Namely, I sat at my computer for 12hrs+ for 6 days in a row while wearing  headphones which mightve been too tight on a wack schedule. But I don't think this was caused by lack of sleep because I've slept 8-10hours the last 5 days and it kicks in very shortly as soon as I wake up and start \"thinking.\" I suspect it has to do with the headphones and my prolonged use of them.\n\nI would go to the doctor but one of my parents doesnt trust doctors and will tell me to drink more water. Medication has been lectured to me as posion my whole life so if I'm in for a long ass lecture in my face for 2hours/day if I even get a whiff. So... yea I'm turning to the wisdom of the crowds for help (reddit). do you all think this is a form or vertigo or is it something else? Will it go away on it's own?

I've been suffering from dizziness since January 11th, 2021. Long story short, don't really know what caused it, but I did have a CT scan with contrast (to make sure pulmonary embolisms were dissolved), and 6 hours later had intense dizziness with spinning clockwise. \n\nI tried to brush it off as being tired, but as soon as I tried going to bed I started vomiting and couldn't stop. 12 hours later, went to the ER.  They did bloodwork, another CT scan with no contrast, and a brain MRI. The only thing they found in the brain MRI was this: \n\nMinimal hyperintense foci in the white matter of the right corona radiata.\nThe appearance is nonspecific. This could represent minimal chronic microvascular disease. The history questions the possibility of multiple sclerosis and this could represent tiny foci of demyelination. Most often such minimal foci are idiopathic with no clinical correlate.\n\nHowever, that demyelination has been there since 2016 on a previous MRI. I used to suffer some wicked headaches, switched oral contraceptives and didn't have an issue since. I'm no longer on oral contraceptives due to them causing pulmonary embolisms (it's been a hell of a year for me).\n\nAnyway, ER diagnosed me with vertigo, suspicious of vestibular neuritis but said it was more likely was BPPV. Went to PT, she confirmed BPPV on my right, did the epley maneuver, and the spinning has gone away. PT suspected something is off with my right eye and I should pursue neurology. \n\nBut I have lingering dizziness with nausea. I'm living on scopolamine patches and Zofran.  I have some loud tinnitus in my ears, particularly on the right. Went to neurology, they did a round of bloodwork looking for autoimmune issues and all tests look okay. He referred me to ENT. They can't see me until March but I'm on a cancelation list. \n\nI'm at my wits end. I can't drive. Daily tasks are a real struggle. I have 2 kids doing school from home. I'm attempting to work from home. I'm trying to look for the positive, but I'm slowly sinking into a depression here. \n\nAnyone experience something similar?

An interesting observation was that immediately after the Epley maneuver I felt like a rush of refreshing cold in my effected ear (left). Similar to what you would get after allowing circulation to a arm/leg after it getting cut off for a time.\n\nInitial presentations were light sensitivity, blurry vision, nystagmus, and nausea (motion sickness), but no discernable dizziness just the nausea after the fact.

My first episode of vertigo happened two years ago after stepping off of a 3-day cruise where I had some sea sickness. I thought it was land sickness and rode it out for 3 weeks and it went away. I actually felt worse when sitting still and better if I were moving, on a car or even on a plane.\n\nThe second time I got it was over a year ago. I started feeling dizzy when I smelled some cleaning chemicals coming in from the apartment hallway. Again it lasted longer than the normal dizziness so I made an appointment with a nurse practitioner who did a test and me and saw nystagmus. He did the epley maneuver for me and told me I can do it myself at home once a day. My partner helped, and also saw nystagmus. Again it went away after three weeks.\n\nNow it's happening again, and it all started when I was staring at a slight downward angle. I thought I was low on iron. After a couple of episodes (that lasted longer than the 30 seconds folks on this sub say it lasts) over the course of a few days, the dizziness became consistent, similar to the last two times. I've done the epley maneuver several times now. I don't really feel dizzy during any of those positions as suggested in this [nice video](https://youtu.be/xTnV3m4bWDg). On the other hand, it actually helps with the dizziness a lot once I'm finished. But the dizziness slowly starts coming back after half an hour, even though I keep my head upright which theoretically should prevent the deposits from going back into the canal.\n\nMy question is, my dizziness seems to be more consistent (though I triggered a really bad episode when I laid on my right side once and feel more dizzy than not if I've been looking even slightly down at my laptop) and not the short bursts of time that's suggested here - does anyone else have similar experiences? Does the fact that I'm still feeling dizzy shortly afterward mean that I've done this wrong? Or is that expected?\n\nI'm really sad realizing that this will be life long and can happen this frequently. :(", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 894, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How often should you do the Epley Maneuver?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/l6oekz/how_often_should_you_do_the_epley_maneuver/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tauqeers", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_rzvu4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1611802710, "domain": "youtube.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/l6m89s/the_main_principles_of_christian_goodmans_method/", "gildings": {}, "id": "l6m89s", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "Great Reviews", "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/c/GreatReviews", "height": 200, "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gVtuac36pxM?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

The BPPV was gone by itself, but I had awful lingering dizziness for a month after (During August), and mild lingering dizziness for two months after that (September and October). At the beginning of November, I was finally happy that this awful thing is gone, but in mid-Nov, boom, it happened again in an early morning. This time, I had awful dizziness for a day, and after that, it was better. I was a PT and she did Epley on me. I had nystagmus on the right side (similar to my first BPPV), and the Epley fixed it. I saw the PT for a few more weeks (up to the end of Dec) to get rid of that very mild lingering dizziness and it was gone. Again I was happy, and today, boom, another one after \\~1 month of happiness. I am really tired of this game and I truly wish there was a surgery or something to get rid of it.

I'm sure, like me at the time, you're very confused about why you're so dizzy. I am 23, relatively fit with no previous health issues.\n\nI woke up one morning and looked over to my phone to check the time in bed. Instantly, I could tell things weren't normal. The room was spinning, my eyes were twitching as I looked around, my head felt incredibly light-headed. \nI tried leaving my bed to go the bathroom, thinking the dizzyness would go away - I was wrong. After a minute or two of feeling like the world was a vortex around me I *literally* crawled back to my bed.\n\nMy initial thoughts was maybe I had covid - I know dizzyness is a symptom of Covid so I stayed bed bound and isolated from my family and also did a covid test which came back negative. \n\nAfter a few days of nausea, I went to A&amp;E Hospital where I described my symptoms. One possible cause of dizzyness is meningitis - my doctor explained that if I was suffering from this my neck would be very stiff and I wouldn't be able press my chin against my chest by looking down. Fortunately, I didn't have this. \n\nMy doctor then believed that I was suffering from BPPV. He explained that this is not serious - I will recover. He gave me instructions for some exercises to do at home as well as prescribing me some tablets for the nausea - I was to only take them if I felt like I needed them. From doing some googling, I believe they're the type of pills women get for morning sickness. \n\nThe excercises he told me to do are called the Brandt-Daroff excercises. They weren't that affective for me, but maybe they will be for you: [Brandt-Daroff](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.swbh.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Brandt-Daroff-Exercises-ML3094.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj0k4zo96HuAhVRhlwKHWQXB1MQFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw2DasEK9RqD5Vqk8sLKHZ4d&amp;cshid=1610851120562)\n\nI did these for a few days. I must say I felt a lot better than I did on the first day I experienced BPPV, but days 2-8 were still 7/10 bad - with the first day being 10/10. \n\nFrom looking and moving head in various directions, I noticed the dizzyness was most prominent when I positioned my head in a looking \"down-right\" position. Following some googling, I discovered the Dix Hallpike test and the Epley Manouver.\n\nThe Dix Hallpike is supposed to help identify what side the BPPV is, and the Epley Manouver is the remedy.\n\n [Epley](https://youtu.be/9SLm76jQg3g)\n\nI repeated these instructions every night and morning and found some relief - I didn't suffer from nausea as much, but I still felt pretty off balance. \n\nApparently you can correct the crystal position but still suffer from \"residual dizzyness\" for some time afterwards - I believe this is what I was feeling at the time. \n\nThe excercise that worked best for me turned out to be - [this variant here](https://youtu.be/Wez9SZJ7ABs) I suggest you try it too.\n\nIt has currently been about 25 days of my BPPV experience, but now I feel *almost normal*\n\nI no longer feel dizzy, and my eyes don't twitch or anything.. but I still feel slightly off balance. \n\nI would recommend a few things; \nKeep your head horizontal, I noticed improvements once I stopped laying in bed all day. Sitting up watching TV or something. Early on, I felt motion sickness from watching TV and seeing things move - good head aches, but this subsided after a day or two.\nI have been taking Vitamin D supplements, apparently this is supposed to help? My experience would suggest yes. \n\nIf you have any questions, please ask me.. I'm not used to making long posts like this but I will respond to anything I receive. I'm not great at talking about myself lol.\n\nStay safe, stay well and please don't lose hope. I was worried I was going to live with this forever.. but I feel a lot better after a few weeks :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 883, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "M 23 - My BPPV story", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/kyxx17/m_23_my_bppv_story/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Hollypoodles", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3buq07qg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1610827659, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/kyqa4e/bppv_still_cured_weeks_later/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kyqa4e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/kyqa4e/bppv_still_cured_weeks_later/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "fiWBLKxA9BzUlQ4eEmHJmUDQOyq_aKXsQGTykRcyCG8", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/5Jp2zf9xEhPz5a9QvUl6_yu8MZ4-O4VL_o3a-RhxH6M.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab60cd332ddd8d68a71ad44413b8e71c88d7ae28", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/5Jp2zf9xEhPz5a9QvUl6_yu8MZ4-O4VL_o3a-RhxH6M.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc9d8881732b2bf77c96ac2f18530f4df8745066", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/5Jp2zf9xEhPz5a9QvUl6_yu8MZ4-O4VL_o3a-RhxH6M.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b90fbda8920ac0bd05ce98104d7d0b0d9b52089b", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/5Jp2zf9xEhPz5a9QvUl6_yu8MZ4-O4VL_o3a-RhxH6M.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a12ea31606ca2ea47b3ef5622525abf59e181d6c", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1610828061, "score": 1, "selftext": "So I had BPPV for 6 months everything I laid down and changed sides I would get it pretty intensely.

I have had BPPV (diagnosed by a doctor) for the last 9 years, started after a really bad sinus infection and seems to happen every few years around the same time of year too. I had a really bad episode though early October. Normally the vertigo only lasts a couple of seconds but this time was about 30 seconds and really nauseous with it and pretty much couldn't do a thing all day but sit in one position.  \n\nI forced myself to do the Eply with my husband and felt a lot better but it took a while to get back to almost normal. It's now January and I feel a  lot better but still having residual, and not all the time just sometimes.   Today I have that \"off\" feeling but normally if it happens it's in the evening- probably bc i know I have to go to bed and I get nervous. I find that I cant just roll over in bed anymore I have to sit up and then go on the other side.  I have not had another vertigo episode since October just feel like one could come on but i can stop it.  Does this happen to any of you.\n\nI can exercise, i can drive fine and do pretty much all things without issue. Just that turning over in bed. It also feels \"weird' is the only way i can describe it if im in a dark room like in the bathroom, shut the lights and then turn to go out the door- don't get the vertigo - just odd. \n\nAnyway, does anybody have exercises they can recommend to help move out of this phase of residual. Its driving me nuts!  And then I start to get anxiety about it and that doesnt help. \n\nI also noticed a couple of times over the holiday, after having a couple of glasses of wine I felt a bit dizzy. That never happened at all before! I read something that the alcohol could change the volume of fluid in your ear and could throw off that feeling.  Not sure how true that is but has anyone else ever experienced it?   \n\nSo I guess that's it, thanks for all the wonderful information you all share - and any suggestions for just daily exercises to try to move out of this residual would be much appreciated.\n\n  \nHealthy and Happy New Year to you all!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 847, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New here -any exercises for residual", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/kpqi97/new_here_any_exercises_for_residual/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "jerseykat15", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8txqh994", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1609675928, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/kpjmdg/dizziness/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kpjmdg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/kpjmdg/dizziness/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1609675939, "score": 1, "selftext": "Back again lol so this morning in my sleep I rolled onto my right side (which was the first trigger of my vertigo about a year ago) and felt dizzy, laid on my back and it subsided.

This guide is merely a starting place (i.e., not exhaustive). Consult your doctor or vestibular physiotherapist for information on your case. Information below can be updated as I receive feedback.

Within your vestibular system, there are two sets of structures that detect movement:\n\n* **Linear acceleration**\n   * Utricle: Horizontal acceleration (e.g., speeding up and slowing down in a car)\n   * Saccule: Vertical acceleration (e.g., going up and down in an elevator)\n* **Rotational acceleration**\n   * Lateral/horizontal semicircular canal: Acceleration along the transverse plane (e.g., shaking your head to say, \"No\")\n   * Anterior/superior semicircular canal: Acceleration along the sagittal plane (e.g., nodding your head to say, \"Yes\")\n   * Posterior semicircular canal: Acceleration along the coronal plane (e.g., tilting your head from side to side, touching your ears to your shoulders)\n\nThese inner-ear structures are filled with fluid and have hairs attached inside that move with the fluid. Depending on which and how much the hairs move, electrical signals are sent to your brain, telling it where you are spatially so that your brain can coordinate the muscles in your eyes and the rest of your body to keep you balanced. The following may mix imagery a bit, but these analogies (OP) might be helpful for imagining the hairs.\n\n* [Utricle and saccule](https://youtu.be/5iZAnn5HlVw?t=344): Grass at the bottom of a layer of jello, with little rocks on top of the jello to weight things down. When the fluid above the grass-jello-rock combination moves, it creates drag on the top of the combination structure and moves it around. At the bottom of this structure, the grass \"feels\" this structural movement. It send signals through its roots to a brain somewhere, telling it how much movement there was.\n* [Semicircular canals](https://youtu.be/uCRx5pr1n2I?t=162): The grass sits on a hill, with the hill covered by a teardrop-shaped gumdrop. When fluid around the hill-grass-gumdrop combination moves, the grass and gumdrop \"sway.\" The grass senses movement and sends signals through its roots to a brain somewhere, telling it how much movement there was.\n\nBPPV occurs when a rock (i.e., a calcium carbonate crystal) somehow breaks off from the jello in one or both of your [utricles](https://www.dizziness-and-balance.com/disorders/bppv/bppv.html) (i.e., on your left and/or right side) and moves into [one or more of the six semicircular canals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4280754/) you have (i.e., three in your left inner ear and three in your right inner ear).

I started noticing dizziness when I would lean forward or sideways, change head position etc. I did Epley as I\u2019ve done in the past but the residual has been really annoying and it keeps coming back. Last time was a few weeks ago and I determined that it was in my right ear with dix hallpike. Did Epley and improved, was feeling better, then today I was messing with a malfunctioning window (head tilted back looking up high) and then moments later guiding my toddler on the stairs (leaning forward over him) when I felt it kick in again. This time I did Dix hallpike and felt like it was on the LEFT side. I called my husband in and asked him to observe my eyes, there was some nystagmus on the left side only as I suspected. So it switched ears?\n\nPCP was not too interested. She said I do have fluid in my left ear but doesn\u2019t look infected. I can hear fluid click in both ears when I change my head position (ie lie down on one side, several seconds later \u201cclick\u201d goes the ear).\n\nI\u2019ve also been having mild pulsatile tinnitus in left ear intermittently at night, though it\u2019s been better lately (I had it for a few months in my 20\u2019s too and it went away on its own). \n\nI\u2019m a healthy 37yo woman with three kids, I do get migraines, I\u2019m under a lot of stress parenting during the pandemic. \n\nI am really anxious and upset about this honestly. So I could really use any words of support or comfort. Also does the nystagmus during dix hallpike indicate that it is indeed BPPV? I\u2019m clinging onto that because the last thing I need right now is to worry about something more serious. It is definitely positional, always brought on by a change in my head position. \n\nI plan to call an ENT on Monday but any advice... reassurance... anything is appreciated.

I woke up one morning and turned my head to the left and everything started spinning. It scared me to death cause I didn\u2019t know what was happening and I had to run to the washroom to throw up, tumbling along the way.\n\nMy parents took me to the ER and sounds like it\u2019s common based on other threads but the doctors don\u2019t really know what to do with it. They just told me to go home and rest, and it took about a week for it to go away. At that time, I didn\u2019t know anything about it - whether it was head movement related or ear related, or even which side it was.\n\nAbout a year later, it happened again. This time I noticed I can lie down on my left side but not on my right side. Tried to do a manuever I found - didn\u2019t work and was just throwing up so I stopped. Took about 4 days for it to go away.\n\nTwo months ago, I had my third episode - always in the same way (moving my head after I wake up). Again, I waited it out. Now I can definitely better manage it. I can\u2019t look up too high (like when you\u2019re trying to get the last drop of water in a cup), looking down is alright, can\u2019t lie on my right side and I need more pillows to prop my head higher. \n\nOne week later, I got it again. This was a first back-to-back episode for me so I decided to go see a specialist. I went to see a physiotherapist that specialized in BPPV. She used an eye camera to monitor my eye movements and they were moving horizontally, so she decided the BBQ Roll was best for me. \n\nHere\u2019s the part that I don\u2019t find in a lot of threads. How the heck do you guys do these manuevers? The anxiety it gives me in anticipating the dizziness to come, the nausea, the feeling of vomitting and really vomitting... I honestly can\u2019t handle it. It\u2019s not anything I would describe as painful but just feeling like absolute sh*t. Everyone\u2019s threads just casually go over how the manuevers helped them but I\u2019m struggling to even doing it. The specialist wanted me to do it a second time and I said I literally can\u2019t and we stopped. My brother had to pick me up because I was feeling God awful and since then, I still have it (2 months now).\n\nIt gets better, like I\u2019m able to very slowly lie down on my right side, but then I do the wrong movement and it comes back. Right now it\u2019s a bit better, but I have this constant physical feeling in my head that I can\u2019t describe where at any moment, if I make a certain head move, the vertigo will come back. I can do most day-to-day to tasks but I have better and worse days and it\u2019s not going away. Today, I\u2019m feeling extra dizzy.\n\nDo I really have to do the manuever this time to make it fully go away? How was it for you? How do you manage to do the manuevers?\n\nThanks everyone.\n\nTLDR; Got BPPV about once a year lasting &lt;1 week but this fourth time it hasn\u2019t gone away for 2 months now.

Was curious if the long time members have noticed an increase of people seeking help on here since the quarantine began.  I found this subreddit when my mom experienced her first episodes in April and Just so happens that I have a friend who started to experience episodes around the same time.  Both complained of neck pain and tightness which would accompany the symptoms.  I wondered if the being stuck inside for long periods on time accompanied with bad posture of neck and back(working from home on laptop and cellphone use) for a majority of the day could be contributing.

The doctor did and taught me the Epley maneuver and relieved my symptoms for the moment being, but I still get \\~5s vertigo whenever I lie down and get up in the morning. I also slept in the 45 degree position that some sources recommended, because lying on one side flat = instant vertigo. I plan on seeing my family doctor ASAP to discuss next steps and possibly PT but this condition is giving me so much anxiety right now and I want to hear your long-term experiences. \n\nI'm very worried about how this will affect my studies (ironically, I'm a 2nd year medical student, and ironically, BPPV was never taught in our neurology block), whether I can hold a future practice, and drive. I've read a lot of posts where you guys were so supportive and gave amazing advice, but I keep seeing that stress is a trigger, and unfortunately stress is the name of medical school and probably for the rest of my life.\n\nI know I sound like I'm blowing things out of proportion right now, but it's very hard to focus with this background dizziness and fear of triggering the vertigo with the slightest movement of my head (even such as shaking it). My final is in two weeks and instead I'm sitting in front of my computer feeling guilty because I spent my study day in the ER instead of staying on top of school and working towards being a good doctor.\n\nAny words/advice would be appreciated. Nobody has ever had this in my family and this is so different from a disease that I can touch/see and I feel very scared and alone. Thank you to whoever is reading this post.

They put me on an anti-inflammatory called diclofenac. I handled post surgery and the medicine well, at least from what I thought.\n\nLast Friday, I experienced ringing in my ears, a skin crawling sensation about my scalp, and this weird vertigo motion sickness feeling. It didn't last that long, so I just shrugged it off. Until Saturday. And it hit me hard. Like, I barely got off the couch, every turn of my head made me nauseas, and I almost threw up.\n\nIt last through the weekend. Couple days ago Monday, I called my surgeon. He said he expects it's a side effect of the diclofenac. He said it was important for me to be on it until Friday, but on Friday, he wanted me to quit.\n\nWell, Tuesday came and that weird motion sickness was worst than ever. Here's the thing though, when I'm up and active and moving around / exercising, I feel mostly normal. It's only when I'm sitting (like at work), or lying down on the couch, that it gets real bad. And when it gets real bad, I get super tired. \n\nI told my surgery it's worse now than ever, and he told me to get off of them immediately and let me know how I feel after the weekend. So I went off the pills Tuesday afternoon was my last pill. Which means I've been off of them for 2 days. He told me my symptoms should clear up by the end of the week, unless it was something different than the medicine he gave me.\n\nWell, yesterday wasn't too bad, but today was A LOT worst. I actually went to Urgent Care because I thought I terrified I was having a stroke or something. I was so dizzy, motion sick, nausea. \n\nThe urgent care doctor, who really had no equipment to diagnose something neurological, said that, \"On paper, you look fine. It's probably an inner ear issue, cause by your the diclofenac. I'll give you some motion sickness medicine, but if it gets worse go into the actual ER where they have the equipment to test you out more.\" They want me to call them / see my primary on Monday in any case.\n\nSo I just took a pill a couple hours ago. And it's helping a little bit? I guess? It's not as bad as this morning. But I'm SO tired. Like dealing with the dizzies, and the worry about the dizzies, is just wiping me out and I just want to sleep constantly.\n\nHas anyone gone through this before? Could it actually be my medicine? This was such a sudden onset, and it last like, ALL DAY, varying from \"eh, it sucks\" to \"OMG I think my brain is spinning around.\"", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 774, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Vertigo?

I also get severe headaches, head heaviness and tingling in my face and tongue. \n\nMy question is - now what? Unfortunately all the specialists have told me that this isn't their area of expertise, but haven't advised what to do next.

I read this page often so I thought I would come here to share my own experiences with dizziness and vertigo. I am a 23 y/o female.\n\n4 years ago, I randomly got extremely dizzy one afternoon. The dizziness was such a weird feeling that it came with a huge bout of anxiety and nausea. A week and a half later, I was very lethargic, couldn't get out of bed or eat or anything. The dizziness persisted. It took a few months before my doctor tested me and told me I had the Epstein Barr virus which most likely affected my inner ear. During this time I also had severe headaches. Eventually after many months the dizziness started to fade, but it was like a bit of it was always in the background at times. In 2019, this happened again. I randomly got dizzy one day at work while sitting. It was like everything was spinning around me and the same bout of anxiety and nausea took over. This time, I ended up in the ER where I was told it was vertigo again but was negative to all the BPPV maneuvers they did. I went to the ER two more time in the following two weeks because it wouldn't go away and I also had some blurred vision/visual disturbances. I saw an ENT that ruled out any ear infection and an audiologist who ruled out any hearing problems and also said it's a \"vestibular weakness\", not really vertigo, but my balance is just weak and I need to move my eyes more. This period of dizziness was the worst. Not only was everything spinning at all hours no matter what position is was in but also some sort of sinking feeling was happening. Like the first time, eventually it got somewhat better but still always there in the background.\n\nNow, the last 6 months in the last covid lockdown have been brutal. More specifically, in the last 2 months, my dizziness and headaches have gotten much much worse. I also have always had some degree of neck pain, even in the periods of dizziness before, (I assume associated with poor posture) but now it has also gotten worse. Not only does my neck hurt but my shoulders, and the pain radiates to the back of my head. Last week, I went to work and as soon as I got out of my car I was hit with an extremely painful headache and this sharp dizziness when I would move my head. I couldn't even stand or walk. I couldn't move my head up/down or side to side. Every time I would take a step, it felt as though I was floating or walking on something wobbly. Every step seemed to radiate some pain to my head. Doctor said it was either a complex migraine or tension headache, but referred me to a neurologist.\n\nI have had 2 head CT scans and a head and ear MRI done which have all come back clean as well as many blood tests.

She also seems to have pretty poor balance.  \n\nShe says that the nausea is much more intense than the vertigo, but has issues with both, and has lost about 15-20 lbs in the last six months or so due to how this has impacted her appetite.  She\u2019s had these issues for at least 4 years.  She is very scared of the doctor but we are talking a lot and preparing to go this fall.

Sorry in advance for the long back-story...\n\nBeen dealing with what I suspected was BPPV for at least 5 years now, but was stubborn/scared and didn't seek treatment. \n\nI'm 35 now, but have a history of ear infections as a child, hearing loss in the same ear (left) - and in my senior year of High School had a bout of vertigo that lasted two months, which was later diagnosed by a neurologist as having been caused by overuse of an antibiotic (the family doctor prescribed me Doxycycline to clear up my acne, which I took several times a day for months). When I stopped the antibiotic, the vertigo cleared up and I was fine for a long time after. Not sure if any of this is related. \n\nIn the last five years or more - if my head tilts back too far in bed, I'll immediately get intense world spinning vertigo where I can't focus my eyes for roughly 15-30 seconds before it calms down and stops. Same thing would happen when getting my hair washed for a haircut. Ended up just propping my head up when I sleep, and would warn the hair stylist to ensure my head held upright when washing. When I did get an attack when tilting my head back, it would be insane for 30 seconds, but would clear up and wouldn't linger. \n\nFinally saw an ENT this week who diagnosed BPPV and gave me the Epley Maneuver. I was pretty terrified. Seems my right ear is the issue, but the actual vertigo the Epley Maneuver triggered only lasted around 5-10 seconds and was rather mild. Left side was nothing, and back up to sitting position was nothing. It wasn't that bad. \n\nThat night, I slept propped up at a 45 degree angle and avoided sleeping on my side. The next night, I tried my left side (non-affected side), but couldn't escape the mental anxiety and slept horribly. Basically all this week I've felt 'off' and uneasy. It almost feels like residual dizziness as other have mentioned, which has never happened to me previously. \n\nTomorrow, I'm leaving on a two week road-trip with my girlfriend (Airbnb's and camping). A few times in the past, I've had what felt like a 'falling' sensation take place when trying to sleep in a tent. It might have had something to do with sleeping on a slight incline, since it's tough to get a perfectly level surface when camping. It sounds crazy, but it felt like I was slipping off the edge of the earth. \n\nIronically, last summer we went camping for one night and although I was scared, I had no issue sleeping and didn't get the 'falling' sensation. \n\nJust wanted to see if anyone else has experienced issues when traveling, and more specifically sleeping on the ground in a tent. For now, my plan is to take two pillows and prop my head up, and drink lots of water. I'm also considering taking Meclizine with just in case. \n\nAny advice?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1161, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Traveling/camping with BPPV", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/ntcotg/travelingcamping_with_bppv/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "zapskimmer1992", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_88vpjif6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1622943268, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/ntakeh/when_does_your_residual_dizziness_occur/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ntakeh", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/ntakeh/when_does_your_residual_dizziness_occur/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1622943278, "score": 1, "selftext": "Curious if there\u2019s a pattern among people.

(literally this is my first Reddit post)\n\nI was diagnosed with BPPV about 8 years ago. It sounds like mine maybe presents a little differently than most of the people here though?\n\nMine feels floaty - like when you\u2019ve been on a boat for a while, and you get off the boat but you still feel like you\u2019re going up and down with the waves. It feels like that constantly, 24/7, and usually lasts a few months. It\u2019s definitely worse for a few seconds if I move my head suddenly in any direction (and more spinny than floaty, surely those are the scientific terms for it), but the mild floatiness is constant. It's also worse if I'm lying down on my right side than my left (which is how I know which side to do the Epley on). It varies in severity, but it\u2019s usually pretty mild - I\u2019ve never had problems walking during an episode, or any real nausea or vomiting. \n\nThe Epley maneuver absolutely helps; it makes me feel measurably better in the short term, and if I do it a few times a day, the floatiness gets milder and milder day by day. It\u2019s never really interfered with my life but it is 1000% annoying and distracting. \n\nI\u2019m at (fingers crossed) the tail end of a bout right now, that started in mid-April. This is my third bout of vertigo in the 8 years since I was diagnosed. \n\nA super weird thing I have noticed, and was curious if anyone else experienced this - when I\u2019m on a  bus, my symptoms completely vanish. It doesn\u2019t work on the train, and it doesn\u2019t work in a car, and bizarrely, it still works on the bus even if the bus is stopped at a light and not moving. I live in Chicago, and the last time I had this, I went out of my way to take buses wherever I had to go, just so I\u2019d have a few minutes of feeling normal. That hasn\u2019t been super possible this time around, because I haven\u2019t had a ton of places to go while things are still a bit locked down, and it also feels dumb to take public transit \\*recreationally\\* during a global pandemic, lol. Now that I\u2019m vaccinated I\u2019ve actually taken a few bus rides to get places, and it still works like a charm. The second I step off the bus, the floatiness is back, but for the few minutes that I\u2019m riding, it\u2019s heaven.", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1162, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "BBPV and bus rides", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/nsx960/bbpv_and_bus_rides/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwawaybutnotrlly", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13dk2v", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1622818038, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/ns6v8x/how_long_do_residual_symptoms_last/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ns6v8x", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/ns6v8x/how_long_do_residual_symptoms_last/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1622818051, "score": 1, "selftext": "Had 4-5 bouts of really bad vertigo that eventually put me in the ER after looking down about  a month ago that threw me out of wack for over a week (difficulty focusing vision, dizziness, brain fag).\n\nSince then, it has improved substantially, but I still don't feel 100%.

I have realised recently it seems to happen when I have very high stress.\n\nLast time it happened it was because my bf had a stomach bug and was throwing up and I was incredibly stressed I would catch it and throw up too, the dizziness lasted for 3 weeks even after I had calmed down and his sickness was over but the dizziness started then. \n\nMy family have recently gotten a puppy and while they\u2019re at work I take care of him, I don\u2019t get much sleep as the dog keeps me up barking and I have to get up early to go and look after him. I\u2019m also terrified of dogs throwing up and this majorly stresses me out. When I\u2019m alone with him in the house I just worry that he\u2019ll randomly be sick and I won\u2019t be able to go near it to clean it up. \n\nsometimes I feel like I\u2019m on a boat swaying side to side and sometimes I\u2019ll randomly have a spinning sensation at the back of my head. It doesn\u2019t seem to be affected by movements of my head or eyes and I have tried doing manoeuvres for vertigo and they have no affect whatsoever, I just have to wait until it subsides.\n\nI know I need to see a doctor but I\u2019m so terrified of the tests they may do. \n\nHas anyone else ever had this? Is it due to stress and anxiety?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1131, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can this be caused by anxiety and stress?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/ng5141/can_this_be_caused_by_anxiety_and_stress/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Robottwopointoh", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_i1tn981", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621380647, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/nfpon9/few_months_of_slight_dizzinessvertigo_bppv/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nfpon9", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/nfpon9/few_months_of_slight_dizzinessvertigo_bppv/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1621380657, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey all - new lurker to new poster. I got my first hit of dizziness at the beginning of December 2020. I've had some form of dizziness/vertigo persist since then. At first I was diagnosed with Rhinitis. Have had an MRI so MS is ruled out. Saw an ENT and he said I had BPPV. Went to a Vestibular Therapist and she found slight nystagmus. About 6 times in 1.5 minutes.   \n\n\nThe thing is, my symptoms were so slight into leading up to the Vestibular Therapy (Vesther) that the treatment I'm currently getting has made me feel so much worse than before. My dizziness was more consistent in December/January and really was improving until I saw the therapist. \n\nBefore: Very slight and quick boat-rocking feeling, almost all the time at my computer. Have rock climbed, ran, biked, swim, drive, all during this time and felt fine. Always felt better while excising. Near the end of April, I maybe felt a tinge of boat-rocking 2-3 times a day, again for only 2 seconds and while at a computer.\n\nNystagmus confirmed April 28th at Vesther - got Epley #1 - I felt nauseous for a about week afterwards. Mostly in the morning  and the afternoons felt better. Slight nausea, never threw up or had to lie down, just felt icky. After 1 week it started to improve. And after 2 weeks I'm pretty sure I felt great! \n\nMay 13th - Go back to Vesther feeling pretty good. They do dix/pike and I still have nystagmus. Dos Epley #2 - Gives me exercises to do this time (unlike before). Now ever since, I have slight nausea, but persistent and consistent vertigo and poor awareness for my body. It was incredibly bad yesterday while at a computer. Like every 5th time moved my eyes I would \"jolt\". It was better today but not great. I'm not a week past my appointment but I'm certainly feeling very shitty and very angry. I feel like I just need to wait out the 1-2 weeks and re-assess but I'm short on patience. I'm pretty angry in general as I really regret going back to the VestTher on May 13th and wish I just kept going without the second visit. Now I'm not rock climbing, and doing my exercises which make me get vertigo. I haven't had it this since February at least.\n\nI'm worried my anger is also perpetuating my feelings of anxiety. I'm worried this will never go away. I wish I could go back to May 11th and cancel my appointment. Anyone have any insight into their treatment progression? Does this sound similar?

Well anyway I was going to the grocery store and decided to stop and birdwatch in the cemetary first. So for about 35 minutes I would walk and pause and while standing look straight up(maybe 10 to 20 secinds) into the huge trees for movement of birds, then bring my binoculars up if I saw any. I probably looked straight up maybe 15 to 20 times in this period. When I got back to my truck and hopped in, my head went Poof and I got the worst \"swimmers ear\" in both ears with my hearing decreased by maybe 50 % and everything sounded \"hollow\" , like I was in a big fishbowl. Tried to clear my ears(hold nostrils and close mouth and blow softly), and they just wouldn't clear. Went shopping, then home and for about 2 hours while sitting upright, they wouldn't clear. Finally right before I went to bed I tried again and POOF my ears clear and dizziness decreased by 90%...I slept so much better(this was thurs night), all day fri and Sat I felt normal again, then Saturday night a little dizziness came back, but was gone when I woke up.

These sounds where present from time to time and for a few minutes/hours I guess. I really didn't give a lot of attention to them, as they didn't really cause me any other problems besides the occasional clicking. Moving on to 2019-2020, I think from time to time I had some vertigo/dizziness episodes, not really like the room was spinning, but felt pretty dizzy and lightheaded, but not at a point that I couldn't do anything. As long as I can remember, these dizziness episodes mostly occurred when I was in the car or bus. In September 2020, I woke up one morning and I was feeling a little lightheaded/dizzy (this feeling was and is focused on my left temple). This lightheaded feeling on left temple kept being there, until today (and it got a bit worse within time, then I got better, then worse, then better, then worse, like it's not really that stable). Today, I have 24/7 pressure-lightheadedness-dizziness coming from my left temple. Another thing is that, when I hold my chin with my hand and turn my head left, I feel some extreme crunching sounds inside my ear and temple, like crystals, and this happens everytime I do this. Sometimes, when I change position suddenly, I might be feeling the room spin as well, so I try to do some epley maneuvers (the one being in the bed with your head 45o right, then 45o left and then 45o left and looking down) but idk they really help. My main question is if anyone else in this community might have same or similar symptoms (mostly the 24/7 temples dizziness-pressure) and if you do, did you find any specific treatment?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "BPPV", "subreddit_id": "t5_3fcnd", "subreddit_subscribers": 1117, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My BPPV/PPPD Storytime (PLEASE READ)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/nc1sui/my_bppvpppd_storytime_please_read/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mangopad", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5irm4p43", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1620841174, "domain": "self.BPPV", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPPV/comments/naukk0/when_should_i_go_to_a_doctorspecialist_about_bppv/", "gildings": {}, "id": "naukk0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/BPPV/comments/naukk0/when_should_i_go_to_a_doctorspecialist_about_bppv/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1620841185, "score": 1, "selftext": "I've had my first couple experiences with BPPV (assumedly) a couple years ago, and they were extremely brief, only lasting maybe 10 minutes, and all dizziness and vertigo would be gone and a complete afterthought for the rest of the day.\n\nI had my first serious experience with BPPV yesterday, which resulted in me feeling extremely nauseous, dizzy, and anxious the whole day.

It was resolved quickly with the Epley Maneuver, I had another bout of it about a year later and Epley worked quickly that time too.  Then on Halloween morning 2019 I woke up feeling weird.  I felt really lightheaded, I wasn't spinning but I just had this strange dizzy feeling in my head.  I laid down and put my head to the side to see if it was BPPV and sure enough the room started spinning, when the feeling passed I continued the steps of the Epley by moving my head to the right and that's when I felt the most intense vertigo I had ever experienced, everything felt like it was spinning not just the room but I felt like my body was spinning.  It only lasted for a minute in 2 but it was terrifying. I went to see a physical therapist to have her do the Epley for me.  While performing the Epley she could not see any movement in my eyes and said she wasn't so sure it was BPPV.  I got no relief from that Epley, I saw her the next day and it was the same and again got no relief from the next Epley.  She referred me to a more high tech PT, they insisted it was just BPPV, did another Epley (again it didn't work) and sent me on my way. For months I was barely able to function.  I knew something was different this time and it couldn't just be BPPV because it felt so different.  I also developed bad Tinnitus that made sleeping really difficult.  After Googling obsessively I started down a path of learning about trigger points and found if you have certain trigger points then that can cause vertigo.  After finding the trigger points in my jaw and working on them I found that weird feeling in my head that I had had constantly for months would go away for a bit.  I got a strong feeling my jaw was the problem.  I started seeing a chiropractor and after each adjustment I would feel better and better.  She felt my jaw was causing my issue as well.  I had so much inflammation in my jaw.  It was way out of alignment on my left and my right side was overcompensating for it.  This made sense to me since when I'd turn my head to the righ that is when I'd have severe vertigo.  After months of working with the chiropractor I still couldn't lay down and turn my head to either side without getting dizzy but I was able to function a lot better during the day because the icky feeling in my head was almost completely gone.  Then COVID hit and everything got shut down here.  I had to go a couple months without seeing the chiropractor and I started feeling terrible again.  That's when I decided I needed to see a specialist for my jaw.  I saw a TMJ specialist who told me I had a bad overbite.  I already knew this but I was surprised to learn how a bite misalignment causes TMJ and can also cause issues with the inner ear.  He said I could use an orthotic however that would only be a temporary fix as it wouldn't permanently fix my bite.  It would only work when I was wearing it.  The permanent fix would be braces.  So off I went to an orthodontist.  After a consultation we decided Invisalign would be best for me.  I'm now on week 6 of wearing Invisalign and I can already feel a huge difference in my jaw, I have way less pain and when I am wearing the aligners  my head feels so much better.  I also noticed my neck and shoulder pain that I've had for years has almost completely disappeared.  I don't know if I still get dizzy when I lay down and turn my head to the side because I'm terrified to try it.  I just hate that feeling so much and I'm afraid I might get discouraged to continue with my Invisalign.  I'm going to wait until I've completed my Invisalign process which is 25 weeks of wearing aligners.  I guess I can update then and let you know if it took the BPPV symptoms away completely.\n\nI know this is a crazy long post but I wanted to share my story because I know I was searching constantly to find advice on how to resolve my vertigo.  Doctors were zero help for me as they don't think outside the box.  If you are having issues with vertigo you may want to get your jaw checked.  I did not feel like I had noticable jaw pain before this.  My jaw would pop pretty bad when I opened my mouth wide but that is the only time it would really hurt.  It wasn't until I found the jaw trigger points and pushed on them that I felt terrible pain that would make my eyes water.  Until I figured this all out I was losing hope.  I felt so miserable and alone.  I have a young daughter and she is the only reason I still got out of bed each day.  No one should have to feel like they have to just live with feeling terrible and that they will never get better.  Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about what I've been through.

I went to a neurologist after starting D3 in August 2020 (new doctor, test came back at 15ng/mL) and still deal with getting vertigo on various drugs such as Carafate, Zyrtec, Miralax, etc. I tried to get a brain MRI on Wednesday and got worse vertigo then ever before. It wasn't anxiety because that causes dissociation, this was feeling like I was free falling but under water or some odd thing. With all this vertigo and stuff can it be a D3 problem? They all sit there and say my thyroid, iron, B12, etc is normal and to get a brain MRI but even the MRI makes my brain feel odd. I am wondering if the D3 5k IU daily (been on since August 2020) will help the vertigo or if it can be a different problem entirely. It started after getting taken off of Levothyroxine in August 2019 but my thyroid remains normal off of meds so they told me to see a neurologist to rule out other problems. I have an arachnoid cyst on my brain (have had them before, no symptoms) as seen from the incomplete MRI. The vertigo is medication induced and as I learned on Wednesday, most certainly MRI induced too. Could it be calcium crystals in my inner ears in part? I still feel odd like I'm a log that's stuck in a wave ot something. I feel most the time when this vertigo that drugs causes like I am a buoy bobbing up and down in the water. As I said this was not a problem on thyroid pills (except standing or sitting) and I could take Zyrtec, Carafate, Miralax, etc with no side effects. I did not know what subreddit to put this into. D3 5k IU isn't resolving the medication induced vertigo, tried to take Miralax the other day and was very screwed up from the bobbing up and down sense of movement.

He did the test but left me on the table for 5 mins- did the Dix Hallpake and said he saw a \u201cslight nystagmus\u201d in right eye- I honestly still don\u2019t believe him bc during that test he proceeded to do the epley and left me there while he checked other patients- then on my own went to vestibular specialist- PT- I also had a PT cousin look at me- none of them saw a nystagmus- even w the goggles- nothing. Also both said the ent def didn\u2019t do the epley correct.\n\nI am now 3.5 months in- and most days feel like garbage. I notice slight improvement every 2-3 weeks with always a set back in between. I only spun that first time in August and then almost once more 5 weeks later which I stopped - did the Brandt-daroff- made it worse but after a few hours was ok. \n\nMy main reason for finally seeking others opinions is I am still having residual symptoms that change everyday- and I can\u2019t find people on here with exactly what I\u2019m going through. Since the beginning I\u2019ve had visual disturbances - blurred vision but that improved about 1.5 months in but I still have visual aura stuff is the best way I can describe it. Head pressure- at the top or side of my head- pressure around my eyes/cheeks. Head aches, ear pressure or ear pain sporadically- ringing only a few times but noticed it today which is rare. Wooziness or lightheaded - comes in waves or stays. The best part (sarcastic voice) is all these symptoms change from day to day or even within the day.\n\nI also have forward head posture I am now working on w the chiropractor- stretches - adjustments. This is something I should have worked on ten years ago. He said I\u2019m not unfixable but it\u2019s just going to take time. Maybe this could be the cause? Again no idea?\n\nThrough all this- I had an MRI, EKG, echocardiogram, X-ray on neck. (I have a prolapsed cable/heart murmur so was just routine heart check up). Everything came back fine. So I have seen ENT- PT- neurologist- PCP- chiropractor - cardiologist.\n\nSo what the actual F is happening. Do you guys think this is true BPPV or something else. I\u2019ve only had one migraine in my life when I was 18-19 yrs old and never again. Please help. For the first 2 months I cried everyday. This is not life threatening but it changes your life. I see and feel for every single one of you. The drs just write this off as \u201coh you just have vertigo no big deal.\u201d Mmmm excuse me? I\u2019ve lost faith in all drs at this point. And I absolutely hate that they do not talk enough about the anxiety that comes with this. It is like nothing I experienced before. The first two weeks I lost ten lbs- had 20-30 min panic attacks, heart palpitations, whole body tremors....this has been by far the worst thing I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life health wise. So sorry for the long post but this has definitely been a journey for me. Overall my anxiety is better- CBD helps. Xanax in the early stages. I take ibuprofen almost everyday.
