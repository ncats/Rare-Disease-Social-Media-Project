I had had a persistent cough that later matured to a sore throat and dual ear infection. I treated it with antibiotics and observed that my taste had gone away, though at the time I assumed it was Omnicef - the antibiotic prescribed. The morning of the 8th I woke up with legs extremely sore as well as a sore back. It felt as if I had tried to move a couch the day before, but I hadn't done anything out of the ordinary. That day I also noticed it was significantly harder to get out of my chair at work, get into the shower (stepping over the border of the tub to get into the tub / shower combo), and I observed an instance or two where my fingers didn't go exactly where I told them to.\n\nOver the next week, I noticed that walking was a lot harder, my strides were much smaller, my legs and back were sore or painful, standing from a seated position was very difficult, and I continued to have no sense of taste - except for chocolate. Eating was very difficult as everything tasted like numb tongue.\n\nI fell Monday the 11th and had to wait until that Thursday to get to see a doctor. I knew something was wrong, but wasn't sure if I was coming down with diabetes, if it was some form of potassium deficiency, or what. My feet were numb and tingly and it seemed to be progressing slowly upward. I also observed some numbness in my fingertips.\n\nThat Thursday, the general practitioner I met with ruled out neurological symptoms and suggested that it could be blood clots in my legs. He also ran a blood test which I was hopeful would find something concrete as I disagreed that it was a blood clot issue. Honestly, it was very deflating as I was consumed that week with fear and hope of getting answers.\n\nThe next morning I was getting ready for work. At this time I had to resort to dressing laying down on the bed due to difficulty lifting my legs. I went downstairs and sat down to put on my shoes. When I got up out of the recliner, my knee buckled and I fell to the ground. I got up a little bit later, got back into the chair and tried again, only to fall again. At this point I called off of work, notified my wife, and asked my parents to come over and make sure I was safe. I was hopeful the ultrasound the doc had ordered on my legs would be carried out that day.\n\nMy wife came home and drove me to the ER, where the attentive nurse practitioner quickly observed that my mouth wasn't moving properly and that I could not smile. They ran a CT scan to assess that I had not incurred a stroke and then transferred me to the local hospital that featured a very good neuro unit. The nurse practitioner was convinced she was looking at GBS.\n\nAt the hospital they ran a lumbar puncture (spinal tap), MRI, and eventually an EMG. The lumbar puncture was very intimidating, but absolutely painless and without complication. The EMG was tough, but ativan helped. The diagnosis indicated that I did indeed have GBS.\n\nWe began treating me with IVIG and monitoring my breathing with a mind to put me on a respirator if it degraded. All the while, the numbness crept up my legs, down from my fingertips, and down from the tip of my tongue.\n\nI wasn't able to eat much, walk, or bathe. I could still move, though my legs didn't lift very much and it was incredibly hard and exhausting to even sit up in bed.\n\nThe IVIG helped and infused fresh strength into my legs. After treatment completed, I moved to an inpatient rehab facility in town that worked frequently with neuro cases. This place was amazing and my therapists were fantastic. They set me up with a wheelchair and I could wheel myself around easily, despite the numbness and imprecision of my hands.\n\nI worked hard in therapy, doing anything I was asked. My goals were to stand for short periods of time, walking with a walker (or on the parallel bars) and being able to handle stairs. I worked on endurance on the hand bikes and hand/foot exercise bikes.\n\nThings were looking very good for me and I was even allowed to transfer to the toilet on my own at the end of my rehab stay, 5 days before I was to be discharged, I noticed that I could no longer smile and my range of facial expressions was way down. I alerted the nurse and talked with a doc or nurse practitioner the next day (a Sunday). The next morning I was given another CT and sent back to the hospital for treatment as they believed that the GBS was reasserting itself.\n\nThat stay they put a port in my artery in my neck and  performed plasmapherisis (plasma exchange) every other day for 11 days. It absolutely drained me and took the life out of me. I couldn't do much at all and the strength and skill I had rebuilt in inpatient rehab degenerated rapidly in that hospital. It was a dark and tough time, but eventually I was released back to inpatient rehab.\n\nThe second inpatient stay was okay, though I wasn't as strong as my first stay and I wasn't in as good of shape by the time I left. After a few weeks I was released back to home and returned to my faithful and loving wife after a 45 day total stay composed of 4 different hospital / rehab stints.\n\nWalking around home was hard with a walker and I fell somewhat frequently (often my strength gave out on the stairs as I had to rely on my hands to pull me up for the most part at first).\n\nOutpatient rehab took some adjusting as the first day they challenged me to go even when I was exhausted and felt unsafe to go on. I fell and that really hindered that relationship as good trust with a therapist is important.\n\nPain and hypersensitivity were an issue. My feet were extremely painful and were swollen by the time I left the hospital. Compression stockings and knee braces helped a little, as did velcro shoes that I could fasten myself (though I had to tape on some tape to make the velcro straps accessible).\n\nMy wife and I would go out to the movie theater to give me an excuse to walk a decent amount of distance. I'd need to rest on my walker periodically, but would eventually make it in. We'd find many similar excuses to get out and get exercise every day in order to work on my strength and endurance.\n\nOutpatient therapy worked on my technique, posture, and balance. They also fitted me for AFO devices that supported my feet and combatted my \"foot drop\", helping me walk without tripping the feet on the floor. I kept pushing things trying to move from a walker to a cane and eventually I succeeded with a cane with a triangular tip (good for applying pressure from any direction) and discovered that I could use a cane in some circumstances. \n\nAs time went on, the circumstances grew and I was able to move entirely to a cane by late August or early September. That meant a huge quality of life increase for me as it let me go to places I could not otherwise reach and carry things with me in my off hand.\n\nI began working remotely part time for my employer (I'm a software developer) and tried to increase the number of hours in a day or number of days in a week every week based on what I was seeing.\n\nBy the end of September I discontinued occupational therapy and took up assembling legos instead as very good dexterity work. My facial weakness had resolved itself by early August and I never did any outpatient speech therapy.\n\nBy November I was walking to some extent without a cane in some circumstances with my therapist. It was difficult and awkward, but I had accomplished the goal of being able to walk in safe circumstances and short distances unassisted. We discontinued my therapy as my technique had arrived but things would continue to improve as my nerves healed and strength returned.\n\nNovember also saw a large increase in the pain as my feet healed more. I was at my highest pain levels from November to January and it required constant elevation of the feet in the evening, icing them to help silence the pain and both continuous release and acute pain medication.\n\nBy mid-January I returned to work full time on site and ended long-term disability. My wife would drive me to work and pick me up at the end of the day and this time together was nice.\n\nBy March I was driving again and my wife and I had moved to a new house. During this time I was also tapering down various pain medications. By late March I was on no medication. This was also around the time when I felt truly myself again and uninhibited and without significant handicap.\n\nWe let my handicapped placard expire in late June. My wife and I also began the practice of walking at least half a mile each evening.\n\nAll in all, from initial symptoms to return to normal function, it took me about 10 months. I still have numbness on my feet and mild pain, but if I don't touch my feet much and wear shoes that don't put much side or top pressure on them I'm okay (I wear mesh crocks with socks underneath and these work very well).\n\nJust recently, the inpatient rehab hospital asked me on as a volunteer to talk with GBS patients they encounter. I'm thankful to be able to share my story, coping mechanisms, be a listening and understanding ear, and help others going through what I've gone through.\n\nI anticipate full healing in my feet and an eventual return of my full endurance, but recognize the importance of investing in that by reasonable exercise and working for the capabilities I want.\n\nIf you're going through GBS, I recommend taking life day by day, relying on God for strength, seeking to bless anyone who you get to interact with, and focusing on the task at hand, whether it's to try to take a step or working with a tech to get dressed for the day. Life was all about meeting the challenge of the hour, whether pain or rehab exercises or self-care. It was about relying on your support system and trying to find new ways of meeting challenges - whether trying a different walker, taping feet that curl up at night otherwise, icing to address pain, or knee braces to address wobbly or hurt knees.\n\nTalk to others too. GBS is weird and the symptoms and side effects can be bizarre. Other people have seen the same strange stuff and can help you through it.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "From Diagnosis to Recovery", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/4tc27n/from_diagnosis_to_recovery/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1465341340, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/4n1yr1/one_year_out_gbs_recovery/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4n1yr1", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/4n1yr1/one_year_out_gbs_recovery/", "retrieved_on": 1472756156, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "One Year Out - GBS Recovery", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/4n1yr1/one_year_out_gbs_recovery/"}, {"author": "OTrex", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1528774676, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/8qfst1/graduate_student_seeking_to_learn_from_person/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8qfst1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/8qfst1/graduate_student_seeking_to_learn_from_person/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1528774677, "rte_mode": "richtext", "score": 2, "selftext": "I am an occupational therapy student and currently enrolled in an assistive technology class.

During my most recent neuro visit I had an EMG done where my neurologist broke the news. He felt so bad that it took this long to properly diagnose me. He said that every diagnosis I had was an indicator of CIDP and that he couldn't believe the hospital refused to test me for it. The tests show that it's up to my lumbar so he put in a claim to my insurance for immediate IVIG treatments.

I got kinda educational.\n\nGBS? 33, had it when I was 5, last 2 weeks I've been barely able to leave bed and have shooting pains in arms and legs. Fearing relapse or residuals. \n\nThe scariest thing about GBS is how little is known. They do not know the source - it's called an autoimmune syndrome because we only know the tertiary effects. What happens is that your body somehow thinks the protein around your nerves (myelin) is bad and undergoes demyelination where your own immube system attacks the protein around your nerves. This is painful, feeling your own body die, and leaves you with varying degrees of immobility, ranging from clumsiness and weakness to full paralysis which requires a ventilator because the body is too weak to even breathe unassisted.\n\nDiagnosis is a matter of excluding OTHER potential causes combined with a spinal tap to measure proteins. This is all painful, exhausting and nerve wracking (pardon the pun).\n\nRecovery can be quick (3-6 months) or take years and many patients have residuals effects throughout their life as they have had massive nerve damage. Treatment is not fun - plasmapheresis (blood is taken out, cleaned and pumped back in) and IVIG (infusion, kinda like the process of chemo). Other than that, there isn't much to do other than make sure you don't die when weak. Time is the biggest healer.\n\nEven if you heal well, it's advised to avoid blood donations (for the sake of others, this one is up to each blood bank) and flu shots - since GBS almost always manifests after some sickness, even though the cause is unknown, avoiding being sick obviously helps and flu shots basically make you weakly sick. GBS got a bit of coverage with Zika but Epstein Barr (Mononucleosis, herpes) has a higher correlation. \n\nAgain to hammer home how little we know: in 1989 when I was diagnosed, we were told the rate of relapse was just as rare as getting it again, less than .01% chance. Nowadays with longer term studies and more research the known relapse rate is up to 5%.\n\nIt's a very scary condition to have had because it impacts my life to this day but the why, how and full extent is not known. Every time I am sick or feel weak, I have fears of a relapse.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Brief informative rant on GBS", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/6mr36e/brief_informative_rant_on_gbs/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LaurenDreamsInColor", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_39dmzvr9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567000518, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/cwl5e2/gammunex_ivig_shortage/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cwl5e2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/cwl5e2/gammunex_ivig_shortage/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567000519, "score": 4, "selftext": "My wife has been getting IVIG for CIDP for a few years now.

Why half my face was dropping. Why my knees would buckle as I walked and why I was sleeping from the time I got home from work until I had to go back in. I received 5 rounds of IVIG for 6 days in the nero ward. I\u2019m grateful it didn\u2019t reach my lungs, but had I waited one more day I would have been intubated. Went to physical rehab for 10 days, re-learned how to walk and continued with outpatient PT/OT until my insurance stopped paying for the visits. \n\nIn the beginning which was only 3 months ago, the fatigue, burning neuropathy and back pain were my biggest struggles. It was very physical. Now I\u2019m in a \u201cplateau\u201d phase where only time will tell when I get better. I now find the battle is much more internal; it\u2019s mental.  this syndrome and the medication I\u2019m on, combined with isolation because I can\u2019t drive and my significant other works full time has brought me to a very dark place mentally. I\u2019ve dealt with depression and anxiety for my entire life, and unfortunately the gabapentin I take gives me suicide idealization and way more depression. But it takes my nerve pain away. I was switched to Lyrica today with hopes the side effects won\u2019t be so severe. Please be aware of the many, MANY side effects of both lyrica and gabapentin... for me it\u2019s a catch 22. I ask myself daily what\u2019s more needed right now? My mental health and stability or keeping my nerve pain at bay by continuing with both Lyrica and Gabapentin. Short answer- gonna try the Lyrica and see how it goes... if I just stop taking the gabapentin not only will my neuropathy pain worsen but I could have seizers from quitting like that.  So I made a psychiatrist appt. to be re-evaluated for my mental health. So many meds, so many side effects. Feel liked lm drowning with so many questions for my neuro follow up my next week at my 3 month mark. \n\nGBS has taken everything from me. I once read that \u201cthe the opposite of depression isn\u2019t happiness; it\u2019s vitality.\u201d and I just want mine back. I sought out help yesterday as I felt like I was going into psychosis? i spent 7 hours in a locked holding facility located in the hospital. Luckily they did not section me but diagnosed me with \u201cchronic depression due to physical illness\u201d (no shit) and I was released with advice to seek out therapy and make some med changes. currently taking the following  :\n\n\n- 50 mgs of Lyrica 3x a day (was originally on 12mgs of gabapentin 3x a day which seems odd to me...Such a low lyricsa dose)\n-tramadol for pain 50mgs 3x a day (rarely take it)\n-ambien to sleep\n- nebumetone (kind of like ibuprofen that\u2019s not as harsh on your stomach. Helps with inflammation) \n-vitamin D 2000 units \n-celexa 40 mgs once a day (doesn\u2019t help at all)\n- Xanax for entirety (been in it for years tho)\n\nI truly feel the gabapentin was is giving me suicidal thoughts and more depression. I have high hopes I\u2019ll finally figure out the right med combo. soon and that the Lyrica will somehow give me less side effects.\n\nIf anyone needs to talk or vent or shoot the shit because let\u2019s be real... most of us aren\u2019t able to do much except wait and hope, feel free to message me! \n\nI\u2019m in the fight if my life when it comes to my mental health right now and wanted to share my story with the hope that it helps just help one person who may be going through what I am. I\u2019m going to try my best to keep fighting but it gets hard. Really fucking hard. \n\nIf any of you have advice about medication in regards to gabapentin or Lyrica I\u2019d love to hear your stories. Are there meds I can take to help with fatigue? \n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, thank you for your time... and if you\u2019re dealing with the awfulness of GBS, my heart is with you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 241, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "GBS: A mental battle like no other", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566705385, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/cuomnb/gbs_a_mental_battle_like_no_other/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "dytavera", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_16z4mxyr", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565873206, "domain": "khou.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/cqpciz/toddler_with_gbs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cqpciz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "d1b1388a-194c-11e9-a44d-0e6d6856fb3e", "link_flair_text": "News", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/cqpciz/toddler_with_gbs/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565873207, "score": 4, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 239, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Toddler with GBS?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566249042, "url": "https://www.khou.com/mobile/article/news/health/toddler-stops-moving-after-trip-to-florida-beach/285-ed46f609-8e7e-4aa9-ac5a-95c5a0d5acee"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NozoGi", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_yrcvx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1565414105, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/codxjt/my_father_has_gbs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "codxjt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e3a53416-194b-11e9-bcc2-0e097ee54f68", "link_flair_text": "Advice and Support", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/codxjt/my_father_has_gbs/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1565414106, "score": 4, "selftext": "He was diagnosed 3 days ago, he started with his legs feeling numb until he wasn\u2019t able to walk, he is nos in ICU and had recieved 3 days of immunoglobuline (or however it is written, I\u2019m sorry english is not my first language).

He spent almost 6 months in ICU, acute care, and nursing home/rehab. We renovated his home to have a wheelchair accessible bathroom and bedroom.

Never in hospital or anything, working and living life. Then around 15 months ago things got bad.

She was in hospital for about 8 months. She's always suffering but trust me her family, and doctors have found no answer to her problem. Shes slowly getting better but usually after a bit of decent days she'll have a set back. Im 16 and I've been trying my hardest to be a loving supportive boyfriend. We've been together for a year and 3 months. I love her so much, it just pains me to see her like this. All the drugs she's on, the permanent frown on her face, her shortness pf conversation. She's unfortunately burnt out, and has been for about a year. When she's in agony from the stomach cramps ill rub her lower back, or just babble on and tell her about my day, distract her.

I was in good health before all of this started. On Monday, June 10, I started to notice some problems with my vision. It's hard to explain, but basically my eyes weren't focusing properly and I had to concentrate really hard anytime I changed the depth of my field of vision. I still went to work, drove, etc. and figured it would pass with a night of sleep. The next morning I started feeling very dizzy and was unstable while walking (which I attributed to the dizziness). I took the day off of work and went to my primary care physician. He diagnosed me with a sinus infection and prescribed an antibiotic.\nThe next morning (Wednesday) when I woke up my vision had digressed significantly. I couldn't focus on anything. My head was spinning and I was seeing double. My face, lips, mouth, hands, and feet were numb. I could barely stand up my legs were so weak. I went to the emergency room and they rushed me in thinking that I was having a stroke. A CT scan confirmed there was no stroke and they were about to send me home (the ER doc said the dizziness was due to the sinus infection and the numbness was my sympathetic nervous system going out of control). Thankfully a neurologist intervened and admitted me to the hospital for further testing.\nOver the next 48-72 hours I went through several tests: MRI, Spinal fluid sample, and an EMG. They began to suspect that I had GBS so on Thursday night they transferred me to a larger hospital in the area. On Friday, the neurologist returned and said that based on the preliminary test results plus my symptoms they were going to diagnose me with Miller Fisher variant of GBS. During this time my symptoms had continued to progress. I also began to develop a problem with my speech because my soft palette was not closing properly so when I spoke most of the air was escaping out my nose (this also happened with liquids when I drank). I needed a walker and a standby nurse anytime I got up and when I did all I could do was take a few steps to the bathroom and back to the bed.\nOnce I got the diagnosis, they began IVIG treatments that evening. I had five treatments in total. Once the treatments began I started to notice steady improvements. I began working with physical, occupational, and speech therapy in my room. I started being able to take short walks around the halls with a walker. My speech started to improve gradually. After my fourth treatment  (Tuesday, June 18) they transferred me down to inpatient rehab so I could get started the next day while I did my fifth and final treatment. After I finished the fifth treatment on Wednesday (June 19) I started feeling great. The next morning (Thursday) physical therapy cleared me to be independent on the hall (I could walk around on my own without a nurse which was huge!). I was still slow walking and didn't feel normal, but I was significantly better. On Friday, they discharged me to go home. My only restriction was no driving and I was going to do outpatient therapy. I had a follow up appointment for August 15th with the neurologist, but it seemed like it would mostly be a formality. The only symptoms I had at that point were vision problems (similar to the first Monday way back when) and some minor tingling in my hands.\nWhen I got back home I mostly settled back into my normal life. I have a wife and three small kids so there was no easing back in. I began to notice an odd, but not problematic symptom that if I \"overdid it\" my body would get a mild vibrating sensation. Similar to a cell phone vibrating in your pocket, but it was all over my body. Once I sat down or laid down, it went away.\nOn Sunday (June 23), I began to notice that I was having problems chewing. My face just felt odd, not necessarily numb. By Monday, I had lost almost all ability to taste foods and the right side of my face was paralyzed. My right eye was extremely irritated and would water a ton throughout the day. I tried desperately to get a sooner appointment with my neurologist, but they claimed that had no openings. I was able to get back into my family doctor on Tuesday (June 25). When he came into the room he said \"Wow, GBS, I've only had 1 other patient in 35 years that had that! What do they even do for that anymore?\" He pulled out his phone and began Googling and looking stuff up on mayoclinic.com. So needless to say he was not much help. I continued to try to follow up with the neurologist and thankfully with some help from my insurance company I was able to get an appointment on July 3 due to a \"cancellation.\" \nOn July 2, I started my outpatient therapy. The occupational therapist recommended that I see an ophthalmologist about my eye issues. Thankfully, he was able to see me that same afternoon. He did a full neurological test and said that they eye looked good it was likely just drying out since my eyelid muscles were not blinking and closing properly. He recommended I use eye drops and an ointment overnight. I've been doing that and it has helped quite a bit with the eye drying out. On July 3 I finally saw the neurologist again. He confirmed that the facial paralysis was not concerning and should clear up \"in time\" so that was a nice reassurance.\nSince then my facial paralysis has improved and is almost completely better. My taste sensation is still not 100%, but it's close. My eyes still have issues focusing and the right eye still dries out sometimes. Physically, I feel strong, but my endurance still is not what it used to be and I tire out easily. I'm continuing to do therapy and hope that will help.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 218, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My experience with MFS", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562681456, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/caliqd/my_experience_with_mfs/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Kinglens311", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_khlt4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562183783, "domain": "reddit.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/c8ss7g/my_cidp_story/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c8ss7g", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/c8ss7g/my_cidp_story/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562183784, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 216, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "My CIDP Story", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562352084, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/c8sovc/my_cidp_story/?utm_source=ifttt"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "jmcke778", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_417pxtw6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562183355, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/c8sovc/my_cidp_story/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c8sovc", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/c8sovc/my_cidp_story/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562183357, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hey everyone I am 24 year old male from England  and i got diagnosed with CIDP just over a year ago, I have currently relapsed. The reason I'm posting this is to see if anyone can relate and just to get this off my chest really. It'll probably be a long read so thanks to anyone who does read it or even comment.\n\nSo in October 2017 (which is the first time i can pinpoint a start of the symptoms) i went out with some mates to play football, first few minutes everything was fine then I started to push myself to run and put my foot through the ball and my legs just gave way from underneath me not all the time but just when i was trying to go at it 100% didn't think a lot of it just thought probably need to go to the gym more often.\n\nFast forward a few weeks I'm at work. I work nights in a supermarket so my job is stacking shelves. So I'm putting stock on the shelves and I notice my left hand grip is weak, it's suddenly taking a lot of effort to take the plastic wrapping of the stock but again I don't really think about because overall I feel fine.\n\nHeading towards Christmas I'm at work and I'm down on my knees putting stock on the bottom shelf and i bring myself back up and as soon as I'm upright i just fall and because I'm working with someone so I just laugh it off. I work 6 hour shifts and before, during and after the shift I'm just feeling shattered.\n\nHeading into the new year symptoms are still there and gradually getting worse, my legs are going from underneath me every now and then, my grip especially on my left hand is nonexistent struggling to even open a packet of crisps but i can still move around fine. I've booked a doctors appointment because I've been suffering with depression and anxiety for a few years and I thought I'm going to speak to someone about it. A few days beforehand I'm reading an article on a wrestling site and it's about a neck injury to a wrestler and how he's lost his grip and how very serious that can be so I get a bit worried and I mention it to my doctor he says he will refer me to a neurologist.\n\nAround about February 2018 my symptoms are progressively getting worse, barely any grip in both hands so I'm occasionally dropping things, my legs are moving slower, walking up and down the stairs is way more challenging than it should be for a 23 year old and by the end of the month I decide to take time off work because I wasn't capable of doing my job. \n\nIn March 2018 I get my referral to a neurologist the only problem is i would have to wait 2 months for just a consultation, I was in a really bad way so the thought of waiting so long for just a consultation was scary. So I made probably the best decision I've ever made and went private, it cost just over \u00a31000 for consultation, scans and tests (I worked nights and weekends for 4 years which as a young adult you can save a bit of money that way). My neurologist puts me back on the nhs after initial test and scans.\n\nAbout a month later I got diagnosed with CIDP the only problem was getting treatment as the condition and treatment is so rare it's only available in a handful of regions and one of them isn't Staffordshire which is where I live. My neurologist reffers me to a specialist in Birmingham which is about 50 miles away from where I live. We go over to see him and he sets me up for treatment the following week. By this time I'm in such a bad way, can barely walk, struggling to wash and bathe myself, need help getting dressed as I can't lift my arms above my head and had to stop driving.\n\nSo me and my mother pack our bags and make our way to Birmingham for a week. I go in for treatment which is IVIG, I had 125g over 5 days. After the final day we head back home and I felt great, it really is amazing what modern medicine can do. I was booked in for more treatment every month for the following 3 months, when I saw my specialist he said I would need treatment for the rest of my life barring any remission periods which I did not realise and was a bit tough to take.\n\nOver the course of the past 12 month's (except for a blip in October 2018) i progressed very well (returned to work in July 2018), with my specialist knocking down the dosage every 3 months and saying that a remission period could be on the horizon. In April 2019 he knocked the dosage down to 80g a month, it didn't work well as a few weeks later my symptoms started to come back not as severe as last time but still enough for me to notice. My specialist confirmed it's a relapse and has since upped the dosage (120g every month) . I have responded to the treatment just not as well as when I first started which is a bit worrying. I'm currently off work again and don't really know when I'll be back the past month or so has been really depressing in all honesty and has me worrying for the future. \n\nWith all that said thanks to anyone who took their  time to read all that and I welcome any questions.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 216, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My CIDP Story", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562352039, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/c8sovc/my_cidp_story/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Hallowheels", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_29db981e", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562037078, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/c841l4/i_found_my_people/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c841l4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/c841l4/i_found_my_people/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562037079, "score": 8, "selftext": "I (27F) was diagnosed 4 months ago with GBS. Admittedly, I was treating my body like garbage. I was excessively drinking and barely eating for at least 4 years so when the symptoms started showing I chalked it up to the numerous health issues I was ignoring that went along with that lifestyle. Every day I would wake up and it would be harder to walk and let my legs stretch out. Finally I got up one day and fell and couldn\u2019t get myself back up. Cue me refusing to go to the hospital because maybe I just \u201cneeded to put my legs up for a bit\u201d. Eventually my family came and forced me to go.\n\nI was in the hospital for a week while they poked and prodded to find out the issue. They told me it was super rare and it was crazy that someone so young is experiencing it but based on my lifestyle not shocking.\n\nThen came my 2 month rehab stay. With that neuropathy kicked in on my feet. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to tell most of you that it was the most excruciating pain I\u2019ve ever experienced. Whenever I would do sit to stands in PT I felt like I had to vomit from the pain. Finally, the doctors switched my meds around an I woke up one day pain free but still tingly. \n\nI spent those two months working the hardest I ever have in my life. I was battling my own body, anxiety and depression, alcoholism, an eating disorder, a break up, and a move (I was hospitalized early April and our lease was up in May...try organizing a move when you can\u2019t be there). But I took on every challenge the PT gave me and by the end of my stay I was basically completely independent on a walker and only took the chair just in case.\n\nNow I\u2019m in outpatient PT and they think by the end of this week I should be able to just use a cane at home and for short trips in the community. I had to change my whole lifestyle. I decided to look up if there was a sub for this on a whim and I\u2019m so happy this exists.\n\nFor me the scariest part is there is so little research and literature on the topic that doctors seem to not know how far you will rehabilitate. I didn\u2019t know anyone who had experienced this and, by what the doctors said, I likely wouldn\u2019t. I really was feeling isolated and a bit angsty if I\u2019m being honest so finding this sub feels like I\u2019m not alone is this scary situation.\n\nHow did you guys find out about your diagnosis and what did the doctors say the solution or healing time was?\n\nTLDR: Diagnosed with GBS and felt alone.

I was 22 and I noticed that my big toes were numb, I didn\u2019t think anything of it. As you all can assume the rest of my extremities soon followed. I had the left side of my face paralyzed then couple days later the right side also decided to join in. I like to think that I\u2019m always trying to find the bright side of thing and this illness was a challenge. I quickly found that I could still make others laugh even though I could physically couldn\u2019t, which was a warm feeling. It took about a month, 3 hospitals and several doctors to fin out that I had GBS. I spent about a 10 days and 5 rounds of IVIG. \nI was told that I would have to physical therapy and occupational therapy. I didn\u2019t mind doing these things because I loved to workout. The entire process took about 6-7 months. I had to stop because insurance didn\u2019t see me improving enough so the they stopped paying for it (not happy about that). So I went on my own and tried to get the strength that I had before. 6 more months pass and I\u2019m about 90% there. I\u2019m benching 200 lbs, culling 50lbs, etc. I felt like I have defeated GBS but as time continued I still felt a little tired. I felt like I could never reach that 100%. I told my doctor and she could figure out why. \n2015 I\u2019m 24, attending college, and working. Life looked like it was getting back to normal even with experiencing fatigue every now and then (I also had nerve damage on my fingers and toes). One day the same symptoms started to come back and I was like f@&amp;k. I went to the ER 4 times and was rejected each time. They said it\u2019s not GBS, I said ok then what is it. They told me to come back when it\u2019s worse. I ended up going to Mayo Clinic in Minnesota 4 months later. They told me I might have some residual effects from GBS and that I also have hashimotos hypothyroidism. I told the doc that no one in my family has a thyroid problem and he said it was probably the GBS that caused it.  \nNow doctors think I might have a metabolic issue but I\u2019m 28 now my insurance ran out when I was 26, so everything is taking more time and money. I still keep a smile on my face even though simple tasks are a lot more difficult to complete. My family is my rock and I\u2019m grateful to have them. I miss playing soccer, I miss doing the things that I was able to do, but I have to look at the things that can do now.

I was 27 at the time. \nI had an extremely severe respiratory virus before I experienced symptoms. I could barely swallow, and when I coughed my throat and chest hurt so badly that I would almost pass out. \nI didn\u2019t go to the doctor because I assumed it would go away. (I don\u2019t like going to the doctor, and I feel like it\u2019s my fault I got gbs. )\nIt lasted for about a week and then went away. \n\nThen a few days later I noticed weakness in my left hand. I had a hard time putting my hair up in a ponytail because my hand was weak. \nMy now husband said everything was probably fine, and I assumed it would just go away. \nThe next day I noticed weakness in my thighs, and I could barely walk up a few stairs. I started crying and I didn\u2019t know what to do. \nMy hands started tingling and got numb. My thighs were also tingling.  The tingling went up my arms. It was very scary. \n\nI ignored it because again I assumed I would get better. \nIt progressively got worse over the next couple days. I struggled to get out of the car, and walk up curbs. \nOne day as I was trying to get into my house ( up 3 stairs) I couldn\u2019t get up, and tried to crawl up the stairs. The stairs are made of concrete, so crawling was extremely painful and I couldn\u2019t crawl anyway. \nMy mom called 911 to help get me in the house. If I remember correctly, it might have happened twice. When the EMTS helped me in the house they used my belt hooks to hold me up. While they helped me, I remember thinking that with their help walking felt as easy as it usually felt. \n\n\n\nThat night I was sitting on the couch, and I couldn\u2019t get up. I tried rocking side to side to get up, but it didn\u2019t work. My thighs were so weak\nI called 911, and started crying hysterically. \nThe EMTs were extremely dismissive. They asked why I was crying, and when I explained that I couldn\u2019t get up they still didn\u2019t take me seriously. \n At the hospital they did a CT scan and then had me walk around the nurses station, then gave me flexeril and sent me home.  My mom was extremely angry that they sent me home. \n\n\nI still held out hope that it would get better. A day later I was much worse. I was on the couch and it took 15-20 minutes of rocking back and forth to get up. I was sweating so bad it was as if I\u2019d worked out. I had to go to the bathroom extremely bad. I finally got up and walked around the room. I thought maybe my walking was getting better. I went to the bathroom and got stuck on the toilet seat for a long time until I used the sink to pull myself up. \n\nI walked into my bedroom and fell to the ground. My brother couldn\u2019t lift me up and I had to call 911. My legs were so weak I couldn\u2019t move. I remember thinking  it\u2019s like that commercial where someone says they\u2019ve fallen and they can\u2019t get up. \n\nThey got there and asked me what medication I was on. I informed them I was on methadone, so they treated me like I was just going to the hospital to get pain medication. The EMT who I told wasn\u2019t very nice after he found out that I was on MMT. They took me out of the house on a chair type device. \n\nIn the ER I had to go to the bathroom. A nurse had to help me. I couldn\u2019t use my right hand because it was almost paralyzed. My left was still somewhat working, but it was still extremely weak. \n\nI was alone at the ER, because everyone was at work. \nThe ER doctor asked me if I\u2019d had a cold recently, and I think she might\u2019ve mentioned gbs. I can\u2019t remember. \n\nI was given another CT scan, and then my mom showed up. She said if they didn\u2019t admit me then she would sue them. \n\nI was admitted, and given a bunch of tests. Multiple painful spinal taps, an EMG, and nerve conduction tests. It was all really painful. The needle sends an electric shock into your muscle. ( they were doing it to my right leg) also I was given breathing tests. I was hooked up to an EKG machine and IVs. One of the tests was squeezing a doctor\u2019s hands, but I couldn\u2019t really do it. \n\n\nI was getting bad extremely quickly at that point. The doctor asked me to raise my right arm, which I could barely do. It wouldn\u2019t stay up, and I was crying and freaking out. \nAt this point I couldn\u2019t turn over in bed or get out of bed. The nurses were all so nice. My back was so sweaty from being stuck in the same position. \n\nI was also afraid to go to sleep because my feet were starting to get tingly and numb. I was afraid I\u2019d wake up paralyzed. \nThey diagnosed me with gbs on my second night ( maybe third), and then put me on IVIG. \nThe night after the first dose I felt noticeably better. \n\n( This happened possibly before I was on IVIG) My fianc\u00e9, now husband, stayed over night for a couple nights. One day when he was there we decided to go to the cafeteria. I was wearing pajama pants and the hospital gown. I had all the wires attached to me. \n\nI was barely able to walk down the hallway, and when we got to the cafeteria it was like a jail escape lol. A nurse showed up rather quickly, and she was a really good sport about it. She understood and was very sweet. She had to push me up in a rolling chair. \n\nAfter the IVIG was started they would have me walk up and down the hallway with a belt around my torso so I wouldn\u2019t fall. It was terrifying. \n\nI was discharged after being on IVIG for 5 days. I felt a lot better, but I still couldn\u2019t walk up the stairs. I was crying and had to crawl to the couch. I was in PT for awhile. It took awhile for me to be able to get on my high bed, walk up the stairs ( I had to call 911 a couple times to get me in the house), and be able to get up without struggling. I wasn\u2019t able to get my strength back for almost 2 months. \n\nNow I\u2019m back to normal. When I get really bad colds my arm gets tingly, which the doctor said is normal. Gbs cannot be cured, and luckily I haven\u2019t relapsed. I was also lucky I got it from a respiratory virus and not a stomach virus. Gbs can be much more severe if you get it from a stomach virus. I\u2019m very lucky I didn\u2019t have bad long lasting damage. Just slight weakness on my right side. A lot of people aren\u2019t as lucky as me. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this post was so long. \n\n\n\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 172, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My story", "updated_utc": 1554268819, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/b4rarb/my_story/"}, {"author": "Owls1978", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ap2qj40", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1551852187, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/axvi6a/this_book_was_really_helpful_for_an_inside/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "axvi6a", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/axvi6a/this_book_was_really_helpful_for_an_inside/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1551852188, "score": 10, "selftext": "My SO\u2019s father noticed numbness at work in 1975.

I'm fairly convince of her diagnosis, but I think there's also something else going on. I remember reading a lot about a genetic condition that affects the body's ability to create/repair myelin, but I can't remember what it's called now, and I can\u2019t find any compelling evidence though internet research (without access to academic databases). I think she never had the DNA testing required to diagnosis it (I think because of the overlap in symptoms). Does anyone know what disease/condition/syndrome I\u2019m thinking of?\n\nWhen I started having mild neurological symptoms in my 20s, I was diagnosed with benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) and something about \"Martin Gruber.\" I think many of my symptoms were overlooked because I was also being diagnosed with spondylitis, spinal stenosis, and annular disc bulges at the time. My BFS has persisted for more than 5 years (my neurologist told me to expect the symptoms to subside in this time). I've been having trouble swallowing and even difficulty speaking at times (with a strange feeling just above the joint of my right collar bone in my neck). For example, two times this week I was speaking and suddenly could not half way through a sentence. I tried clearing my throat and coughing, but still could barely speak (laryngitis?).  Could these be signs of a degenerative neurological disease? I\u2019m trying to decide if it\u2019s time to talk to a neurologist again (it\u2019s been a decade). \n\nTL;DR: Grandpa had polio and post-polio syndrome, mom has CIDP, I have BFS.

He says music and tv give him a headache and he can\u2019t move around much, and I want to use my time with him to help him be more comfortable.

I type in Guillain Barre and there\u2019s a sub reddit. So my story starts in November, right before Thanksgiving. At this point I was running 5 miles every other day, weight training the other days and in pretty good shape physically for a 53 yr old man.I was having problems stretching and feeling extremely tired for a few weeks. I ended up getting severe headaches, followed by a severe rash and swollen Lymph Nodes. I was given a course of Prednisone, which I had a bad reaction to. By the time I was at the end of the course I couldn\u2019t walk.I ended up in the hospital for a couple days and I had MRI\u2019s, CT Scans, and X- rays done. I was released from the hospital because I was able to get around without falling after a few days and everyone assumed I had Lymphoma, so I had to get on board with an Oncologist. I had a pet scan done and was told it was most likely Lymphoma. My walking ended up getting worse and my back was killing me, I had pain shooting down my arms and legs and also couldn\u2019t feel my hands or feet so I ended up in the hospital again. I had more MRI\u2019s, and Ct scans done along with bloodwork, 2 Spinal Taps and had 2 Lymph Nodes removed. 2 weeks in the hospital and it was determined that I had no signs of Lymphoma but had elevated levels of protein in my spinal fluid and I was released because  my walking had improved and to get some out patient testing. I had  no diagnosis from Neurology, Oncology and Infectious Disease.. I had a follow up with Neurology and it was determined I had Guillain Barre. The swollen Lymph Nodes were from what they determined was Mono, which triggered the Guillain Barre. The rash was from some medication they gave me. It\u2019s been a crazy ride so far but at least I know what I\u2019m dealing with and no cancer. I can\u2019t believe how weak I still am after 2 months. Walking is still an issue, sometimes I feel like I can\u2019t get one foot in front of the other. My feet are still a bit numb and I\u2019m still in a good amount of pain. I also have some issues with uncontrollable shaking. PT 3 days a week along with home rehab. I feel like I\u2019m never going to recover, very frustrating but I\u2019m staying the course. They have me Neurontin, Lyrica, and Morphine to deal with the pain. I\u2019m hoping to improve a little quicker and get back to work but I\u2019m a slave to this thing.

High cholesterol. Borderline high bp.\n\nI'll start off by saying I never had any issues with body pain, tingling, nerve, muscle pain, headaches or anything like that before 4 months ago, I was nearly perfect (minus the diabetes, high cholesterol, and BP).\n\nSo 2-3 months ago. It started with left foot redness, then right foot redness. Then tingling. Then moved up the body towards arms, legs, back, head. Symptoms became progressively worse and graduated to numbness, muscle and nerve pain. Probably happened over a few days and weeks. Complete list of symptoms: burning, pain/ numbness in hands/feet/arms/legs, upper back pressure/pain, dizziness, headaches, changes in blood pressure (low dia), muscle/nerve pain, fatigue, trouble walking, throat stinging, soreness towards right and left jaw, fast heartbeat. Many of the symptoms were intermittent and they'd come and go randomly. After about 2 months many of the symptoms either went away completely or lessened in severity. The only symptoms that I seem to have now are just numbness in hands and feet, headaches/dizziness, low blood pressure (low dia), back pain/pressure.\n\nWhen it all started i went to 2 different hospitals that just gave a general diagnosis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, they didn't do much tests. I did a lot of stuff outpatient: emg, holter monitor, comprehensive blood work, x-ray, endocrinology consultation and they all said they couldn't find anything of concern. And they weren't able to offer a diagnosis. Primary care then referred me to a neurologist. Then I met the director of a neurology department that works with one of the hospitals that I went to. The neurologist was able to diagnose me with GBS after talking for 2 hours. She basically said I made good recovery, seeing as how my symptoms have seemed to have improved a lot on their own. She told me to check into the hospital and get IVIG therapy, which could speed up recovery. She calls the hospital neurologist that works under her and lets her know what's going on. Neurologist said they would do MRI and a bunch of other tests. I check into the hospital the next day. They didn't do any advanced tests at the hospital, such MRI or spinal test. My care team was an internal medicine doctor and a resident doctor. I overhead them talking outside of my door to their team of interns/other resident doctors and basically they were saying that I was faking my symptoms, I don't have GBS, I shouldn't get IVIG treatment. If he has anything it's probably just diabetes. Resident doctor went on to explain to the group that this is the first time I've seen someone misdiagnosed with GBS, he's probably just messed up from the diabetes. They tell me the risks of IVIG treatment and proceed with the treatment. They cut treatment short by 2 days and just send me on my way. They didn't tell me anything except follow up with  the neurologist and primary care. Discharge papers are worded weirdly and basically says based on neurologist instructions we gave you IVIG and you may or may not have GBS. \n\nSo here I am not know if the neurologist gave me the correct diagnosis and whether the IVIG will do more harm than good. I'm going to follow-up with my primary care and the neurologist. But, I'm also going to see a different neurologist (outpatient) through the other hospital that I went to (it's a world famous hospital if that matters) in order to see if they offer the same diagnosis. What do you guys make of this? Does this sound like GBS, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, or something else? \n\nNot looking for a diagnosis. Just want a dialogue.

A higher grade neurologist was called in and he confirmed the diagnosis, he said the spinal results being ok supported the diagnosis of it being mild. It was diagnosed as a mild case as it only affected her legs and hands (which I consider serious because she could not walk at all, not even stand up, move her feet or even toes) and it was said she would make a full recovery. She had IVIG treatment for 5 days and after seeing some positive results (being able to barely wiggle her toes, hand numbness slowly going away, upper legs slowly feeling less numb) we were sent home. \n\nFirst week home was great, her numbness was slowly getting better, her PT was going great even to the point of being able to walk with a walker without anybody having to hold her up, etc. however, the day after her most demanding PT day where where her body was pushed to limits she hadn't reached before, she could not walk at all due to pain in her feet. She says it's like a burning sensation with small needles stabbing her feet constantly as well as hypersensitivity. Because of this, her PT has regressed, she can no longer walk, and is only now beginning to stand up with help. The worst part of all is that her feet pain has gotten to the point where she can't sleep because the pain keeps waking her up.\n\nI wanted to know (if it is someone with a \"mild\" diagnoses even better) if as the doctor (not neurologist, will see him next month) told us, this burning and needle stabbing sensation and hypersensitivity is normal to have in a diagnosis like hers, especially since she was recovering quickly, but this last week has us a bit worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 583, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My girlfriend had/has GBS, I'm looking for information about the recovery process.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/jdcpye/my_girlfriend_hadhas_gbs_im_looking_for/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Slow-Bumblebee-3153", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8iacm2no", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1602972660, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/jd49uo/gbs_healing_process/", "gildings": {}, "id": "jd49uo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 22, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/jd49uo/gbs_healing_process/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1602972671, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi guys, I got out of the hospital 2 weeks ago after 5 day IVIG.

Luckily, I am a health care practitioner and was able to self diagnose using differential diagnosis and within a day of onset of symptoms was able to find my way to a hospital. \n\nRehab was long and tough (and *always* ongoing, am I right?). What sucks the most in the aftermath is the number of cramps I get per day. For the first 2 years, I would cramp nearly 100-200 times a day, often in places I'd never cramped before. The worst, though, are my cramps at night/morning. \n\nI'm working and am on my feet for at least 8 hours a day. When I come home, my routine has been to indulge in a rather large amount of smoked cannabis that cuts my cramps down to 10-15/day. \n\nI've decided to try and stop smoking cold Turkey in an attempt to not drive my body into the ground with all the lung/circulatory problems that come with smoking (oh, and I have hyperthyroidism so smoking is a big no no in the first place.)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's nearly day 6 since quitting smoking. I take tinctures but they do little, if at all. My topical cannabis creams thankfully dull the painful sensations of cramping (absolutely fascinating btw, would recommend for anyone rehabbing from any type of injury or illness to prevent overwork commonly associated with taking painkillers). But as I'm about to drift to sleep, I will get the **fattest** cramps in my tibialis anterior, gastrocs, or quads. It's been keeping me up at night and in the mornings, bilateral cramps in all 3 muscles are common. I arrived to work 30 min late because I physically could not get out of bed, for every micro movement triggered a massive cascade of bilateral cramps in all 3 muscle groups listed above. I couldn't even reach for the cannabis cream and Mohrus tape I keep on my nightstand. \n\n\n&amp;nbps;\n\nWhat are your go to meds/remedies for cramping? I'd appreciate non-prescription suggestions and would greatly appreciate more natural solutions. Obviously, I stretch every day and I even use the theragun for 1-1.5 hrs after work to loosen up the muscles. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn a final note, I'd like to express my sympathies for the female sex. A month ago, I experienced what was probably the closest to a menstrual cramp in my lower pelvic wall. HOLY HELL is it debilitating. I doubled over and could not move for a solid 15 minutes. \n\nOn a final, final note, I would seriously recommend smoking cannabis or eating edibles as a solid solution. It's been a blessing that I've lived in a legal state the past 2 years. High quality medical cannabis (yes, GBS is a qualifying condition for a prescription) has increased the quality of my life, albeit with some other health drawbacks. Depending on the strain, cannabis itself may not stop the cramps but it definitely changes how your brain perceives it. No longer is a cramp a debilitating pulse of fiery pain. Instead, it is a more dull tightness that nags the sides of your consciousness. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn a final, final, final note, I'm curious. What does this sub think is the most debilitating cramp? A tibialis anterior cramp or a quad cramp? Both are nearly impossible to stretch out when supine and my god, they are just so ever persistent! My vote goes to quad cramps as they are harder to stretch while in bed. For tib anterior cramps I just roll over and use the bed to plantar flex my foot against the bed to stretch out the cramp.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 577, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What are your tips and tricks to prevent the inevitable night and morning cramps?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/j91hro/what_are_your_tips_and_tricks_to_prevent_the/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "NatashaR933", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ib8j6n0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1602095771, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/j6wiyf/nerve_pain/", "gildings": {}, "id": "j6wiyf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 22, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/j6wiyf/nerve_pain/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1602095782, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone!

He was in Myrtle Beach on vacation with my mom at the time, woke up the first morning they were down there and had no feeling in his feet / lower legs and was very weak, couldn't walk on his own.  Was in the ER / ICU down there for a few days progressively getting worse despite a few rounds of IVIG treatment (they suspected GBS after a day and started the infusions but weren't able to completely confirm the diagnosis despite a spinal tap and lumbar puncture among other tests).  He wasnt getting any better (lost hand and arm movement, and was starting to have breathing problems so he got intubated) and they wanted to move him to a more serious facility so we had him flown back home to Ohio to the Cleveland Clinic. They are a pretty kickass Hospital system and some of the family lives about 15 minutes from the Main Campus in downtown Cleveland so Mom has a close place to stay. \n\n They've been doing plasmapheresis treatments on him, to some better results.  He's able to move his arms and shoulders, hand control is still a bit wonky but he can mostly point to stuff now (has an alphabet board and spells things out to communicate because he's been intubated for the past 11 days). Has very minimal movement in 1 leg, nothing in the other so far but can tell when you are touching both feet so thats atleast something.  They've been doing stretches and some basic PT in his bed with him and he has those leg sleeves on to help with the muscles and cramping as well.  Breathing was getting better but now its started to go downhill again unfortunately.  We were hoping to get him off the intubation but doesnt seem like that will be in the cards just yet.   He's had high blood pressure and is borderline diabetic so managing both of those on top of this has been a challenge for the doctors apparently.  And as if this all wasn't enough, they've found inflammation and lesions on his spinal cord, and a few on his liver as well so we're awaiting biopsy and PET scan results on those and just hoping for the best right now because we've got enough on our plates with all the rest of this :(     \n\n\nHe was a mailman for 30 years, walking his route every day.  It blows my mind that of all people, he can be the one to suddenly lose the use of his legs like this.  His calves are the size of my thighs!  Hes a typical stubborn Italian gentleman so naturally hes a stubborn terrible patient lol but seeing him completely laid up like this after 2 weeks and still in real trouble is.....I don't really have the words for it.  \n\nSo, any of you survivors or family members that have had any similar experiences with serious hospital stays want to share?

Last year our then 19 year old daughter caught a bad cold in her first few days at university and soon after found her walking ability started to deteriorate.\n\nThat progressed to losing the ability for both eyes to look the same way and she lost focus when looking at things and ultimately could not walk unaided or could not stand bright lights or read or even feed herself and she also lost her reflexes which still haven\u2019t come back 11 months later. \n\nShe was diagnosed with Miller Fisher Syndrome which I understand is a rare variant of Guillain-Barre Syndrome. \n\nShe had four IVIG treatments and left hospital after about ten days and slowly has made it back to normal. \n\nShe dropped out of her course at university and is due to start a new course later this month. \n\nHowever since becoming ill these things have changed:\n\n1. She has irregular periods, often up to a month late. \n\n2. She overheats so we can be walking the dog and the rest of us have a coat on and she is wearing a T-shirt. \n\n3. Her face became more round. \n\n4. She put on weight around her tummy only and often has bloating issues after eating only a small amount of food. \n\n5. She has stretch marks on her stomach and legs. \n\n6. She is often very low emotionally and finds it hard to react to small things going wrong without taking it personally and seeing it as more evidence of why she is rubbish etc. \n\nSome of the above are symptoms for Cushings but she has had blood tests for that and all came back normal. \n\nI wondered if anyone else has suffered with any of the above after their illness?\n\nDespite any evidence to the contrary our daughter will not give herself a break at all and insists any changes are due to her low amount of willpower and over eating despite the fact she eats no more than the rest of the people in her family.\n\nIt may be even if people here respond to say they had the same issues she won\u2019t take any comfort from that but I feel compelled to act from the point of view of a concerned parent.\n\nAny advice would be very much appreciated. \n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 536, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Weight gain after illness?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/ikj9xo/weight_gain_after_illness/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "nonebiz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5yryv6ma", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1598191923, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/if3ujf/delayed_treatment_of_guillainbarre/", "gildings": {}, "id": "if3ujf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/if3ujf/delayed_treatment_of_guillainbarre/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1598191934, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey everyone!

Encouraging words are also welcome, and honestly really needed right now.  Along with being scared, I'm feeling really discouraged with my treatments apparently failing, and the rollercoaster of emotions I've been on from feeling great to feeling horrible again has really done a job on my mental health.\n\nI apologise in advance, but this is going to be a long one.  I've included a TL;DR at the bottom for those who don't want to read the whole thing.  \n\nIn September I noticed that my arms felt weaker.  It started off so small, just noticing that my purse felt a little heavier (it's a heavy tote anyway), and that when doing a little more in the shower (added a body conditioner, so literally just a little more using my arms to rub it all over me) made my arms feel fatigued.  At first I thought that I was just loosing muscle, because I had stopped working a physically strenuous job, and wasn't working out, so I wasn't alarmed.\n\nHowever, every day the weakness got slowly, but progressively, worse and worse until I couldn't raise my hands above my shoulders.  I also began noticing that getting up from a sitting position was becoming difficult, too (I have single floor living, so I wasn't doing anything like stairs, just flat walking, so maybe that's why I didn't notice them right away.).  I went to my PC, and he did a bunch of blood work (all came back normal), and referred me to a neurologist.  While waiting for the neurologist appointment (about 3 weeks away) I continued to worsen.  It felt like I had wrist and ankle weights on that just continued to get heavier and heavier every day.\n\nFour days before my appointment I called the neurologist, and asked to come in sooner, because I had gotten so bad that I was falling (just from getting tripped up, like a toe getting caught on a stair, and not having the strength to catch myself, and not light-headedness, or balance issues), and I was unable to stand on my own from a sitting position, or from falling.  As a matter of fact, I called and asked because I couldn't stand up from the toilet that day, and had to crawl to a bedroom chair to hoist myself up!  He of course told me to go to the ER.\n\nAt the hospital I had X-rays, a MRI, a Spinal tap, and more blood work, but everything again came back normal.  The only thing showing this wasn't just in my head was that ONLY ONE of my reflexes worked (my left ankle reflex).  That of course explained why the last few times I had fallen that I landed on my face! \ud83e\udd26 Then I got an EMG, and while I could feel all the sensations, but my body didn't respond at all.  I just lay there completely still getting jolted and pricked.  I also never felt any numbness or tingling anywhere on my body.  They didn't know what it was, but decided to try treating me with IVIG.  \n\nI had 5 days of IVIG (25 grams a day), and on the morning of the 3rd day (even before treatment), I greeted my doctors by waving hi with my hands above my head!  Of course I was elated, and so we're they!  I went home, and was fine, until 6 weeks later, on Thanksgiving day in fact, I felt the faint weakness starting again.  My heart sunk.  My doctor diagnosed me with CIDP, and I went back to the hospital, where again I got treated with IVIG (this time for 3 days, 25 grams each).   \n\nAgain, I recovered fully after the IVIG treatment, and was set up to be infused every 4 weeks.  This is when it gets interesting/unusual, and in my case devastating.  The first month went great.  I got my IVIG (doc prescribed 2 days of 40 grams each going forward) just as I was feeling the weakness return, and again recovered fully.  However, every month after that my symptoms began returning every 16-18 days, and by the time for my treatment I was back to not being able to stand on my own.  \n\nThe doctor tried upping the IVIG first (40 grams to 50), but when that didn't change anything I went to the 50 grams every 3 weeks.  The hope was that since I would be getting IVIG before my symptoms got as bad as they'd been getting, that my body had less healing to do, and the IVIG would be able to work longer.  The first two months with the new schedule was great again, and I didn't feel symptoms return at all before my next treatment. \n\nUnfortunately, once again, my symptoms returned.  This time just 14 days from my treatment.  It also began taking longer for me to bounce back, and begin to feel my \"strength\" return after IVIG.  In the last 2 treatments (still 2 days of 50 grams each) I've recovered less and less after each treatment, and still start getting weaker again at 14 days.\n\nI normally have a positive attitude about getting sick.  I found it to be a huge wake up call on how in the blink of the eye your whole world can change.  I don't take for granted the things and people that I did before this reality check, and I'm super grateful for that, but it's getting harder and harder to be positive with things that were working, not working as well anymore.  I tell myself someone else has it worse, and to be grateful that I'm still able to do what I can do, but I feel like this condition/virus keeps getting stronger, like it's building resistance to the IVIG, and I'm afraid of how bad it's going to get.  \n\nAs soon as I start feeling weakness I want to stop doing everything that I don't have to do that requires moving my arms much, because it's just a constant reminder of my current state.  I end up watching TV, going on social media, or reading a book.  Nothing productive, and with wanting to stay safe from the pandemic, there isn't anything to do but hang out at home anyway.  So that's what I do.  All day, everyday.  Day, after day, after day, and it doesn't look like it's going to be able to change anytime soon.  \n\nI don't want to live like this, and be a physical burden for my husband (he has to shower me, pick me up from sitting, and even cut up my food for days before my treatments) even though he never complains, and I know he loves me deeply.  I don't know what to do.\n\nThose who get IVIG treatments, how long between treatments do you go, and how many days in a row do you do?  \n\nAnyone else have an autoimmune related condition that's had successful, alternative treatments like Ozone Therapy?\n\nHave any of you had their condition get worse and worse, even though your treatment was technically working to improve your symptoms?  \n\nLastly, does anyone have any suggestions of what to do for the despair, or that helped them lift their mood?  \n\nTl;dr: I was diagnosed with (CIDP-also known as Chronic Guillian Barre Syndrome) that seems to be becoming progressively resistant to IVIG treatment.  Looking for advice on why/how/what might be happening, how others get their IVIG treatments, and how to beat feeling bored, depressed, and sorry for myself.\n\nThank you all for your time, especially those who read the whole thing (god I can't believe how long it really is!!!), and also in advance for your responses.

I've been reading through this sub and it sounds like you're a group of exceptional people. There is a lot of strength in here. I thought I'd pop in to say hi, share a bit of my story and hang around for a bit! It's been 17 years since my bout with GBS and I've found myself thinking back a lot recently. If any one wants to chat to me about being a long way down the line from GBS, or anything at all, then feel really welcome. Please do.\n\nRecently I've wanting to reconnect with my experiences of it, and how it's lead me to be the person I am today. I also recovered from COVID in April, and that definitely has led me to think about life a bit! \n\nI got AIDP in 2003, when I was 13, off of the back of Laryngitis. This was in a very small town in NZ, and no one had a clue what was going on. GBS was known about but they had disregarded it because I was so young. Within a day I had major weakness, and I was put into quarantine at hospital for 5 days while they tried to understand what was happening - I wasn't able to see any one, and the paralysis went through my limbs. Fortunately my torso wasn't greatly effected and I was able to breathe/digest unassisted. It was servere, but I was spared from how severe it can get. \n\nI had a 9 month recovery period, which was made challenging by the fact that few of my health providers had encountered GBS. So there was a fair bit of guess work going on. I'm super tall as well,  by 13 I was 182cm / 6\" tall, and over those 9 months I grew another 4cm / inch and a half. So that definitely complicated things.\n\nI recovered though, missed a year of high school but was able to come back. A downside from the health care was that once I was walking well enough again, the rehab pretty much stopped. I had really significant muscle atrophe, and a long term impact was that my feet became deformed because my leg muscles didn't redevelop with the proper balance.\n\nToday I'm 2m / 6\"7 and I lead a normal life. About 18 months ago though I had a foot reconstruction, because walking was becoming really challenging due to my feet. What was crazy was when I woke from the anaesthetic, there was another guy opposite me in the room. He had just been diagnosed with GBS and was in his second day at hospital, what are the chances. I wish I had kept in touch with the guy.\n\nThe reconstruction worked well though, really well.  Since then I've been able to exercise, I've found a love for running, and I've just signed up for a half marathon in November (I'm in New Zealand, we are so fortunate to have no community transmission of COVID here, and life is relatively normal). So lets do this.\n\nLooking back, my young self was a smiley kid. I quietly got on with things. Or that's how my brain has chosen to paint the picture. But as I'm opening up, I'm properly getting to appreciate the impact of it on those who were around me.\n\nSo, this ended up way longer than I'd intended. But it's felt great to write this. It's been a strange comfort to me to read your stories, hear your thoughts, because I've never spoken much about this. To those of you who are experiencing GBS right now, I wish I could easily offer the same comfort, but I know each case can fall on such an incredible spectrum of unique. Maybe you may relate to some of this, maybe not.\n\nBut for me, this too did pass, and I've lead a rich life so far. If there's any way that talking to me could help, even if it's to just pass the time, then again please do feel welcome.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 507, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Just found this sub - amazing", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/i2byn6/just_found_this_sub_amazing/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "StarmanMD", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2pp86vqd", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1596144194, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/i0uj2g/can_you_share_your_recovery_time/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i0uj2g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 22, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/i0uj2g/can_you_share_your_recovery_time/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1596144204, "score": 1, "selftext": "well, I still have residual weakness in my feet 7 months after the paralysis started. and I'm extremely worried that I'm not gonna recover completely. so can anyone please share their time of recovery just to know the ranges between different people? thank you &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 502, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "can you share your recovery time?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/i0uj2g/can_you_share_your_recovery_time/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Sir-RokoDoko", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_drdtlxs", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1596004476, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/hzvqs8/i_just_wrote_about_my_recovery_and_it_helped_me/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hzvqs8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "5d81c60a-194c-11e9-baa4-0e6d6856fb3e", "link_flair_text": "Improvement and Recovery", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/hzvqs8/i_just_wrote_about_my_recovery_and_it_helped_me/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1596004486, "score": 1, "selftext": "For some background, im a 16 year old male who was diagnosed with CIDP (not guillan-barre but very similar) 3 years ago.

I wanted any background that might be relevant. If something seems like what I\u2019ve been going through is for sure *not* CIDP I would like that advice as well. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong and trying to be the most prepared before I add to my never ending medical debt. \n\nI am a 30F.  I have been mostly healthy my whole life. I suffer from a \u201cNOS Sleep disorder\u201d since I was 16 (aka something is wrong, but I don\u2019t check enough boxes to fit into one. I have horrible sleep paralysis, insomnia, and excessive daytime sleepiness/lethargy.  \nThey were thinking Narcolpsy, but I dont have Cataplexy and didn\u2019t hit REM enough times during my sleep study. My neurologist at the time told me I was \u201cnormal enough\u201d he didn\u2019t feel the need to pursue a diagnosis that could potentially limit my ability to drive and scared 16 yr old me into not wanting to pursue a name to my issue. // At 24 i started having symptoms of Gastroparesis (where my stomach want emptying properly), but when I had the function test done my stomach emptied exactly 3% to well to be diagnosed. My luck.  Like many with GP after about 2 years it almost totally went away and I do suffer from cyclic vomiting disorder but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s connected to anything?. /// At 28 I was in my final year at graduate school (stressful sure, but really enjoyed what I was doing and wasn\u2019t overly stressed) and began to have what I thought was carpel tunnel. Went to the orthopedist and it wasn\u2019t carpel tunnel.  He made a joke about \u201ccommitting me\u201d when I tried to describe that my hands felt like an old fuzzy TV. Static-y.  (Numb, but I could tell where they are in space, electric pain....I thought it was a good description) anyways he just said it wasn\u2019t \u201cortho related\u201d and sent me on my way. After that appointment, the numbness and pins-&amp;-needles in both hands slowly started going up my arms till it hit just above my elbows. I couldn\u2019t tell temperatures, my dexterity was gone, and the electric type pain was awful. Then my feet started going numb. That was really scary.  I was falling over and just in pain all over. The lethargy was awful. I am on a stimulant for my sleep disorder and I couldn\u2019t overcome the lethargy even taking a double dose of my stimulant!!!  My primary care doctor ordered an MRI and that came back normal except for a few white Matter lesions, but not enough to indicate MS.  My doctor had my back though and he knew something was up that was beyond his scope so he helped me get into an autoimmune clinic in FL. It took over two months for the appointment and my primary hated the pain I was in, so he did some research and put me on a pretty rigorous steroid treatment for 13 days.  It really helped. By the time I saw the specialist (who was the clinic\u2019s MS doctor and she basically only did MS)  I was about 60% better.  The specialist was less than kind. She reviewed my MRI and said the same thing, not enough for a diagnosis and I didn\u2019t have all the Classic MS symptoms. (My main ones were the peripheral numbness, pain, and lethargy which could be explained away by my not-defined sleep disorder).  She ordered an MRI of my cervical vertebrae, which came back normal. She ordered about 5 more tests, but then I lost my insurance and couldn\u2019t afford the tests. When I called about 6 months later to explain that and get new scripts for the tests after I got new insurance I was basically told \u201cif it wasn\u2019t important to get the tests done when she ordered them last time then it must not impact me very much\u201d. Which was a big slap in my face./// Despite that, my primary care doctor has been great. He is the one that posed the possibility of CIDP to me. It seems to fit a lot of my symptoms.  While I have almost fully recovered from my episode in 2018 (it lasted for about 6 months at it worst, and got better over another following 6). Where I am now, 2 years out, is I still have numbness in my right pinky and ring finger.  I never fully regained my dexterity in either hand and drop things a lot more\u2014&amp; I can\u2019t tell temperature with my hands very well. I also have pain that will come if I use my hands too much or if I get sick and it\u2019ll last for about for about 2 weeks in both hands, but then it\u2019ll go away.  My feet I don\u2019t notice as many issues with them, they\u2019re mostly on the numb side but they don\u2019t have pain. /// my primary care doctor wants me to find a specialist to get formally diagnosed, but I don\u2019t even know where to start. My experience with adult neurologists has been really bad and everyone is so specialized now that if you don\u2019t fit exactly what they know then they want to pass you off.  Any advice on how your road to a CIDP diagnosis went would be great (tests to ask for, specialties to look for in a doctor)....I may not have CIDP, but I hate living in fear that what happened in 2018 will happen again and I don\u2019t have a game plan for it.

This past year, I had what was the start of the worst experience I have ever experienced in my 26 years of life. One day, I started experiencing nausea and vomiting. I had what I thought was food poisoning. It became clear that this wasn\u2019t the case. The vomiting continued for three weeks. I was unable to eat or drink anything without vomiting. I also was unable to work. During this three week period, I had six emergency room visits, four visits with PCP or specialist, two CT scans, ultrasound, upper GI series, and an EGD. Doctors were unable to determine the cause of my vomiting and nausea. The vomiting eventually stopped and I started to recover.\n\nTowards the end of my stomach issues, I started experiencing a tingling feeling in my feet and legs. That tingling quickly turned to a sharp pins and needles pain. I then started experiencing weakness and I was having trouble balancing and walking. From there, I couldn\u2019t walk without my knees buckling. I started to experience a severe pain in my legs and feet. The pain was worse at night and I was having a difficult time sleeping. I soon lost the ability to walk and had to use a wheelchair. I started feeling the tingling in my hands and arms. Not long after that, my abdomen felt numb. Eventually, it was determined that I have Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), which is a disorder in which your body's immune system attacks your nerves and leads to paralysis.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most pleasant thing in the word. What\u2019s worst is it\u2019s really rare (fewer than 20,000 cases a year) and I haven\u2019t had the fortune of being in an area where there are tons of experts. In fact, by the time I was diagnosed properly, it was said by the amazing neurologist that I finally found that I was just a couple of days away from the paralysis caused by GBS spreading into my diaphragm. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to breathe and would be put on a ventilator. Something that unfortunately happens to many GBS patients.\n\nFast forward to present day and nearly a year since having IVIG treatment for GBS. I am now able to walk after being in intensive inpatient rehab for 3 weeks and having outpatient physical therapy 3 times a week for several months. The numbness and tingling has moved down my body and is now below my knees (GBS works from the toes up and as you recover, it works it\u2019s way down the body).\n\nHers my cry for help: I am in pain. I am in constant pain and discomfort. I take Gabapentin for nerve pain 4 times a day and it doesn\u2019t seem like enough. My feet are so sensitive that I can step on a crumb and it literally feels like I have stepped on several shards of broken glass. My toes are so sensitive that it hurts to even put tennis shoes on.

The following day his entire torso was numb and his hands and feet were worse.  He described the feeling as pins and needles.  We grew increasingly more concerned and ended up in the ER for MRI\u2019s all night.  They gave us a promise that a neurologist would be able to see him right away on Monday (this occurred through Saturday night).  They were unable to diagnose the issue but most likely ruled out MS.  \n\nMonday came and the neurologist was unable to see him until next Wednesday.  At this point his symptoms in hands and feet had worsened, and it had spread to his legs.  On Tuesday we decided to go to a different ER, and they were able to bring a neurologist in.  They said it\u2019s possibly GB, and that with time his symptoms would worsen, but they would grow until a plateau stage, at which point they would start to get better.\n\nIn the meantime we\u2019ve been cutting out our vigorous exercise routine, and trying to ice his back just in case this is from some sort of inflammation (as nothing is certain).\n\nI personally am trying my best to support him through this.  It hurts my heart when he wakes up and each day tells me it\u2019s a little worse.  I want to find a balance between him being independent and feeling like he can rely on me without me being overbearing.  I mostly just try my best to be there emotionally, be as understanding as possible (even though I know I cannot hope to understand) and let him know I love him very much.  We\u2019ve been holding hands lately because the sensation of touch in these numb areas is uncomfortable.  \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how I can best help?

I know you won't be dx without MRI or lumbar puncture and nerve conduction study. How long did it take to get officially dx. I'm so nervous and am not sure if the aniexty of it all is making me think I'm getting worse and/ or noticing every little thing.

Flu-like symptoms.  Fever.  Cough.  Mucus.  You name it.\n\nI eventually developed slight vertigo which turned into ear pressure and facial tension.\n\nBy mid February, I had massive head pressure and a lightheaded feeling.  \n\nThe vertigo would go away from my eyes but the pressure was so intense in my head that I went to urgent care.\n\nThe doctor said it was a migraine.  Which is laughable to me.\n\nEventually, I saw my doctor who said it could be a middle/inner ear infection.\n\nHe prescribed me nasal sprays, amoxicillin, antihistamines, etc.  it didn\u2019t help.\n\n\nNow since then I\u2019ve developed some odd sensations to accommodate my head pressure.\n\nBurning feet.  Tingling fingers.  Numb hands when I sleep.  Weak legs.  Burning sensations everywhere and across my chest. Back pain.\n\nThe worst one is heart palpitations.  Especially after eating a meal (not as hungry lately).  My heart beats louder anytime I move or start feeling these nerves overreact.\n\nIt feels like inflammation or poison all over my body.\n\nNow my question is how can this happen? This all started with the flu and slight vertigo.  Then it turned into something completely different.\n\nMy vertigo even went away! Which gave me hope.  Instead i got a whole new array of symptoms.\n\nI was doing some heavy research and noticed my upper neck towards my right ear felt numb or rather swollen, jelly-like.  I think it\u2019s called the vagus nerve.  Anyways anytime I apply pressure on there, I can feel my head tense up.\n\nThe vagus nerve also controls most parts of the digestive, arms/hands and heart.  So that could explain the palpitations and tingling.\n\nNow my question is can an inner ear infection cause all of this? I was healthy leading up to the new year now all of a sudden I\u2019m sick all over.\n\nI was able to go to the gym 4 times out of 7, now I can barely walk without feeling lightheaded, with shortness of breath.\n\nDoes this sound like an autoimmune response? Virus? \n\nAnd since it\u2019s only been two months, can I recover from something at this level? \n\nI appreciate any response.

My mom is 58 years old and was diagnosed with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome back in 2008. My mom has always been a tough (grew up in Iowa on a farm) and smart woman raising 5 kids pretty much by herself while my father was out being untrustworthy and scamming people as a auto mechanic. My mom separated from him back in 2010 and was left with nothing due to my father disappearing. My mom was forced to file for food stamps which she always thought to be embarrassing and had to put her pride aside for her kids since she couldn't obtain a job due to her illness messing with her physical and mental state at the time. The food stamp agency told her she had to be in school or to get a job to obtain them so she always wanted to be in the medical field so she started Massage Therapy school and was hoping to make a career out of it. My mom has been working out every morning at home for the past 12 years and shes in the best shape I've seen of any woman in their 50's. Eats healthy, never consumes junk food or much sugar. Recently she started obtaining pain in her lower back about a year ago and i know its bad because I've never seen my mom cry before. The massage parlor she works at treats her bad and doesn't offer benefits but works with her schedule and shes starting to be in severe pain while massaging others. She filed for the free medical visits at a small Community Hospital but does not do anything for her and they only happen every 8 months. My siblings and I try to convince her to file for disability but she seems to be to embarrassed to file for it claiming other deserving people need it. That's a little info about my moms background.\n\nI'm 26 years old and i'm going to school full time while in the Army National Guard. I have Tricare Reserve through the National Guard and looked into adding her to my insurance which they have the option to but theirs no point since they have a very small limit of what they can do for my mom. The other option I've been thinking about is volunteering for a deployment since i read my health insurance while on active duty is better then the reserve insurance. I've tried looking into other options but thought id try making a post on Reddit to learn from other people experiences or to gain more knowledge on the situation.

Now I'm feeling better, but about three days ago started to have a pins and needles feeling in my feet and hands, as well as a cool numb feeling in different parts of my body but mostly my legs... shooting pain as well. I called my doctor and he told me I was probably exhausted from the illness and to take magnesium. Meanwhile I googled my symptoms and...here I am. I've since talked to my doctor a second time and basically because of the current crisis he says to sit tight and not to go the hospital unless I'm in respiratory distress. I think he's too focused on the covid19 diagnosis and frankly I'm scared something else is going on. Your thoughts? I think I'm just going to call the neurology department of my hospital tomorrow but there is no guarantee I can talk to someone.

I separated from the military a few days later (bad timing right), and now I have no income and no insurance. I\u2019m set to get a pneumonia checkup with a low income clinic two days from now, and I\u2019ll mention my symptoms. \n\nWoke up about 4 days ago with horrible nerve pain/tingling down both arms. (No numbness?) I thought I would wait til Friday to mention it, it could be anything. Yesterday my legs started feeling it too, only slightly, so I brushed it off. Today I can\u2019t ignore the electrical/burning pain shooting down my inner thighs when I walk, and the soreness in my outer thighs.\n\nI\u2019m highly considering going to the hospital (ER) tonight. I started thinking (symmetrical sudden onset nerve pain? After the Flu? It\u2019s getting worse?) it could be Guillain-Barre. \n\nShould I go to the hospital tonight and start running tests? Symptoms have been going on for about 4 days. Or can I wait til Friday to mention it to a much cheaper doctor? Would I stop breathing overnight? I don\u2019t have any numbness. I know the internet says \u201cit takes a few weeks to plateau\u201d but. In your experience, can I wait 2 days, or should I take on the hospital bills uninsured? My other concern is that it\u2019s too early for the spinal tap to register any high protein levels... and wasting money on one. \n\nIf you read this, thank you so much.

If you are willing, it would also be great if you could describe how long after the vaccine you got the diagnosis, what your disease progression was like, and whether you have had any bad experiences with vaccines afterwards. \n\nThank you :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 1200, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for other people with potentially vaccine-induced GBS", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/s31cgo/looking_for_other_people_with_potentially/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Zealousideal_Jump774", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_eu2ltz9m", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1642017684, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/s2fenk/another_update/", "gildings": {}, "id": "s2fenk", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/s2fenk/another_update/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1642017694, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m done letting gbs control my life.

I had GBS back in 2017 when I was 21 years ago. I was paralyzed in my legs and arms. After my recovery I only had lingering tingling in my hands/feet for a couple months. It has back 4 years and I am suddenly experiencing nerve pain in both my legs. I did not have any pain when I had GBS. It was quite the opposite as I felt nothing at all (except the tingling that occurred before the paralysis and after my recovery.) Could this nerve pain somehow be GBS related? I was lucky to have a very successful recovery back when I had it and was even exercising about a year later. I am a bit anxious right now about this and would love to hear your thoughts.

Have since experienced numbness and tingling on my back, calves, hands and feet, stabbing pains on hands and feet, increasing weakness, difficulty drawing straight lines and opening packages, and abnormal sensations throughout body. My patellar reflex is present right now, unclear if it\u2019s diminished or not. Normal B12, HA1C and TSH. \n\nOn December 2nd, I started feeling tingling in my hand and legs, and I haven\u2019t felt normal since then. The tingling lasted several days and then mostly went away, but not completely (it still shows up sometimes, almost always in my feet, but is now easily relieved when I change position). \n\nAbout a week after the tingling started, I noticed that I\u2019m weaker than usual. I was holding a cup of coffee with my left hand, and it felt heavier than cups of coffee usually do. I also have some difficulty opening packages that were easy for me to open before. \n\nI walk very little, so it\u2019s hard to assess how my ability to walk has changed, but I do feel like my legs feel weirder than usual, perhaps the left more than the right. \n\nOh, also, I now feel some strange sensations around my body often. They feel as if someone splashed water on my skin or something, and last a few seconds at a time. \n\nI also get shooting, stabbing pains that last a few seconds in very random places (e.g. my tongue and right middle finger). I\u2019ve also experienced longer-lasting strong pain since my symptoms started, in my right hand and then left foot.  \n\nAlso, I feel like drawing straight lines (with my right hand) is harder than usual. I\u2019m a physics minor, so I draw coordinate axes all the time, and recently it\u2019s been taking me a few tries to get them to look neat. \n\nI got my Moderna booster (after being initially vaccinated with Pfizer) and flu shot on November 15th, both at the same time.  The timeline of my symptoms seems compatible with GBS, so this makes me wonder if I should go to the ER. \n\nI have sought medical attention, but only before the onset of weakness. One of the things my doctor brought up was MS, so I will get a brain MRI and EMG test on Thursday. I\u2019ve had a lot of blood tests, including for B12 and diabetes, all came back normal.\n\nAt the moment, I still have a patellar reflex (I made my boyfriend test it) but we\u2019re not doctors, so we don\u2019t know if my reflexes are diminished.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 1165, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "GBS or MS?

My timeline has looked like this \n\n-first week a fatigue and foot numbness \n-second week tingling numbness spreads and noticeable difference in balance when walking and weakness\n-third week some ice pick headaches, twitches, and muscle spasms with significant decline in walking and arm mobility\n-fourth week less spams and twitches, but persistent numbness and need to walk with a cane. intense fatigue and weakness. arms substantially weaker.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten an MRI as my doctor thought it may be MS, but it came up clear and my numbness is not exclusive to one side. My PCP mentioned that, although very rare, it could possibly be CIPD since my symptoms are too mild and slow for guillain barre. I am seeing a neurologist in two weeks but in the meantime wanted to see if my experiences sounded similar to those who have had CIDP. I especially want to know if any facial numbness was/are experienced along with any twitches or spasms. \n\nAlso if anyone experienced these symptoms after getting botox injections or flu shot. Those both happened about 1 1/2 months ago although they could be totally unrelated.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 1137, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "CIDP Experiences", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/qularq/cidp_experiences/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "xkrysowskix", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_a9e150cb", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1636932483, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/qu2f56/lyme_or_gbs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "qu2f56", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "373b26d0-1947-11e9-8629-0efccfe053d4", "link_flair_text": "Questions", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/qu2f56/lyme_or_gbs/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1636932495, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm new here and need some advice. Almost exactly 1 year ago I was bitten by the tick. Ofc I was worried since I know how dangerous can untreated lyme be. 4 weeks after the bite i started to develope tingling feeling in my limbs, than my balance turned off (I felt like I'm 'near my body' while moving) and the last thing was extreme weakness in legs which was constanly getting worse to the point when I went upstairs and could barely move my legs. Ofc I thought I have lyme, went to the doc, he told me to do the test which was negative but he gave me a 3 weeks of doxy just In case. It didn't help at all. After browsing the web I thought that IDSA treatment is not effective so I chose so called Lyme Literate Doc and started 3 antibiotics at once since I believed that's the only way to improve, but... as You can guess already I didn't at all after 3 months of abx. In the meantime I developed weird 'eye lag' feeling, like my eyes are to slow to record faster moves and pain in the bottom of the foot (it comes and goes). And here I am after a year with heavy legs (not as bad as it were), eye lag, foot pain and feeling off-balance. I've done whole tick-transmitted disease panel and the only positive one was Mycoplasma, which - I found - can cause GBS flare... Do you think it may be it? Any of you Had the same or similiar story? Should I visit neurologist for any kind of treatment or it's pointless at this point? Thanks in advance!

Doc says GBS but I don't have enough to admit you so your going home with generic muscle weakness diagnoses, come back if it gets worse..... it is.  I forgot to mention in the main also trouble swallowing to a small extent.\n\nThis just happened with me, Weakness started 48 hours ago, already have nerve injury in back and left leg, so live with pins and needles on left foot, or rather when you've been outside too long in the winter and you freeze your hands and when they start to warm up again you get that excruciating pain, and significant muscle weakness in right leg that wasn't there before and left leg more so than usual, so Pain in both legs that's not usual. So Both feet painful pins and needles and muscle aches both legs not usual strange but hey I've got to wait for my disc to fuse together naturally anyway because I'm not a candidate for spinal surgery so I'm used to all sort of weird crap. that sums up Saturday.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSunday wake up 3:30 Am, reach over for glass of water as soo as it slide off the edge of my nightstand and its full weight is then on my hand it shoots right out of it and hits the floor. Have bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, assume it was that go to reach down and try to pick it up Ow f@#\\* OW OW OW what the jeebus is going on sharp ache? if there is such a thing in the muscles in my arms ok maybe i was sleeping on it.  Reach for glass its like its glued to the floor. Ok something is up try and get back on bed arms barely working, legs are 50% at best right now on a good day.  Wind up face first on the floor....  Ok wake up wife, take my pain meds well two because screw whatever dumpster fire my body  has created.  A good dose of oxy should clear this right up anything that survives 60 mg warrants some attention. I'm on it daily anyway for a l5 S1 injury,  doesn't make a difference. Ok well lets just go ahead and start throwing a little of everything at it, valium, another oxy, 800 more mgs gabapentin, Flexeril, all i wind up with is a dry mouth so bad its like glue. Oh and throw in a side of difficulty swallowing.  \n\nOk time to take this seriously, have a medical background. Know what GBS is and that's its auto immune but that's about it. I more know how to treat a sucking chest wound in the field with a piece of plastic a pen tube and some tape if I'm out of 19 gauge needles.   Fire up the interwebs, hit up a trusted symptom checker pop everything in:  Strong probability of GBS, yeah whatever I must have jacked up when entering everything being tired and in pain and the screen keeps getting blurry and I've always had 20/20 vision everything else is broken but, that has always been 100%, including medications etc, this is a gold standard symptom checker. Spend 20 minutes re doing it double check everything, get same result... Ok must be a glitch in the database or something.  Going to next one, same result again.... ok well then start to consider possibility but no way, i would have hit the lottery already if I had those odds.  Also kind of killing time, drinking a couple of electrolyte drinks i keep around because I always keep them on hand for when I cant hardly eat or drink due to a digestive issue. Check third symptom check making sure i am being totally 1000% un biased and answering accurately and honestly SAME... Still no improvement actually getting worse.  oh and ive taken my temp about 14 times because I keep sweating etc no temperature. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarting to get scared,  make a plan with the wife tell her what i know and what's about to happen, and that I'm going to call the insurance co advice line and talk to one of their on call nurses, one to confirm what I am starting to suspect. Talk to nurse explain symptoms like 47 times, not really but a lot of double checking and a couple triple. She tells me I need to hang up the phone and call 911 which already knew was coming, already had bags packed with the metric ton of stuff I have to carry around. Ambulance picks me up they do a 12 lead in the driveway, all good get to hospital, immediately get two cat scans 3 sets of x rays and half my bodyweight in blood.  Talk to doc , doc says I cant find anything wrong like literally I on paper I'm, healthier than I should be to be totally honest other than I am under weight,\n\n I had a chest infection about 3-4 weeks ago and my chronic pain has been pretty bad so haven't been eating much and pretty stressed out cause extreme chronic pain takes a toll on your body.  Doc says he is going to discharge me, I'm kinda going ok well all y labs were good, imaging nothing changed from the last time i had imaging done a few months ago. But hey Im not the doc and he is a good dude, I've seen him a few times.  He almost makes it to the door and asks if I've been sick at all, I ask like how long and he is just like whenever sooo I tell him well I have this rash, but other than that diarrhea about 12-14 days ago completely forgetting the upper respiratory infection because I just get them semi frequently.  He says you it kinda sounds like GBS but I don't have anything to hospitalize you on because your not having trouble breathing to technically your stable  but its more of a diagnosis of omission than anything follow up with your pcp and see about getting into neuro also but come back if you start having trouble breathing...   So now im home, even my fingers feel tired and heavy and hurt. a kid running through the house 50 feet away seems to cause more pain. And even my discharge paperwork  basically says well you probably have this but we cant say that for sure so were going to say its generic muscle weakness more or less of a unknown cause.\n\nAnd that's how I wound up here, typing even drains the life out of me adn hurts...  I can already tell you that I'm headed back to the Hospital by the end of the day tomorrow if this keeps getting this bad this fast. I may have had some fatigue Friday afternoon / evening  but this went from feet up, Pain between shoulder Blades throbbing outwardly till you hit the shoulder and the joints hurts.  I am hoping its wrong on this but I guess ill just have to follow up with my pcp in a week when I have a appointment.  I just am not sure what to make of all this  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny Input would be greatly appreciated and if you took the time to read this wall of text my sincerest thanks.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 1120, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ambulance ride to hospital and sent home presenting with classic GBS Doc says the words GBS but...

A few days later I begin to have double and blurry vision so go to the ophthalmologist. She runs tests and sends me to ER. At ER, MRI and CT scan of brain come back clear. \n\n\nI was told to follow up with neurologist and he orders a lumbar puncture. Had that on 10/26. CSF is normal, no elevated protein. \n\n\nThe next day I begin to have excruciating muscle spasms in my legs and sciatica. Go back to ER, MRI of spine shows some herniation and they think the puncture irritated the nerves. Next afternoon (3 days ago), I'm out with my kids and I fall. My legs just give out. I had to drag myself home because my right leg wouldn't cooperate. Figured it's the sciatica, go home and rest. The following day, I wake up with some weakness/soreness but it makes sense bc of the previous events. Go to a market and fall again. Legs give out. Husband rushes me to ER. Everything is fine , high inflammation markers but nothing life threatening. \n\n\nToday I am unable to walk. I had an appointment with neurologist today and she is running tests, she thinks it's eppstein barr. I disagree but I'm not a Dr. She rules out GBS since CSF protein wasn't elevated but I was not experiencing symptoms at the time of the puncture except for blurry vision. \nFindings so far are no/delayed reflexes in legs and feet, high SED rate, high CRP, normal CSF.\nMy voice is now extremely hoarse and I'm just so tired and in pain and scared that this is permanent. \n\nIf you read this novel, Thank you.

I\u2019m close to 8 years after and while during winter &amp; summer, I experience a low level nerve tingling, this past year I\u2019ve noticed more times were I experience a slight disconnection with my nerves, I\u2019m not really sure what to call it. Ghost disconnection? In these times, my touch will feel slightly numbed and I have to consciously check that I\u2019m feeling my toes, moving my body because my brain almost second guesses it. \n\nThis happened earlier this week for a solid day which is longer than normal and the next night I woke up in really intense muscle and nerve pain from my mid abdomen down, especially my hips and thighs. The pain was able to be relieved with extra strength Tylenol. I had to retake once and then it was gone. The next day (today) the nerve pain in my hips and thighs is back, not as intense but very uncomfortable. The type of pain reminds me of when my nerves were initially turning on after my GB episode. \n\nHave you ever experienced it? What has your neurologist said? \n\nI plan to go to a neurologist but I wanted to have some more experiences to reflect on, the neurologists I\u2019ve seen haven\u2019t been helpful. \n\nThank you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 1113, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Nerve Pain several years after onset", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/qjq8s2/nerve_pain_several_years_after_onset/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "JessandGun", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_b7m582h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1620345327, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/n6ldk5/boyfriend_with_prior_gbs_nervous_about_covid/", "gildings": {}, "id": "n6ldk5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1e8c78f0-194c-11e9-acf5-0e0dc11520c4", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 23, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/n6ldk5/boyfriend_with_prior_gbs_nervous_about_covid/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1620345338, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey all!

They started the IV I G treatment pretty quickly and I had five days of that but didn\u2019t see a difference afterwards. The first week I was here they gave me Norco and IV morphine at the same time and during that was the only time I felt any relief from the pain even if it was only for a half hour or so. After a week they stopped the morphine and went to just the Norco which really does absolutely nothing For the pain.\n\nDuring the same time they were doing the IVG I was also given an Gabapentin but again not much notice any difference. Not only have I not seen any improvement but now my hands feel the way my feet too which is and excruciating burning sensation and also severe stiffness.

I can\u2019t really use my hands for anything because I have no sensation in my fingertips and the rest of my hands are burning and stiffness so they don\u2019t even want to move the right way. \n\nMy question is has anyone else ever experienced this? Nothing seems to help so I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to be able to function and live a normal life at all. If anyone has been through this can you tell me what to expect going forward because I\u2019m lost.

Any insight into what this could be, if it will get better over time, or things I could do to help?\n\nThanks!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 761, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intense nausea and green stool.

The doctor thinks it might be GBS. But they really don't know. My spinal tap was clear. My blood work (so far) was clear. It's possible I have a pretty mild case of GBS. I have been able to walk for over 4 weeks. I have seen literature that patients who did that also had clear CSF. So maybe GBS? But, the neurologist did an EMG test. No large fiber neuropathies were found. Main motor reflexes were intact. Neurologists suspected small fiber neuropathy (SFN). Not unheard of GBS... but....\n\nThen I looked up SFN. I got scared. There's a lot of stuff that just isn't well known. My condition is acute. Whatever it is, it has progressed over days and a few weeks. I'm afraid it won't slow down. I have polyneuropathy as well. Sensory. Motor. Autonomic. Mostly sensory. But the whole package is there. It has been slight. But growing, growing, growing.\n\nI received antibiotics for a infection in early Feb. A few days later, tingling in my hands. Then my feet. Slowing drifting upwards. Bilateral ascending peripheral neuropathy. Weakness and worst symptoms in the legs. Nausea and changes in bowel consistency. Weakness seemed to reach its peak at about Week 4. Maybe symptoms had stabilized. Maybe that was wishful thinking? Week 4 was last week.\n\nI felt lucky at first. I had been able to walk throughout. Maybe I was out of the woods. Maybe this wasn't as deep of a nightmare as I thought it might be. But now I can feel the weakness spreading. In my shoulders and wrists now. The tingling numbness is going basically all the way up my quads. I can feel it all over my back. The tingling in my face, weakness around my jaw has returned. \n\nRight now I'm eager to start all the treatments. I told my neurologist so. She is still let's wait and see. But I see things sliding. I feel like I'm falling off. It's so hard to wait. This feels like such a hard time. \n\nPeople with GBS stabilize. Right now... I'm afraid I won't. Maybe I'm freaking out? Maybe I did stabilize. Anxiety makes it so hard to tell sometimes. I guess I'm just reaching out right now. Anything anyone can say. Any experience. Any insight.

I'm going to keep a thread of my progression as I wait to see if anything happens. I'm hoping that my thread may help people decide what is the best course for them.\n\nI chose to get the vaccine because I live in an area where people don't want to follow social distancing protocol, and I work in the public sector where I'll be required to help the general public as soon as my office reopens. I did and still do have worry about getting the vaccine because of GBS, but after speaking with my doctor, I realized that making an educated risk was one I was willing to take. My GBS was not induced by a vaccine, but more than likely a flu or bacterial infection I had at the time (on a side note, the greater Cincinnati area has the highest cases of GBS in the US. My educated guess is that there's a certain bacteria or virus natural to this area that triggers it but nobody's really sure). \n\nI got my vaccine about 1.5 hours ago (3/3) and will be updating with anything that might be of interest to anyone. My second vaccine will be 3/29. As always, please contact your doctor before getting the shot.

Right side of face (which had largely recovered) now noticeably weaker, though not as bad as nadir in hospital (yet...).\n\nSpoke to neurologist and physio today who have advised watch and wait (come back in 4 days and in meantime go to ER if trouble with breathing, swallowing or vision). That\u2019s fine; it\u2019s tempting to always want to take action (pump me with IVIG again!) but I recognise that\u2019s not always necessary or the best.

Though I hear others say it differs greatly for everyone, so here's a little backstory on what I've been going through.  \n\n\nI've Been dealing with muscle pains and joint pains accompanied with muscle weakness for about 7 years. Trying any rehab does not work as it seems like the body can not convert the exercises into positive results, even the weakest/lowest impact of exercises makes my pains flare up for days unless it's straight-up stretching. Sore eyes tend to itch and burn quite easily and will cause double vision if I try to focus on something for too long. I have chronic fatigue syndrome accompanied by brain fog and a lot of food intolerances that prevent me from eating any sort of carbs/sugars/starches without flairing up drastically. Constant abdominal pain as well when/after I eat. Symptoms have been \"maintained\" to a degree by diet and herbal supplementation. Fatigue and fog increase as time goes on and cognitive function diminishes. It has vastly become more and more difficult for me to think and communicate to others without losing focus on what I'm trying to say. Any new herbal remedy I try that is supposed to help with immune function and or kill bacteria works well for a short period of time, then stops working, no matter how much I rotate them.  \n\n\nI bring this all up because all of this started one day when I was in school 7 years ago. I was drawing and everything seemed to be fine then all of a sudden my arm became very weak and was trembling. I was in school for animation so I thought it was due to my drawing habits at the time as symptoms kept progressing. I thought it was carpal tunnel at the time, which spread to both arms. Eventually, that spread to my eyes and they burned so fiercely whenever I looked at any electronic screen I couldn't look at anything without feeling pain. I saught to cure boredom by trying to be more active and the pain spread to my knees. I've gone to a neurologist but they said nerves are fine. I've seen a naturopath who helped me reconfigure my diet which has helped me over the course of several years to at least get 80% function out of my eyes again, but my arms and legs (pretty much all joints) and abdomen still plague me with constant pain. I've been told of the possibility of /parasites (though I've only been tested for some) sibo/lyme/ Epstein barr virus. All negative.   \n\n\nI just want to get some of your opinions before I go to my doctor with this, as I've been in and out so frequently doing so many tests while being so tired, it's hard to drag myself back there on something that doesn't have any relation to what I'm going through. I should mention that symptoms SEEM to have manifested after a case of antibiotic abuse partly due to my fear of being sick from other symptoms I was feeling at the time, and partly due to either incompetent or just out to lunch doctors. To me it doesn't sound like it 100% is what that is, but I figured I'd ask in case someone has any insight!  \n\n\nIf you've made it here thank you for taking the time to read.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 744, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for answers to a very long period of no diagnosis.

I was then hit with major fatigue and the following weeks lost feeling in my feet, began to trip, fall over (to the point I had to purchase a wheelchair)...it was awful. I was in my last semester of graduate school so I had no time for doctors. I also had no money for doctors (wonderful America).  I finished my dissertation with the help of voice to type software and my family in helping me get places.  I lost my job offer and literally had no idea why my body was shutting down. \nAfter 3 months of this my GP ordered an MRI which showed a few \u201cwhite matter foci lesions\u201d per the radiologist but in follow ups with neurologists they said they didn\u2019t see those.  \nI was mostly tested for MS, which came back no clinical findings. My GP put me on a strong steroid treatment and physical therapy and I got most of my life back. However I still have weakness in my legs and both hands. My hands also hurt, all the time.  After 2-3 years of this I finally found a new neurologist.  He did a nerve condition test and ruled out CIDP (which I was sure I had) and ordered another battery of tests for MS.  $5000 later, all negative.  I had my appointment today where he told me he couldn\u2019t diagnosis me, but he also couldn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t have MS. Just needed to wait. \n\nHere is my question, if I had GBS back in 2017 is there any test they could do now to determine that? \n\nIve accepted that where I am feeling wise and pain wise is just where I\u2019m stuck at, no matter what it is, it\u2019s nothing fixable. However, putting a name to that pain would make my life so much in easier in having to explain it to others or getting understanding/protections at work.  I think all my doctors just think \u201cMS\u201d and won\u2019t look for anything else.

I have seen multiple doctors none of whom have been able to diagnose the issue. I have an upcoming appointment with a neurologist (finally!), but honestly, I am beginning to get very concerned about this and would be extremely grateful for some advice. Does this sound like a neurological condition to you guys? Does this sound like CIDP? Or something even worse like ALS? Sorry for length!\n\nDetails: 25 years old, male, Caucasian, 6 foot tall, 75kg weight, asthmatic with no current medications except inhaler. \n\nI began having trouble with my health in April 2016 while I was taking an abnormally high dose of topical Minoxidil, applied to my face. During the month I spent taking the drug, I noticed unflattering changes to my soft tissue. My skin and muscles became doughy and I was concerned that I was looking prematurely aged. Simultaneously, I experienced numbness and apparent muscle weakness in my lower bowel, affecting my ability to pass stools. Needless to say, when I noticed these side effects, I stopped Minoxidil immediately. However, despite prompt action my soft tissue did not recover and I still have altered soft tissue and abnormal bowel sensations now, almost five years since taking the drug.\n\nFor the next two years, I noticed no other symptoms, although, on reflection, I may have had muscle fasciculations, but in August 2018 I lost the ability to burp. I had just completed a long-distance run when I had the sudden sensation of weakness, floppiness and numbness in my oesophagus, accompanied by a need to burp up gas but an inability to activate the muscles needed to do so. At this time, I also began experiencing abnormal yawning, hiccupping and microburping (although the yawn is only a kind of partial yawn and doesn\u2019t use all the normal yawn muscles) hundreds of times a day, which I have read is suggestive of nerve damage. I developed and still suffer from severe acid reflux.\n\nMy symptoms remained static for the next few months until in November 2018 I had a bad bicycling accident. This resulted in me fracturing both my elbows and my right wrist, as well as getting whiplash on my neck, though slight pain. Recovery from this was for the first few months uneventful, however about three months after my initial injury I began getting pain, tingling and numbness, along with weakness in my arms. These attacks were sporadic, but did not seem to result in permanent weakness.\n\nHowever, I did notice that I seemed to be clumsier than usual and to be dropping things more often. This problem still afflicts me. I additionally began having severe muscle spasms in my jaw. To give some sense of the power of these spasms, it felt as though my jaw was being wrenched out of its socket, although thankfully I suffered only a few of these and have had a small amount only since.\n\nFinally, I began suffering from another round of symptoms in June 2019. The first symptom I developed during this period was swallowing trouble. Shortly before graduation, I lost the ability to swallow normally in a manner that recalled my sudden inability to burp a year earlier, with, firstly, extreme difficulty initiating the swallow reflex, and secondly, when I did eventually manage to begin swallowing, the actual movement itself was spastic with several muscles appearing either not to activate properly or to be uncoordinated.\n\nIn the days after this I experienced pain and clicking around my Adam\u2019s Apple area, as though nerves or muscles were getting trapped and I had a strange tingling sensation and the perception of a loss of mass underneath my tongue. A muscle between my chin and my Adam\u2019s Apple disappeared during this time and I have not had feeling or tension in it since.\n\nIn the weeks that followed these sudden swallowing difficulties, I saw several doctors. One suspected that it could be an infection, however the antibiotics he gave me failed to help. No visible abnormalities with my throat were noted (and at a later date I undertook a nasoscopy which confirmed this), suggesting that it is a neurological or muscular issue. No more treatment was offered. I was unable to eat more than yoghurt and water for this period, but in the months that followed my swallowing slightly improved.\n\nUnfortunately, the muscles that I believe I lost when my swallowing first worsened have not returned and my swallowing, though functional, remains impaired. To the extent that it is improved it feels as though this is because other muscles have atrophied and are \u2018filling in\u2019. I have since had a neck MRI which showed no abnormalities, ruling out a bone issue.\n\nSwallowing was not the only problem I developed during this time, as I also began suffering from muscle twitches, usually between 20 and 30 or so a day, beginning in my abs, where the twitches were especially violent and afflicted me while lying down at night, but which have over the past two years spread all over my body, including my face, arms, hands, neck and buttocks.\n\nMost worryingly, they have been accompanied by progressive muscle weakness and spasticity, as well as what seem to be altered reflexes.\n\nOther than my swallowing difficulties, it is difficult for me to say which muscles first started showing abnormalities. The first changes I believe I noticed were in my core, which started showing what for me was unusual weakness about a year ago \u2013 I was unable to do even very light core exercises without my core shaking uncontrollably and on occasion have difficulty sitting up and standing up straight \u2013 and my face, where I noticed twitching under my eyelids which expanded to my nose, lips, cheek and chin and weakened smile muscles.\n\nAlthough, I am afraid, I cannot be specific on the timeline, I have more recently developed shoulder weakness, which often shake when I put my weight on them while lying on my side. My right shoulder was described by a physiotherapist I have recently begun seeing in a bid to improve my strength as uncommonly weak.\n\nIn the past year I have also noticed progressive weakness in my arms, particularly my elbows and muscles appear to have disappeared at my elbow making day to day tasks such as elements of cooking such as whisking and cutting food, as well as press-ups, very difficult. My wrists appear weakened too, as are my legs and knees.\n\nIn the past few months I have noticed increased difficulty going up and especially down stairs, with impaired balance. I have also experienced weakness in my lower back and have noticed reduced coordination in my fingers.\n\nThese functional changes have been accompanied by visible changes to the muscles and the limbs. On my arms, a muscle has disappeared around my elbow, leaving an indentation; on my knees, I have observed similar changes, areas of muscle apparently wasting away and leaving dents; on my forearms there are also new indentations and disproportionate muscles; on my calfs, the muscles have what to me are abnormal bulges and dents; and on my hands, the muscle between my thumb and index finger feels mushy and there is a new dent.\n\nThe final symptom I wish to raise is that, since perhaps a year ago, I have been suffering from abnormal reflexes. Essentially, my reflexes are on the one hand delayed and on the other hand exaggerated. For example, if I brush a wall, my body will, often, spastically twitch away from it as a reflex, but this will happen later than usual and the movement is more dramatic. Another example is when our family dog nudges my stomach. In this case, I will get a violent twinge in my back about a second or two after the impact.\n\nThis is not a full list of every symptom I have suffered since I first started feeling abnormal three years ago (for example, I also have common numbness, tingling and feelings of water trickling under my skin), but I think I\u2019ve covered the most important.\n\nI would be extremely grateful for any information or advice you can offer.

I was diagnosed with LSS and have been infusing a total of 120 grams of GAMUNEX-C over two days every 3 to 4 weeks at home for the last 8 years. My LSS symptoms cause some atrophy in my right hand (mostly thumb) and left calf, with mostly a numbing/aching pain in both feet. The IVIg has been effective in that I\u2019ve not gotten worse, which I expect I would have without it.\n\nI\u2019m interested to know if people are having the same experiences as I am when getting infusions. It has taken me a while to learn what works best for me when infusing. Like staying hydrated, taking my meds, etc. Some of the things that I have been considering follows.\n\nI have found that different nurses approach delivery of their professional services quite differently. Especially with the location of the stick. I observe that about half the nurses begin looking for a vein on my arms, while about half go straight for a vein on my hands. One nurse wanted to locate the stick in a vein across a knuckle in my thumb, but I declined.\n\nI\u2019ve also begun over the last two to three years, monitoring closely the rate of my infusion delivery, as I have become concerned with validating that the pump is correctly configured. For instance, if I stay hydrated both before and after infusions, and take my meds timely, and assure that my dosage each of two days is 60 grams at 133.3 ml/hour for 5 hours, and with 30 minutes of intravenous hydration first, then I don\u2019t experience any severe side effects.

under me. It was so weird, because for years I had recurring dreams of it happening. I went to the ER, had tests done, they couldn\u2019t find anything and told me it was from stress; and despite being unable to walk, the idiot doctor released me.  It was true, I was in the midst of one of the most stressful periods of my life, but to the point of literally paralyzing me? My neighbors had to carry me out of the Lyft car and into my house! The next day, my sister &amp; brother picked me up and took me to the hospital near them, and by the time we got there not even an hour later, I was completely paralyzed and my breathing became labored. \n\nFortunately, they diagnosed me within 30 minutes: Guillain-Barre Syndrome. I became completely paralyzed from the neck down to my toes, and had to be intubated. I was delirious from a bad UTI and spent a week having delusional nightmares &amp; they all thought I was going to die. I even saw my dead Dad at my bedside. All I could do, and did do, was pray. I had to keep my headspace as calm as I never knew I could be...\n\nThey did the standard 2 treatments, and the first one didn\u2019t work; the second treatment did, and I began to regain feeling about a month after initial onset, but now I had to relearn how to do every single thing that we take for granted. Sit, walk, talk, hold something in my hand. So, for the second month, I did just that at an inpatient rehab hospital. I had to learn how to properly swallow, I could not even have a sip of water (the greatest beverage on Earth! Also the biggest torture for me as I recovered, thirsting for water). The first success? Holding the toothbrush and brushing my teeth. Each day, I busted my ass to do a little more. Open a clothespin without dropping it. Put pegs in holes. Change the channel on the remote. Breathe on my own, especially so that I could finally drink a big glittery glass full of icy water. Roll over to the side to help nurses clean me up. Wipe my own ass. Would joke with the nurses that was my goal then mimic the kid in Big Daddy. Once I was able to do something, I insisted on keeping it that way. The first time I sat up after a month in bed, whoa! You never realize how important your core muscles are until they aren\u2019t used for a while. The first time I stood up, with machines helping me, ooof, dizzying! But every single day, I made more and more progress. One movement at a time.\n\nA couple weeks later, I finally got to chew on ice, yay! Ahhhhh, ice ice baby!

First time poster here. I first want to say that I\u2019ve been reading all the posts, and everyone in this group is so supportive of one another and the GBS community. It\u2019s awesome to see.\n\nSo I have a question that I was hoping y\u2019all could help me with. My mom was diagnosed with GBS in October 2020. I was visiting her one night and she wasn\u2019t feeling well, and by the end of the night, she has lost the ability to walk. We went straight to the ER and they quickly diagnosed her with GBS. She also has stage 4 cancer, and actually got the GBS from her immunotherapy treatment. It\u2019s been a little rough over here.\n\nAnyway, she really did pretty good at the hospital (no ICU) and stayed 2 weeks (received IVIG). She went to rehab facility for 2 weeks after that. She was sent home, and she wasn\u2019t in great shape. But since then, she has been making very very slow progress. She walks with a walker and needs 24/7 caretaking. She\u2019s been out of the hospital for 2 months now. \n\nSo finally my question! Thanks for sticking with me. Since she\u2019s been home her right hand started tingling a lot more than usual, then started numbing, and now it\u2019s closing up into a fist. She cannot control it at all and now can\u2019t use it at all. We are worried that she\u2019s somehow regressing, although she seems to be doing okay otherwise (but extremely slow recovery with everything else). So I guess my question is, when you were recovering, did you have things that happened that made you feel like you were relapsing or regressing? Or is this hand thing not that big of a deal in your opinion? I\u2019m just lost because GBS is SO confusing and it\u2019s hard to find answers. We do have a good neurologist who is monitoring as well.\n\nJust wanted to get yalls thoughts in this and see if anyone went through something similar. Thank you guys!

I fully respect and understand not everyone will make the choice I did and I personally struggled with this decision. It wasn\u2019t taken lightly.\n\nI am currently 24 hours out from having the Moderna  COVID-19 vaccine. \n\nI was able go get the vaccine through my local health department  because I feel into 1B priority group in Texas which includes people over 65 or if you have a medical condition putting you at a higher risk of complications should you become infected with COVID-19. It was free and I waited for two hours. I was prepared to have a letter of medical necessity but it wasn\u2019t required and when I checked in I was simply asked if I was a medical worker or high risk and that was all the vetting done. I will say the vaccine has not been in as high demand as other places and our local officials have been very liberal in giving it to people who fall into the group 1B category because they are concerned the vaccines will go to waste. \n\nAfter I got the shot I was required to wait at the clinic for 15 minutes to ensure there were no adverse side effects or an allergic reaction. I felt a little lite headed and slightly nauseated as I was waiting to leave. I contributed this to stress because of the lack of social distancing and just the anxiety I had over all in making this decision. \n\nAbout two hours after the vaccine I had chills and a low grade fever 99.8-99.9. The injection sight became very painful and has remained this way. I simply took Advil and went to bed early. \n\nToday I have a headache, feel slightly dizzy, my throat hurts a little and my stomach is kind of upset. Overall I feel really tired and sluggish.

This is my first post here.\n\nHers was a rapid onset. She had some soreness and weakness one evening. She thought it was because of the extra work she was doing over the few days prior. The following morning her legs were much weaker, and she was starting to feel it in her hands and arms. I took her to the E.R. where she got to see every single E.R. doctor on duty at the time. I remember them giving her the reflex test, the one where they hit your kneecap, and she didn't flinch although she said she certainly felt it.\n\nThey couldn't figure out what was causing this, and so they admitted her to the hospital.\n\nThe following morning she got a visit from the neurologist. She said, \"I think you have GBS, and it's a rapid onset. Let's start treatment now.\"\n\nWhen I saw her that morning she was paralyzed from her shoulders all the way down. She could still feel everything; she just couldn't move.\n\nShe had an IVIg infusion for five days, and she stayed in the neurology department for a week.\n\nThe next week they moved her to the therapy department where she stayed for three more weeks.\n\nShe never had to be put on a ventilator though she did say that there was a feeling of pressure on her chest. She didn't lose any abilities in her head or face. She got Bell's palsy while she was there, but that cleared up a week or so later.\n\nShe came home in a wheelchair which she used for a few months, then she had to use a walker for another few months. Now she gets around using a hiking pole.\n\nIt's been exactly one year now, and she is slowly getting back to normal. \n\nShe has almost all her strength back. She still has low endurance and walks slowly, like a penguin (don't tell her I said that). She is still going to physical therapy twice a week and occupational therapy once a week. We walk our dogs about one and a half miles in the morning and another mile and a half in the evening. She gets the slow dog and I get the fast one so it works out.\n\nShe's doing a lot of knitting; it keeps her hands and fingers busy.\n\nYesterday she said that one of her thumbs feels normal again. She said that before now it felt like there was a piece of tape or dried glue on her thumb so that there was always a thin layer of something between her thumb and whatever she was touching. The other thumb is still weird and so are her fingers.\n\nThe hardest part is that recovery feels like it is taking such a long time, almost like it isn't happening at all. Thankfully, the therapists are there every few days to remind us that she just did something that she wasn't able to do before.\n\nThe reason I'm posting is because I myself frequently browse this group in in order to get an idea what we can look forward to as my wife recovers. After a year, I think I finally have something to contribute.\n\nOne more thing. My wife was recently featured in a local magazine article about her GBS and recovery.\n\n [https://www.cityofvancouver.us/messenger/page/partnership-dedicated-recovery](https://www.cityofvancouver.us/messenger/page/partnership-dedicated-recovery)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 688, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "One year ago today was the start of GBS: progress report.", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/kqneey/one_year_ago_today_was_the_start_of_gbs_progress/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "VampyreLust", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_m80s6zv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1609794828, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/kqi44s/ontario_ministry_of_health_guidelines_for_the/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kqi44s", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "44162904-1947-11e9-95cb-0e529f2502d4", "link_flair_text": "Resource", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/kqi44s/ontario_ministry_of_health_guidelines_for_the/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "MC4uoZZi6voCO5VndfVJzn_S2HWL8KJuVSBqy2N9YY0", "resolutions": [{"height": 144, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/o885XLO4LmiSjZjQk_2_GjzkhHbgJHqkTX1tUhkXPgc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d726d5ce27be17901d74bc519250500a6a4c27a", "width": 108}, {"height": 288, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/o885XLO4LmiSjZjQk_2_GjzkhHbgJHqkTX1tUhkXPgc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a4bbfcfccf3a1b1d5705dc404fb8d27df43fbe", "width": 216}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/o885XLO4LmiSjZjQk_2_GjzkhHbgJHqkTX1tUhkXPgc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b606789b9c744f9eb447f3b11038e31d2cf9aea8", "width": 320}, {"height": 853, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/o885XLO4LmiSjZjQk_2_GjzkhHbgJHqkTX1tUhkXPgc.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d46574e37338665a925d1823f49cec7ebda94f6", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 1024, "url": "https://external-preview.redd.it/o885XLO4LmiSjZjQk_2_GjzkhHbgJHqkTX1tUhkXPgc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=11fbe4cad944e5390f00de2797ce31fec48cd17d", "width": 768}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1609794838, "score": 1, "selftext": "I received this info sheet because I have a relative in assisted living and they're being vaccinated this week.

Third day out I finally ate real food. I have been essentially bed ridden until this morning (Friday).\n\nSo this is about four days after initial vomiting and GI issues, and now my GI symptoms are largely gone.

Enough so, that I've decided to make this post, as I am needing some points of view. \n\nAs a kid, I had a severe episode of GBS that involved paralysis in my legs and one occasion of pulmonary problems, all of which followed receiving a flu shot. This was back in the 90's and not a lot was known about the link between shots and the syndrome at the time. \n\nI've held off getting a vaccine for COVID, out of fear of recurrence. I even contracted COVID this year, and luckily had a mild case. But I have still postponed getting vaccinated until now - I see the trend in society where I live, and more and more places are enforcing black and white policies about vaccination. Vax card, or no entry. To gyms, to bars, to locations, etc. My place of work is even starting to harden its resolve. The writing is on the wall - be vaxed, or be gone. \n\nI've talked to four different primary care doctors over the course of 6 months about the vax. One said I was making a mountain out of a mole hill (this was before the J&amp;J FDA Warning in July. I wonder if he recanted?), another doctor said I should hold off until there was more data, and one even said that if she were in the same position she would opt out. So I'm a little perplexed, as even the experts don't seem to agree. \n\nHave any of you had the same experience? Or even the same concern of recurrence? Did you get vaccinated? What happened? \n\nI would be curious and very interested to hear some of your experience regarding the vaccine.

They blamed cowvid of course like they do with most things as the Dr and hospital are in the same network.  In the hospital on oxygen &amp; meds for about a week. Released at families house temporarily as they wont allow visits anywhere which is extremely evil.\n\nStays in bed the entire time around 10 days, barely ate, has to change diapers, clean,  then one day the family saw her breathing really fast, charcoal black stool, then heart rate dropped so fast that if the EMTS didn't show up in 30secs or so they would probably would have passed. Put her on oxygen, intubated in hospital, kidneys failing, blood pressure dropping, passed away next day.  Sadly the next day her family were going to send her to a facility for a month in order to do psychical &amp; speech therapy as they couldn't did in the home due to no room to work.  \n\n\nI was less than 3 weeks new to this GBS to try and help a family understand. We put the pieces of this GBS puzzle together as the Dr's wouldn't even mention it was a possibility even tho it was 100% obvious it was GBS. All this happened so fast Im still in shock. To think that person would still be here if they hadn't taken that got dam fluu shot is one of the hardest things to process. An avoidable situation that lead to suffering  &amp; death. Some days I still feel like I'm in a nightmare.   \n\n\nStill trying to find answers as none of the Dr's, nurses or EMT's listen. They all say rowna this, rowna that to EVRERYTHING, as if they refuse to tie the vaxx to what happened. Thankfully the home nurse treated a lot of GBS patients from the vaxxx. He diagnosed her with GBS as she had all the symptoms. One day you're walking, talking, driving, going to the bathroom solo. To the next day all that ceases to exsist all from a shot.  \n\n\nIm trying to find some closure as to what exactly happened that lead to her death. Some days I feel guilty that there was more I could have to done to possibly avoid this. A poster here recently mentioned dysautonomia from GBS. Did some digging on it which lead to some possibility that maybe that might have played a role in her heart function. Again Im just speculating here.   \n\n\nMy curiosity into the fluu shot lead me to dig into the vaers database to compare deaths from previous years as I saw enough articles of people saying they received the rowna vaxx instead of the fluu shot \"by accident\". Too many coincidences so I become suspicious. What I found was an eye opener. From 2017-2020 on average 105-120 died from the fluu shot. As of a couple days ago 2021 showed almost 96,000 deaths. Thats over 800 times more deaths ever. Something very suspicious is going on. Cause this month alone I know of 2 deaths from the rowna vaxxx, 1 with GBS &amp; 1 death from the fluu shot in my circle of peopel.   \n\n\nI just want to know what's going on. Im frustrated cause the Dr's are evil. They wont listen &amp; act like we dont know what we're talking about. My mind is all over the place.

Sad thing is I advised her not to get the shot this year as I felt some kind gut feeling with all thats going on to stay away for now. Ive also seen my fair share of people recently being administered the rowna vaxx when they went in for the flu shot. Then the place saying sorry we made a mistake when they handed them a vaxx card. \n\nSpoke with one of the nurses that helped my friend. She stated she was a travelling nurse and one of the places she worked had an entire section of GBS patients that all got it from the rowna vaxx. Something this year just doesn't feel right. One of my friends clients got it and from the vaxx and they now have to sell their home to buy a bigger place in order to dedicate a section for her husbands as her life is now turned upside down from this unfortunate circumstance. She told me it's gets worse before it gets better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend is a senior at 82. One day she was walking, the next day after the vaxx she is paralyzed. Her family n I have been taking care of her, feeding her, changing her diapers, giving emotional support. This is terrifying as I never knew someone with this. The nurses that have seen her in the home dont really do anything but check vitals which I do. Psychical therapy said they cannot properly treat her in the home. They recommended a 3 week stay at a nursing home which will offer 24hrs care + physical therapy.   \n\n\nFrom my research they say most eventually recover from GBS, while its possible they dont. I know recovery is dependent on a lot of factors. For those who might know or actually recovered how long did it take? What is a realistic time frame? It's been almost a month for her and she cannot walk, can barely remember things, takes a long time to answer questions, only eats 400-600 calories as she constantly complains shes not hungry. She lost a ton of weight &amp; muscle mass in the legs.   \n\n\nIm lost, im heat broken and dont know what to do. Her insurance only covers a 3 week stay if we decide to send her to a nursing home. Her condition at the home is sad nor ideal. I've read many places it takes many many months to make significant improvement.

Fevers and headaches similar to the vaccine, escalated to some pain on both sides, tachycardia. I even nearly passed out once in a lobby trying to get a covid test. (Which turned out to be negative.) \n\nSo after a few weeks I finally got my doctor to take me seriously, and got diagnosed with mono last week. Though at that point I was on the tail end of it. \nI also had some pretty bad blood work when it came to my liver, and an enlarged spleen. \nI thought everything was fine, I kept feeling tired all day and like pretty weak towards the end of the day so I just assumed it was fatigue from mono. \nBut while I was in one of my college classes- a choir- I found it difficult to sing because breathing in too deeply hurt, (chalked it up to my spleen though) and my chest felt tight. I could feel my heart racing as well. I'm positive if I had taken my heart rate it would've been too fast again. \n\nI think it was when I headed to my car- feeling really weak- naturally I went ahead and got some food, and felt better afterwards, but while I was reading up on some stuff wondering if mono had anything to do with my heart rate, I noticed out of like no where seemingly like the entirety of my legs seemed to tingle with that annoying pins and needle sensation. I'm not entirely sure but I think it's been changing spots occasionally. Right now it's my thighs, knees, parts of my shins that kinda tingle. I don't know if I'm imagining it but it feels like my face and hands are itching as well. \nBut it went on for hours. I got out of my car and headed to class, didn't stop the tingling. Even now, like 7+ hours later it's still tingling. \n\nI don't think it's entirely constant, I only really feel it when I stay still (though it happens really quickly), and I can still walk around fine and all, it's just sometimes my legs feel weak. \n\nSo im just wondering if I'm overthinking or if Im right to be a little worried about this. Especially considering that I was diagnosed positive for mono AND got the vaccine a month ago that claims to have increased risk for this. \n\nI did schedule an appointment with my doctor (she wanted me to come in this week anyways for a check up and more bloodwork to make sure everything is fine) but that isn't until Thursday. Though I did have plans to go to an emergency clinic or wherever I have to go if it gets any worse. \nBut just having some insight from people who have experiences this would make me feel a little better.

And I\u2019m the kind of person who just needs these things to be told to me bluntly and I have no idea what her never coming off the ventilator would mean. Can you live like that for a prolonged amount of time? Also she\u2019s like fully there. Nods to your questions, winks, tries to smile, etc. \n\nBasically I\u2019m just wondering if anybody else has been in a similar situation. What might it mean if she can\u2019t ever come off a ventilator? Will she never be able to talk again? Never be able to leave the hospital? I know nobody on Reddit can tell me for sure.

She was paralyzed for several months but, thankfully, made a complete recovery. Since then she has been very hesitant to take vaccines, though she is by no means an anti-vaxxer, quite the opposite. In fact, she took the Pfizer vaccine after talking to several specialists and had zero issues.\n\nFast forward, I'm pregnant with my first child and her first grandchild. We're very close and obviously I'd like her to be around after I give birth. We are both trying to do research to see what risks are involved for her getting the TDAP vaccine. She had it once before when she was very young with no negative impacts and her doctor is very for her getting it. \n\nI'm hoping this community may have some resources for research or studies in terms of the TDAP and GB. Obviously, I'd never do anything to force my mom to get something that could legitimately harm her. I completely respect the fact that the idea can be terrifying to her for legitimate reasons. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't anxious about it as well. But on the flip side of that, I have to be cautious and protect my child as well, even if that means keeping her away the first 3 months of his life until he can get vaccinated. \n\nThank you for your time and any advice or resources you might be able to point my way!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 1074, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Looking for Some Advice with TDAP Vaccine", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/px9ikn/looking_for_some_advice_with_tdap_vaccine/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "wildluvxXx", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ekrmho7n", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1632788906, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/pwuflo/anyone_who_has_had_gbs_and_got_covid_did_you_guys/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pwuflo", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "1e8c78f0-194c-11e9-acf5-0e0dc11520c4", "link_flair_text": "Advice", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/pwuflo/anyone_who_has_had_gbs_and_got_covid_did_you_guys/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1632788917, "score": 1, "selftext": "Wondering if it\u2019s safe for people who has had GBS. \n\nI know we are not allowed to do any vaccines like flu shots and any sort of viruses is a trigger for it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 1074, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anyone who has had GBS and got COVID, did you guys do the Monoclonal Antibody treatment?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/pwuflo/anyone_who_has_had_gbs_and_got_covid_did_you_guys/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Swimras", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_16a8e9", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1632683505, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/pw08hn/encouragement_to_advocate_tw_gbs_death/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pw08hn", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/pw08hn/encouragement_to_advocate_tw_gbs_death/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1632683516, "score": 1, "selftext": "I want to share our family's experience with GBS, partly for catharsis and partly to encourage you to advocate and seek second opinions.\n\nMy brother was diagnosed with GBS in mid-August of this year. Over the course of a week, he experienced loss of sensation in his hands and feet, then loss of balance, and paralysis of his upper and lower extremities. They initially thought the paresthesia was due to anxiety, and there were a few days of ER and doctor visits without any answers. \n\nHe started having a facial droop, and after the doctors ruled out stroke, they confirmed GBS with a spinal tap. We were relieved to finally know what was going on and we're hopeful with the prognosis. My brother was diagnosed with the Miller-Fischer variant of GBS and was started on IVIG. He then got plasmapheresis. This entire time, he was under the care of respiratory therapists who continued to confirm that based on his spirometer numbers and oxygen levels, he did not need to be on a vent. \n\nHe was discharged from the ICU after 2 weeks, and went straight to rehab, where he got 3 hours of services a day. He complained of chest tightness and fatigue and it was dismissed as anxiety. Typically in rehab he had been monitored at night, but for some reason one night he wasn't. My dad, who was sleeping in the rehab room that night, woke up to find my brother not breathing. We have no idea how long he was gone.\n\nHe coded twice that night and finally became stable, but was unresponsive and on life support. After 5 days like this, we were told he was brain dead. He was an organ donor, which we are thankful for, but it's such a small consolation.\n\nI have really hesitated sharing this story with this community, but if it can convince anyone to advocate more for their care or push for second opinions, it's worth it. I do not wish this situation on any family. Please listen to your body and demand good care- ask for physicians who have seen GBS before and are familiar with its progression. We thought that the main goal was to avoid the ventilator, having no idea what could happen without it.\n\nTo this GBS subreddit: I'm so thankful to read your stories of recovery.

She was initially diagnosed with GBS but has since been told it is CIDP. She left ICU to spend some time in a normal ward and is currently in a neuro-rehabilitation ward where she's been for about 10 weeks or so. She's currently in a wheelchair and is learning to walk with a frame and is making slow but encouraging progress.\n\nHowever, despite all of the things she's overcome (now eating, breathing, going to the loo without help), she is still struggling with daily debilitating numbness, mostly in her hands and face. This seems to get worse as the day goes on and doctors have said it is possibly fatigue, but frustratingly it is so bad it's beginning to hinder her progress as she is struggling to use her hands on some days and is forced into her bed after lunch on occasion because it's all too much.\n\nThey're offering her Duloxetine to try and help, but I was just wondering if anyone else had experienced this long-term numbness that didn't go away despite other improvements? It's so frustrating to not be able to help her or for the doctors to not know exactly how to alleviate this issue, but any support or information would be hugely appreciated!

My chest felt tight and I felt out of breath, and my extremeties felt cold. \n\nMy smell and taste had also disappeared and I told the doctor this, they did a covid test and I was positive. I had started having symptoms about a week prior to this emergency room visit but my previous test was negative. However, they said my tingling was anxiety. I've had anxiety for years, and knew this felt different but I don't like to argue. They discharged me.\n\nThe numbness happened again a few days later and this time my lips felt tingly too. I went back to the emergency room. They gave me an inhaler and discharged me. \n\nYesterday the numbness was worse than ever. It was my legs and arms and whole face. My fingers and knees felt hard to bend. My heart was racing. My vision felt as if my eyes were looking different directions almost. I went back again. This episode lasted 4 hours, much longer than before, and I was shaking. I was having a hard time holding a pen to fill out forms and could barely speak to them.. my vocal cords felt like they were going numb too if that makes sense.\n\nThis time they did bloodwork and a cat scan. They said everything looked fine, I was just a bit low on potassium and they discharged me again...\n\nHowever, guillain barre doesn't show up on a cat scan from what I know. It seems they were just looking for stroke signs but my numbness is on both sides and I stressed that to them.. they just said I need to follow up with my regular doctor. I'm calling my doctor when they open, just a couple more hours, but I think they're going to tell me to go back to the emergency room. \n\nI really suspect guillain barre but what is your experience? Does this sound like it? Its been a week, but I'm so afraid it's going to be so much worse in just a few days and I want the doctors to take me seriously. I know it's rare but I think covid may have caused it. I've never had eczema either until covid, and my body is covered in itchy bumps and patches. Eczema is an autoimmune response, and so is guillain barre and I think it's connected \n\nSorry for the length I hope I'm wrong and it isn't guillain barre but I don't know what else it could be. Any advice is welcomed, I just don't want the doctors to push me off until it's too late.\n\nNot sure if it matters but I'm a 25 year old female in the united states. 140 lbs, 5'3.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 1043, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hello everyone, I think I need to know I'm doing the right thing - doctors seemed unphased but I'm worried", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/pk88hy/hello_everyone_i_think_i_need_to_know_im_doing/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Atlguy889", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4nga4pcb", "author_is_blocked": false, "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1631055652, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/pjy79a/what_was_your_recovery_timeline_like/", "gildings": {}, "id": "pjy79a", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "5d81c60a-194c-11e9-baa4-0e6d6856fb3e", "link_flair_text": "Improvement and Recovery", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/pjy79a/what_was_your_recovery_timeline_like/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1631055662, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m heading into month seven of recovery.

The numbness comes and goes many many times during the day. I also began feeling pain in my elbows.\n\nAs the weeks progress, the numbness is still there, but now my knees as well as my elbows hurt me so much. I struggle to hold plates full of food as well as go up and down stairs. Im 28, a good weight, and before this all started I could work out daily. I get random shots of pain all over my body. Ive been to the internal medicine specialist, who ordered blood tests as well as got an X ray for my knees and elbows, and said everything looks good. He pretty much said he doesnt know what else to check.\n\nIm in so much pain its crazy, and I dont really know what to do. I contacted 3 doctors and they all give up after a blood test. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nI really appreciate the help.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit":

Besides some loss of fine motor skills and a bit of sensation within my hands, the paralysis never spread to my abdomen. I couldn't walk, but I was just grateful that I didn't need to be intubated. It was scary, and I needed a ton of support from my incredible family and partner, but I had read many stories where the outcome of GBS was much worse. I felt lucky to have a case which wasn't as severe as others, and I was really determined to get better as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm a college student, and the hospitalization and subsequent recovery made it so I couldn't finish semester. I'm managing to pay for school with the help of an academic scholarship (which I nearly lost because of my withdrawal from the semester) and loans. I spent all of December going to PT religiously, recovering, and getting ready for getting back on the academic bandwagon.\n\nWhen I started this semester I needed to still use my cane to get around and I couldn't drive myself to class, but my very supportive boyfriend helped me get to campus and I took on a full-time course load. I'm in an engineering program and the classes can be really tough, but I generally do well because I spend much of my time studying.\n\nAs semester progressed everything gradually became better, except for the fatigue. Everything made me tired, and I had to budget my time to meet the difficult requirements my program places on its students accordingly. I stopped going to PT, I could finally walk without a cane, and I only had enough energy to manage my class/work/homework schedule. I felt that if I went to PT my grades would slip because I would be too tired to do my studies.\n\nRegardless of that, my grades did slip. I've been giving this semester my all, and I can't seem to manage better than a D/C average, whereas prior to GBS I used to make the dean's list each semester. I'm scared I'll lose my scholarship (and thus be unable to pay for school) even though I'm still giving it my all. I feel the problem is the fatigue I feel each day. I've been managing it with vitamin b supplements and caffeine, but some days I'm so tired I need to be driven to and from school/work because I'm worried I'll get it an accident. I make sure to get plenty of sleep each night, but I feel so tired all of the time.\n\nAfter talking with my therapist about a recent exam I had he recommended I drop this academic semester. I study hard, maybe even harder than before, but I am struggling to keep my head above the water. It seems that even though I can walk again I am plagued by this fatigue which makes it hard to do even the most basic of tasks. A trip to the grocery store after work? No way, I'll be too tired to do anything for the rest of the night if I do that.\n\nI'm mostly making this post to put my story out there, but also to ask if anyone else has had issues with fatigue even after they regained control of their motor skills. I feel like I need to keep pushing myself, but my body is telling me I'm not done healing. I'm concerned about my academic future, and I'm genuinely pretty sad that I might have to withdraw again when I thought my recovery was going well.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 376, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Constantly exhausted", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/f74uxs/constantly_exhausted/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Alexcee7", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ofhoqk6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1581694343, "domain": "youtu.be", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/f3ts6k/what_no_one_tells_you_about_guillainbarre_syndrome/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f3ts6k", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "Alesha Alexcee", "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_iZSIpFQY-Gi1sNoAeJa7Q", "height": 338, "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/npg6YHuAXyw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

It started with her eyes being super dilated, taking her to the pediatrician and he noticed she had no knee-jerk reflex. As symptoms progressed we went to the hospital and eventually got the right diagnosis. Highlight for her was when she was \u201ctransferred\u201d to another building that is technically another hospital by the life flight crew. The nurse with her was bemoaning to her friend on the flight crew that they had to wait around for a doctor to do the transfer since she was connected to equipment. No calls had come in so the three of them in full gear wheeled her across the walkway. \nSecond time was two years ago when she was 15. Started feeling weak and since she had previously been diagnosed GBS was spotted quickly. An ivif treatment very quickly took her from almost complete paralysis to moving again 2 weeks later and recovered 100% 6 months down the track. It was a tough 6 months and took a lot of work to gain everything back but, she kicked its ass and was playing tennis on the high school team that fall.\nFast forward to last week and it starts again. Only this time it has progressed much faster and far more aggressively. On Monday they had to intubate her and they identified pneumonia on Tuesday. I know she\u2019s being taken care of and I know we are doing everything we can for her but, it just breaks my heart into pieces to see the pain in her face as they do the cough assist machine to help clear her lungs. It devastates me that she is going to miss a school trip in 2 weeks she has been so excited for. I can\u2019t imagine having to go through months of physical therapy again just when you think it\u2019s all better.\nSorry for the pity party but, it\u2019s just really awful right now. I\u2019ve found hope and healing by reading all your posts about your experiences so thank you for sharing.

That's also when our school year begins, she attempted to attend on a wheelchair but felt uncomfortable and wasn't able to complete the term.\nI think she developed PTSD to some degree, because she struggles with falling asleep and staying asleep; she claims that she is often confused when she wakes up thinking she'll be alone in a hospital room; and sometimes she wakes up and tries to stand, which still is a little hard although her physical recovery has been successful so far, and is reminded of the situation she's in; certain noises or words make her go really still and/or angry. \nShe hasn't discussed any of this with the people from mental health because she believes they can't help her.\nSo she explodes from time to time, with anger and frustration, and lashes out at me or our little brother, and sometimes even our parents.\nWhat can I do to alleviate her psychological needs?

So, as with many of us modern folks, I naturally turned to the Internet. Doctors hate us inquisitive patients because a) they care about us and worry we\u2019ll get possibly harmful/inaccurate information, and/or b) we\u2019ll ask them too many pointed questions, and/or c) we\u2019ll ask too many polnted qestions (which might get us out of their clutches!).\n\nSo, researching by my symptoms (which reminded me of an MRI finding none of my doctors made much of), I ran across VBI (vertebrobasilar insufficiency).  Two vetebral arteries run up the back of the neck, joining to form the basalar artery, all to bring blood to the brain. Reduction of this blood flow can, not surprisigly, cause health issues. The worst of these can be a stroke which kills you. Basal artery occlusion (complete blockage) is very dangerous\u2014and cause a posterior circulation infarction (not good). I do not know if this type of stroke leaves a lesion visible on MRI of the brain. So, back to the MRI findings I *did* have (on multiple MRIs). There was complete blockage of one of the vertebral arteries at the vertebral artery/basal artery junction. Their was partial blockage (reduced blood flow) of the other vertebral artery at that point. So, reduced blood flow to the brain, or VBI).\n\nVBI could explain all of my symptoms.* The first doctor who pointed out the MRI findings to me said I should take daily aspirin as an anti-coagulant (and I continue to do that) and did not ascribe any of my symptoms to it, and went off on the theory of a spinal fistula (abnormal connection between an artery and a vein). He couldn\u2019t find one. The second doctor who saw the finding ascribed no symptoms to it, and eventually diagnosed CIDP (never did a nerve biopsy).\n\nSo, I\u2019m going to raise this issue with my new doctor as soon as I get the chance.\n\n*Even explaining the coming and going of some of them.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 348, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "If I don\u2019t have CIDP, then what is wrong?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/eqis9j/if_i_dont_have_cidp_then_what_is_wrong/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tbl_335i", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_26e66ys0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1579326715, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/eqcmsz/potential_gbs_need_advice/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eqcmsz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/eqcmsz/potential_gbs_need_advice/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1579326717, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello fellow redditors, approximately 4 days ago, i got a sudden tingling in my feet.

I\u2019ve recovered relatively quickly, going from being almost fully paralyzed about a month ago to now being mostly (70-80%) functioning on my right side and about 30-40% functioning on my left. (Although my bowel and bladder have not started to recover yet)  I discharge from the hospital in a week and the doctors/nurses want me to learn how to insert my own catheter, due to my bladder issues. \n\nMy concerns:\n- Since my motor function is limited, my left hand will likely not be able to help much, other than maybe stabilizing my penis.  I can lightly grip, but not with much accuracy. Doctors/nurses say this won\u2019t be a problem as they\u2019ve taught paraplegics with limited function in both hands to do it, so they can teach me.  \n\n- I\u2019ve already had one UTI, so I feel that having a nurse perform the procedure is safer.  They say that there are risks with having a nurse do it at home, because they might not show up on time, and since they are going from house to house, patient to patient, they\u2019re carrying around a lot of foreign bacteria.   The staff says that doing it myself, even w/o sterile gloves that the nurses in the hospital wear, is safer because my skin and my home has my own bacteria that I\u2019m already used to. (Even though I have two cats and there is always going to be cat dander floating in the air)\n\n- The doctors also reference independence and reduced cost for nursing as benefits, but since I still can\u2019t walk and spend a lot of my time in a hospital bed, my independence is limited anyway.  I have pretty good insurance, so it\u2019s possible that they may cover some or all of the nursing cost.  \n\nSo, with all of that, my main question is safety.  If I learn how to self-cath, is it really going to be better than relying on in-home nursing care?  Anyone else have experience, good or bad, with learning how to do it on your own?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice or feedback!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 347, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is it safe to do my own (Male,44) urethral catheter when I don\u2019t have full function of my hands?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/eq2ldx/is_it_safe_to_do_my_own_male44_urethral_catheter/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "wekiva", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4kftu", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1579128472, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/ep9wac/diagnosed_with_cidp_well_maybe_not_so_much/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ep9wac", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/ep9wac/diagnosed_with_cidp_well_maybe_not_so_much/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1579128476, "score": 1, "selftext": "After years of having balance issues and wonky gait (and some other symptoms), I was diagnosed with CIDP by a neurologist (after nerve conducion studies and spinal tap).

These past 4-5 months have been very difficult for me to go from a highly active lifestyle to be essentially bedridden.  I was super lucky to have an amazing support group around me, my Mom took time off work and visited me at the hospital everyday from 9am-9pm, my work gave me paid time off to recover.  I also had tons of friends travel all kinds of distances to come visit me in the hospital, bring me food, treats, weed, you name it.  I don't think I could have done this all without them.  Here is how the past 5 months have gone for me.\n\n**(Background Info) March 11th 2019 - August 18th, 2019:** consistently riding/racing my road bike 400-600km per week (15 hours/week in the saddle on average).  Not more than 2 days off the bike in a row.  I was in the best fitness of my life with big goals in the cycling world.\n\n**August 19th, 2019:** Woke up with extremely sore and rigid muscles in entire body; all regular flexibility gone - it felt like I \"strained\" almost every muscle in my body.  This was much worse than any soreness I have ever felt before from excersize.  At this point I am asking myself, am I over training?  After the symptoms persisted and got worse, I knew that there had to be more to the story.\n\n**August 28th, 2019:** Extreme jaw pain(TMJ) and severe headaches (lasted for 5 days)\n\n**August 30th, 2019:** Went to Emergency Department.  Urine, blood and chest x-ray normal, sent home.\n\n**September 4th, 2019:** Prescribed Vimovo (Naproxen) - 500 mg/20 mg per day and referral for electromyography test (EMG) at Sports Medicine Clinic\n\n**September 6th, 2019:** Numbness in toes, but no pain; swollen legs/edema in feet; blotchy skin on feet.  Went to Emergency Department for 2nd time, Heart ultrasound normal, Blood tests normal\n\n**September 7th, 2019:** Pins and needles and extreme throbbing, stabbing/burning pain on tops of feet(it felt like there were hot frying pans on the tops of my feet), preventing sleep for more than 30-45 minutes at a time\n\n**September 16th, 2019:** Went to Emergency Department for a 3rd time due to worsening symptoms , Obtained MRI results - normal.  Admitted to Hospital after consultation with internal medicine resident and neurology resident.\n\n**September 18th, 2019:** Tests done at the hospital:\n\n* Spinal tap done (high protein level present, consistent with Guillain-Barre Syndrome) - samples also sent to a national lab for testing for rare conditions\n* CT Scan done (normal)\n* Nerve conduction test done (indicates Guillain-Barre Syndrome)\n* Electromyography test done (indicates Guillain-Barre Syndrome)\n* Diagnosis by neurologist:  Guillain-Barre Syndrome\n* First round of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) transfusion completed overnight\n\n**September 20th, 2019:** Second round of IVIG transfusion completed.  I can feel the numbness/tingling in my ring and pinky fingers, this was a first as the symptoms had previously been limited to my lower body.\n\n**September 21st, 2019:** Discharged from hospital with hydromorphone prescription (3 mg every 4 hours) and Gabapentin prescription, starting at 300 mg/day and increasing by 300 mg/day to 1500 mg/day\n\n**September 26th, 2019:**  Things got worse since I was discharged from the hospital and the constant pain was really taking a toll on me mentally, I didn't want to live with it anymore.  I was getting 2-3 hours of scattered sleep per night and   \n was needing to put my feet in a bucket of cold water to relieve the burning sensation.  I slept on the couch with my feet in the cold water a few nights as I couldn't get any relief from the sensation in bed.  Once my feet started to shrivel from the water, I started putting grocery bags on my feet and then putting them in the water to keep them dry. \n\n**September 27th, 2019:** Called an ambulance around 7 pm due to uncontrollable pain in feet. Taken to Emergency Department.  Spent night in Emergency Department on intravenous morphine.\n\n**September 28th, 2019:** Admitted to hospital again.  During hospital stay hydromorphone dosage increased to 5 mg every 4 hours, with 1 mg intravenously after 2 hours, as needed, as breakthrough dose; at end of first week, 1 mg intravenous dose changed to 2 mg oral dose.  Gabapentin dosage increased to 2100 mg/day; nortriptyline dosage increased to 50 mg/day.  I was able to \"shuffle\" to the washroom and stand long enough to have a short shower but was essentially bedridden and constricted to a wheelchair for moving around the hospital.  My ankles and toes were locked up and I could not bend them on my own. \n\n**October 9th, 2019:** Traveled by private ambulance to TGH for appointment with neurologist.  No further treatments or testing recommended at this time. Type of GBS confirmed to be  \u201cAxonal Multi-Sensory\u201d.  Told to stay the course and wait for improvement; Call her if symptoms worsen or new symptoms appear and she will see me immediately.  Gabapentin dosage increased to 2700 mg/day.  Next appointment scheduled for January 15, 2020\n\n**October 10th, 2019:** Discharged from Credit Valley Hospital with hydromorphone prescription (4 mg every 4 hours, with 2 mg after 2 hours, as needed), gabapentin prescription (2700 mg/day) and nortriptyline prescription (50 mg/day); Continue with existing Vimovo prescription (500 mg/20 mg per day).  Stayed at parents place in a hospital bed that they rented.  Lived on the ground floor.  Focused on getting my joints moving again and not allow my muscles to completely deteriorate.\n\n**October 18th, 2019:** Reduced dose of hydromorphone to 4 mg every 4 hours, with 2 mg after 2 hours, as needed, as breakthrough dose\n\n**October 23rd, 2019:** No more constant burning/stabbing pain, just numbness, tingling, aching ankles and feet.  Reduced dose of hydromorphone by alternating doses of 4 mg and 3 mg every 4 hours - No more breakthrough doses required\n\n**October 24th, 2019:** Started to ride my bicycle on an indoor trainer again at a low resistance.  Was able to manage 4 mins before feeling too tired and fatigued to continue on the first day.\n\n**October 28th, 2019:** Reduced dose of hydromorphone to 3 mg every 4 hours\n\n**October 30th, 2019:** Able to eat at table and sleep in my own bed upstairs\n\n**November 4th, 2019:** Reduced dose of hydromorphone to 2 mg as needed - stopped taking altogether within a few days (I wanted to stop taking the hydromorphone as soon as I could)\n\n**November 18th, 2019:** Saw family Dr., Discontinued use of nortriptyline advised to continue with gabapentin for another few weeks.\n\n**November 22nd, 2019:** I was having some GI issues so I stopped taking the gabapentin as I thought that might be impacting my digestive system.  I was also experiencing some dark thoughts and fell into a bit of a depression.  I think I was getting frustrated with how gradual the progress was in my legs, some days I would feel the same as the day before and it was difficult to get myself motivated.  I wasn't riding my bike at all as I wasn't feeling very well mentally and physically.\n\n**November 22nd, 2019:** I saw my Dr. and he thought the GI issues either had to do with the medication or the GBS itself as it affects all the nerves in the body.  He wanted to monitor it and see if anything changes.\n\n**December 3rd, 2019:** I started physio 2x a week at a clinic that was specialized in helping people overcome neurological conditions.  This was an important step as it helped me \"re-learn\" a lot of basic movements and was a good transition to being able to ride my racing bicycle again.\n\n**December 15th, 2019:** Now that I had been doing physio for a few weeks, I was getting some confidence back and more and more energy.  My body is slowly gaining some flexibility back(still a long way to go to get back to where I was) and things are on the \"UP\".  I made a plan with my physiotherapist to slowly increase the duration of cycling each day so that I could work back up to where I was before I got sick.  The idea was that I would keep the resistance fairly low and consistent at the start but then increase the duration of the ride by 10% each day.\n\n**January 13th, 2019:** My feet are still a bit numb, my flexibility has not returned yet but I was able to ride my bike 3x this week, all for between 1-1.5hr.  This was a HUGE step, both mentally and physically for me.  My aerobic power is about 70% of what it was in August(based on power vs. heart rate data) and my top end anaerobic capacity is probably closer to 50% of what it was.  I am looking forward to seeing my progress over the next few months with these stats to use as a reference point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was without a doubt the toughest 5 months of my life both mentally and physically.  Even though I still have some numbness and tingling I am forsure over the \"hump\" and well on my way to recovery now.  My biggest recommendation/suggestion for someone going through GBS is \"KEEP MOVING AS MUCH AS YOU CAN\".  The longer you wait to start rehab/physio, the longer it will take to recover.  At the very minimum, try to walk up and down the hall once an hour.\n\nI learned how important it is to have patience and remember to take a look back at how far I have come.  I still have a long way to go to get back to where I was 5 months ago(in terms of fitness) but I would like to think that this experience gave me a mental strength that turning the cranks would have never been able to provide.

Since she's been up here, she hasn't received any plasma exchange treatments and has been struggling to wean off of the ventilator. Today she's using 90% O2 of the ventilator, and her PEEP number is 16. 2 days ago she was using 45% O2, but she had a tough night and shot back up to 100% the same night. Doctor is afraid that there isn't much left to do, and isn't too optimistic about doing the plasma exchange treatments. Since my mom has been in the ICU, her kidneys havent been functioning, and the dialysis is working as well as they expected. I convinced the doctor to give my mom 5 treatments over the next 10 days in hopes that it will give her the kick start she needs to start getting better. The problem at the moment is that she's not even well enough to do a tracheostomy. My family and I have decided to do the tracheostomy as soon as my mom is stable enough to do so, so the tracheostomy is honestly our last hope to continue her recovery. My question to you guys is if you've ever experienced this kind of situation. Have you had plasma exchange treatments while on the ventilator and how did it go? Have you had a tracheostomy while dealing with CIDP/GBS in the ICU? Have you ever had plasma exchange treatments while using dialysis? Any answers to these questions are much appreciated.

I\u2019m a 26yo female. My first GBS symptoms presented themselves the first week of September 2019. One of the first and worst symptoms was intense facial/jaw pain. Constant throbbing to the point I thought it could be broken and having hallucinations. I tied frozen veggies to each side of my face day and night. \n\nWithin a week, the pain was gone and my face has been paralyzed since. I have been unable to close my eyes or my mouth completely so I have to bandage my eyes at night to sleep and can only drink from a specific water bottle and closing my mouth manually. I had 8 ivig treatments, a month of inpatient therapy with daily e-stim an hour daily, without improvement. \n\nNow, I have a single muscle above my right eyebrow, a second muscle underneath my right eye, and a muscle in my chin that slightly move. Because I am no longer doing e-stim and the muscles in my face are paralyzed, my face is swollen from lymph fluid and I cry uncontrollably 24/7. I am worried that my progress is extremely slow or that my face will not fully recuperate. \n\nI was wondering how long it took you/someone you know to regain control of their face and if there is anything in particular that helped.\n\nThank you!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 324, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Bilateral facial paralysis", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/ec1jj4/bilateral_facial_paralysis/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ChiTownChick", "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "72bdba60-1947-11e9-a37e-0e82cf55fbb8", "author_flair_text": "Survivor", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_12ug99", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576387221, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/eauyhs/dont_ignore_symptoms_because_youre_afraid/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eauyhs", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "#dadada", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e3a53416-194b-11e9-bcc2-0e097ee54f68", "link_flair_text": "Advice and Support", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/eauyhs/dont_ignore_symptoms_because_youre_afraid/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576387222, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a really bad anxiety disorder and the symptoms just appeared one day about a week or so after a serious respiratory infection.

Big mistake. \n\nMaybe you\u2019re like me and pretend the symptoms don\u2019t exist and just ignore your body yelling out for help. I have a huge fear of hospitals and not being able to leave them because my mom had 2 back surgeries 2nd one botched. I also was in a psych ward as a teen 3 times, so seeing the firemen is a trigger fOr me.  My mmmwas in the hospital for half of my 7th grade year, so I developed this fear of being trapped in the hospital. And she was so drugged up. It was a traumatic experience.\n\nSorry to go off there, but please don\u2019t ignore serious symptoms. They won\u2019t go away, they will only get worse. I woke up one day and I couldn\u2019t walk up the 3 stairs to our back door. I was crying and my mom got annoyed because nothing was helping. \n\nThe day I went to the hospital for the final time I was sitting on the living room couch. It would take me rocking back and forth to get the right momentum to get up ( and I\u2019d be sweating by the time I \u201cgot up\u201d). \nI\u2019ve only told my husband and my mom what happened next. \n\nI had to pee extremely bad but I was afraid I\u2019d get stuck on the toilet ( right then I should\u2019ve known to call 911). \nI didn\u2019t want to just go so in my darkest moment I had to use a cup. \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude29 because I literally was losing all functionality. \n\nAfter that I rocked back and forth and managed to stand. I thought I must be getting better because I could walk around the house. \nNot even close. I walked ( not even close to how I normally walk, I couldn\u2019t lift my thighs too high so I was taking literal baby steps) to my room and lost balance and grabbed the only thing I could see. My poor little guinea pig\u2019s cage. Don\u2019t worry I didn\u2019t pull her down. \n\nNow I\u2019d literally fallen and couldn\u2019t get up. ( THAT IS LITERALLY WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH MY MIND. THAT COMMERCIAL \u201cI\u2019ve fallen and I can\u2019t get up!\u201d) it\u2019s not funny at all. It\u2019s terrifying. But that\u2019s what was literally going through my head. \nI still refused to call 911. I had no idea my life was on the line. \nI called my mom who called my little bro. He\u2019s like 6 inches taller than me so we were sure he\u2019d be able to get me up. No go. And that plan wasn\u2019t well thought out anyway. I\u2019d just continue to ignore my symptoms until something horrible happened. I\u2019ve heard gbs can mess with your heart.

I had GBS in 2017 and have been having what I consider to be symptoms of a relapse. I\u2019ve been to the ER like 3 or 4 times in the last few weeks due to bad panic attacks and fear of relapse.\n\nI\u2019ve been having a vibrating feeling in my feet on and off for about a month, and also tingling in my fingertips. Along with that I\u2019ve had numbness/pain in my feet.\n\nNow I definitely did have lasting nerve damage but I guess the reason I got scared all over again was because it seemed like it had stopped completely or almost completely, then a month after a September cold went away it came back. I might just be tripping because I have pretty bad anxiety. But, in my head that\u2019s how it seems. My strength and balance is fine, though sometimes my legs feel a little shaky, but that could be cause I\u2019m an anxious mess lately.\n\nMy PCP said they don\u2019t think I need a spinal tap as they don\u2019t think it\u2019s coming back, but boy am I scared. It\u2019s been an all consuming thought everyday for the last few months. I\u2019m terrified.\n\nAnyone know what symptoms to look out for or know if they\u2019re on/off? When I got it the first time it came on pretty suddenly. Was in the bathroom at the hospital due to another illness, suddenly fell and couldn\u2019t get back up. So I didn\u2019t start off with tingling/numbness the first time.\n\nI\u2019m trying to keep my anxiety under control but every feeling is scaring me.. and raising my blood pressure which also isn\u2019t good lol.\n\nI had what my doctor today said may have been a URI that lasted maybe a week and went away about 4/5 days ago. So, besides my cold I\u2019m scared all over again because of that. It was just right side chest irritation and mucus coming up, but still. And every time I go outside I have throat irritation/running nose for maybe the rest of the day and then I\u2019m fine. But, that\u2019s also scarring me. Ugh. Maybe that\u2019s just allergies though.\n\nDoctor seems to be confident stuff is good, but who knows.

I had GBS in 2017 and have been having what I consider to be symptoms of a relapse. I\u2019ve been to the ER like 3 or 4 times in the last few weeks due to bad panic attacks and fear of relapse.\n\nI\u2019ve been having a vibrating feeling in my feet on and off for about a month, and also tingling in my fingertips. Along with that I\u2019ve had numbness/pain in my feet.\n\nNow I definitely did have lasting nerve damage but I guess the reason I got scared all over again was because it seemed like it had stopped completely or almost completely, then a month after a September cold went away it came back. I might just be tripping because I have pretty bad anxiety. But, in my head that\u2019s how it seems. My strength and balance is fine, though sometimes my legs feel a little shaky, but that could be cause I\u2019m an anxious mess lately.\n\nMy PCP said they don\u2019t think I need a spinal tap as they don\u2019t think it\u2019s coming back, but boy am I scared. It\u2019s been an all consuming thought everyday for the last few months. I\u2019m terrified.\n\nAnyone know what symptoms to look out for or know if they\u2019re on/off? When I got it the first time it came on pretty suddenly. Was in the bathroom at the hospital due to another illness, suddenly fell and couldn\u2019t get back up. So I didn\u2019t start off with tingling/numbness the first time.\n\nI\u2019m trying to keep my anxiety under control but every feeling is scaring me.. and raising my blood pressure which also isn\u2019t good lol.\n\nI had what my doctor today said may have been a URI that lasted maybe a week and went away about 4/5 days ago. So, besides my cold I\u2019m scared all over again because of that. It was just right side chest irritation and mucus coming up, but still. And every time I go outside I have throat irritation/running nose for maybe the rest of the day and then I\u2019m fine. But, that\u2019s also scarring me. Ugh. Maybe that\u2019s just allergies though.\n\nDoctor seems to be confident stuff is good, but who knows. Guess I\u2019m just venting here and asking......\n\nJust looking for some other POVs and experiences.

My first time really on Reddit. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions or experience with hand tremors after having been affected by Guillian Barre Syndrome previously. Earlier this year around March I was diagnosed with GBS. It was a frightening and terrible experience, to say the least, but luckily it was an acute form and I ended up recovering quite fast. I still had problems regaining my ability to walk, but I felt I was getting better every passing day. I went to Guatemala around July to go and volunteer in a project where I'd teach children English and help in the community. While there, I caught a pretty bad case of dengue. (This really wasn't my year, as you can tell by now). I went through the whole hospital bed thing and was released from the hospital about a week afterwards. The reason I'm writing this post is that I had noticed I began having hand tremors when I curled my fingers to a certain point. afterward the dengue. This was especially when I picked up a spoon and noticed the soup was just pouring out by the tremors. I hadn't noticed it before and I'm still dealing with the hand tremors to this day. It's been about 2 months since and I still have shaky fingers. My body has been recovering a lot more due to my therapy, especially the strength in my feet and arms, yet I don't know what to really do about this hand situation. Should I give it more time? Is it a sign of a weak immune system or is the GBS still taking time to leave? Does Dengue have anything to do with this?\n\nI appreciate you reading this. I would love to hear what you could recommend because I'm a tad bit worried about this situation at the present moment.\n\nThank you once again!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 282, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Help please!", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1572163341, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/dkoze4/help_please/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "heart_shark", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_44k4qwrz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1571469733, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/dk0gds/ive_never_talked_to_another_person_who_has/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dk0gds", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/dk0gds/ive_never_talked_to_another_person_who_has/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1571469733, "score": 8, "selftext": "I\u2019m (35M) on year 2 of recovery.

I went for a regular eye test after experiencing double vision for a week. My optometrist wasn't happy with what he saw and refferd me to an opthamologist the next day(which is an insanely short time, causing my mum to panic)\n\nFor the last couple weeks before that I had been very weak, and had a few falls where my body locked up.( Even spilt hot tea on myself once) But anyhow, the opthamologist was extremely concerned with my symptoms and wasn't letting us go till there was a hospital bed waiting for us. When I was admitted for the first time I could stand, bend my knees a bit, and still move my arms. During the night they put a heart-rate moniter on me, at one point I sat up and it shot up to 170bpm. Within a day I could bearly move, unfortunately they didn't update my chart and ended up discharging me saying It was just stress. There where quite a few bad practices during that adminision,such as forgotten medication and the like, but I digress.\n\nA week later I couldn't move, my GP saw me and said that I had GBS and needed a lumbar puncture to confirm it, We had to get an ambulance to the nearest hospital. The doctor who eventually proformed the procedure told us that it was unnecessary and even said \"do you know how much it costs us?\" She was really good despite that. I was transferred to a larger hospital during the night with GBS, and started IVIG. During all this I was pretty much completely alone, my mum has to care for my family and I was in a separate room. For the first two weeks I just continued to get worse even with the treatment, but ended up in a rehab ward. Eventually I was diagnosed with Miller fishers variant, increased intracranial pressure and FND\n\nRehab was quite odd, I had more treatment there then in acute, another course of IVIG started to help as well as multiple therapeutic lumber punctures, one of which hit a nerve causing chronic pain.\n\nAt the time I entered rehab I couldn't move at all, not being able to roll over was probably the worst, nurses got pissed at me for always pushing the call bell despite my inability to do anything myself. During rehab I ended up losing over 25kg(55lbs) I Started at 64kg(141lbs) and 174cm tall but 39 kg at my lowest with a bmi of around 13. I was bearly alive at that point, and had a NGT put in so I could be pumped with food. I was constantly vomiting because of the NGT, and stoped eating entirely because it was so uncomfortable. \n\nAfter three months I was given an ultimatum by the ward coordinator, get your weight up to 48kg so you can go home or be put in a care home. She gave me this because I was making 0 progress and others needed my spot, I still don't think that was right but I didn't have much choice.I worked until I could assist with transferring my body from place to place(pivoting was all I could do) When I heard that I may be able to go home I was elated, and became determined to do so.\n\nAfter four months I was discharged without a NGT.( Either they could take it out or I was going to rip it out)(Please don't threaten your healthcare professionals like I did) I had a diation who agreed to take it out, do out patient care as well as Ot/physio.\n\nNow seven weeks later I'm able to walk, cook, and do nearly everything the same as before.

Three weeks later I was admitted to the hospital, placed in the NCCU within 24 hours, on a ventilator soon after, and lost all movement/feeling in my arms and from the waist down. Thankfully, after heavy IVIG treatment I was taken off the ventilator within a couple days, was transferred out of the NCCU within a week, and then moved to a rehab facility after a couple weeks.

I've been out of the hospital for one month and I've gotten back to 100% again. I've been hiking and swimming and am generally the active person I was before I got GBS. Granted, I'm not exactly *old*, so that may contribute to the fast time of recovery. I've had a bit of leg pain but that seems to be alleviated for the most part. It's the end of a long and painful era, I guess. \n\nSome of the nurses and CNA's I had to deal with were human scum, but they're in the past now and I never have to see *them* again. I still can't get over the sharp contrast between the hospitals in Buffalo, NY and Winston-Salem, NC. In Buffalo everyone was nice and really wanted to help me. Once I got medivac'd to North Carolina I was pretty much just treated like a number. Man, I hate American health care. Luckily I had insurance because there are people who don't and have to pay *TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FUCKING DOLLARS FOR AN ER VISIT!* I feel so bad for all of the people still stuck in that rehab center that have been there for months. I wish there was something I could do to help them but I don't know how. \n\nI came out of the hospital extremely motivated to continue with life but after seeing what I saw there I just want to isolate myself from everyone and live in a shack in the woods, or something. Luckily we had a GoFundMe that raised 20k to support us, which was pretty damn cool. Also, celebrities I like (and some that I've never heard of in my life) sent me well-wishes over Twitter. I also received a bunch of gifts from Internet strangers. What really bothered me, though, is all the \"prayers\" that people were giving me. I don't personally have a religion and feel prayer is a way to do nothing and say you're helping. I don't really know how to describe it.. \"cheated\", maybe? I get that they meant well but it irritated me for unrelated reasons. Overall, though, my life is pretty damn good and I'm back to where I was before I got sick, but with a new understanding and purpose.\n\nTL;DR If I can do it, you can too.

I (22F) was diagnosed with GB almost 4 years ago. I recovered pretty well despite the leg pain here and there throughout the day along with fatigue. However, over the past couple of years I\u2019ve come to gather a list of symptoms that I go through on a daily basis. I wake up with a terrible stomach ache and nausea, but I never throw up. I have absolutely no appetite until (if I\u2019m lucky) around 2 pm. Some days I won\u2019t have an appetite until I\u2019m ready to go to bed. I still force myself to eat even if this causes more nausea. I also burp a lot throughout the day. Over the last few months I\u2019ve lost 20+ pounds with no exercise at all. I am constantly tired and have always had on and off episodes of depression. I always assumed these symptoms were just GB related OR i was just extremely stressed from finishing up college but it wasn\u2019t until recently I read up on celiac disease and how it can be linked to peripheral neuropathy. It just got me thinking. Does anyone else experience symptoms like this, or is anyone diagnosed with celiac that was later on diagnosed with GB (or vice versa)? Sorry if this is a jumbled mess.

a pulmonary function test for me which the diffusion area was low.

illness since the very end of september. I am hoping I can share a bit of my experience here, as I have recently read quite a bit more on GBS, and now am left wondering if I could have some form of this, or something related. Granted, it would fall into the more minor severity group of disease. \n\nSome of my first symptoms of disease were at end of september, where I started getting migratory joint pain. Different wrists, ankles, knees, etc seemed to have a strange pain and fatigue flare up. Around that time as well I was starting to get some pain and coordination issues with my left hand. Notably, I did not have numbness and tingling. Typing mistakes, dropping things more often, felt like it would behave as if my hands were very cold. Just clumsy and awkward. \n\nPain moved to my left elbow, where doctors promptly diagnosed me with tennis elbow on my non dominant arm even though i was resting for 2 weeks. \n\nEventually the neck pain increased quite a bit, my spine hurt and I started having strange sensations in my head including some burning, twitching facial muscles, and a sensation like someone was quite often flicking my hair above my right eyebrow. I started having some intermittent low grade fevers around here too, but I think this was due to sinusitis. \n\nAbout 2-3 weeks after initial symptom onset, things were at their worst. My whole body had a persistent sensation like I had worked out extremely hard, and felt like my muscles were jelly and very weak. At this point I was having some difficulty walking, although I could still get around fine. My knees would buckle getting out of bed in the morning, and often buckle on stairs, I had to move around really slow. Things seemed especially bad in my quads for a while, they had a very funny strange feeling to them that is hard to place. Like the muscles weren't firing correctly or something, very weak. \n\nIve had quite an extensive workup since then, seen by my primary, physiatry (for neck and spine pain), a neurologist, rheumatologist (both of which said consider CFS, more on that later), and a orthopedic doctor who had initially noticed I had joint pain in my wrists. \n\nI got tested for lyme multiple times, did multiple courses of antibiotics during this period (which thankfully got rid of the massive pressure in my head), tested for MG, autoimmune panels, a lot of CBCs, metabolic panels, thyroid, parathyroid, everything always came back normal. Borderline high calcium at times was the only irregularity, but ionized calcium normal. \n\nI also developed what I think may be 'red ear syndrome' a relatively harmless phenomenon where usually my left ear (sometimes both) gets very hot and filled with blood and turns very red. The non contact thermometer reports temps of 103.5-1.04 during these flair ups that last half hour to an hour. I dont have a real fever while they happen. I also once had a chest temperature increase in the same fashion, where my chest around my sternum all of a sudden flushed out and felt very hot, reaching 103.5, going away in about in hour. \n\nThe recovery has been extremely slow for me, I still am experiencing almost daily fatigue, tiredness and weakness. I had a great day yesterday. Today I felt the weakness and fatigue hit hard, along with spine chills (which I get intermittently this whole time). I feel like I am trending in a positive direction, but the intensity of the symptoms vary quite often. There is absolute improvement from the knee buckling and trouble walking week in October. \n\nDoes this sound like anybody's experience with GBS? I think it was ruled out relatively early for me, since I didn't have numbness or pins and needles sensation, but then I also had read that may not always be the case. \n\nAs for the note on CFS - from what Ive been able to determine based on discussions with cfs folks the hallmark of their disease seems to be the post exertional malaise. Where I feel ok doing light activities and often feel a little bit better after doing some mild activity. I just do not have stamina like I should for an otherwise healthy 36 year old. \n\nI'm looking back at this wall of text. If you got this far, thanks for reading. Ive just been sort of lost and never had an illness like this. I am continuing to see a variety of specialists, their wait times are out of control with this post covid situation.

Very uncomfortable, but I could still walk throughout and didn't have to be hospitalized. Since then I was able to rehab and a lot of things got better. Energy, nausea, weakness, tingling all improved. \n\nI got the second covid dose about 2 weeks ago. Flu symptoms disappeared after 24 hours. But then a week later, I started to feel bad again. I thought it was in my head. Just imagining, anxious, whatever. But, the last few days?\n\nNumbness really escalated in the legs. Especially today. Pins and needles came back in both legs. Then in the hands. Tingling to the point of burning or like an exhausted pain in quads. Hands getting slower. Getting harder to type. I could walk normal earlier today, but now it's like a shuffle with a slight knee buckling. Everything just feels so much more numb. Energy levels crashing. Though deep tendon reflexes still look okay on a test, whatever that's worth.\n\nDamn, I was hoping I was going to skate through this shot. Guess not. \n\nPreviously my neurologist refused treatment with IVIG because I was a mild case. I think that was the right call in hindsight. I don't want to go to the ER again without a good reason, because I know they won't do anything but treat or release. And if it's not life-threatening, I think they'll just say release to be safe.\n\nBut... I'm having a new thing. It feels like my chest is heavy. And I don't know. Maybe this is just anxiety. Cause, yeah, this is a really anxious time. I hate having to go through this again. But, it's like I have to think about breathing every now and then. And there's some tingling, numb, pins and needle crap in that area too. Like a small sense of pressure just below my sternum. And I'm just like......\n\nOkay, step back. Is this nerves? What does trouble breathing actually feel like? I had a mild case before, but how do I know if I hit an inflection point and that this is 'different'? It feels like things are going faster this time. I feel like I could slide off a cliff.\n\nI don't know. Anyone have any advice or insight? Ideas of what to do or where to go?\n\nBtw: I reached out to my neurologist but they haven't gotten back to me yet. Unfortunately not terribly surprising. I reached out to try to schedule and see more neurology appointments, but you can all guess how that is going.\n\nThanks for your time!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 869, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What does GBS breathing trouble feel like?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/naz1zn/what_does_gbs_breathing_trouble_feel_like/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "stayonthecloud", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6iere", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1620476687, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/n7o5cy/what_does_gbs_feel_like/", "gildings": {}, "id": "n7o5cy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 62, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/n7o5cy/what_does_gbs_feel_like/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1620476699, "score": 1, "selftext": "Please help.

TL;DR: It\u2019s been just shy of 3 years since I first felt my GBS symptoms, and I am doubting that I have GBS and wondering if I have CIDP instead. I have always had a mild case of GBS and have had no hospital stays, treatment, or physical therapy.\n\nI got the flu shot in early January 2018 and started feeling strange a few days later. It started with pins-and-needles feelings in my feet and legs, and spots on my body that felt cold or wet even though there was nothing there. I also started feeling weak in my arms, neck, and legs during that first week or so. From the very beginning, my symptoms have come and gone throughout the day. I would go to work for a few hours and then all of a sudden, I would be unable to hold my head up or use my arms and had to have someone pick me up from work because I was too weak to drive home by myself. Sometimes I would feel pretty much normal only an hour or two later, and other times it would last for days.\n\nBefore my diagnosis, I saw a few different types of doctors and had MRIs and lab work and allergy tests. I also went to the ER once because my episode/attack was so severe that I couldn\u2019t even hold my mouth closed because I felt so weak and could barely walk. They ran a bunch of tests but didn\u2019t suspect GBS at the time so I went home with no diagnosis. Eventually I got a referral to see a neurologist, who suspected it was GBS. I was fortunate to never be hospitalized because I had a mild case and so much time had already passed since I first felt symptoms. \n\nWhen I say \u201cweak\u201d I mean that I have a hard time walking, can\u2019t use my hands or arms normally, can\u2019t keep my head upright, etc. I also normally have the sensation of being underwater or like everything is in slow motion. I also sometimes have tingly feelings, feelings or burning or cold/wet on my skin, and brain fog. These are my symptoms along with extreme fatigue. \n\nDuring the first 6 months, I would be weak for a few days at a time and then normal for a few days and the cycle would continue. Then I went almost two months with absolutely no weakness or tingly feelings or nerve pain and I was SO HAPPY! On the 4th of July that year, my boyfriend and I camped out on the hills for a few hours above the golden gate bridge in San Francisco to watch fireworks and it was absolutely freezing cold (probably 20 degrees with the wind chill). I had also had some wine and then we got in the car and blasted the heater to warm up. This triggered the worst episode I have ever had. I couldn\u2019t use my arms or hands long enough to take a bite of food, or brush my hair, or go to the bathroom by myself and I could barely walk. This lasted about 4 days until I finally recovered.\n\nI told my neurologist about this and he started to suspect CIDP, and I finally had a spinal tap in November 2018 (10 months after I first felt symptoms) and he confirmed that I had GBS but not CIDP. Since then, my episodes have come and gone and have been getting less frequent and lasting much less time for the most part. The way I understand it, my symptoms have never been severe enough for treatment so I have never had any kind of treatment except a prescription for gabapentin to use every once in a while when I get those tingly or hot/cold skin feelings.\n\nIt will be three years in January since I started feeling symptoms and I\u2019m currently in one of the longest episodes I\u2019ve ever had. I got weak again a few days before Thanksgiving and it has lasted until now (Christmas was a few days ago). In the past 5-6 weeks, there have been less than 5 days where I\u2019ve felt completely normal all day. I\u2019m seeing a new neurologist in a few weeks to see if he thinks I can benefit from some treatment or if I have CIDP. \n\nI just have the feeling that this shouldn\u2019t be happening if it was GBS, although I know my GBS is different from most peoples.

I was convinced I had some kind of nerve impingement, until I had an appointment with my PCP on 11/2 and she sent me to the ER for GBS(which I had read about and written off). Basically after a lumbar puncture and a 3 hour long MRI, I was admitted and got 3 days of IVIG(Gammunex). The IVIG gave me headaches, and I vomited twice at the hospital. The neurology team I talked to seemed very positive about my prognosis and were confident that I had a mild case.\n\nAt that point I was only having pins and needles/numb sensation from my ankles down and in my hands, maybe a little up my shins. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed improvement in symptoms since the treatment. I didn\u2019t take the Gabapentin I was prescribed after leaving the hospital, that could have contributed to my next week which was terrible with migraines and nausea. The headache was so bad that I went to the ER, I believe they gave me Dexamethasone, which helped for a couple of days I think. I also took the Gabapentin again for a about a week, and I\u2019ve been off of it for a bit over a week now. Unfortunately, I also got very constipated from resting/dehydration and developed some bad hemorrhoids.\n\nI had an EMG on 11/17, where the doctor diagnosed me with CIDP. I felt very stiff and \u201csore\u201d the following day, and that never really went away. I have wild sensations up my legs to my knees, even smooth surfaces, and hands can feel sharp on the bottoms of my feet. My hands feel very tight or stiff through my wrists and elbows up to the sides of my neck. l am experiencing pretty consistent vision issues. I\u2019m unsure about what I\u2019m feeling, what is the disease and what is a side effect? What does a healing nerve feel like? What does high inflammation feel like? Spinal cord thickening? When should I be concerned?\n\nThe worst thing about this is that I don\u2019t really have a neurologist I trust or have communication with. I know I\u2019m probably leaving out a lot of details. I\u2019ve been learning a lot from this forum, it\u2019s a good resource. I\u2019m just looking for some wisdom and maybe some guidance. I know it can take 6 weeks to feel benefits from IVIG, I just want to know if it makes sense to feel this bad at this point. Thanks for reading.\n\n\nP.s.

Before my wife and I met (6years ago - she was 27) she apparently never noticed any difficulties in walking (she actually ran marathons). After marriage we used to go on long walks together and I noticed a very very slight slap of her right foot but always thought she\u2019s just tired. She got pregnant in 2018 and delivered c-section (by choice). During her pregnancy she had to take Thyroid medication and later got diagnosed with Hashimotos disease. Post pregnancy recovery, you could really notice her right foot limp / drop. Since then, the entire of 2020 we have tried to find a diagnosis. Spinal tap, blood reports, full body MRIs, EMGs, sural nerve biopsy, Pet scans etc etc. Things that could be seen were 1) Sciatic Nerve Enlargement 2) Oligoconal Band detected in CSF and Serum both (negative result) 3) First Ana profile was negative, a year later repeat test showed extremely small positive (doctor said high cases of false positive) 4) Muscle wasting below the knee - right foot 5) Sural biopsy showed mild dymylineation and axonal loss. She has no pain but now the foot drop and muscle wasting is getting worse despite continuous physiotherapy. Later EMG/MRI shows that despite taking Hansen\u2019s medication (she\u2019s from India) for 8 months there\u2019s been no improvement in the Sciatic nerve. She was also on steroids (30mg for a week and then tapered). We aren\u2019t sure of the steroids helped or not. In addition, post pregnancy she has had high Bilrubin (1.7) and gall bladder stones (last we checked they weren\u2019t blocking anything). In recent couple of months she seems to be losing weight as well. I don\u2019t know if any of this is connected but wanted to mention it.\n\nNow the doctors (we have consulted around the world) are unable to diagnose it without a Fascicular Sciatic nerve biopsy which a risky procedure apparently. We might still have to do it some day but the best guess right now focal CIDP and we are scheduled to start 5day course of IVIG next week. If this doesn\u2019t work then the biopsy might be done (will try to get it done in Mayo Clinic). \n\nFrom my personal research, I feel it really could be anything (Autoimmune, CIDM/CIDP, Amyloidosis, Sarcoidosis, Lupus, MS, Sjogren, MMN, GBS, Piriformis Syndrome etc) but it is difficult to diagnose without the sciatic biopsy.\n\nI just wanted to share our story and keep it updated going forward, in the hope that it helps us as well as someone else out there. \n\nWould love to hear any similar experiences, anything that jumps out, what to expect from IVIG, when could we expect to start seeing results, are future doses needed (as our doctor hasn\u2019t talked about it much - said if this works we can start oral immunosuppressant for maintenance), sciatic biopsy experiences, etc.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 634, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Foot drop, Sciatic enlargement - Starting IVIg", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/k2fkdu/foot_drop_sciatic_enlargement_starting_ivig/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "helpxl", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_80kc479a", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606468368, "domain": "self.guillainbarre", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/guillainbarre/comments/k1xwqg/electrical_stimulation_for_gbs/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k1xwqg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/guillainbarre/comments/k1xwqg/electrical_stimulation_for_gbs/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1606468379, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello, all.

Only symptoms I seem to have left are fast heart beat, low blood pressure, dizziness, pain/weakness in hands and feet. I've been reading that some people make a full recovery fairly quickly, while for others it takes a long time. For those of you who had a slow recovery, how long did it take to make a full recovery/good recovery? And what symptoms took the longest to go away?\n\nThanks for sharing.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "guillainbarre", "subreddit_id": "t5_3e5rb", "subreddit_subscribers": 629, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "For those of you who had a very slow recovery, how long did take you to make a full recovery?

"selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI just thought I'd share this article I found with this sub to anyone who may be interested on the impact of a COVID-19 vaccination for GBS/CIDP sufferers.\n\n*\"But the UK's Vaccine Taskforce chair, Kate Bingham, estimates hundreds of thousands people might not benefit from a vaccine because they do not have a working immune system.\n\nThis might be due to an immune deficiency, or because they are taking immune-suppressing drugs, for diseases such as cancer.\n\n\"It's crucial that we leave no one behind as we move closer to finding both a vaccine and developing more treatments for Covid-19,\" she said.\n\n\"We particularly need to ensure those who cannot be given a vaccine, such as* **people who are immuno-compromised,** *have alternatives available that will help protect them.\"\n\nAstraZeneca, which is developing the antibody injection, hopes it will offer 6-12 months' protection.\n\nStudy lead Prof Andrew Ustianowski said, while vaccines work \"by inducing a person's immune system to produce antibodies that inhibit or 'neutralise' the virus\", his team are investigating whether similar protection could be given to the immuno-compromised, by injecting antibodies which have been shown to neutralise the virus directly into the muscle.\n\nThis bypasses the immune system for those people who \"don't respond well to vaccines, or cannot be

I thought I might had been appendicitis but I didn't have any fever or nausea, the doctor examined me, told me to get a few tests (a blood test and an ultrasounds) and apparently everything was normal with only signs of an already contained food poisoning. \n\nThe colon pain is gone now but when I felt the balloon on my right side I could also feel that something was pressing against a nerve there because my right leg felt very very slightly numb, that started on Saturday before going to sleep. The next day I started feeling a bit of tingling in my foot. I went to the doctor yesterday (that's when he told me I was basically all good) and I still had the tingling on my right foot, I mentioned that to him and he told me to get an x-ray of my sacro lumbar section. \n\nThe thing is that later that day the tingling extended to my right hand, then left foot, then left hand. It was mild but noticeable, at night I decided to do some stretches for sciatica pain and it seemed to relief the numbness on my right foot. I did the same thing in the morning and so far I haven't had much tingling and I believe zero numbness on my feet (it actually comes every ones in a while like just one needle slightly pinching somewhere there). As for the hands, they kind of feel the same as yesterday but now it's more localized at the tip of my middle fingers and my thumbs.  Two things I'd like to mention is that the tingling comes and goes and also I can feel a slight pain in my hand joints that also comes and go, also when I clench the muscles of my right leg, it feels as if had worked out, it's a slight soreness as well.\n\nI know it's very early to come to conclusions but nothing like this has happened to me before, it's overall a very mild sensation, it's not debilitating. I want to wait a bit longer before seeking medical attention just to see if anything gets better or worse as time passes.\n\nIf anyone can give me their opinions or thoughts I'd be very grateful.
