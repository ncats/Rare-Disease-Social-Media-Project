The surgery actually didn't go so well and I had swelling complications that ended up cutting the blood supply to my lip and had to have another surgery to relieve the pressure which ended up with some tissue necrosis and lost ~30% of the white part of the lower lip and incurred some other damaged tissue. They reassured me that as soon as the lost tissue is healed they will be able to do a revision hopefully making things look somewhat normal again. It was never an issue really but my mother noticed it had grown which prompted the surgery along with having good insurance and just graduating college.  I had a surgery in 93, 04, and 06. The last 3 surgeries were done at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. The first two by a Dr. Clay who is now in Mississippi I believe. He was a very nice guy and very talented. I would recommend him to anyone who was in his network. I always knew I had a neurofibroma but never had heard of NF1/2 until just yesterday. Im not sure if I carry either mutation yet. I'm hoping to have children one day and I am going to look into genetic testing soon. Has anyone done so? Did insurance cover it or was it out of pocket? How much does it usually cost? I also want to get an MRI to make sure that I don't have any other tumors anywhere.  I just wanted to introduce myself and say Hi. If you have any questions what-so-ever feel free to post or PM.

I've read that most of the symptoms other than the CALs don't appear until later in life, but I thought the lisch nodules might be evident, even at this age. \n\nWe have the MRI tomorrow, and he seems a-okay. Excited even. He can have food up until 5am, so I told him I would get up at 4am to make him a big breakfast of his choice. He's pretty thrilled about that.  The procedure sounds like it will be relatively easy. They will give him a fast-acting sedative through an IV, so he should be ready to go 15-20 minutes after the scan. That makes me feel a good deal better. Here's hoping for some good results there!\n\nTL;DR: Five-year-old son has lots of CALs, but just heard from the ophthalmologist that his eyes are clear for symptoms of NF (No lisch nodules or indications of pressure).

I have been a bit of a wreck today. I took my five-year-old son in for a check-up and asked the doctor about several spots he has all over his body. They are CALs, and he has at least 7 of them more than a centimeter in diameter. I had looked them up online and found stuff about NF1, but tried to not worry about it because WebMD is always scary. He also has freckling/discoloring on his neck, groin, and armpit. He has complained about the occasional headache and of his hip hurting of all things. Neither my husband or I have been diagnosed or shown signs of it that we know of, but then again, we don't really know what those signs would be and certainly haven't been watching for it. \n\nThe doctor removed all of my nonchalance by becoming concerned when I showed him the spots. He drew a blood sample for testing (in my anxious state, I should have asked specifically where the test was being done and what exact type of test it is). Next week, we're scheduled with an ophthalmologist and then we have an MRI. I'm really nervous about sedating him for the MRI. The doctor, for all of his concern, seemed to have very little knowledge of the disease and even went to do research on it during the appointment. The pathologist told me she had to look it up on the internet to see what sort of blood test it was. So I'm not sure what to think of their judgement.\n\nI know we can't get any real answers until the tests are done, but I guess I'm just reaching out for advice/reassurance/anecdotal support. I have read that a lot of children my son's age are diagnosed just based on the spots and freckling, since other symptoms don't come until later. From your experience, is it likely that our son will be diagnosed? I know it's incredibly variable (which is all the more frightening), but what can we expect? If it's not NF1, what could it be?\n\nTL;DR: My five-year-old's check up has turned into a wave of anxious testing. He has CALs and freckling, but not much else. Occasional headaches. What can we expect? \n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your kind words, encouragement, advice, and the gold! I am so glad I have found this wonderful community, whether he is diagnosed or not.

I'm 22, turning 23 in a week, and a senior in college.  Was diagnosed with NF type 1 when I was one year old, so I've lived knowing I've had NF just about my entire life.  The disorder has affected me in multiple ways.  For example, my balance really isn't that good.  I have a few small Neurofibromas here and there, most of which I just live with.  Had one taken off my foot when I was a baby (which is what allowed me to be diagnosed with NF), and then another removed from my left hand when I was 15.  I have countless others, that I have not gotten removed, mostly as they don't bother me enough to undergo another surgery, but also because of fear of nerve damage (almost had one removed from the back of my left knee when I was nine, but the doctor recommended that we shouldn't after an MRI).\n\nThe most traumatic thing NF has put me through, however, was shortly after my 12th birthday.  The doctors found three astrocytomas in my brain and I was rushed into the hospital for emergency surgery to get the largest of them removed.  Complications arised, including a staph infection and need for two shunts, and I spent a good three and a half weeks in the hospital.  I then had to go back a few more times that summer for follow up surgeries.  Two years later, another astrocytoma started to grow, so I went back to get that tumor removed as well.  However, that surgery was not nearly as traumatic as the previous brain tumor removal.  I've had a few small follow up surgeries since, but they were all smaller things, such as a shunt revision or two.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to introduce myself and say that I'm glad I found this place.  Have never really had a connection to other people with NF before.  I *almost* went to the NF camp when I was a preteen, but then I went into the hospital.

I was diagnosed at the age of 16. At the time I was playing foot ball (not well, but I was on the team). I had always been athletic but never cared about sports and was always uncoordinated. None the less, my friend at the time got me into the sport and as I started to progress, I of course was going through puberty, which is the point NF reared it's ugly head.\n\nIt started with a bowing of my left shin found at my physical. Scans found a cyst at the center of it and I was ordered by the doctor to not play football until a specialist took a look at it for fear it would snap. After weeks of being sidelined I finally seen a specialist in Detroit, who still makes me laugh when I think about him. We traveled across the state to see this specialist. he puts the MRI up on the light bored and says \"you see this?\" pointing to the obvious bowing and cyst. \"that is not normal\" \"...\" \"but go ahead and play\".\n\nIt was bitter sweet really, it felt like a waste of time, but I got the clear to play again. I got home in time to help my friend as a coaches assistant for the rocket league and raced my bike over to the field with my football in between my handle bars. A bump in the road knocked the ball loose and I ran over it with my back tire which flipped my bike and me into the air where I did the nicest shoulder check to the pavement. I was young and sprung right back up, but couldn't move my arm much. having just recently watched lethal weapon and being a dumb kid I figured I dislocated my shoulder and when I got the field I had my friend lift my arm to pop it back into place. this was immediately met with excruciating pain. So, I left to go to the urgent care. This also makes me laugh, as they took and Xray, and put it up on the board, and clearly you can see that my collar bone is nearly in two, and the doctor says \"I am going to have to get a specialist to look at this\" I know it is protocol, but again, I was a dumb kid and couldn't help but laugh as I had no medical training and I looked at it for 0.5 seconds and said \"there's your problem\".\n\nWell, football season that year was done for me, I was in a sling for a long time. but base ball season was just around the corner and I figured I would stay in shape and condition myself for that. I started working out and one day noticed I had lost some strength in my left leg, I figured I just pulled a muscle and nursed it a bit, but when baseball tryouts started, I hit the floor hard doing a shuffle exercise and decided I would go to the doctor. the reflex test showed no reflex in my left leg... tests where done and shown that I had weakening nerve connection to my calf, MRI's showed a tumor mass growing from my spine. (as a side note, I have always been a bit of a dare devil. at the time my leg starting to weaken, I still found it a good idea to do flips off of the gymnasium bleachers onto a pol-volt mat we got a hold of in gym class, my last jump, I over shot and my foot smashed on the floor and fractured my ankle... so all of my sophomore year I was in a sling or cast... my team mates started to speculate I was faking it lol)   \n\nNow, I have always had my inner demons. I, like any sane teen, struggled with depression. But mostly I never had the attention span to stay self loathing for long. When I was told the nerve damage was permanent, I held it together, but all voices started to sound like the peanuts adults after that, all that rang in my head was that I only had further loss of functions to look forward too, and they just want to wait and see, because surgery could make it worse. I feel like I checked out for the rest of the meeting with the doctor, and came too when my mom was in the drive threw at Mcdonalds and asked me what I wanted.... and I could do nothing but quiver my lips trying to hold back the tears. My mom of course hugged me and cried, which didn't help my holding back. I remember honking behind us as we sat in the drive through hugging each other and crying for a few moments, I don't think I ate anything the rest of the day. \n\nKeep in mind that at this time, we had no idea really what NF was or to suspect it, but the idea got brought up since my Uncle and Aunt on my Mom's side had the disease. All I knew was my aunt was on disability for a learning disorder and my Uncle had a messed up eye... not exactly helping my demeanor.\n\nwell, I went to the NF clinic and they denied I had enough signs at the time, mostly because my mom had never been diagnosed, but we found the missing cafe olay to get the diagnoses. this eventually lead to finding Dr. Mckay Mckinnon, a surgeon at the university of Chicago, famous for removing a 200lb tumor from a woman. We found out from him, not only is my tumor much larger than we where led to believe, but it has invaded my glute and my bladder, and is only getting worse. I was signed up for surgery so fast my head was spinning. I lost my glute, half my bladder and a lot of tumor. Most of my Junior year was spent recuperating from the major surgery. The incision went from the back of my knee to the outer rim of my... rim.\n\nas the years went on, I have lost all mobility of my left foot, but with some ace wrap I can walk around. I am years over due for follow up scans, but as I progress in life I find it more and more difficult to take time off of work to spend tons of money to either be told I am fine, or worse, that I have more trouble ahead.\n\nI am currently a Medical Assistant, and now that I am in a profession, now that I am engaged to the woman of my dreams, now that I find myself with more responsibility, I am finding it more and more obvious that I have a memory problem.\n\nI have always been easily distracted, mostly by my own thoughts. I would get really excited, pull out my note pad and pen in class and think \"yes, I am going to pay attention, I am going to ace the test, I am going to get a scholarship, then I will be on my way to a great university and make a...\" the bell rings, I missed the lesson, and I have doodles all over the page I indented on making notes on.\n\nnow, what I find funny is, far too often I forget the simplest things seconds after someone tells me, yet I always did well on tests, most of my problems came from not remembering to do homework. but I doodled in class and drove the teachers crazy when they couldn't keep my attention, turn in any homework, but pass the class with my test scores. further more, I tend to do my best when I just blurt out the answer (I often blurt out things randomly, not always appropriate) but I don't tend to do well when I have to think about the answer. math is a good example. I did much worse with the show your work crap, but half the time I can solve the problem with what feels like not even thinking about it. I second guess myself and try to work out the problem in the method we are suppose to use and it takes forever, and I get 3 different answers before finding out I was write the first time.\n\nthe hard part, what I fear puts strain on my job and relationship, is that adult life is not multiple choice tests. I have a terrible sense of direction, I forget instructions and details almost instantly. I forget to make appointments, I forget to pay bills, I forget to look at our expenses. I find that as my awareness of my memory and attention issues blossoms, so does my anxiety and depression, further impeding my attention span, and it can be a vicious cycle.\n\nWhen things look their darkest, I have to keep in mind that I am working at a wonderful hospital with doctors that respect me and what I do, I am making a living with the woman of my dreams and although we hit hard times with expenses, we live in a great place and always make due. I want to eventually further my education and move up with my responsibilities, and if ever I have my self doubts, my future wife, and colleagues remind me of my hard work and accomplishments, I even had a world renowned cardiac surgeon compliment me and encourage me to keep moving forward. I will always struggle with my limitations, but I am thankful for the support I get, and the reminder that I am capable of more than I give myself credit for.

I have SCOURED the internet for NF information and still can't seem to get closure on our following situation:\n-We have a daughter who is turning 7 in a couple days. Smart as a whip, no learning/behavior issues, only 1 CAL spot and some freckles near her groin. 2 years ago I took her to the dermatologist to look at a random mole I found between her toes. Mole was fine, derm asked to see the rest of her freckles. She immediately noticed the freckling and asked about NF. No family history, no other diagnostic factors so far. The dermatologist went on and on about the disease and even referred us for genetic testing even though she did not meet the criteria.\nTomorrow I'm taking her to our regular pediatrician, who will take some photos of the freckles and send them to the genetics dept to see if they think she should be tested. Here are my questions:\n-I have read that the genetic testing, if negative, STILL is not a guarantee that she doesn't have it. I can't imagine stressing about this for years and years. Is it common for someone to not meet the criteria until puberty?\n-I've googled the shit out of \"inguinal freckling\" and every single picture is of someone's armpits, which is actually axillary freckling, not inguinal. How common is it to have groin freckles but not armpit freckles in NF? She has about 30 freckles and they aren't super close together. They kind of go from her groin to around her whole hip area, so not super clustered. Also, she doesn't seem to have gotten any more in the last 2 years.\nYou can't even google inguinal freckling without NF coming up. Does anyone have freckles down there without NF?\n\nI hope this made sense, and whoever is willing to answer this mess of questions, I really appreciate it. \n\nEDIT: It was just freckles.

My boyfriends mom died almost exactly a year ago from a tumor growing on her brainstem from nf1. My boyfriend has had a tumor since he was a baby and it has never caused any problems. Lately though he constantly tells me he's old (he's  30). His mom was 52 when she died so he has it in his head he is middle aged and only has like 20 years left. I have been shrugging it off and pointing out that his grandma died from the disease in her 80s, so his death  ks not as imminent as he thinks. Now, though, i want him to be tested to see if anything is going on up there. He works a lot so i said i would help find a doctor who specializes in nf1. \n\nAlso, our 2 month old has 15 cafe au lait spots, so he might have it as well. Kinda worried about him as well. His pediatrician  said she would look for more signs later on when he is a little older, but it seems like i find new spots on him every  day.\n\nWe are in the Dallas area. We called a specialist here and they wont have an opening until February. We are willing to go out of state if we have to if we can get an appointment before the end of the year. We have hit our out of pocket max with our insurance, so anything medical (in network) is completely free until the end of the year. \n\nAny help or advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAlso, you people  are pretty amazing. I wish more people knew about this disease because while its pretty common, i had never heard of it before i was pregnant with my daughter (2 years, does not have nf1). My boyfriends mom was an amazing lady and when she was dying, it was just heart breaking to see her go from alright to dead in 5 months. She didnt get checked out annually because her husband was a dick. When she was in pain anytime she asked to go to the doctor the entire time they were together (30ish years), he would get mad and say she was going to make them lose their house because  they didnt have insurance, so she just never said anything when she was hurting. The pain was probably an early sign, and had she been checked 4 or 5 years before, they might have had a better chance with radiation or chemo. Instead, my kids have to grow up and not remember her. When she was in hospice care at home (they live with us), she tried to take a bath one day and couldnt get out of the tub. I would usuaally help her, but was asleep at the time. Her husband bitched about how helping her get out hurt his back and it still hurt 2 hours later, s o she said she wouldnt ask him anymore.  The next day i got up and heard a noise in the bathroom. She had tried to take a bath and couldnt get out, so she had been stuck for about 30 or 45 minutes because she didnt want to ask him for help.Her husband still lives with us and i have not spoken to him or acknowledged  his presence  since October  because of how he treated her before they found the tumor and how he neglected and abandoned  her during her last 3 months. When she was in the nursing home, he didnt visit her a single time.\n\nI know all of that was too much information,  but oh well.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Finding a doctor help", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/3dcx2z/finding_a_doctor_help/"}, {"author": "TheWayIDo", "author_created_utc": 1403483055, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_h3ahw", "created_utc": 1436196531, "domain": "self.neurofibromatosis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/3cb75g/paranoia_and_hatred/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3cb75g", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 11, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/3cb75g/paranoia_and_hatred/", "retrieved_on": 1440628296, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Just venting here:\n\n\nI'm scared.

He's got a big one on his hip and then several other small ones. Maybe 4 total but I'm not entirely sure. I told his dad years ago that he needs to watch out because of that being a sign of NF. \n\nMaybe about 3 months ago we noticed some tiny flesh colored raised bumps on him. Very tiny tho. Probably .5cm or less and maybe about 20 total. I thought at first maybe they were just some type of warts. My daughter (not related to him) has some small flat warts on the back of her leg so I thought maybe he got them from her. \n\nWe were looking at them again yesterday and I thought to myself how weird that they're all over his body. Arms, legs, hands and maybe one on the back of his neck and wouldn't they be in one area like my daughter's if they were warts. Then I remembered the cafe au lait spots and it clicked. \n\nI hope that I'm just overreacting but I told his dad to make him an appointment to get checked out. My friend whose daughter also has NF1 told me they would have caught it when he was young once the doctor saw the spots. I'm not so certain tho because his mom hasn't really kept up with his care like she should have and why we have him now. \n\nMy stepdad has plenty of raised spots but they're pretty large (diameter of a quarter and maybe 1-2cm high). I don't know if maybe they start out that tiny in the beginning? \n\nThanks for any input.

That turned out to be fine, so the doctor recommended a look at her whole body to check all of her skin. When my daughter disrobed, the dermatologist noticed freckling in her groin area. I'd like to add that this was 2 months after we lost our son in an accident. The dermatologist brings up neurofibromatosis and goes into all the complications it can cause. My daughter, who is already wigged out at the doctor's office after losing her brother, becomes very anxious about the diagnosis, as do I. \n\nMy daughter is now 6 years old. Still has the freckles and a total of only 1 cafe au lait spot. She is normal height, regular head size, at the top of her class academically and with all other normal physical/emotional attributes. She is also biracial (Indian and white).\n\nWas the doctor a little ahead of herself calling out NF with just the presence of groin freckles, or is it really a significant symptom? I know only time will tell ultimately, but I'm just wondering how much I should even be concerned. If more cafe au lait spots show up that are the right size, I would certainly take her in. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Parent with a question", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/350sl6/parent_with_a_question/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1430700683, "domain": "self.neurofibromatosis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/34ruuj/honesty_over_apperance/", "gilded": 0, "id": "34ruuj", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/34ruuj/honesty_over_apperance/", "retrieved_on": 1440756491, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I recently posted an ad to craigslist. I'm only looking for a friend with benefits and I thought this would be the best place. I have had two previous hookups from craigslist  they were both good and a few first meetings that were ok. (one ended badly..more to come)  What I did learn from these two experiences that in my case I find it's best to make a connection with somebody and then I meet them at hotel because I'm pretty comfortable with that. The last two guys that I did hook up with that kind of how it went down and awkwardness because we both knew when we were there.\nWell this time in the ad I posted looking for more long-term friends with benefits situation somebody I have a good sexual attraction with and that I can push boundaries.\nWell I got 100 messages at least and quickly narrowed it down to one... Been messaging for about two weeks and are ready to meet really soon. We have exchanged some really sexy steamy messages and I'm hoping that we are going to have some good in person chemistry and have some really good sex. Definitely the potential is there.\nSo the problem is my neurofibromatosis. I am not disclose this to him because if he googled it the images of it will fucking freak him out. I do have noticeable small lumps on many areas of my skin I am completely self conscious of this. I really don't even know how to broach the subject.\nI did have one day where we met in a public area and went for a walk during this walk we totally made out...like he was feeling me EVERYWHERE. I thought we had really good chemistry and then he asked me if I had a skin condition he thought they were warts mostly because he felt someone some of that on my back. I told him what it was and he said he would look it up and he would see me again and he strung me along for about a week and I dumped me. Obvious this was a huge blow to my self-esteem and now I'm not feeling as confident as I was before. I'm not wanting to catfish somebody I don't want to portray myself for something I'm not but I also don't want to sound insecure and point my flaws.\nI have sent this guy lots of pictures and you can kind of see some of the bumps ...he's never said anything and all other than that I'm super sexy super and he wants to fuck me.\nThe next issue is my boobs because of this neurofibromatosis I have some lumps on the nipples kind a looks like I have two nipples almost... it's either maybe going to be a huge turn on or a huge disappointment.\nA little bit extra to compound the problem is all the pictures up I have sent him are in sexy lingerie and he thinks I have amazing boobs which I don't obviously don't due to the aforementioned problem and also because without a pull-up bra they're really not perky. I'm not trying to lie....I dint edit the pictures at all but they are GOOD\nSo I can get message is from him telling me that he thinks I'm totally hot and sexy and beautiful and he really really wants me but all I can think is when he sees me he's going to be disappointed.\nWith clothes on I'm full of confidence and I get lots of looks from men and I just want to have that same confidence naked. I don't want to lie to somebody I don't want to be rejected.\nNo obviously I thought about messaging him kinda saying what I said but I think it just sounds so that it can lacking confidence and I definitely don't want that to come across as that.\nRight now the messages we've been sending each other are super sexy super hot super detailed super Dirty and I think we can have amazing sex so do I just leave it?

The last thing I want to do is act a paranoid man in front of a community of loved individuals. But here it is:\n\nI've always had this birthpatch on the right side of my chest, and the reason I'm saying patch instead of mark is that it is rather large. In fact, it consists of many different sized spots. This has been bugging me in my life and caused (I'm sure)unneccessary unpleasantry in cases where I'm revealing it. I'm now almost 21 years old, and I've had it for as long as I remember. \n\nJust a few days ago I looked up if there was a dermatologist nearby that could remove the caf\u00e9 au lait-spots(which I now know the marks are called). While searching around for that I stumbled upon neurofibromatosis and that caf\u00e9 au lait-spots is one of the first signs of having nf. Now my internet searching changed course, and I tried to find more about how they diagnose people that suffer from nf. At least six caf\u00e9-au-lait spots with a diameter of 1,5 cm is one sign of seven. You need two to be diagnosed. I'm rather pale and the spots are not really that visible for me to count and measure them, but I think I have around or more than six. The other signs are signs that I can't check for at home, but I wonder if it's necessary to go to the doctor and have them check on me. Which brings me back to this reddit post - do you think my spots warrant a doctor's visit and a worried mind?\n\nI tried to take a photograph and edit it so you could see the spots better, but I fear you can't see all that good, but here's [the original](http://i.imgur.com/Vx5Mlq0.jpg) and here's the slightly [edited one](http://i.imgur.com/pubAW72.jpg). You can't really see it, but the spots span almost from my back, up to and above the nipple and down to the center of the stomach.\n\nA little background information that might be relevant: no family member with neurofibromatosis, I am twenty years old and I'm from and live in Sweden.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Worried that I might have neurofibromatosis", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/2tuqbx/worried_that_i_might_have_neurofibromatosis/"}, {"author": "monkeypawz", "author_created_utc": 1379974901, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_d9gps", "created_utc": 1422220009, "domain": "self.neurofibromatosis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/2tnec8/anyone_had_children/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2tnec8", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/2tnec8/anyone_had_children/", "retrieved_on": 1440945727, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Ladies, have any of you had children?

While I miss her pure spirit every day, I am glad she is no longer struggling in a world  where she couldn\u2019t hear, sit, stand, walk, eat, and see anymore.  And although NF2 was a huge part of her and her life experiences she didn\u2019t let her genetic condition define her.  She was forever focused on PEOPLE.  She wanted to always help others and better the world around her.  I am so blessed that God granted me several prayers.  I prayed often that she not suffer or die scared and alone.  She did have pain but didn\u2019t have tremendous suffering.  At the end she knew she was home and surrounded by her entire family before she passed.  She smiled at us and told us all how much she loved us.  Bekha inspired us all so much and so many people she encountered.  To keep her legacy and help her continue to impact people now that she is gone her family has created the Rebekha Scott Servant Leadership scholarship at UIS.  This endowed scholarship will continue to grow and assist students long after the family and friends that knew Bekha are gone.  I am sure she would be super excited if she were still with us and heard about this scholarship.  Her time living independently at University of Illinois Springfield was some of her happiest years.  If you are interested in giving to her scholarship please use the following links.  Donations of any amount are accepted and all donations are tax deductible.

I first need to say I was born into some very  favorable circumstances. My dad is a doctor and a damn good one at that. In addition I was even more lucky that my dad had a patient with NF at the time of my birth. Having someone with deep medical knowledge in your life can really help put a cap on and contextualize family medical drama.  That is if they remember to tell you about all that fancy medical stuff. Now my dad is an   amazing doctor, an amazing father, and he treats my mom very well, but when off work he has the tendency to be a little bumbling and unfocused. This is where the story starts. My dad got a phone call from a female medical school friend that she was going to be in town and wanted to meet up. My dad, being the nice guy he is, invited her over to dinner. Now my mom absolutely hated this woman. My mom thought this friend was loud, obnoxious, and inconsiderate. But what is done is done, she was going to be coming over and my mom just had to fake enthusiasm. The night of the dinner comes and this medical school friend joins my parents for a nice dinner and some catching up. \nAt this time I was still a baby, like around 1 if I remember the story correctly. During the dinner the friend looked at me, paused for a moment, then turned to my dad. She asks \"Does PM_ME_KIM_JONG-UN happen to have neurofibromatosis?\" My dad casually responds with, \"Oh ya, I know. He does.\" Now this is the first time my mom ever heard of this. She does not know what neurofibromatosis is. She has no clue what issue this lady is seeing in her cute baby boy.  \"Neurofibromatosis, what the hell is that!\" \"What is going on!\" \"Is my baby going to die!\" were likely the thoughts rushing  through my mom's mind. My mom proceeds to break down crying, which pretty much ends the dinner. So that is the story of how I got diagnosed with NF.\n\nTL;DR: My dad is a doctor and forgot to tell my mom he diagnosed me with NF.

Anyway we were then referred to the genetics team and paeds. She started walking after 8 or so hours in ED so they said more than likely that was transient synovitis. \n\nShe is now 2.5 years old, we have been on yearly paeds appointments, developmentally, she is grand, nil issues, makes friends, has a wild imagination and we have been told she is ahead of her mile stones. Because of this, the paeds Dr said that if she didn't have these cafe au lait spots clustered under her arm pit she wouldn't be under yearly review, and also that she won't be cleared from NF until she is 8. Her eye tests have come back fine too. I'm just wondering, what sort of things do you notice in this age bracket? And also, had anyone had these cafe au lait spot and then been cleared of NF? \n\nWe are wanting to have another baby as well, and the paeds lady said my partner is more than likely the carrier - suspected NF, but not being followed up on.

I\u2019ve been poking around this subreddit and figured this was the best place to post.\n\nMy wife has NF1, when I met her, she was never \u201cthat girl that has NF1\u201d, to me she was just the girl I fell in love with. She told me about her condition early on and it really didn\u2019t bother me, she has a very mild case that was caught early on when she was born. She is very away of her condition, she knows she had some learning difficulties growing up and has some bumps and latte spots, but other than that no surgeries or major issues yet. She was and always has been a quiet person. After we got married, we started talking about kids, the topic of her condition came up and we decided that even though she has a condition, it has not had any major negative impact on her life, so she would feel ok if our child ended up with NF1. Fast forward 2 years and my wife is pregnant, we are very excited. But, now that pregnancy is real, we have been doing a little more research on NF1 and what we should be looking out for, and after reading material online, I\u2019m terrified.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in mistakes, we would not go back and change anything, we are still excited to be parents, but for me I\u2019m having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that our child may end up with a more severe case of NF1. I feel like I might be hyper fixating on this because I\u2019m anxious of being a parent. Like if it wasn\u2019t NF1 I would be worried about other things that run in the family.\n\nWe have one of our first appointments coming up and we will be discussing it with the doctor, if they are not familiar with NF1 we will try to find one that is. \n\nIs there anyone that is in a similar situation or has kids with NF1?

I then talk to this specialist and I am told: well, this is going to happen as you get older. There is nothing you can do or eat to prevent it.\n\nWhat the actual F? You literally told me it was not a concern or my case would not get worse. I am feeling so low and I am hating myself now. I am keeping the tears inside but guys I am struggling.

Our doctor told us he wouldn't help us until we saw a genetic counselor. As far as we know there's a 50/50 chance of passing it on. The doctor is not familiar with NF, and told us the possibilities are endless and depending on the results of the tests, DH could have anywhere from a 0% - 100% chance of in fact passing it on. Does this make sense to anyone else? We've done lots of research, as has DH's mom, and we've never heard anything like that before. \n\nIt's frustrating since the wait times for genetic counselors in our area are around 1.5 years, coupled with a year-long wait list for IVF.

Not with hands/fingers, but just - sitting, is there a sensation of something there?\n\n-What is the difference in sounds between normal hearing and that coming through the device? Is it mechanical or computerized sounding? Can you tell the difference in sound coming through natural hearing and that coming through the device?\n\n-Do you have any improvement in figuring out the direction of sound with the BAHA?\n\n-Does it give you any pain or general discomfort overall?\n\n-Has it caused any pain or discomfort in your \u2018good\u2019 ear?\n\n-When the device isn\u2019t attached, is there any feedback/sound/whatever through just the abutment? Say if it\u2019s brushing against clothes collars, etc.\n\n-I know they don\u2019t generally improve loud settings, but does it help you at all say in restaurants? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s very situational, but just in general.\n\n-Do you feel like it was a worthwhile improvement in your life overall? (That sounds silly maybe, I know, but I\u2019ve been SSD for so long that I\u2019m mostly adjusted, and just deal with the oddness that happens, so I\u2019m wondering if you feel like it was worth the surgery/any discomfort, etc.)", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does anyone have a BAHA for single sided deafness?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/5ujqm7/does_anyone_have_a_baha_for_single_sided_deafness/"}, {"author": "toothpicklez", "author_created_utc": 1474208277, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_11ht2f", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1487049452, "domain": "self.neurofibromatosis", "edited": 1487129237, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/5tyav1/tattoos_and_nf21/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5tyav1", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 18, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/5tyav1/tattoos_and_nf21/", "retrieved_on": 1489542706, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So im a 21 year old male who suffers from nf2 so this is directed more towards people that suffer with this condition.

We took him to the hospital for an unrelated matter (that turned out to be nothing) but while there, the ER paediatrician noticed he has 8 CALS.  We knew this but didn't realize it meant anything.  The genetic testing comes back in February but we've been monitoring since and it looks like his spots have grown, so we are pretty certain he has it.  Neither mom or dad have ever shown symptoms so at the moment we are assuming it's a spontaneous mutation.\n\nMedical articles are a tough place to find answers, especially since modern medicine is continually improving. I have a number of questions I wouldn't trying to find answers for, if anyone here has the time, experience and current knowledge.  I understand the disease is totally unpredictable and some of my questions will be un-answerable but I thought I'd ask anyway.  We are of course going to consult with our paeditrician but we don't have any appts soon (in the process of getting one as a result of the diagnosis).\n\n1.  The biggest question is that of plexiform neurofibromas.  It looks like if he doesn't have any structural issues by school-age (will be getting an x-ray to check for tibial/orbital dysplasia) the biggest potential problem are PNs.  It is difficult to find stats on PNs - what %age of patients get them, where do they usually appear, do they always grow to a disfiguring size.  If we catch them early can any preventative procedure take place? The biggest question in regards to PNs is how treatable are they?  I've found sources that state we can use chemotherapy and radiation to treat them and others that state PNs are totally untreatable.  Looking for any answers in regards to PNs here.  Have there been any recent advancements in PN treatment (&lt;5yrs)?  [This](http://wjso.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477-7819-3-6) German study seems to imply if caught early enough, PNs can be completely removed without further complication.\n\n2. What is the difference between a plexiform neurofibroma and a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour?\n\n3. Is having 8 CALS at such an age a bad sign?  We see numerous stories of people that weren't diagnosed until they are 5-6 because it took so long for their CALS to appear.  Does having CALS so young indicate a severe case?\n\n4. Can you predict severity or types of symptoms based on which mutation he has?\n\n5. Many sites say that the severity of symptoms \"can\" differ from parent to child (assuming it's inherited), but they don't say which is more likely - similar or different expression?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My six month old was just diagnosed with NF1.

With most people having only a few of the possible complications. However, sometimes NF isn't mild. My mother is one such case. \n\nShe was diagnosed at 3 years old in 1970's due to severe complications with her growth. She has had over 100 surgeries since then, and has lived over half her life in the hospital. Her NF caused severe scoliosis, severe pain, chiari malformation, emotional issues, facial deformities, hearing loss, stunted growth, migranes, hypotentsion, and congenital bone defects.  \nShe is missing bones, organs, parts of organs, and more because of NF. Recently they have had to remove a huge section of her intestine and one of her adrenal glands. She is barely 4'9\" tall, weighs maybe 90 lbs, and spends her days in constant pain. She has always been on a cocktail of medications, and even though she is in her 40's she has the health of someone in their 70's. She is absolutely covered in tumors and they are very visible on every inch of her body. She is disabled and has never really been able to work, and was unable to finish high school in the traditional way. \n\nThere are other severe cases. Young children get brain tumors and die, I met a young man who had lost all of his vision due to it, NF can causes seizures, and in some cases mental retardation. [Source](http://www.ctf.org/Learn-About-NF/Diagnosis-of-NF1.html)\n\nNF isn't always mild it can be very devastating, and it affects each person differently (even in families). I myself do not have it, although I had to undergo a lot of testing to make sure that I didn't, and she constantly blamed herself the whole time. I think that most people aren't aware of the severe cases, and I think the community focuses on the mild-moderate cases even though those people aren't the ones who would benefit the most from the research. I didn't make this to scare anyone, but just for you to remember that NF can change entire families, and that there is always someone out there who has it worse, and research has come a long way.

I'm blessed to have a pretty mild form of NF, however, It was really hard for me to deal with as a young kid. I definitely have learning disabilities as a result of the condition and when I was younger I felt devastated over how hard it was for me to learn compared to my peers. Some of my worst memories involve math classes thought elementary and middle school. My learning difficulties were also compounded by the fact that I was not in a school that was able to accommodate my needs well at all. To be honest, I'm still terrible at math but have managed to avoid it since high school. Honestly, I still am immensely insecure over my learning capabilities but have come a long way with my mindset and try to remember that I am indeed intelligent in a lot of ways. Another thing that I hated growing up were the cafe au lait spots. I genuinely thought that nobody would ever find me attractive because of them. Luckily, I realized how silly that was. I've even been complimented on them before by a partner! But I digress :) \n\nAnyway, I noticed I've been harboring some anxiety recently over not knowing if my condition is going to worsen as I get older. I'm really scared I am going to develop tumors, cancer or other issues as a result of NF. I think I'm just looking for some reassurance or personal experiences with mild cases of NF either getting worse, or remaining pretty docile into late adulthood.

I'm a 29 year old male (almost 30). I recently had a biopsy of a small lump on my back, which confirmed NF2. I currently have no hearing loss or other symptoms (that I'm aware of). \n\nMy mother is 56 (almost 57) and also has NF2. I've always known my mother had a simple \"skin condition\" causing some bumps, but I had no idea that implications of this disease until I was diagnosed with it. My mother has no symptoms other than a some bumps on her arms and chest. No hearing loss or other problems. My mother's always had a optimistic, unconcerned outlook on her NF2. She last had an MRI in roughly 2002, so I don't know if she has additional tumors. \n\nWhen I told my doctor my mom has NF2, my doctor became very concerned, which lead me to finally look into the disease. Prior to this, I just thought NF2 was aesthetic. I now realize I'm wrong. \n\nEverything I'm reading is terrifying, and not consistent with what I see in my mother. Does my mother's relatively healthy life have any implications for my future with NF2? How about the fact that I'm 29 (almost 30) and still have excellent hearing and no other obvious issues? \n\nBecause I inherited this from my mother, am I guaranteed to have the same type of NF2 mutation as her? I read [this article] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3naG-zVXta5T2FwS05PZXNJeUU/view), which suggests there's  major mortality differences depending on the type of mutation (truncating, splice-site, missense, mosiac?). Can I assume since she's getting older and still doing just fine that I'll have a similar experience/life-span?\n\nMy doctor wants me to see a neurologist and to get an MRI. I'm now having to trudge through the referral and insurance processes before I can see a specialist. I figure it'll be a few weeks before I can talk to anyone. \n\nAny help here would be sincerely appreciated.

He went back to the doctor today and is currently at the ER getting a CT scan as he has not had one since he was in high school.  He is 26 now.  I know that after puberty things with NF1 tend to die down a bit, but he has a lot of trouble with his eyesight, to the point to where he will likely need surgery soon and maybe glasses on top of that.

It hasn't been a huge bother in my life but I have had a lot of fibroma growth on my body. Mostly on my back and chest which makes me feel really insecure.\n\nI have a fairly barge bump on my arm which I'm actually getting removed this year. It'll be the first surgery I have to remove one. I am pretty excited because I always wear long sleeves to hide it. People always ask what it is and Idk what to say. I also have one on my forehead which doesn't bother me I've learned to love with but hate when people ask about it (I say it's a scar) and they say well I should get it removed in a rude attitude like it's ugly and would look better without.\nWhat can I expect with surgery? Is there any pain after its gone and have you guys experienced it coming back?\nI haven't had an MRI in a really long time since I went through puberty. I'm 25 now.\n\nI read here a lot that you guys experience all kinds of other body pain, stiffness, joint pain, high blood pressure. Doctors have never told me about such things. And I never knew that those kinds of symptoms can be related. Can anyone explain all this to me a little? \n\nI do have a fibroma behind my optic nerve which hasn't given me trouble. And I have slight scoliosis which also hasn't given me trouble but again these are things I haven't checked up on in years.\n\nI hear that this consition can also cause clumsyness? Is this true? Everyone tells me I am super clumsy. I drop a lot of things but I always thought this was because I move fast, I'm a pretty speedy person.\n\nLately I've been having problems with my left ear tho idk if this is related to NF. Doctors are not helpful, they see me for literally 3m dismiss me and I leave. My ear is in pain and it feels like it leaks water, it also seems swollen in the center or like there's a bump beneath it. Doctors keep telling me it's allergies but that makes no sense that that is the one and only symptom in my left ear only. All my allergy test came back negative too. I am struggling to find good help. I had problems with my eyes esrlier this year too which was dismissed as allergies by several doctors who just looked at old diagnosis and said the same thing. Eventually it went away on its own but it depressed me to feel so helpless where no doctor could aid. I went to 6 different clinics.\n\nAny of you planning on having kids or have had kids? I don't wanna have children because I don't want my consition to get worst I also would not wanna pass it down. Idk if that's selfish of me.\n\nSorry to rant, I don't have anyone to talk to about this and never really opened up to friends about it. I opened up to one friend once and she told me I was a liar and didn't believe me (shitty friend). My boyfriend knows and doesn't care about it, it doesn't bother him and he tells me I'm beautiful every day! I love having him by my side.\n\nI guess I'm here because I'm scared of what's to come in the future of my life. And also to get out insecurities on those days that I feel down.

After I graduated high school I went to my doctor to get checked out, and the doctor brushed it off and didn't know what it was. They ran blood tests and found nothing and basically told me I was fine. I went back to the same doctor office for an unrelated issue and a different doctor there saw a large protruding lump on abdomen that I have had for a very long time. She was unsure what it was and told me to see a dermatologist. I went to the dermatologist in February and the doctor recognized it was NF immediately. He removed the lump from my stomach and it came back as NF-1 plexiform. Since then I have been having multiple doctor visits all year including my first brain MRI and more scans to come. The whole thing has been very overwhelming... I am lucky in the sense that it is not very noticeable on me (for now anyways) as I have very few visible lumps... but the whole thing has made me feel very bleak.

Also has been experiencing confusion and slurred  speech. Additionally has localized pain in the back of the head. We saw the referred Neurologist on Friday. The doctor did a brief exam and diagnosed him with anxiety, said the symptoms were psychosomatic and  he needed CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy). No MRI, no CT, no EEG.

Just found this sub! And so glad I did. I never met or talked to anyone who has NF. But I\u2019ve(26F) been having NF1 all my life. Sorry if this is a bit long, but like I said, I never talked to anyone who has NF and would like your insights ;___;\n\nAll the doctors I\u2019ve met with couldn\u2019t give me a straight answer on NF or didn\u2019t know about it. But I went to a genetics doctors yesterday. It\u2019s the first time I met with a doctor who specializes in NF. As they doing examinations on my body. They  want to do an MRI on my Spine. They told me I have some tumors and they want to look at. Which wasn\u2019t a shock to me because I already knew I did. But hearing it from a professional doctor made me want to cry. He also mentioned woman with NF has a higher risk of breast Cancer. I already worry about my health a lot and that made it worse. \n\nI know that NF is different for each person. But how do you deal with being confident and not worry about the future of getting worse. I\u2019m insecure to wear a swim suit or sometimes even a crop top due to my spots. I have it all over my body but most of my spots are on my back and on my tummy and they\u2019re more visible there than on my leg and arms. So it\u2019s been hard throughout my life.\n\nAs for the bumps. I\u2019m lucky enough not to have any visible bumps outside. But I know I have some tumors inside of that makes sense. \n\nI know I\u2019m all over the place I apologize! It\u2019s just finding this sub is kinda overwhelming since I never met, talked or knew there was a sub for this. \n\nSo For those who has NF how do you cope with it? And how do you stay confident? And do you get headaches a lot? I often get many headaches but I did an MRI scan on my head in 2007 for headaches and they didn\u2019t see anything there. \n\nAny help will be appreciated!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "subreddit_subscribers": 802, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hello!

When I was a teenager I remember like writing the word sad on paper of how I felt every day for a few months. So I would write the feeling every day on this paper. I stopped and I am not sure why I started in the first place. Every day was the feeling of being sad. Pathetic? I am more sad these days.\n\nHigh school was horrible. I felt like a freak. Changing in the bathroom in the locker room for gym or if the bathroom was utilized I had a technique I did which the girls would not see my birthmarks from the nf and bumps.

Now the whole process starts over again. My older siblings have children and never had to worry about a single thing. I think it is okay for me to wish this upon someone else. I do not see anything wrong with it. I believe everyone should have the same odds. I have 50/50.. so everyone else should have it as well.

My mother was a split gene mutation and also has NF 1, she isn\u2019t physically affected but does have learning disabilities. My grandfather served in the Vietnam War and was heavily exposed to Agent Orange, he was healthy as an ox but later in life developed diabetes, several heart problems/diseases and eventually cancer, my mother was born after his exposure by the way. I believe with every fiber in my body that my mothers and my neurofibromatosis was caused by my grandfathers exposure to agent orange, and it\u2019s blatantly obvious. I am unsure if the studies are still going on, but I do know that at one point John Hopkins in Maryland was doing a study on neurofibromatosis, which was being fully funded by the United States Army, and across the way at Walter Reed, which mind you, is for the most part exclusively a military personnel hospital, they had one whole floor of kids with NF. at the time that they were going on my mother had called and asked just some information about the studies. But when she had asked about if I had anything to do with agent orange, they stonewalled her, immediately it was, they had to go, they couldn\u2019t talk anymore and they hung up.

I am a first time mom with extreme health anxiety that I actually take medication for and see a therapist bit weekly about, so any input is helpful for my worrying mind.\n\nMy son has had birthmarks since birth. Including a \u201cmagnolian\u201d spot on his butt. I never thought anything of his birth marks as I have some and so does his dad. He even has one on the same spot that I have my large one on my lower back. \n\nWell fast forward to 2 days ago when I noticed a new birthmark on his shoulder. I decided to google what kind these are and I came up to CALS spots which inevitably led me to NF1. Needless to say, I\u2019ve friend and vomited from anxiety multiple times since. (This is what happens during my episodes) and I\u2019ve taken him in to his doctor. The doctor didn\u2019t seem too considered but took a look and he has about 9. Ranging from dot like ones to his biggest 3 being on his chest /side / back. She said we will just watch them and take note of any new ones.\n\nBut I cannot simple just do that. Needless to say I am so scared. I keep googling if this many CALS spots could be normal without any underlying issue and of course google says no. I\u2019ve already made a dermatologist appointment but that\u2019s for a month  away because no sooner availability. \n\nMy son is on track developmentally. He\u2019s actually very tall for his age (99th percentile) and average for weight and head (56th-60th) and is standing and cruising on his own. And no other notable issues.\n\nSo here I am, making this post, to try to get some sort of idea of what\u2019s going on. I haven\u2019t been able to eat or stop thinking about it all day (anxiety sucks) and I feel awful thinking my baby having birthmarks could mean something more serious. \n\nDo these spots always mean NH1? Does the appearance of them really matter? His are very light (we are a light tan complexion as we are Mexican) and some you have to really look for. Most of them except the two on his side and back aren\u2019t ovals rather random shapes with jagged/squiggly edges. \n\nHow do I stop losing my mind and feeling guilty like I possibly passed this down to him? \n\nI know my reaction is an overactive one due to my mental health. So thank you for reading this! \n\nAlso, to my knowledge, no one in my family has been diagnosed with NH and we all have some form of birth mark.

out. turns out i have serval tumors around C1-2, C2-3, C3-4 with alot of cord compression.  the doctors in my area(NY) were ready to operate to removed, almost went though with it, went for a seconded opion at Johns Hopkins. were they found although my scans look horrible my exams are good, so they did not want to operate, just monitor with MRIs every 3 months, that countied for a year or so, then went to once every 6 months, then once a year,  then in 2019 some of the grew, witch ment surgery was back on the table, or atlest i had to think about it.  and monitore my body more closely. im back to MRIs every 3 months, and need to montire things like unration frequencyand BMs balance among others, i just some times find it hard to tell if im having a change that was eather very slow over time

First of all, I am inspired by the resilience of this community. I came here to selfishly ask a question and I spent almost an hour reading all of your amazing stories. Nonetheless, I still figured the best place to come for answers are from the experts, the people who actually have this condition. My story is a convoluted one. About 2 and a half months ago I had some lymph nodes flare up for no reason. This obviously caused me anxiety and I had them checked out at my doctors who said they were nothing. However, I also felt great fatigue, malaise, and overall sickness for about 2 weeks after noticing that. I had neurological symptoms such as twitching and tremors which have persisted today and have had an EMG and NCS done to rule out diagnoses. The last couple of days I\u2019ve been on edge feeling my body and I have noticed that when I pinch skin together I can DEFINITELY feel fixed nodules almost. They ache when I squeeze them. These are all over my body including inner arms near biceps, under chin, and on lower jaw, and on inner thighs. Of course I looked this up and I was directed to a diagnosis of NF. However, I don\u2019t know anybody in my family who has it. I am 18 years old just FYI. I\u2019m not sure if this is even worth asking but I\u2019d figure I come here first before doing any sort of genetic testing in case anybody here had a similar experience.

Today at an appointment with a brain and spine specialist the doctor handed me a printout on NF1 and said he thinks I have it and to think about if my symptoms match the description. After I got home and had a chance to do more reading and research, it started to seem like maybe it doesn't line up?\n\nOne website said 95% of the time it's diagnosed before age 10. I'm nearly 30 and haven't had any symptoms until about two years ago.\n\nI noticed a small lump at the base of my spine about two years ago. MRIs showed three small lesions. I've had ringing in my ears for a month now, but I assumed it was from my teething baby loudly voicing his displeasure in my ears daily. I do have some scoliosis that's been around for years and is minor. The doctor I saw today also thinks a lump in my thigh (noticed ~3 years ago and was told it's a lipoma) is also a likely neuroma.\n\nNow I feel like I'm lost because I don't know how much the doctor I'm seeing knows about neurofibromatosis. When I read about it, I feel like schwannomatosis sounds more like what I'm experiencing, but I know that's way more uncommon. I have freckles and one small birthmark but not what I'd call cafe au lait spots - I don't think any of them are more than 1.5cm. No learning disabilities, no optic gliomas, or anything else that I know of. I am pretty short (5'1), but so is everyone in my immediate family.\n\nI have surgery in December to remove the mass in my psoas muscle and I should get confirmation of what exactly it is then. I know I'm lucky because I've had only mild pain. But I just had my first baby. I'm sick with worry about what might happen with my ten month old if I've passed on something to him. I know it manifests differently in everybody and I'm terrified for him.\n\nIf anyone has any insight I would appreciate it so deeply. I feel like I'm googling myself into a really scary place. Was anyone else here diagnosed this late in life? Anyone with schwannomatosis here?\n\nThanks in advance. You guys have an awesome community here.

The interesting part is the clinical presentation. At first they thought it was NF2 or schwannomatosis because there were multiple presumed schwannomas in just one leg. Brain and spine MRI came up clean. Now, after surgery to remove a few of these masses, the pathologists confirmed there were 2 neurofibromas and 1 plexiform neurofibroma along the nerves in one calf. Now they are thinking it is a mosaic/segmental version of NF1 because there is also one CAL on the foot on the same side.

From navel to breast bone. There's probably hundreds.  I'm just terrified of the future of having a breastplates made of those little fleshy nodules and feeling them rub on my shirt and knowing that if I were to go out in public people would find me disgusting. \n I already have to be very careful about clothing I wear rubbing against those and causing pain from both friction or nerve irritation.  I definitely can't wear some of the things I wore a few years ago not just due to being an older person but because the plexiforms don't allow me to without great pain.\n\n\nI don't think we're disgusting but I know it's what people think when I'm not able to hide the plexiforms I do have. We've probably all seen peoples comments online about how we look an articles and whatnot about NF.\n\n\nIt's just so frustrating the limits there are towards removal and Medical treatments in general. Like someone could go and remove these hundreds of little things but clearly something's happening in my body where the roots are just spreading. Everything is so poorly understood that I worry about finding even a surgeon to handle it if I did go that route and there's a point where the scarring would be just as bad and  be just as uncomfortable. I'm angry and sad and I want a better life than this.\n\nI know I am smart and creative, but NF takes my energy, really does cause me to lose a lot of my overall capability to be strong and useful.  I'm sometimes too tired to feel passionate about things I care for just because of my aches and pains and that's frustrating as hell.\n\nAnd especially here in the United States I feel so limited to my options for my future be  Disability or ????.\n\nI just want to go outside and look like everyone else and where whatever I want with comfort. \n\nThis is not how I wanted to leave my twenties behind.

Its been slowly been getting worse, day by day. Now it\u2019s at the point where it\u2019s starting to get unbearable. I've 3 intense lower back spinal surgeries performed throughout my life to remove tumors logged around the nervous system/spinal cord, according to my doctors my spine is now starting to degenerate. I\u2019m losing feeling in my legs, my arms, my hands, my feet. I have muscle spasms far too often and my legs kick at random times. The worse part is the pain and random burning sensations that occur throughout my body every single day. It\u2019s not the type of pain that is always extremely excruciating, but the type that is achy yet persistent. It even hurts to sleep unless I'm in the perfect awkwardly held position. \n\nSomedays it gets the better of me. Imagine arthritis throughout all of your spines. But also imagine a mild burning in your legs and arms. Yup, that\u2019s how I feel pretty much all the time. I\u2019ve taken hundreds of pills over the last couple of years; ibuprofen, Advil, Prescribed steroids, muscle relaxants ect. (I refuse to be on opioids because I don't want an early grave). I\u2019ve been to the doctors' office too many times and I\u2019ve had way too many MRIs. When I\u2019m in front of other people I try to act like nothing is wrong because I don\u2019t want to make things awkward, but occasionally I\u2019m not able to hide it and awkwardness ensues (lol I guess I\u2019m starting to get used to it).\n\n I have neurofibromatosis type 2. There is no cure, only mitigation of pain. Many of my hopes and dreams have had to change lately and oh what I would do to feel normal and healthy again. I guess it could be worse, I'm grateful for my friends and my family for being around. I don't have cancer. But to be honest it just sucks. I feel like no one around me in person understands, but occasionally, when I see posts on this subreddit, I feel a sense of belonging.

Well recently I started to get weird symptoms - a bad limp and weirdness in my right arm/hand. So I call my primary care doctor who immediately sees me and gets me an MRI of the spine at my local hospital - on the condition that I get in contact with the NF clinic in Boston. I get the MRI done and call the NF clinic who tell me that the first appointment is a virtual one in September, but they want me to immediately send the MRI + radiology report to them. Upon reading the radiology report I come across a term I don't understand and google it (advice #2 don't do that). Of course, the top results that come up are cancer related terminology. Now I'm starting to now freak the hell out, but no worries can't be that bad my appointment is in September. Then 2 days later  I get a call from Boston telling me they want to see me the following week in-person (I know they now have the MRI + the radiology report). At this point my stress levels are through the roof, I'm thinking this is really bad and my spinal neurofibromas are glowing like Christmas trees with cancer. \n\nSo begins one of the worse weeks of my life, I'm seriously thinking I've got a few months to live. Eventually I get to the clinic, my blood-pressure is higher than it's ever been and the doctor walks in. I eventually ask her how bad is it, what does this all mean? She just sits there dumb-founded and tells me that the tumors have grown slightly and I will need surgery at some point in the near future. No cancer, no worries.

I have had many problems because of it but l am asking for your help to stop the abuse of someone that was believed to haveNF1 but is more likely to have had Proteus Syndrome he died many years ago. Joseph Merrick was a British man born around 1862. He had was believed to have NF1 at first but it is believed he had Proteus Syndrome and was outcast by his Father and Stepmother, after an intolerable life in the workhouse he was used in Victorian Freak shows and abused by the public and his managers. Luckily he was looked after eventually by a doctor that took care of him.    \n\n\nUnfortunately his abuse is planning to be resurrected by ITAE productions in the UK tour they are planning called \u2018Dinner and dissection\u2019 where they plan to dissect a replica body of Joseph Merrick in front of a paying audience while they dine in a Victorian tent. Yes, you are reading this right. It truly breaks my heart that others ,as well as me, have to tolerate this depiction of people who are disabled or who look different as things to be cut up, taken apart and gawped at for the entertainment of those who aren\u2019t. I am a strong person but was rocked by this when l read it. My daughter has inherited NF1 and l am keeping this from her as l do not want her to think of herself as different or a specimen. Please help me by signing a petition at Change.org , if you type in Dinner and Dissection it will appear. If any of you out there can think of any other way to help prevent this happening please send me your ideas. The tour is planned 7th Jan 2022-25th March 2022 across the UK.

He seemed to think it wouldn't scare that well.\n\nObviously, I am getting different advice but I just want something that has minimal risk of scarring. Honestly, I don't care if i have to pay every 5 years or so if it grows back while i am young.\n\nI think i may be predisposed to keloid scarring but I'm not sure.\n\nIt's really frustrating because I am so self-conscious and because I live in a city where no one really knows about the condition so no one cares or can relate to it. I also feel like most male doctors I've seen dont really 'get' how important minimal scarring is to me, they just seem to think I want them removed and that's it- I guess DRs don't really understand how self-conscious women can be about scarring even if we have this condition?

In almost every aspect, it aligns with my values and what I always imagined myself doing post-college. It\u2019s prestigious, challenging, and I have health insurance for the first time in my life. \n\nBut\u2026 \n\nmy NF1 has been getting in the way of things. I\u2019m in excruciating pain daily, and I find myself struggling to keep up. I\u2019m finding it more and more difficult to be present, to get things done, to feel like what I\u2019m doing is still worthwhile. Getting out of bed is so exhausting that most mornings I worry about being able to safely drive my commute. I have to fight the urge to call in sick.\n\nNo matter how much I exercise, eat right, meditate, sleep, or ask for accommodations in the workplace, I feel like things keep piling on. The pain is still there; nagging me, taunting me, and interrupting basic tasks.  It\u2019s there when I\u2019m trying to enjoy a night out with my partner, it\u2019s there even after I\u2019ve soaked in a hot bath and laid down for bed. It\u2019s just always there, and I can\u2019t seem to work through it. I\u2019ve tried talking to others about it, but no matter how I word or phrase things, it\u2019s invisible to them. My words are lost in translation. I feel like a burden. \n\nI only recently got into healthcare as an adult and I\u2019m working on addressing all the things that my parents neglected. I\u2019ve had MRI\u2019s of my back and my hand\u2014per my medical summary, I have \u2018innumerable skin lesions\u2019 in my back, one larger plexiform neurofibroma, and dural ecstasia of my sacrum. The enlarged tumor in my palm is inoperable\u2014removing it would render my hand neurologically useless because of how it wraps around my nerves. The plexiform neurofibroma in my back would require a large incision, possible skin grafts, and weeks of recovery. \n\nI didn\u2019t even know that I had been living with tumors in my back until a few weeks ago. The pain had always been this ambiguous thing that followed me around. I attributed it to scoliosis, doctors would say I lacked iron. My mother told me recently that she didn\u2019t want me to get too involved in treatment for my NF as a child because we couldn\u2019t afford it, and she didn\u2019t want me to seek pity or use my condition as a crutch throughout life. I can\u2019t help but resent her for that. I guess it\u2019s her way of trying to save face for the neglect. I\u2019ve been noticing more and more caf\u00e9 au lait spots in the mirror lately- more fibromas showing up on my neck, my arms. I blink and there\u2019s always more appearing.\n\nI\u2019m on the fence about going through with the surgery on my back\u2014on one hand, it could potentially ease up some of the pain I\u2019m in. On the other hand, it could potentially *not* ease the pain and I\u2019d have to live with the scarring, the weeks of recovery, the opiates that make me purge and burn my chest. Even though I\u2019ve been living independent of my parents for years, I still hear my mom tell me we can\u2019t afford it.\n\nI have a job interview lined up in a few weeks. I talked with my partner about it, who said I should at least entertain the idea. It\u2019s only part time, no benefits. Six-hour variable shifts, doing what I do now but in a different setting. I\u2019d make less. It\u2019s closer to home. I don\u2019t know if my new set of bosses will be keen to accommodate me. It\u2019d probably give me the time and space to go back to school and work on my Master\u2019s like I\u2019ve always wanted. Things seemed to fall in place when I was in school-- I was more diligent, organized. I didn\u2019t have writer\u2019s block like I do now. I don\u2019t really know where I\u2019d begin to pick up the pieces if I left my current job. I'm tired of organizing every waking moment around NF, consciously and unconsciously.

need a break, I need this treatment to work). Last year the tumors that have been encasing my spine spread to my eyes. The spine tumors have been growing, and spreading since 2017 you know that pain that you feel only when these tumors are growing? it\u2019s very distinct I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m really worried about these ocular tumors.  The doctors are telling me conflicting things meanwhile my health continues to seemingly spiral.  \n\n\nI finally found a doctor who\u2019s willing and giving me honest information about the tumors in my eyes. He doesn\u2019t think they are neurofibroma but isn\u2019t completely sure what they are. [ocular tumors](https://imgur.com/gallery/NajTWRR). I\u2019m supposed to go to Arizona, or Canada here soon to try and treat these tumors in my eyes. I\u2019m gutted about the potential of loosing my vision. It\u2019s bad enough that the fucking disease took my young adult hood.  I graduated in 2008, that summer is when I had to have emergency surgery to remove my lower digestive tract.  I have 6-8 inches of small intestine left they took the rest of it. I literally spent my 20s in the hospital every 2-3 months from 20-28 with infections stemming from the removal of my digestive tract.  The doctor fucked up the surgery and didn\u2019t clean all of the stool from the wound.  As you all should know shit and open wounds don\u2019t mix.  It\u2019s like throwing gas on a fire.  I nearly died from sepsis when I contracted MRSA in the blood stream along with MRSA. After that I lost my spleen, and pancreas, then my gallbladder last year.  My liver has permanent damage from 7 years of TPN. My Esophagus is dangerously thin. I often wonder that the reason is I survived all of this. Again I need to vent a little in a place where people get what is going on, and hopefully be able to talk to someone who\u2019s maybe going through some of the same things. Getting back to the tumors in my eyes I\u2019m petrified because right around the time I found out about the tumors in my eyes I crashed a motorcycle, as they were doing scans to make sure I didn\u2019t break any bones.  They found a number of growths on my lungs. The doctor said they were nothing to worry about unless I\u2019m at high risk for lung cancer. From what I have read tumors of the eye spread to the lungs and liver next. If that happens then I\u2019m a goner. I\u2019m okay with that I really am.  I keep having worrying symptoms I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m going to wake up one morning and be blind or I\u2019ll go blind while driving down the road.

The ER doctor somehow got a hold of my neurologist and he ordered a outpatient MRI which I was able to do right away and also got schedule to see my neurologist next Monday. Now I got to wait 2-3 days for the MRI results. \n\nSo has anyone that has NF ever had these problems or anything?

I stare daggers back at adults who make faces, I've snapped at adults who make degrading comments, but mostly I try to utilize education. Especially when it comes to children. \n\nThe other day a pre-teen made a rude comment to him while we were at the store the other day about him needing to be on an episode of Dr Pimple Popper.\n\nI did not hear it, but I could see on his face that something happened. I asked who, he willingly pointed him out, and instead of confronting the kid himself, I addressed his mother. The kid went white as a sheet when he was essentially told on.\nThe mother came to our defense and we again we were able to utilize it as a teaching moment as well as the kid realizing neither his mother nor Strangers will put up with bullying comments. I can only hope it sticks with some of the people, often asking them if they'd like it if someone stared and made mean comments about something THEY have no control over.\n\nBut this particular comment has really struck a chord with him and he's been really depressed and in a funk since. \nI remind him daily that he's loved, that I think he's a wonderful, handsome man, and that \"those who matter don't mind, and those who minds don't matter\". Just as daily reassurances to help build the confidence that years have spent beating out of him. \n\nI'm just not sure what else I may be able to do to help him out of this funk and I just don't know what to do. \nI can't claim to know what he deals with daily, I just hate seeing him so upset without knowing what I can do to help. \n\nAny advice is welcome.

I posted a while ago about my concerns of my vision loss and how I thought it could be to do with nf. Well since then I have FINALLY seen a neurologist who specialises in NF. He didn't believe the vision loss was caused by an optical glioma as I have had previous tests done on my eyes which showed nothing and that I didn't present the symptoms associated with them. He said he didn't think I needed an MRI but referred me to have one anyway to put my mind at ease. \n\nSo anyway this morning I had my mri (with contrast) and it was not as bad as expected and was over within an hour.

It  took them hours to figure out what was wrong. Eventually they found out it was my appendix and when I went into surgery they got an answer to why my appendix was hard to find l. The surgery took longer than it was supposed to because they found a softball sized benign tumors attached to the muscle wall which was pushing my appendix out of the way. After that surgery it got the ball rolling and several tests later I was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis 1. In my case It was a genetic mutation that happened at conception. They found hundreds of benign tumors all throughout my body. I don\u2019t know the official count because they stopped counting at 500. I have two brain tumors in my thalamus, a cluster of tumors wrapped around my lower spine and the rest are every where else. Because of the tumors putting pressure on my nerves I am in pain 24/7. On a good day I am a 6. What truly help keep me distracted from the pain is art and music. Last year after several ocular migraines I grew a black spot on my right eye that\u2019s most likely permanent. I have a surgery coming up on February 14th.

I wasn\u2019t diagnosed with NF1 until my late 30s when I was in the midst of a year long running streak. I\u2019d noticed some bumps on my upper torso and arms when I\u2019d get really hot or in the right light and thought maybe those were just fat. I\u2019d always been pretty active and ran a lot but this particular summer I\u2019d lost a lot of weight. I was stressing some but running non stop. I couldn\u2019t always get my mind right. Foggy or clouded thoughts. Short term memory issues. Just strange. Concerned I finally went to a doctor about a large cyst I\u2019d developed on my face. The doctor referred me to a dermatologist who was very concerned about a couple of the bumps. The largest one which had between my lip and chin had been somewhat concealed by my beard even though it was short at the time. I attributed it to an ingrown hair that wouldn\u2019t go away. Anyway. He decided to remove it and biopsy it.  Oh my God the terror of waiting on the results. The longest 3 day weekend of my life. Having Shown no other signs of NF the first thought was of course cancer, some sort of leukemia or skin cancer considering i was always out in the sun.  He checked me and found some cafe au laits on the lower portion of my back and legs. It was odd because at nearly 40 I\u2019d be a strange case for late diagnosis. Anyways. It was good news to get the NF1 diagnosis especially considering my age and the other possibilities. But then the fear of did I pass the gene on. After multiple trips to a geneticist and neurologist it doesn\u2019t appear any of my children inherited and apparently none of my older family members have signs of it. So strange. Other than about two years ago my teenage daughter started having seizures which ended up being attributed to epilepsy. Multiple MRIs and Cat scans later it appears she doesn\u2019t have any tumors causing them. So another complex late onset health issue. Further complicating my issues. No clue what kicked started it other than a few trips to a testosterone therapy clinic by the gym. Excess hormones or something? Who knows.  Anyhow. Back to the point. I\u2019m sorry. I used to be a great writer I have like a super processor miss firing and I can\u2019t construct this properly.  \nWhen I was very active for the first two years it seemed my spots were very noticeable. Especially when I got hot and sweaty. The more weight I lost the more bumps I had. Just all over my upper torso and arms. None below the waist at all though which baffled the dermatologist and the geneticist. Over the last year work and kids busy activities have prevented me from being as active as I\u2019d like. I put on probably 30 pounds. I\u2019m now at 240. The heaviest I\u2019ve ever been but my neurofibromas don\u2019t show up much at all. A few on my arms in the right light if I\u2019m hot and some on my neck. I\u2019m concerned though with my health. My BP and Heart Rate have both been the highest they\u2019ve ever been the last two doctor visits.  Granted BP was just 142/81 and HR was 88 but that\u2019s much higher than I\u2019ve typically had. Also being lest active my cognitive abilities are wrecked. I can forget something when I walk into the next room. Recalling certain information can be painstaking. Normal functions and such seem to be fine but it\u2019s just harder to concentrate I suppose. When I was at a healthier weight and active these issues weren\u2019t as severe. So long jumbled story short. God I hope if you suffer mentally as I do from this you were able to follow.    Anyway I\u2019m starting my run streak back and plan on running everyday for the next 425 days or so to break my last streak. I want to lose 30-40 pounds by summer. I\u2019m hoping my BP and HR return to normal. And my cognitive abilities improve. But I know with weight loss my \u201cspots\u201d are going to really show. It\u2019s just miserable. \n\nSide note. Do any of you relate excess stress to the NF1.  Not related to stress about the NF1 and it\u2019s side effects but just stupid stuff and strange stress over little things. Pettiness I suppose. And impatience. I\u2019m reaching now. Sorry. Thanks for you time.  I think the Etch A Sketch Brain is the worst part of NF1.   I want to remember my wife. My children. Enjoy experiences with them. Recall things. Tell stories. I can\u2019t stop. Must post now.  Sorry again folks.

It will be a laminectomy of L1-2 and a resection of the larger of the tumors.  My neurosurgeon says that it's very likely that he won't even be able to see the others.\n\nI have a lot of confidence in my neurosurgeon's skills and I know that there are risks, but am cautiously optimistic.  However, I've never had this type of surgery before, and would love to hear about some personal experiences.  What are some things to know about recovery that I might not have thought of?

At that point I had suspicions about it, since I have many of the trademark symptoms - huge cafe au lait spots, short stature, scoliosis, about a dozen tiny neurofibromas (tumors, about the size of a pencil eraser that just look like little skin lumps) and one plexiform neurofibroma (big tumor) on my left side.\n\nI had heard about NF a few times online and brought it up with my mom a couple times when I was a teenager. SHe said I was tested as a kid, but the results were never \"conclusive\" and the fact that I had scoliosis and cafe-au-lait spots was nothing to worry about. \n\nMy dad told me the truth, about six month ago, that I had been diagnosed when I was 4 at Children's Hospital in DC. When I confronted my mom about this, she started screaming and hysterically crying, sobbing, shrieking, saying how she took me to \"all the best doctors\" and did \"everything she could\" and, according to her, all the doctors told her not to worry. She said she was going to bring it up when I was pregnant, when I'm at the highest risk in my life of developing tumors and when I pose a 50% risk of passing the disease onto my kids. She said there's no possible way I could have a genetic disorder, that there's absolutely nothing wrong with me  and I'm \"too smart\" to have a genetic disorder (wtf?) and doctors just like to put fears in people's heads... etc etc etc.\n\nI had an official diagnosis from a NF doctor about two weeks ago; luckily I have a local NF specialist clinic in Philadelphia. I have literally almost every single symptom of the disease, including a huge tumor on my left side that I'm trying to get removed. Mom insists that it's just 'fat', even though I've had it for my entire life and it does not look or feel like fat. The doctor took one look at it and immediately confirmed that it was a plexiform NF. I really should have had it removed years ago, but mom wouldn't acknowledge it as being anything abnormal. When I told her about the appointment and the official diagnosis, she flat-out denied it, still. She maintained that \"doctors will diagnose anyone who walks in the door with anything they feel like\". She kept saying that the lump I have on my side is just \"fat\" and \"you've NEVER had a neurofibroma in your LIFE!\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I told her I needed to get a tumor removed, she was like, \"What, that fat lump you have?\" FAT DOESN'T GROW IN HARD LUMPS, MOM!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny time it comes up, she just insists that I don't have the disease, that I don't have any tumors (I have over a dozen!!!). Her absolute denial of this is baffling to me.\n\nI also apparently had a brain MRI when I was 8 where they found that I had not a brain tumor, but an unusual thickening of the optic nerve in my brain. I need to get an up-to-date brain MRI and a full body MRI to check for internal tumors. This is a health issue I'm going to need to deal with for the rest of my life. I have a highly increased risk of multiple types of cancer, and I need to be watching for tumors and related health issues they can cause, and she can't even even acknowledge a diagnosis because... well, I have no idea why. Maybe she's too proud to admit that she has a daughter with absolutely no medical problems, I have no idea.

I had seen the report prior to our appointment with our NF specialist.    It indicated an astrocytoma in the midbrain.  The day before seeing the NF, we were with his Neuro Opthamologist; he had seen the scan and seemed very concerned.   \nSo, our NF specialist was pretty chill about it.  I love and trust her, but I\u2019m still not comfortable with her advice on this one.  She wants to wait and do another scan in 6 months.  I realize that these gliomas are typically slow growing with NF, and this appears to be focal rather than diffuse, at least for now.  Still, this is the \u201cworst case\u201d scenario I was given when he was first diagnosed.  It was not visible on his scan 14 months ago, so that makes me feel it\u2019s maybe not so slow, though of course it has to start showing up out of \u2018nowhere\u2019 at some point.  He is not showing symptoms of a midbrain tumor, but the vision symptoms would be masked since he is blind in one eye.  \nHis history includes diagnosis at 3.5 years old.  At that time he had bilateral optic gliomas.  With 12 months of chemo the smaller glioma was no longer visualized.  The larger one stopped growing, but left him blind in that eye.   He also has a large diffuse PNF all the way across his low back that doesn\u2019t involve his spine (been there his whole life).  \nHis full body scan this time around showed lots of new subcutaneous fibromas.  The largest is in his thigh, which I understand needs to be watched especially carefully as the thigh apparently is a frequent location of fibromas becoming metastatic.   \nOne of you replied to describe your experience of a midbrain tumor that was successfully treated.  Thank you!!! Your reply was very encouraging.  Though I know that radiation would be a last resort at his age (12) because it can retard brain development up until about 16 years old, it\u2019s great to know about such a wonderful success story.  \nI\u2019m typically quite upbeat and optimistic, but this is hitting me hard and I\u2019m trying to decide if I need to push back and get more action rather than wait 6 months.  \nSo glad all of you are here!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "subreddit_subscribers": 1397, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update midbrain tumor", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/k2u7os/update_midbrain_tumor/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "WardenHDresden", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_nh21q", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606494901, "domain": "self.neurofibromatosis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/k24f7w/infant_with_possible_nf1/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k24f7w", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/k24f7w/infant_with_possible_nf1/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1606494912, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have a 4 month old that is starting to show large light brown spots in random places across her body.

(Which I was born with, multiple caf\u00e9 au la spots and small NF lumps.) \n\nI am fortunate enough to have private health insurance, so I was booked in for a cystoscopy to remove the tumour and cauterise the area. \nI had to stay overnight after having this surgery done because I had a Catheter which over the course of a 15 hour period flushed out and drained my bladder with 24 litres of saline solution. \n\nI was discharged the following morning and it was extremely painful to urinate for 2 days as I was mostly urinating blood and passing large scabs. \n\nI saw my Urologist today and he had the lab results back, it was a benign plexiform neurofibroma which was attached and pressing against the bladder wall. \n\nHe gave me a referral to a neurologist so I can keep an eye on my NF and get regular brain and full body MRIs.  \n\nOn the 26th of this month (November) I am seeing my plastic surgeon who is an elite surgeon with many years experience in practicing and teaching surgery around the world. He has worked with quite a few NF patients over the years, which is also covered under my private health Insurance. \nAnd around my body I\u2019m different places under my skin, he is removing a total of 8 neurofibromas, and the best part is I can go home when I wake up from the general anaesthetic, it\u2019s only a day surgery. \n\nI am just wondering what is the % rate of Neurofibromas grow back after they\u2019re removed. \nI am well aware that sometimes they don\u2019t grow back, but sometimes they do. I have been trying to do some research and can\u2019t find a rough figure, does anyone know the % rate of regrowth after removal. \n\nAlso, now that I am going to be seeing a neurologist to get regular scans and check ups, probably once a year, \nWhat else do I need to be aware of? \n\nI am quite physically fit, I have very few symptoms that have not caused me any complications in my life (apart from the lump in my bladder which is extremely rare for them to grow there) \nMy two favourite things to do in life is to play music and travel to NZ to do quite advanced but amazing multi day hikes. \n\nMelbourne Australia is quite different to the states, Australia has a genetics clinic, but they don\u2019t have a specific clinic for NF, so they best I can do is see a neurologist.\n\nAny advise anyone can give me on how to look after myself and monitor my condition. \nI\u2019m not in a headspace where I am constantly worrying about it, if anything I\u2019ve become too complacent.

I\u2019m Britt. I was born with NF1 as I inherited it from my mother who also has the condition. I have a lot of tiny tumors scattered all over me along with some medium sized ones. The last few months I\u2019ve noticed more and more fibromas popping up and the ones I currently have are growing in size. It is really frightening me tbh but currently have no insurance and no job. I\u2019m working on both of those things but I have some personal issues getting in the way. \n \nI\u2019m on a medication for Crohn\u2019s disease called Entyvio. I\u2019m in a medical study for it so they supply the medication for no charge. I\u2019m worried it\u2019s making the condition worse or if it\u2019s not related to that. My concern is that if they\u2019re growing externally then they must be growing internally as well. An internal tumor was never found although the last MRI I had was in 2015 so that probably changed \n\nHas anyone else noticed their condition worsen in their mid 20\u2019s? Did it eventually slow down or even speed up? I\u2019m so dysphoric as it is and have agoraphobia from the NF. The fact it\u2019s getting worse is doing no good for my mental health.

dominantly in my right ear since I was a teenager. It became permanent around 19, but only in my right ear. I have fatigue, and growths all along my throat and spine. I haven\u2019t had a scan done on my brain or spine yet, but I\u2019m fairly certain I have NF2. \n\nI\u2019ve for as long as I can remember had issues with night vision, I basically can\u2019t assume spatial awareness and distance at night. My vision is bad but not horrible, mostly skewed by astigmatism. My spine is heavily curved in the upper part, and bent inwards heavily in the lower part.  I have issues with laying down flat as I\u2019m not actually flattened, and my right shoulder blade stabs into the muscle of my back so I experience nerve pain and at times tingling in my hands. \n\nMy brain feels the worst of the consequences of my possible NF2 condition. I have terrible memory, forgot attending my own mother/step father\u2019s wedding just 3 years ago, and I have noticeable issues with short term memory and empathy. I feel tired easily and sleep for either short periods, or extremely long periods, depending on my physical fatigue and likely hormonal imbalances. \n\nI feel manically depressed/elated and can\u2019t seem to find middle ground. Through much of my college life, I self medicated with marijuana and my symptoms, especially digestive, seemed under control. But now that I\u2019ve waned off marijuana, I am having no relief in memory or ambition and my digestion is unpredictable and can be very painful. \n\nThe scoliosis and tinnitus lead me to the NF2 self diagnosis, along with obvious growths both in the back/base of my head/behind my ears, and now it feels that I\u2019m developing these growths on my back and spine. \nThe sad truth of this disease is relieving to read about, surprisingly, because I originally discredited my life experiences as symptoms of laziness and \u201chaving it easy.\u201d I grew up privileged and although I was heavily emotionally abused by my alcoholic father, my mother has always looked out for me and tried her best to respect my feelings and intentions or lack thereof. They separated when I was in late middle school and divorced both legally and from each other\u2019s lives when I was in early high school. I now live with my stepdad, who appreciates and supports me (both mentally and with some expenses) and especially cares for my mother. \n\nThe unfortunate part of my life is that my mother can not accept that I probably have NF2. She now says I use this condition as an excuse/crutch to rationalize my lack of motivation at my job (I do daycare/boarding for dogs at a place called Bed and Biscuit) my job is largely physical and exhausting, even for people who don\u2019t have NF symptoms, so I am left burdened and frankly I feel alone. I also graduated college but with poor grades (not that surprising, I\u2019ve always been an on and off student) and haven\u2019t used my degree whatsoever. \n\nIt has been comforting to perceive a bigger picture for my physiology and I\u2019m really glad I do have proper logical truth for my condition. I have an appointment set up for a physical evaluation in January of 2020 and intend to explain thoroughly my condition as well as possible screening to determine the extent of my growths and other health concerns.\n\nAs of now, and as you can tell from my writing, my mental capacity isn\u2019t terrible. the formation of my NF2 (possibly) seems to be related to my life experiences and the resulting consequences.\n\nWhen I was young, maybe 7 or 8,  I fell under a concrete swing that seated two benches and numerous people. I was trapped and my head was crushed/bruised/bleeding, as well as much of my chest, but there were little physical indications of skull fracturing or concussion. I even remember it and it was terrifying, but I avoided death by reacting quickly and flattening my body and turning my head as the large square concrete slab scraped back and forth like a pendulum. \nA man pulled me out after he stabilized it\u2019s movement and my mom only witnessed the resulting physical condition, fortunately.\n\nI also have had numerous concussions, 1  from clumsy kid activities like jumping off couches, another during a football practice when I was in middle school, another from slipping on soap spread at the entrance of the bathroom in high school and the last from falling directly on my forehead after blacking out smoking weed at a friend\u2019s place 4-5 times over the course of a few hours. I remember this last fall (probably the hardest I\u2019ve hit my head) as gracefully/lightly losing consciousness and slowly losing control of my body as I fell, but my friend said I fell over as if I\u2019d been shot in the head. \n\nI think the past traumas influence my ability to function while smoking a fair amount of weed consecutively throughout a 4-6 hour time period, but because I normally only smoked 1-2, maybe 3 times a day about 3 hours apart each session (at my most dependent phases on the drug) it\u2019s hard to say. But for further info I was a chronic abuser of marijuana from age 19-24. I\u2019ve recently in the past few months completely stopped because I was caught with weed by police twice and now have quarterly hair follicle tests. If I fail them I go to jail.\n\nAlas, I want to say my physical condition and it\u2019s mutative state seems in direct relation to much of my life experiences with trauma. Perhaps if I didn\u2019t have all of these accidents, my possible relationship with NF2 would be far less apparent. \n\nLike I said I\u2019ve had no proper diagnosis yet, but the scoliosis combined with the tingling and tinnitus, as well as the on and off muscle fatigue, (oh and I\u2019m only 5\u20195\u201d and about 105 pounds) makes me think I\u2019m likely effected. But I\u2019m not that afraid. I think it\u2019s because answers are more comforting than unexplained/apparent incomparable misfortune. I just hope I get more time to enjoy the things I love, like league of legends, poetry, reading, anime and movies/tv, and animals. And I hope as my condition worsens I can still find joy in this world. \n\nMy mentality is largely manic as I\u2019ve stated, but the good times are really great. I consider myself confident and like-able, and I try to cover my shortcomings by being helpful where I can, especially at work. And it\u2019s noticed! Although many of my coworkers see me as aloof and unreliable mentally (I forget names of dogs and locations within our kennel, as well as coworker information and even names) I try my best and I noticeably care for the dogs and my team. \n\nI also want to say thank you for all the courageous people who speak about their condition and seek out company, without this sub I would have nowhere to share my story and experience.

So, I went to the mayo clinic to find a solution since none of my other doctors seem to know what is going on with me. I was hoping for some good news, or at least no news at all, but what the doctor told me today is basically the worst news someone can get in their entire life. Basically, the doctor said that there is a lot of scar tissue pressing on my spinal cord due to the many spinal surgeries that I had along with my scoliosis. This scar tissue has and will continue to grow and get worse even though I haven\u2019t had a surgery in two years, and that it is \u201cchocking my spinal cord\u201d to the point that the cord is so thin that it is impossible to see on the scans. I saw the scans myself, and the spinal cord -not the vertebrae- is normal and visible at the top of my neck, but it quickly becomes thinner and thinner until it is so impacted by the scar tissue that the cord itself becomes \u201cnearly invisible\u201d on the scans. He said that my body will continue to deteriorate over the next few months, and maybe a year or two if I am lucky, and that there is nothing that can be done. He never said that I will die in a few months, but in his own words he said \u201cyour body will continue to deteriorate until that is it.\u201d I am terrified, I am basically going to waste away slowly and painfully.

Severe NF (1) along with many plexiform neurofibromas which are not visible on the skin. All tumors are deep within my body. Anyway, because of my NF (1) I developed skeletal deformities that caused severe scoliosis, restrictive lung disease, failure to thrive, etc. For most of my life NF was not a primary issue. Most of the surgeries were for my scoliosis. I have had a near total spinal fusion with three titanium rods along my spine and over 20 spinal surgeries( I have had an additional 20 procedure, but due to other reasons). I went through extensive chest reconstructive surgery in 2013 and because of that now need to use a bipap at night to assist with breathing. I always struggled with putting on weight, and I\u2019m very skinny (constant nausea does not help). I needed a g-tube and TPN up until 18. Despite all these obstacles I managed to stay in school, never got left back, and excelled in my classes. I even went through radiation therapy for an MPNST during my senior year in HS, yet I still loved every minute of the last year in high school. I was really hopeful that as I got older my health problems would be less severe and easier to handle. I was wrong. It all start 1.5 years after I started college. I was never in any condition to live in a dorm far away in some college somewhere, but I managed to get into honors society in a college in the City, and I commuted everyday to and from school by myself. I even got a part-time job at my local library. I was so happy. Finally, I gained some form of independence and made a life for myself! Well, things suddenly began to fall apart in mid August of 2017. I don\u2019t know what happened to me, but I remember waking up that day and feeling like something was, \u201coff\u201d. From then on the mild yet manageable symptoms that I had my entire life got much worse. I suddenly had much worse back-pain and bad neuropathy in my legs. I felt too weak and fatigued to garden for the rest of the summer. Despite these issues I pushed myself to continue going college that fall. I was hoping that a routine spinal surgery that I was getting in February of 2018 would set things back in track. My spinal surgeon at Johns Hopkins is amazing. I really believed that the surgery would help since he saved my life before, so why not again? Well, the surgery came and went and I continued to get worse. My walking got really bad and my pain and weakness continued to degrade. I am in no way blaming the surgeon. I just thought that the surgery would put me back on the right path... The worst part was that it was my idea to have the surgery. Before the surgery my spine doc said that it was not 100% necessary to replace my spinal rods and that I could wait, but I was so hopeful that I went with it anyway. Now, more than a year later I am in the worst shape I have ever been in. I take methadone, nurontin, and dilaudid daily for pain and it barely helps. I still scream in pain all day, mostly from my bed. The worst part was that I had a chance to get better in August of 2018 when I started the experimental MEK inhibitor called, Selumetinib. It apparently has been successful at shrinking neurofibromas in 70% of patients, and supposedly 100% of people who tried the drug did not experience any neurofibroma growth. Well, I guess I\u2019m a medical anomaly since not only did my tumors not shrink, but they sprouted up faster than weeds in a spring garden. I am terrified. I\u2019m skinner than ever before and rarely feel well enough to get out of the house except to see doctors or do physical therapy. This lifestyle is killing me. I was such a social person, and I used to never sleep in late or stay home all day, but now I do. My life has gone upside down and does not seem to be getting any better. My doctors at NYU and MSKCC no longer can help and have zero answer or suggestions. I just went to the NF clinic at the Mayo Clinic hoping that they would know something that my current doctors haven\u2019t thought of, but based one how my appointment went today they do not seem to have any answers, and they only seemed to be fascinated with my very clear and \u201cbeautiful\u201d lisch nodules that dot my iris. I have no more hope and frankly do not feel like I have much life left in me. I am drained both emotionally and physically. Based on my readings on NF it seems like late teens &amp; early twenties is when NF issues flair up, and from what I read a lot of NF sufferers pass away around this age (Gillian Anderson who starred in X-Files had a brother who died of NF (1) at 21). It kills me that things did not turn out differently for me. I sometimes stay up all night thinking about what my life would be like without NF. What would I look like? Would I be supper smart. Would my family be happier? Would I have a girlfriend?  I even just wish that my NF symptoms didn\u2019t get worse since that late summer day in 2017. If my health did not degrade I would have been graduating college next semester. I know only one or two people will read this to the very end, but I guess just need to vent, and maybe in someway I am writing this to leave some kind of trace and story of my existence. My parents are very supportive and caring, but after two years of dealing with my worsening health issues they just get frustrated and upset when I tell them how scared I am or how shitty I feel physically and mentally. Also, I have totally changed my diet and I am now a health freak, yet that has not helped me either. I am at wits end. I feel like I am stuck in a dead end of a giant maze. I do not even see the point of living anymore yet I am too scared to end it because I fear that there is no afterlife. I really do not know why I writing this since I am not asking for answers or even support; I guess I just need to get all this BS off my chest.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "subreddit_subscribers": 962, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I\u2019m really scared that these months will be my last...", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1573099817, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/dsayz8/im_really_scared_that_these_months_will_be_my_last/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "almost-summer", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_10bew2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1572905635, "domain": "self.neurofibromatosis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/drp6j1/reminder/", "gildings": {}, "id": "drp6j1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/drp6j1/reminder/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1572905636, "score": 7, "selftext": "There are clinical trials occurring all over the world for treatments for NF.

The position\u00a0I was applying for required a high school degree at most and no prior\u00a0experience, so I thought I had a good shot at getting it.\u00a0About 2 weeks ago I had the\u00a0interview, which left a sour taste in my mouth and made some memories of workplace discrimination reemerge.\u00a0\n\n\nAs is custom for all of my interviews, I told the employer \"I acknowledge that I'm petite (4'10, 85 lbs for those wondering) and, oftentimes my size restricts me from reaching high objects and lifting things that are too heavy. Would you be able to provide accomodations like a step-stool and help in lifting things?\" The vibe in the room changed. The interviewer gave me a spiteful reply in a very rude tone, and our talk was soon cut short. As I was being led out of the room to leave, the interviewer said to me \"you're so small, everyone is going to think you're a client.\"\u00a0\n\n\nRight... The way I was made to feel in that room reminded me of some  past\u00a0positions. I've been screamed at for being unable to lift things that weigh more than my total body weight\u00a0and I've had coworkers purposefully\u00a0put tools &amp;\u00a0my personal belongings in places I can't reach. I've had a few managers who are understanding and 'help' me where it is needed, but mostly my needs have been met with ire and contempt.\n\n\n\u00a0I've always done my job well and I ensure to speak openly and honestly about my needs with employers from the get-go, but I'm afraid that the simple act of ASKING for necessary accomodations tarnishes my working relationships and makes me look unemployable. I've learned to let these poor experiences roll off my back and consider it to be a 'litmus test' for a toxic work culture, but damn. I need a job to live and eat.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0So...

So we took her to a pediatric neurologist (the only one in town due to small city) and he ran a blood test. He said it was negative, but that the test was not that reliable. Apparently, it had a high false negativity rate. So he pretty much said there was nothing else to do but wait. He admittedly didn\u2019t know much about NF, so he had to look up info. We felt relieved just seeing the negative result. However, the spots kept spreading to her underarm then her groin. So then I started getting worried that perhaps she might have been a false negative. This has been on my mind for years now.  My husband thinks there might not be a need to get her evaluated right now if she\u2019s not showing any other symptoms, since our research seems to indicate there\u2019s not much to be done now. However, this is all online stuff. From people who have lived through this, I would like to know: Is there a benefit to getting it diagnosed already or should we just wait? I would like to know even though I know that even if she does have it, the severity is pretty much up in the air. I just like to be aware with my kids\u2019 health. However, I don\u2019t want to put my daughter through anything if it is unnecessary at this point and there is nothing they can do or check now. I read an article saying that age 10 is when more symptoms show up. I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s true. So I\u2019d like your thoughts and advice, please. Anything would be appreciated because if I do take her to get checked out again, we will have to travel because this time I\u2019d like to find someone who is more familiar with NF.

Although NF1 has variable expression, it is usually recognized by cutaneous stigmas such as caf\u00e9-au-lait macules and intertriginous freckling and by development of neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas are a distinct type of neurogenic tumor with malignant potential. About 10% of patients with NF1 develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors with very poor prognosis. Bone dysplasia, scoliosis, and meningeal defects (spanning from dural ectasia to meningoceles) are common in patients with NF1. Intrathoracic meningoceles are rare but, when present, are usually seen in the constellation of NF1.

I am looking forward to getting to know each and every one of you. I am here because I have NF1. I have always been shy to talk about it and never really talked about it with anyone. Last year, I discovered a charity called Cupid's Charity that is raising funds for NF. They have made great strides in raising money for NF too! If you have not heard about this charity they do an event called Cupid's Undie Run, where people run in the event in their underwear. The point of this is people with NF can't hide or cover up their spots or bumps. I am participating again in the 2022 run. [https://my.cupids.org/MasonUlves](https://my.cupids.org/MasonUlves). How it works is that the money does not go to me (obviously) but it's through my profile through my charity. They do a fundraiser system where you win prizes based on how much money you raise.

For about 2.5 years now I have been dealing with a paralyzed vocal cord. Docs say it is maybe due to an \"occult tumor,\" meaning, a tumor that is too small to identify on imaging (MRI) or a tumor that is acting in a covert way. The only intervention therapeutic they have offered is to inject the paralyzed side with botox to make it swell up and thus (in their view) make speech easier for me. The theory is that it would allow the two vocal folds to \"meet in the middle\" again (something they can't do now). Currently, my non-paralyzed cord is overcompensating and trying to reach over the median to meet the paralyzed one (which, as luck would have it, is paralyzed just a bit farther over median; and yeah, it could be worse). I'm not super wild on the idea of injecting my paralyzed vocal cord with another paralyzing agent, itself a neurotoxin. Seems counterintuitive. Dangerous. They disagree. They also asked that I do speech therapy. I did. It did not work. \n\nAnyone else dealing with this issue?

But if anyone can provide me with some advice/experiences that could make this potential diagnosis less upsetting that would be awesome", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "subreddit_subscribers": 1675, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "what to expect?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/oo0ucy/what_to_expect/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AktuallyIsDolan", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3dj9qda4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1626769595, "domain": "self.neurofibromatosis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/onxyng/my_struggle_for_surgery_due_to_australian/", "gildings": {}, "id": "onxyng", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/onxyng/my_struggle_for_surgery_due_to_australian/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1626769606, "score": 1, "selftext": "my government totally screwed up getting vaxinations for everyone, Sydney has lock downs and I'm supposed to be having surgery to remove three tumours nf2 in my spine that are paralysing both my hands.

Maybe it's that?\n\nWe are waiting to be seen by a pediatric dermatologist in 2 months (ugh) but i got an appointment for myself in 2 weeks, and i will mention my son's CALS in the context of my freckle splotch and bumps.\n\nHe &amp; I have no neurological symptoms so I am thinking skipping to a neurologist is not what we should do right now, right? His pediatrician had nothing to say other than confirming that they were CALS. Can the dermatologist order the genetic testing herself?

Her dad and I have been super vigilant and taking her to see her specialists since then.  She is 10 months old now and thus far the only signs we see have been the cafe au lait spots.  Well, now I am noticing that she might have developed some strabismus - where one eye appears to go inward more than the other.  Also, I am noticing that her ears are low-set and not level to where they should be.  She also has some extra folding in the back of her neck, which already appears to be rather short - I have a short neck so perhaps it\u2019s that?  Anyhow, after googling my life away, I came across Noonans syndrome, which she seems to meet some of the facial characteristics for it.  Does anyone on here have NF1 and NS? I\u2019ve read that it can be a thing.  I\u2019m going to take my baby yo her specialist but I wanted to see if anyone in this community has any experience.

The CAL\u2019s continue to multiply. I know sometime is off. I have raised 3 babies. I know something is off!!

Told me no goggle and that we needed to wait for testing. \nAfter test came back she has NF1 and our kids and us get tested. It\u2019s a fluke gene!! \nShe has speech issues, social issues, physical issues, sleep issue, learning disabilities, testing for Asperger\u2019s an autism, motion sickness, fear blisters it temps over 85degrees, and 100 + CAL and 1 neurofibroma.

My insurance wouldn\u2019t pay for a genetics test at this time, so I dropped it.\n\nClinical diagnosis based on presence of two of the following:\n\n1. Six or more caf\u00e9-au-lait macules over 5 mm in diameter in prepubertal individuals and over 15mm in greatest diameter in postpubertal individuals. ** I only have 3\n2. Two or more neurofibromas of any type or one plexiform neurofibroma. *** I am littered with them \n3. Freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions. **freckling for me is in \u201cwrong area\u201d\n4. Two or more Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas).\n5. Optic glioma. ** not present\n6.

I went to the doctors for what I thought was carpal tunnel and every test came back that I was fine. After visiting several doctors, in may 2019 we discovered I had complete loss of temperature feeling in my hands. I couple feel pressure, but no hot or cold difference. An MRI later &amp; further research they found two tumors sandwiching my spinal cord at the C1-2 level. Had to get surgery right then. The surgery gave me my feeling back, etc. Every doctor after looking at my medical history, MRIs and biopsy of neurofibromas all say it all points to NF. So I asked to get genetically tested. I got referred to another genetic counselor who said she also thought it was NF, but like stated above I didn\u2019t \u201cqualify\u201d so she approved/suggested to my insurance to get tested.\n\nI got the genetic test in the middle of 2019. They told me it might take a long time...So I waited. \n\n2021. (I changed jobs and switched insurance so they apparently didn\u2019t call me with my test results???) I called and asked if it was ever completed. They said yes and that my results were inconclusive. She said that when they look at the specific gene that causes NF there was a gene mutation, but on that has never been reported before. She said she would talk with a geneticist that specialized in NF. They talked and got back to me that while I do not \u201cqualify\u201d and the test is inconclusive, he would absolutely say I have NF.\n\nI just feel really defeated at this moment.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "subreddit_subscribers": 1611, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Trouble w/ NF Diagnosis", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/npz245/trouble_w_nf_diagnosis/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "lonelygirlbelgium007", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_41qs8hs3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1622535373, "domain": "self.neurofibromatosis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/npoz3b/cant_they_invent_a_medecine_with_neurofibromine/", "gildings": {}, "id": "npoz3b", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/npoz3b/cant_they_invent_a_medecine_with_neurofibromine/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1622535385, "score": 1, "selftext": "If our body\u2019s does make bad or not enough neurofibromine... why can\u2019t they just invent something like a pill so we have more  or good neurofibromine in our body\u2019s so the cells will not grow... pfff why is it al so hard to deal with... good sunny weather again in Belgium....

You're all very kind and knowledgeable people, and the camaraderie is great. :) So, onto my question/new obsessive thought that will rob me of sleep for the next month and a half...\n\nI realize that people with a diagnosis of NF1 have a higher risk for developing cancer at some point in their lives. However, does this risk scale with the severity of their symptoms? For example, if someone were to just look at me fully clothed, they could never tell that I do indeed have NF1. I mostly have CAL spots and tiny fibromas on my trunk. I was only very recently diagnosed, and NF1 has never really affected my quality of life. I would say, therefore, that I have a very mild case. Does this mean anything for my overall cancer risk? I'm a bona fide hypochondriac and have OCD and anxiety, so since I discovered this potentiality, I have taken it and run with it, and now I have made myself a worried mess, lol.

I finally bit the bullet and signed up for Reddit just to join this community! I'm a 21 year old female, and I have just very recently been definitively diagnosed with NF1. I'm very luck that I have a (I think?) mild case of it. I'm covered in CAL spots -- mostly around my groin and under the arms -- and have quite a few fibromas all over my body. They're tender and hyperpigmented -- just like any other fibroma, I suppose. I have bad anxiety, OCD, and very possibly could have ASD, which I've just learned are potential comorbidities with NF1. \n\nMy geneticist has put in orders for four MRIs to be done soon, on my head, neck, spine, and thorax (I believe). I'm a very small person, and I weigh only about 115lbs at 5'4, so I would assume that internal plexiforms would be quite obvious, but I don't know... I heard that if you don't have any plexiforms after going through puberty, then you should be set. However, not knowing is absolute agony. I guess I'm posting here for advice pertaining to MRIs, and some emotional support in general. What should I expect going in for the MRIs? What advice can any of you offer?\n\nApologies if this is a bit of a disjointed first post. I look forward to experiencing the camaraderie here -- it seems a very welcoming place.\n\nx Mel", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "subreddit_subscribers": 1600, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "upcoming MRI -- kind of scared!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/nhtgvv/upcoming_mri_kind_of_scared/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "blehbhbehu", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_63ck1y9f", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621551066, "domain": "self.neurofibromatosis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/nhdu1x/will_working_out_help_with_flabbyness/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nhdu1x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/nhdu1x/will_working_out_help_with_flabbyness/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1621551076, "score": 1, "selftext": "So my left arm is covered from my wrist to my shoulder in bumps and stuff it\u2019s disgusting and ugly and i hate it so no end, anyway i was wondering if exercising would help with the flabby skin its really weird looking because im a very skinny person and my other arm does not look like that .

With the one I had in 2014, they detected \" There is a 7 mm T2  hyperintensity in the white matter of the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere which is nonspecific.  There is a similar focus in the medial aspect of the left cerebral peduncle\" and \"asymmetric appearance of the proximal left middle cerebral artery which is smaller than the right\". For whatever reason, I wasn't notified to schedule a follow-up and I figured that since I was cleared with what they initially looked for that I was fine.\n\nHere's the rundown of what my labs I got back from my recent session:\n\n**Impression:**  Chronic left MCA trifurcation region stenosis/occlusion with collateralization, similar to prior MRI.  NF1 related vasculopathy is among differential considerations.  No other significant stenosis.   Attenuated right A1 and P1 segments consistent with congenital variant. \n\n* **Petrous and cavernous segments of ICAs:**  Unremarkable.\n* **Supraclinoid ICAs:**  Mild tortuosity proximal segments both ophthalmic arteries.\n* **Middle cerebral arteries:**  Chronic appearing left MCA flow signal attenuation.  Irregular contour and decreased caliber of left M1 segment with apparent distal occlusion.  Flow related enhancement of small caliber M2  and M3 segments apparently via collaterals.  Findings are grossly similar to MRI of 08/13/2014 and likely due to chronic occlusion rather than congenital variant.\n* **Anterior cerebral arteries:**  Markedly hypoplastic right A1 segment.  Paired A2 segments at the midline.\n* **Anterior communicating artery:**  Unremarkable.\n* **Posterior communicating artery:**  Fetal supplied right PCA.  Moderately hypoplastic left PCOM.\n* **Distal vertebral arteries:**  Unremarkable.  Bilateral PICA noted.\n* **Basilar artery and branches:**  Unremarkable.  Bilateral AICA and superior cerebellar arteries noted.\n* **Posterior cerebral arteries:**  Hypoplastic right P1 segment.  Fetal supply smaller caliber right PCA. \n\nI'm not entirely sure what a good chunk of this means, but asymmetrical MCA is what got the person's attention when it came up again and wants me to get checked on because there's an increased risk of a stroke if it gets worse. I was wondering if anyone else has gotten results like this back and how you went about dealing with things. I'm sure I'll be fine, but it's just this air of mystery with wondering how long this has been going on for that bothers me.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "subreddit_subscribers": 1133, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Neurological issues and MRA/MRI scans", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/fwnoli/neurological_issues_and_mramri_scans/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "notwhoyourthink", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "a5dc4f5a-ee92-11e7-a12e-0eb7b9fa33b6", "author_flair_text": "NF1", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2wiskfce", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1585426667, "domain": "self.neurofibromatosis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/fqrn91/how_is_everyone/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fqrn91", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/fqrn91/how_is_everyone/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1585430061, "score": 2, "selftext": "How is everyone?\n\nI\u2019m into week two of self isolating on Tuesday, and a almost a week into a three week lockdown.\n\nI don\u2019t go many places but now I know I can\u2019t go any who want to go all sorts of places.  \n\nPlease stay at home and keep safe.  \n\nP", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "neurofibromatosis", "subreddit_id": "t5_2t4qg", "subreddit_subscribers": 1126, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How is everyone?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/fqrn91/how_is_everyone/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "gaviepants", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_171i5m", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1585278259, "domain": "self.neurofibromatosis", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/fpphb5/nf2_t5_spinal_tumor_removal/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fpphb5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/neurofibromatosis/comments/fpphb5/nf2_t5_spinal_tumor_removal/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1585278264, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just got the news today that I have to have surgery to remove a tumor on my T5.

You don\u00b4t have anything wrong, but i would like to keep being single\" and a lot of stuff. And everyone kinda lied to me. A week later or even days, i would see them with boyfriends and stuff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, because of some things, i found a group of people in my school who were kinda cool and nice. The group had... 2 males, and 4 females. With me in with we were 3 males. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a time the group kinda lost people. And in the end, we were 2 males and 2 females. I had a crush in one of the females. But she kinda rejected me in the past. So i told the male who was my best friend in that moment.

My effects so far have been minimal other than a birth defect in which my ulna on my right side didn\u2019t grow completely and my elbow is dislocated. It never caused much issue growing up except that my wrist broke more easily. I\u2019ve broken my wrist 3 or 4 times and had had to have surgery every time. I have a metal plate in my arm to hold the bones together.\nAround November of last year, my face started breaking out. It seems to be cystic as a lot of times, they are painful and hard and sometimes I can\u2019t get anything to come out. Sometimes, pus does come out if I apply heat beforehand and others clear stuff will come out. And other times, nothing.\nIdk why but when it started I immediately became terrified that the NF was progressing. I have a couple bumps on the back of my neck, and one on my scalp but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re neurofibromas or just moles or warts. They don\u2019t hurt. They haven\u2019t grown. In fact, sometimes they feel as though they\u2019ve gotten smaller but I\u2019m not sure because I don\u2019t monitor them very closely. \nI\u2019ve had a glomus tumor for about ten years now. I can\u2019t afford to get it removed and I\u2019ve read that a lot of doctors don\u2019t even know what they are and I can\u2019t afford to be doctor-jumping just to find one who will listen. \nI did try to talk to one doctor about it and asked her if I would see an orthopedist for it and if I would need a referral. I mentioned the long history and the symptoms and she just seemed to dismiss what I said and told me (nonchalantly), \u201cI would actually refer you to an oncologist because it might be skin cancer.\u201d \nI don\u2019t really know a lot about skin cancer, although I\u2019ve read several different articles and searched several medical websites, but I don\u2019t think that I would go ten years with no other symptoms. Plus, it looks nothing like the pictures on the websites. It just looks like a purplish reddish spot under my nail, not a black streak. So, I gave up. I can\u2019t have an MRI to diagnose because of the metal plate in my arm. Besides that, I can\u2019t afford $8,000-$10,000 for it either.\nI\u2019ve also been having issues with thinking and concentrating. That could be due to depression and anxiety, but idk.\nI\u2019m just tired of living in fear and apprehension. I\u2019m tired of doctors not being educated. I\u2019m tired of feeling like there isn\u2019t more research and I\u2019m confused as well because NF is supposedly one of the most common hereditary diseases and yet doctors don\u2019t know about it. Cystic Fibrosis is less common and all doctors know what that is. Granted, CF generally shortens a person\u2019s lifespan significantly more than NF does, but it\u2019s still important.\nI went in for birth control removal and reinsertion last month, and while there they did a \u201cwell women\u2019s\u201d exam. This was done by a midwife and she thought she found a lump of some sort in my left breast. I can\u2019t feel anything but whatever. \nI told my husband that if it ended up being anything, I wasn\u2019t going to do anything about it and he got angry and told me that yes I was. \nI told him that we can\u2019t afford it anyway. And tbh, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve frequently been thinking about suicide, but I can\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t want to mess my kids up. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019d really care much or not, but somehow I feel like if I died \u201cnaturally\u201d that it would mess them up less than if I killed myself. Plus, I\u2019m not really religious but I believe in God (though my faith is starting to waver a bit sometimes) and I don\u2019t want to go to hell (I don\u2019t think that people that commit suicide go to hell automatically but I think I would).\nMy mother is covered with neurofibromas and I really wish I could be more like her. She doesn\u2019t seem to let it bother her. I\u2019ve never liked the way I look anyway and if that happens to me, it will just make it worse. I hope I\u2019m not offending anyone. That\u2019s not my intention. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve already had to deal with stares, questions and ridicule my whole life due to my arm and I hate it. \nI have read in this subreddit that they are developing new drugs that seem to show some promise to help with NF tumors but I still have to try to find a doctor who will know what I\u2019m talking about and who would prescribe the drug. And again, I can\u2019t afford that. \nI just turned 30 and I just keep thinking about how I don\u2019t want to live another 20-40 years or more like this. That\u2019s honestly what scares me the most. If I was in my 50s and just developing symptoms, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d care as much. I don\u2019t really want to live a \u201clong life\u201d, but it seems that the universe or God or whatever you believe in wants the exact opposite for me that I want for myself. \nI see people in here that are so positive and I just wish I could be too, and not really care about what others think. \nSorry for the long post. I\u2019ve wanted to post in here for awhile but didn\u2019t know what to say or how to say it because I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings or piss them off.

I\u2019m almost done with an IT program at our local community college and she\u2019s just changed hers to social work.  With me finishing we will be able to get our own place and starting to plan for a family ~7 years down the road.  We\u2019ve both been worried about pregnancy and NF.  She\u2019s more worried about passing the gene and I\u2019m more scared about her own health.  We\u2019ve read that the gene can be removed from a child before they are born, it would cost a lot but we wouldn\u2019t mind and would plan around that.

My gf is making appointments to her OB/GYN and neuro soon to talk about this but we want to know first hand experiences or discussion before they come up.\n  \nThe next question is about working.  My mom and grandma both have MS so I\u2019ve seen the toll work can do to people with neurological conditions.  My girlfriend currently works 17 hours a week at an aftercare for K-8.   She can do this right now but some days she is worn down.  She worked worked summer camps the last few years during vacation and comes home tired and in pain for the last 2 years.  Me and my mom are also worried about her immune system around young kids who aren\u2019t the cleanest and don\u2019t know how to sneeze in their elbows.  Would a part time office job be ok in the long run?  My aunt is a social worker who said she could help my gf find an assistant job, but my gf also is offered a preschool 25-30 hour a week job once she finishes her degree.\n  \nAny input is awesome.

The conclusion of my recent full spinal and brain MRI was that I basically have a severe form of this disorder. My neurologist said that in his time working with NF2, I take part of the cake for having one of the most severe forms. I asked him questions like, \"Am I in danger of becoming a paraplegic? Quadriplegic? Feeding tube? Trach?\" And the list went on... Basically, the answers were yes all around. I have spinal tumors as big as 5cm, filling my spine. Some compressing, displacing or widening my spinal cord. The doctor doesnt want to even touch them UNTIL they start causing major symptoms. Which pisses me off because I don't want to lose a major function that I happen to LOVE doing before they decide to do something. One is growing in to the bone in my lumbar spine. I have one behind my pelvis. I'm hardly worried about my brain tumors anymore. \n\nI will begin Avastin as soon as I establish an oncologist in Springfield, MO, home base.
