And I have been masturbating for as long as I can remember, have been doing sexual acts since I was 14, and lost my virginity (and am still with the same boy) at 16.

I had one night in particular where I was in bed and allotted myself some normal masturbation (simple clitoral, since whenever I try pleasuring myself vaginally I become frustrated and feel I need to pee, and I can't orgasm that way) after I was done, however, I had the internal intense urge of \"I need deep vaginal stimulation\" (vaginal swelling, lubrication, and what I call phantom pleasure) but, as I stated before, the only one who can satisfy that is my boyfriend, but he wasn't with me. I tried to let it pass and to to sleep but it just would NOT go away!! I lost track of how many times I rapidly made myself orgasm clitorally, and even tried to stimulate internally to no avail. It ended up with me being stuck awake until 5 am crying and practically having a panic attack. Although flareups are few and far between, and nothing compared to the other stories I've seen, they are still miserable.

I\u2019m over the moon to find that this support group was created because I feel PGAD is extremely under represented and talked about in the medical community, despite it happening to a surprising amount of women out there. \n\nAnyway, I developed PGAD-like symptoms earlier this year after starting a new birth control. I basically lost my mind and started becoming super horny all the time. The night it all started, I had a massive panic attack because I remembered hearing about PGAD and I was terrified I would be stuck like that for the rest of my life. I didn\u2019t sleep until 6am that night. It was like I was about to sneeze all the time, and I was in a constant state of panic. I\u2019d have bouts of extreme rage and depression and multiple times where I wanted to end my life. \n\nI stopped taking the birth control and I immediately saw improvement. Every five days,  I would get an episode. It was weird, but it literally happened every five days. I still don\u2019t know why. I saw three different doctors in hopes to find a reason to why this happened and two of them basically said it was in my head and not real and PGAD is fake and made up by pharmaceutical companies to get money out of people \ud83d\ude44 my GP was the only person who actually confirmed my hunch that the birth control did this to me. She was very concerned for me and believed me that what I was going through was not normal. She was hopeful, though, that it would go away. \n\nNow, four months later, I rarely experience any symptoms at all and I feel soooooo much better. My hormones are still figuring themselves out, but for the most part, I feel back to normal. I don\u2019t feel crazy anymore and I\u2019m basically myself again. \n\nAnybody who\u2019s going through something like this, I\u2019d love to talk to you.

away.\ni think that my mental state contributed to the cause.\ni have sensimotor ocd with fixiation on breathing and also anxiety problems.\nIm not taking any meds whatsoever (and never have).\nI tried psychotherapy once but i was coping well enough with my ocd and anxiety so that i was not in the need for it.\nWhen it is really bad, it feels like im on the edge of an orgasm and my glans is extremely sensitive.\nFor me i learned that i can let the feeling go away by avoiding sexual stimulation and reducing stress to a minimum.\nIf i do that the symptoms will reduce and after 3 days of a flareup it is basically gone.\nSexual stimulation will trigger it again which is making me very depressed since im afraid of destroying my relationship in the long run and not being able to have sex again.\nSitting and thight clothes are making it worse while present.\nAnxiety and stress are making it exeptionally worse which was very shitty in the beginning because it is a stressor on its own.\nSometimes it also affects my bladder and i have the constant feeling of needing to pee.\nI was visiting a neurologist and im getting an MRT tomorrow, i have little hope that they will find something organic but i will try everything i can.\nI think it is somehow linked to anxiety and ocd, if there is nothing organic found i will think about the use of an ssri like paroxetine (anybody

felt like touching myself so i did. when i finished, i tried going to bed but i kept having the feeling between my legs as if i was still touching myself, but i was just laying there in bed. it was kinda different tho, like a mix of that feeling and when u have to pee\n\nthe next day i had that feeling and it lasted the entire day, getting worse if i sat down for too long.  it felt better for like 10 minutes after i used the restroom so it could just be a weird bladder or urinary tract infection honestly.  i did touch myself that morning again\n\ntoday i still have that feeling all the same. this morning, though, soon after i woke up, i randomly started shaking and convulsing, similar to how i react to an orgasm but like it did not feel good.  i was terrified, i thought i was dying, and it lasted so long i thought i would never be able to get up out of bed.  it was probably just from fear but i felt very very nauseous the couple hours after that.  i had some trouble in school

It happens again a third time that day but a lot less came out. And from then on once a week I have a spontaneous sudden crippling orgasm it doesn't actually hurt unless I hold it in. And now I am noticing instead of once a week it's now every 5 days and I've also noticed there is a building feeling of arousal but no erection.\n\nI am really kind of worried about this and because of covid-19 I do not have the resources to go to the doctor or in this case a urologist to find out what the heck is going on and the only thing that I can find on the internet about spontaneous orgasms is PGAD.

At first it was just once in a while, then it ramped up in intensity as the days went on. I began taking 800 mg of Ibuprofen every 4 hours. My symptoms present as constant, intense arousal in my clitoris that wraps down into my vagina and up to where my g spot is. I don't spontaneously orgasm, but my clitoris is constantly aroused with a buzzing,  throbbing feeling. I was masturbating 4-5 times a day bc like so many stories I read, I thought the release would help, but it didn't. I'm now trying to not masturbate, but it's hard when it feels like I need to. I don't have pain per se, but there is sometimes a stinging sensation, usually when I pee. Otherwise it's this constant sexual feeling of throbbing/buzzing.  It's worse when I sit on a hard chair or do core exercises.  \n\nInitially, I thought it was connected to being on Testosterone (I am trans FtM) bc my clitoris had grown quite a bit and I was also masturbating way more often due to an increased sexual arousal.  \n\nSo I discontinued Testosterone therapy. My last injection was a month ago. My symptoms then improved for a few weeks, to the point where I was forgetting what it felt like. \n\nThen it started to come back again a week ago, just a blip for a few minutes at first, and now ramping up again, to the point where I ended up in the hospital yesterday, crying hysterically. \n\nI had my first appointment with a pelvic physiologist and a urologist last week. The urologist took a urine sample, it came back as having an infection due to too high of levels of ureaplasma, so I'm on doxycycline for that, but I didn't find that out until yesterday so I've only taken my first two doses. \n\nThe pelvic physiologist gave me lot of information that was a little overwhelming.  She explained the muscles of the pelvic to me - I was sexually abused as a very young child and we discussed how tense and hypervigilant my pelvic muscles have been for the last 30 years  - I'm 36 now -  she did a physical exam and a just an initial introduction to pelvic massage. She was very confident that treatment will help. However,  this was when my symptoms had mostly gone away and we were thinking it was related to the Testosterone. \n\nI began reading about PGAD yesterday and I'm scared that this is what I have and that it will lead to suicide \ud83d\udc94 this feeling is horrifically triggering for me bc it is reminiscent of the way my vagina felt after the sessions of child abuse - irriated, stimulated, no way to make it stop.  \n\nThe other thing I think of is that 4 days before these symptoms started, I had finished weaning off Effexor, which I had been on for the last 4 years. I read that anti-depressants can have an effect and I've been on some sort of anti-depressant since I was 17 and now I have been on nothing for the last 40 days.  \n\nWhen I googled Effexor, bc I couldn't remember if it was an SSRI or not and it came up listed as an anti-depressant and a nerve pain medication, I had no idea it was a nerve pain med. I'm wondering if that could have spurred it on. \n\nYesterday they prescribed me Xanax, put me on Prozac (Fluoxetine), and started me on the Doxycycline. They also referred me to a pain management clinic to have them evaluate my Pudendal Nerve. They also prescribed me vaginal Valium suppositories, I'm seeing conflicting information about that on the net. \n\nHas anyone been on Testosterone, had this happen, and stopped taking Testosterone? Did it help? How long did it take after stopping for the symptoms to subside?\n\nHas anyone been on Effexor or an anti-depressant and stopped and had this happen? \n\nHas anyone tried the vaginal suppositions and gotten relief?\n\nThanks everyone \u2764", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 197,

I'm pretty sure I have PGAD because my whole life I've had spontaneous episodes of \"someone walking over my grave\" as an ex put it - but it wasn't just goosebumps,  there was also brief shaking, tingles up and down my spine and pulsing pelvic floor pressure. It wasn't until I was sexually active and intentionally achieved orgasm that I realized how similar the feelings are. I've also experienced persistent arousal and gential/nipple sensitivity for as long as I can remember understanding what those things feel like (age 11 maybe?)\n\nWhat I'm wondering is if it's worth seeking out a diagnosis. I'm already on SSRIs (paroxetine) for anxiety and OCD, I already take magnesium supplements for RLS and I get b12 injections every three months to make up for deficiency. I'm not sure what else a doctor could do to help me and while I find the episodes and general discomfort sub optimal at times, I have thus far learned to live with it. When unmedicated I was masturbating at least twice (two 'sessions', usually multiple orgasms) per day which I assumed was due to what I perceived as high sex drive. I now know it's for relief and since starting my SSRIs (6 years ago) I'd say it's more like one session per day with the occasional day off.\n\nAs long as my negative experiences don't worsen... is it worth trying to \"fix\" it by going through the motions?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 190, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "If it ain't broke...?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/ib7csp/if_it_aint_broke/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "throwawaysandthings", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7js2xboi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597502847, "domain": "self.PGADsupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/ia8l6r/i_cant_tell_if_this_is_pgad_or_not_but_its/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ia8l6r", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/PGADsupport/comments/ia8l6r/i_cant_tell_if_this_is_pgad_or_not_but_its/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597502858, "score": 1, "selftext": "during my period, i(20F) was masturbating and when i \u201cfinished\u201d it felt like it was lingering on which was odd to me. now, i have this strange feeling down there and i have for the past 4 days. its not like im about to orgasm, just more like an aroused feeling that comes on when i have to pee or im stressed / thinking about it. its not wet or anything either, just the feeling. i have no way to get to the doctor any time soon so im not sure what i should do. ive also been having pelvic cramping as well!! \ni need advice please and thank you !!!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 189, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "i cant tell if this is pgad or not but its driving me crazy", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/ia8l6r/i_cant_tell_if_this_is_pgad_or_not_but_its/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "magpiezekens", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2wbjirl", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597336065, "domain": "self.PGADsupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/i932h7/sudden_pgad/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i932h7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/PGADsupport/comments/i932h7/sudden_pgad/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597336105, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m 25(f), and have had all the symptoms for about a week now.

So basically last October I was put on Lexapro 10mg for depression and I actually thought it was beginning to help(maybe it was) but then like a month after starting I got a strange rash from my hips up. My physician was positive it wasn\u2019t lexapro causing this so she kept me on it. Eventually it went away BUT then like another month later I started feeling like the inner thigh of my left leg/ left side of vagina started feeling numb like when you fall asleep on your arm. It\u2019s numb but also hurts. Well that persisted and stayed for like 3 days and kept getting worse. Then when I was laying in bed I started getting waves of what I assumed were orgasms but they were different than the regular ones. Not pleasurable at all and my clit was like icy hot and I began getting cold sweats. I mean I was full on freaking out and having panic attacks so that didn\u2019t help. The day after I went to the hospital and they found a ovarian cysts and reassured me that\u2019s what it was and sent me on my way. I think me having that idea in my head helped me push through it and eventually the feelings would kind of dissipate because I wouldn\u2019t give them the time of day. It ultimately lasted a month and went away. I\u2019d still feel that numbness if I sat on a hard surface for too long though (always on my left side) well I pretty much thought I was passed it but then I randomly started having what I guess would be mini orgasms again out of nowhere. Meanwhile I\u2019m still on the lexapro. It\u2019s gotten worse and worse and I\u2019m often sore down there or have the icy hot feeling. I know I am definitely OCD and make everything worse by over-focusing on it and raising my anxiety. I\u2019m still dealing with it today and it\u2019s been close to 2 ish months but I\u2019m in a darker place mentally, especially since my specialist wants me to get fully off lexapro. Does this sound like a nerve problem? Antidepressant induced? Or my anxiety/ ocd causing this? Because I remember once I decided to not let the feeling overpower my day it eventually just went away. But I also had college keeping me busy all week. Now with all of this going on I\u2019m often inside, and alone and it\u2019s so hard not to dwell on my symptoms. Also a crazy thing to note is even when my PGAD pretty much disappeared for the 4 months whenever I would have a panic attack I would have like a mini orgasm or two and feel icy hot down there. So maybe I\u2019m just stuck in the anxious depressive state and that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping it around too. My specialist thinks endometriosis can be causing this too but I haven\u2019t seen where that was the cause for someone yet. I would just love some insightful opinions. I saw one girl say she\u2019s so ocd she would focus on swallowing and the spit filling in her mouth and felt she was choking ( I actually went through that period too haha) I also have depersonalization which I think comes on when you hyper-fixate on reality. I just know how it started was so odd, with the numbness and I still get it on the left side if I sit for too long.

One day I decided that I wanted to shave my pubic hair, so I did, but after I was done I got this weird tickling/tingling sensation down under my testicles and or near my perenium. In a way it kinda feels orgasmic, but the feeling is not going away. It gets better when I exercise, but when I am alone or sitting or laying down is when it will get really bad. I wouldn't say that I am experiencing any full orgasm, but it feels like I'm about to orgasm, but like only a little bit. Hard to explain. It gets better in the morning, but throughout the day the tickling/tingling sensation gets much worse. Anxiety also makes it worse. I've only had this for 3 days, and I looked up my symptoms. The only thing that is popping up is PGAD. The internet says that this is a rare condition and that it affects mostly women. I am a male, so I feel very isolated and alone with this. If I do have this than I must have the worst luck ever considering how rare it is in males.  The feeling just feels very annoying in the background, and I don't want to live like this. I also really hope this isn't PGAD, because I looked up PGAD, and people are saying that this makes people commit suicide. There also isn't a cure or anything, so that also make me really upset.

I\u2019m also in a constant state of arousal. It never goes away, and it only lessens some for a few minutes to an hour at most after orgasming. I nearly always feel wet, my breasts get really sensitive and swollen out of nowhere, and I nearly always feel swollen and throbbing in my vulvar area. However, I know that actual desire and mental arousal aren\u2019t supposed to be part of PGAD, but I nearly constantly feel that as well. Occasionally, I won\u2019t be in the mood, but still have the physical symptoms and feel like I have to try to orgasm even though I\u2019m annoyed and don\u2019t want to. Do any of you feel mentally aroused as almost as often as you do physically? Is it possible to have both PGAD and hypersexuality?

Ive never felt like this before - constant arousal down there that\u2019s quite distracting. I think if it is PGAD is must be a mild case because I can still watch TV but I have to try really hard to focus on it. \n\nI\u2019m on the pill and had my pill break a few days ago which is when this began - I took the next pill today so am hoping that maybe it was caused by a combination of stress and the hormone change of my period? Initially I thought I was just missing my boyfriend as I\u2019ve not seen him in 5 weeks, I tried to masturbate but my vibrator ran out of charge halfway through and I was too tired to use my hands so just had a cold shower and left it. But last night I masturbated again and it didn\u2019t help at all - maybe for 5-10 minutes and then the feeling was back, so I thought I was just really sexually frustrated and went for round 2 but found I couldn\u2019t finish as towards the end everything was far too sensitive and it hurt.\n\nBut the feeling didn\u2019t go away - I\u2019ve never had arousal last this long after failing to finish before and it\u2019s driving me crazy. I can only sleep on my back, not on my side as this must place some pressure somewhere. I\u2019ve even tried placing a pillow between my knees but I still can only sleep on my back.\n\nIf it continues I don\u2019t know what I will do.

I am a female, 25 yrs old and going crazy this week because I am constantly masturbating and I am constantly aroused without a reason. I\u2019ve had this thing all my life, basically. Arousal without a reason, and I just try to make it go with masturbation. But these episodes just come and go for me.\n\nFor example I have more of these when I\u2019m anxious or depressed. For example if I have a very bad week at work, I am constantly aroused that week. I masturbated at work before. I masturbated while I was in university, when my class had a break because I was extremely aroused at class for no reason. \n\n I never thought of it as a disorder, I always thought I was a very sexual person, that\u2019s why (I don\u2019t have much experience with having actual sex though). But during this quarantine, it god so bad that I went crazy today. I was almost going to cry. for the past week I was trying to find someone to relate, I searched everything about masturbation in google and reddit to see if other people has the same experience as me during the quarantine.\n\nToday I did not write \u2018constantly masturbating\u2019 but \u2018constantly aroused\u2019 and I saw this disorder! When I read it I was almost going to cry. It seems almost the same as what I\u2019ve been going through all my life.\n\nMy question is do I really have PGAD you think?

After about 6 months of remission my PGAD is back. About 2 years ago my PGAD started. It came on after I abruptly stopped antidepressants after 2 years. It started as this throbbing that could only be relieved by orgasm, but orgasms didn\u2019t feel pleasurable. They felt like a release of a pressure valve - built up tension being relieved from my body. Inbetween orgasms I\u2019d experience spasms. Sitting down made the spasms worse. In fact, everything made the spasms worse - sitting, standing walking, you name it! Only sleeping pills helped. If I didn\u2019t orgasm the spasms would go away but the throbbing pressure would remain - this uncomfortable and deep pain. I started amitriptyline, lyrica, bought myself a standing desk for work. I went to a pelvic PT who worked wonders and taught me exercises to release pressure with my pelvic wand. I was going to the toilet way too\nmuch at night so I did some bladder training and avoided straining to pee at all costs. Things got better! The pain stopped! The muscle tension never went away so I always did pelvic floor releases at the end of the day and kept up with the amitriptyline. I didn\u2019t date for over a year because I was terrified it would come back. Then one day I had a spontaneous orgasm at night, but it didn\u2019t feel unpleasant. My symptoms actually felt fine the next day. It got me thinking - maybe I\u2019m healed! I decided to masturbate the day following and again - no pain! Then about a week later when the urge came on I masturbated and it was back to that same familiar tension. I needed over 5 orgasms to get to a point of feeling ok. The pain didn\u2019t begin straight afterward, but I got my wisdom teeth removed the following week. The general anaesthetic really fucked with me. I needed to go to the toilet but wasn\u2019t able to. I strained a lot to pass urine. Then the following week I got my booster vaccine. I was tossing and turning all night unable to sleep. I woke up at one point with that unfamiliar and unwanted feeling - The painful throbbing. The throbbing was so bad that a relieved myself the next day. I did it once and then the urge to do it came back stronger an hour later, so I masturbated 3-4 times. I\u2019ve avoided masturbating at all costs in the three days following, but I started a new job and I\u2019ve had to sit through a lot of meetings. Usually I would have a standing desk. My tips and tricks aren\u2019t working and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ve damaged the nerve again for good :( I resigned today because the pain was so bad and I couldn\u2019t focus, but now I\u2019m left with my own negative thoughts and the pain has been awful. Does anyone have any insights they can share to keep the pain at bay while I figure out next steps? I really appreciate you all - no one knows the pain we experience and can empathise unless they\u2019ve had this condition. Its taken away so much of my life - dating, shorts and pants, sitting for long periods of time. Sticking a plastic wand up your vagina every night to relieve tension is also just the most weirdly fucked up and lonely experience. I hope you know you are not alone, and my life did get considerably better while in remission.

It\u2019s also almost 2am and I\u2019m extremely sleep deprived(haven\u2019t been able to sleep because of how bad my PGAD has gotten) so I might sound a bit loopy. Anyways, my PGD started in 2017, after a shower. I suddenly had extreme sensation in my clitoris that I need to relieve, so I did. I noticed the sensation would not go away. So then I relieved it again. And again, and again. Still the sensation remained. At this point I\u2019m panicking and I call my boyfriend, who was and still is extremely understanding. After some time, and many masturbation sessions later (days of masturbating), it randomly subsided. It would take me about 4-6 orgasms to feel relief. The weird thing was, after I had one orgasm, I always had to immediately relieve myself with a mini orgasm that easily came after. I ended up going to a pelvic floor doctor after doing some research. I was diagnosed with IC because with the arousal came bladder pain, leaking and urinary frequency. After a year of bladder treatments and no improvement, my doctors turned me away. I was so fucking lost. Every few days I would have to violently masturbate until I felt some sort of relief. If I was lucky it would be once a week. As time went on it got worse, I had to masturbate more frequently and it would take 8 orgasms, then 10 then 12 or more to feel any relief. Fast forward to now. I did more research in the last few months and figured maybe I have pudendal neuralgia, so I went to a specialist. Of course they diagnosed me with it and had me agree to do a pudendal nerve injection block. Worst decision of my life. They gave me injections through my buttcheeks, and in the moment the numbing stuff they injected into me did help relieve the sensation in my clitoris, but after a day from the injection (it\u2019s been exactly a week since I got it) my symptoms started getting even worse!! Whatever steroid they used did not do it\u2019s job. The worst part is, when I tried to relieve myself, I only had half of the sensation in my clitoris so it was hard to reach orgasm which I needed for relief. Imagine having to do that 12 times too\u2026 so fast forward to now. I haven\u2019t had any relief in a week. I\u2019ve been having to masturbate multiple times every fucking day in hopes that it would go away and it\u2019s only gotten so much worse.  I haven\u2019t been able to sleep because the sensation makes me sick to my stomach and is not accompanied with some weird vibration which almost feels like a rush of blood near the clitoris. It\u2019s also extremely enlarged and everything fucking hurts. I\u2019ve been screaming and crying and my boyfriend is afraid that the injection did permanent damage to my nerve or something. I hate everything!!! Not to mention overtime throughout the years, having sex became difficult because every time after sex, even though it wasn\u2019t touched or stimulated, my clitoris would act up and I would have to relieve it. I\u2019ve also been having pain during sex since. I\u2019ve been super suicidal and nothing feels real anymore. I\u2019m at a total loss. Perhaps I have pelvic floor? I\u2019ve always urinated during masturbation and everything always felt tight around there. If I sit for too long I start to get this numbing sensation around the clitoris which then turns into PGAD.

Came across this subreddit when googling for answers.\n\nIn 2016 I was on vacation with my partner. One night I woke up at night in excruciating pain. It really felt like I was about to give birth. My uterus was cramping way worse than any period cramp I\u2019ve ever had. I couldn\u2019t move. I felt like I was about to throw up and poop at the same time. It got slowly better over an hour period. Had some dull pain in my uterus a few days after.\n\nI\u2019ve experienced these \u00abseizures\u00bb regurarely over the past 5 years. They always happen at night/early morning. After experiencing it a few times I noticed that the pain came directly after having an involuntary orgasm in my sleep. It may happen multiple times a night.\n\nI\u2019ve tried having more sex and masturbating more, as I thought I was sexually frustrated. But it hasn\u2019t worked. I\u2019ve not seen a doctor about this yet, because you know, it\u2019s embarassing! But I\u2019m going to the gynecologist tomorrow, planning to tell her all about it. \n\nIt may be worth mentioning that I\u2019ve always had heavy menstruation with a lot of pain. It runs in the family, and my sister almost died from loosing too much blood from menstruating. I\u2019m on continuous birth control to manage these horrible periods.\n\nDo you think this could be PGAD? I\u2019m asking as I\u2019ve understood it\u2019s pretty rare and difficult to diagnose, and I think it would help to hear from others with similar problems. It destrys my quality of life, as I\u2019m already chronically ill, and this comes on top draining my energy.\n\nThank you for taking your time to read my story.

"selftext": "So I decided to post this because as of yet I haven't seen my \"approach\" to greatly relieving my PGAD symptoms and this might help someone. I started having symptoms June of last year after starting an antidepressant AND having a UTI. On top of that, I'd had a really traumatic miscarriage the year before and it messed up my pelvic floor.\n\nLike most, I was completely freaking out when first diagnosed and IMMEDIATELY started reaching out to doctors. I eventually made my way to a pelvic floor specialist and she was able to point out that not only were my pelvic floor muscles cramped up, the whole right side of my body was cramped up. She was able to demonstrate how stretching my leg a certain direction greatly reduced the symptoms. The next several sessions was her trying a bunch of different things to see what helped, some did and some didn't. She explained that the pelvic floor is SO connected to the rest of the body that working on other places would help reduce my symptoms, and it started WORKING. Ultimately it was certain stretches that helped \"even out\" my body and loosen up the muscles near my sacrum. Sacral chakra-specific yoga also help, as did breathing exercises where I imagine my pelvic muscles relaxing and opening up. I then started seeing a Myofascial massage therapist who helped me with the trauma side of my muscle issues. \n\nThrough my own research and testing out things on my body, I was able to isolate certain muscles in my glutes that were perpetually tense and painful to the touch. Whenever I have a flare up, I have my husband massage those muscles or I use a foam roller. Sometimes if I just pinch the muscle it will make the PGAD either go away or reduce enough that I don't think about it. A TENS unit in that exact spot also helps and sometimes feels like it switches the \"off switch\" on the PGAD. ALSO.. here is the big kicker. Massaging my right foot (the side of my body that cramps up) will get rid of my PGAD. Not super long term, but if I'm somewhere were I have to sit for a while or dealing with a bad flare up, I'll roll a tennis ball with my foot. Sometimes I'll have my husband press this one pressure point on my foot and it will do the trick SO GOOD. ALSO, whenever I'm flared up, instead of putting ice directly between my legs, I'll put it on other parts of my body that are tense... under my thigh or my foot or even my stomach muscles. I've found that drawing the attention away from the clitoris helps a lot. \n\nWhen I was in the worst of it, it felt like my body was my enemy, which sucked a lot. It helped to build up a more trusting relationship with my body where I was very intentional with self care and connection. Sometimes I would even look at my clitoris and say \"I'm not afraid of you.\" Psychologically, it helped a lot. Sex has even been possible because I'm able to use all those techniques (plus a cold water bath) to \"come down\" after sex AND the heightened sensitivity has made my orgasms EPICALLY stronger. Seriously have never had organisms this strong. It took some time to get back into sex, and we took it small steps at a time while I built up my coping and \"come down\" techniques. Eventually, sex became something that helped me relax and be in tune with my body, thereby reducing the symptoms. Sometimes it actually helped take the edge off and if I go to sleep right after sex I'll wake up the next morning with minimal to no symptoms.\n\nMy approach is not a complete cure, but I've gone months and months with out being really bothered by the PGAD. I'm currently in the middle of a bad flare up because of hardcore stress and unfortunately another miscarriage, so I'm going to look into having a surgeon do the neurolysis of the dorsal nerves to see if it will get rid of it for good, but overall I have a lot of hope with managing it and being able to live my life.  Approaching the PGAD problem through the perspective of muscles has really changed the game for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps someone! I know PGAD is so unpredictable and the \"cures\" almost random and many of you(us) have tried a million different things. If you try these exercises and it helps let me know how it goes!

I had dealt with this before, after coming off Prozac, but the difference was that only lasted a couple of weeks -- and this wasn't going away. Symptoms continued for around four months. I even started noticing I was sore down there, almost raw.\n\nOne day I used a new soap, and my entire body broke out in a horrible itch. Along with this, my vulva became extremely sore, red and irritated. The \"arousal\" feeling turned into burning. I went to the doctor and got diagnosed with contact dermatitis of the vulva. Guess what substance was in common with both that soap and the lubricant I had been using for years... Aloe vera! Apparently, I'm allergic to the plant that's supposed to help with reactions. Go figure.\n\nAs my reaction died down, I saw a decrease in both the burning and the PGAD symptoms. For me, low-grade irritation down there feels like arousal. Every time it's flared up again since, it's been because I became allergic to a new substance.\n\nObviously, this won't be the answer for every single person, but if you're at a loss, it might be an idea to treat your PGAD like an allergic reaction.

Invest in really good deodorant if sweating is a problem for you. An unscented roll-on like Certain-Dri + a scented anti-perspirant is my fav combo. If you're comfortable, shaving your armpits might help keep the deodorant on longer.\n5. Lay towels down when you sleep, and dress lightly (or consider not wearing underwear when you sleep), if night sweats are a particular problem.\n6. For night time, it seems counter-intuitive, but sleeping with a pillow in between my legs helps. Again, it does not prevent spontaneous orgasms. Rather, it gives my pelvic and abdominal muscles something to brace against and reduces muscle fatigue and prevents pulling a muscle.\n7. Sleep in a cool/cold bedroom if your doctor approves of it. A good tip for a good night's rest anyway!\n8. During spontaneous orgasms, try not to \"fight against it\"/tighten your muscles too much. Work on learning to maintain your breathing and relax your muscles. For me, this prevents muscle injury/soreness, emotional distress, and reduces the length of time of an orgasm.\n9. During spontaneous orgasms, reminding myself that it's involuntary, it will pass/it's temporary, etc. helps reduce stress and therefore reduces length of time of an orgasm. Whatever is most stressful about a spontaneous orgasm for you, develop a meditative mantra to remind yourself of otherwise.\n10. Learn any other triggers. You can't avoid them all, but work with them. Sometimes it's car rides, intense music/flavors/textures/any sensory experience whatsoever, intense emotions, lying down, caffeine, etc. By learning triggers, you may learn what might help reduce the symptoms.\n\nAnd of course, before you try anything on this list, if you don't know if you have PGAD or not, you need to talk to your doctor. PGAD can be caused by many different things or mimic so many different other conditions, so it's so important to just have an honest chat with a medical professional about your symptoms even if it seems awkward.

year of my course. the reason for it being worse during corona is that i lost my social life. if im out there being with friends and living a normal and fun life it goes away but ones im alone for too long it comes back and haunts me. i couldnt live alone so i had to go back to my country to seek help. almost no doctor has heard of it. they dont know how to treat it. nothing works. i can only manage to control the symptoms. triggers for me is stress or feeling bad or feeling lonley. for example if i have a bad day for what ever reason, i might get pgad activated for the next day. but here is the catch now cus of the pgad on the second day i feel horrible and that itself triggers the pgad for the next day. and it fuckin goes on. like a small fire in a massive dry jungle. it might stop at some point. ones it isnt there i have to do my best not to think about it and be scared about it otherwise the same cycle initiates ones again. i have to avoid anything that stresses me. i have to stay super active during the day and do anything that convinces me that i made a good use of my time or day today or els the pgad starts the same day or next day. i was thinking about finishing my course but cus i had to suddenly come back to my country i am now above the age of 18 and in my country if you are above the age of 18 you cant leave the country unless you attend the military for 2 years. which is a lot of stress. i cant convince the doctors in the militery that i have this condition and i cant do my duty cus there isnt a way of me proving that i have this and not faking it. for past days i have had really bad episodes of pgad. no one has a cure for it. im alone. i can only think about ending my life. that is the only relief i can think of. no one should ever live like me. the prolonged orgasm feeling makes me feel dizzy all the time. im miserable. even my parents who happen to be surgeons dont understand me and are busy doing their work. i have no one to turn to. im stuck in my country. and i know no one can actually help me. i guess millions of people die every year and im sure they didnt want to. i have to be one of them. thanks for reading this much.",

I\u2019m a 22 year old female, and for the past two weeks or so I\u2019ve gotten PGAD symptoms. I\u2019ve had the disorder since I was 15. I had symptoms for months back then and I remember wanting to die, finding no release and being too embarassed to talk to anyone about it. Then it just stopped, I don\u2019t remember doing anything specific but suddenly I didn\u2019t get the symptoms anymore. \n\nAnyways, about two weeks ago I started feeling it again. I\u2019m hopeful this will go away like it did last time, but I have doubt. What if it\u2019s here to stay this time? These last days have been hell. I\u2019m growing more and more anxious day by day. I can\u2019t sleep. It takes hours to fall asleep and I wake up multiple times a night to a burning sensation in my genitals. That\u2019s mainly what it is for me, this horrible burning and throbbing sensation that doesn\u2019t go away no matter what I do. I can\u2019t be intimate with my boyfriend. He\u2019s been wonderful though, I told him and thank god he took it seriously and has been trying his best to make me feel better.\n\nStill I feel like there\u2019s no cure, I can\u2019t distract myself with anything. Hanging out with friends has become almost impossible, and public places give me major anxiety. I can\u2019t begin to describe how debilitating this disorder is and what it does to my mental health. I feel a constant mix of anxiety, fear and frustration. Yesterday I was thinking about ending my life. I\u2019m just in a very dark place right now. I booked an appointment with my gyno but I\u2019m scared there\u2019s nothing doctors can do since I live in a relatively small country and I can\u2019t even find any information on PGAD in my language.\n\nI just wanted to share my story.

interesting like hanging out with friends, playing my violin, or playing video games. but when im bored or stressed, thats when my symptoms start showing up. ive also noticed a pattern, usually it is really bad for a week then really mild for a week.  ive only had a couple of random orgasms but that was only when i was really turned on. i also have a few other symptoms which may have a corrilation to  PGAD: Pain when peeing and orgasm (sometimes) and hard flaccid syndrome which can accur randomly not for more than a day. ) Im nourvus about telling my parents though because im afraid there wont be treatment and my brothers will end up finding out then word will spread to my friend group. thats all, just though id do a little rant to get a few things off my chest. help and insight would be

I didn't tell anyone about this out of shame, so I hope to get support here.It all started a long time ago. When I was 9-10 years old, I started masturbating without realizing it. However, I did it in an unusual way. I pressed tightly to the bed (floor), raised my legs a little and \"rolled\" on the foreskin. At the age of 14, I first tried the usual masturbation for everyone and it was good. I began to alternate the ways of masturbation, until I completely ruled out the old one. Moreover, this activity helped me so much to relieve stress, so at the age of 15-16 I did it almost every day before going to bed. In addition, to get more pleasure, sometimes I deliberately waited 30-60 minutes and continued. But one day I wondered, do I really need it? I have read many articles on the benefits of not masturbating. I firmly decided that I would not masturbate that night. However, an unexpected disappointment awaited me, which haunts me to this day. Every time I try to sleep, I have a strong urge to touch myself. And thinking about it makes the \"pain\" even stronger. I went online hoping to find a solution. Everywhere they wrote that it was all in the head, there was no need to think about it. But all my attempts only proved that I feel physically uncomfortable. After some time, I began to notice that the need for masturbation appeared not only at night, but also during the day. I could sit at school, with a tutor, at a visit and feel a strong burning sensation in the genital area. The more I endured, the longer the discomfort remained after the procedure. At night, there are situations when 1 time cannot fully alleviate the symptoms. It's terrible to do this 3 times a night. This has haunted me all these years! And it manifested itself when I sit or lie.  \n**What is it at the moment?**  \nMasturbation has become both my pain pill and my most hated enemy. 1-3 times a day is normal for me. I thought I had problems with the prostate and bladder (when I really want to go to the toilet, the burning sensation intensifies). But the examination showed that I am healthy in this regard. I rummaged through everything about PGAD and realized the whole misfortune of my situation. My record for abstinence so far is 4-5 days when I was constipated. I have no idea how this is connected. Perhaps one pain was hiding another.  \n**My attempts to fight PGAD:**  \n1) I have found that being in a good mood can relieve symptoms noticeably. Therefore, I tried to talk with friends as often as possible, play games, eat delicious food and relax. But the negative moments of life will not go away on their own just like that. Only one bad obsession could make me want to masturbate. I try to control it, but it's very difficult.  \n2) I also noticed that the stronger the orgasm from masturbation, the longer I will not be bothered by the symptoms. I have several ways to do this, but I'm not entirely sure of them, so I won't say anything.  \n3) In a stuffy room, sitting in sweat, the symptoms go away by 75-90%. It's summer now, so sometimes I try not to turn on the air conditioner to get at least a little breath from the PGAD. I also read that training helps. they cause sweat. But since I'm mostly a homebody, I don't have to choose.  \n4) Saw one person comment on reddit. He was helped by stretching the pelvic floor and a daily walk. I admired his success tried to repeat after him. Perhaps I would have been doing this even now, if not for the third day. I tried to do each exercise correctly and walked a lot that day. I did not masturbate all day, although he felt the need. Before going to bed, I even went in for some sports. So much I believed in the correctness of my actions. But when I went to bed, I realized that I was already on the brink. Therefore, I decided that nothing bad would happen. After I finished, the feeling was disgusting. I went to the toilet 5-6 times in an hour. After that, for 2-3 days, everything below the belt was in tension. I have never felt such terrible discomfort. After this experience, I gave up.  \n**Soon:**  \nI plan to go to a neurologist and a psychiatrist. They might be able to do something to me, because I'm really scared. Now I live at home, so I can relieve my symptoms in a proven way at any time. But what happens next? I will go to university, they will give me accommodation. And what am I going to do there? How will I sleep? How will I study? And how will I sit in class? I do not know what to do. Lately, I haven't been able to concentrate on anything at all. Thanks for reading this.

I added some details and updated with recent developments \n\nPlease note: PGAD is also known as RGS, which is the term I used here\n\nMy story:\n- I was on Sertraline (antidepressants) for a few months then we increased the dosage from 100mg to 150mg\n- A few days later, I started having my first RLS symptoms\n- We had to increase Sertraline again to 200mg\n- Then came RGS (Restless genital syndrom), which is even worse than RLS\n- My doctor prescribed Quetiapine to help me sleep and said it would help with the symptoms \n- Then I stopped sleeping, mostly. Always falling asleep only when extremely exhausted. I was feeling so bad and that was actually the worst time of my d\u00e9pression\n- I called my doctor crying telling her to do something or i'll just stop my meds altogether or worse... I felt very bad\n- I was finally able to convince her to decrease my Sertraline dosage to 150mg, then to 100mg a week later\n- My RLS + RGS got a little better and I got a lot better. I was doing so good with my depression that I went back to work\n- RLS was mostly gone but RGS still annoyed me\n- Doctor prescribed pramipexole 0.25mg and it helped a lot\n- We increased pramipexole to 0.50mg and I had a whole 3 weeks without symptoms\n- I just started having mild symptoms of RGS again a few days ago. It's still manageable, but I hope it doesn't get worse", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 389, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My story and how I got better...

At the time this sub didn\u2019t exist and I really didn\u2019t know where to post what was happening to me. I never post on Reddit, but after spending the past year going through hell and now finding a new normal that is manageable, I want to share my experience and what has worked for me as it may help others.\n\n[My story](https://www.reddit.com/r/SSRIs/comments/aemdxi/im_still_new_to_reddit_and_just_realized_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI am not a doctor so this is not a professional opinion or insight. I\u2019m a veteran and I got to the VA and the doctors there have been less than helpful. I\u2019ve had more \u201cspecialist\u201d look at my junk in the past year than I can count. Ive done multiple sleep tests, tons of blood/lab work, and even had 2 prostate exams. So far there is no clear diagnosis except for hyper-sexual disorder. They\u2019re afraid to call it PGAD.\n\nThe number of unprovoked orgasms increased to about 4-6 per day in the weeks following the first one (some dry and some wet) This is the one of the worst parts. It got to the point that I wouldn\u2019t leave the house unless I was wearing a condom. \n\nMy erection never went away, even following an orgasm and I had no refractory period. My sexual desires and sexual ideology went through the roof and I developed a porn addiction. I went from watching porn about once a every week or two to watching it whenever I could. The first 6 or so months after this all started became a downward spiral. \n\nI had a warm fuzzy feeling at the base of my penis and in my balls that would turn into pain if I did not have an orgasm, and I rubbed my penis raw a lot. \n\nI was put back on different ssri\u2019s, other non ssri ADs and even tried Tramadol but they didn\u2019t help. I started taking CBD and it helped with the migraines and some of the head fog. About 6 months ago my wife went to Colorado and brought back some 2.5 mg THC 5mg CBD edible and for the first time I actually had positive results.\n\nThe edibles didn\u2019t fix all my symptoms but they made it more manageable. I now take them everyday, 2.5-5 mg 2-3x per day (I tried 10mg once and that actually made things worse and got me too messed up). I can still function normally at that dose and I only have about 1 unprovoked orgasm per week now. I still have a constant erection and no refractory period but sometimes my erection will soften a little, almost like being 80% hard, which is a huge improvement. It hasn\u2019t decreased my sexual appetite but it makes it easier to manage. I don\u2019t get a lot of pain at the base of my penis anymore but that fuzzy warm feeling is always there. I\u2019m still experiencing vivid wet dreams about 3 times per week give or take. \n\nI\u2019ve had to make some changes in my life. Going out in public is still an issue but it\u2019s doable. If I\u2019m 90% sure I\u2019m not going to have an orgasm. The weirdest thing is walking around with a noticeable erection all the time. I wear clothes that help hide it but it\u2019s still noticeable. \n\nWe told another couple that we\u2019re friends with about my situation and how the edibles have helped. I regret doing that because things feel awkward now. My wife doesn\u2019t think so but I catch both of them looking at my junk a lot when we\u2019re around and the woman has become overly friendly. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ve told others too. Certain dynamics have changed with certain friends in our group, with some people being more friendly, with some of the women coming in for big hugs when we see them which they didn\u2019t do in the past. The edibles help with anxiety and make me more sociable so it could just be the result of me being more friendly. On the flip side, some of our friends have stopped coming around and have stopped inviting us to parties or get togethers.\n\nThis is my new normal. It\u2019s not what it was before this all stared but it\u2019s 100% better than what it was 8 months ago. Sorry for the long post, I\u2019ve got more things to say and could type a book on my past years experiences but I\u2019m going to end it here. I\u2019m going to try and post about this more often going forward.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 55, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Living with PGAD", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/ei5ckz/living_with_pgad/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "karenLynnSteele", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_10wpkf", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1577633857, "domain": "self.PGADsupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/eh78gt/awkward_question/", "gildings": {}, "id": "eh78gt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/PGADsupport/comments/eh78gt/awkward_question/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1577633858, "score": 1, "selftext": "This is sort of embarrassing but... has anyone had PGAD lead into any unusual experimentation sexually?

Two DAYS. If you don't have much experience with antidepressants and SSRIs, typically you can expect to spend several WEEKS gradually tapering your dose off. \n\nI was a little wary of this when he suggested such a quick change, but hey he's the psych and I didn't want to get marked down as noncompliant. The first few days after the switch seemed perfectly normal so I assumed everything had gone okay. Little did I know that the average half life of fluoxetine is about a week, meaning that it takes about a month for your body to flush it out if you've been taking it for years like I had.\n\nCut to me in my outpatient therapy almost a month later to the day. I suddenly experience physical arousal that lasts all day. I think it might have something to do with entering trauma therapy and write it off for the first day. When it persisted the next day I started researching and discovered PGAD.\n\nAt this point I've been dealing with my PGAD symptoms for three weeks with no more than about two days at a time of 3/10 or lower. I managed one day to have about 8 orgasms with no more than temporary relief. My personal psychiatrist has been tapering me (properly) back to fluoxetine, but I'm almost fully switched over now and had one of my worst days of symptoms yesterday. \n\nI'm furious. Furious with the negligent psychiatrist who thought it was acceptable to essentially take a patient cold turkey off a medication they'd been taking for years. At my own psychiatrist who was almost willing to send me home with a dismissal that this is a trauma symptom that will pass eventually. At the medical institution as a whole for not bothering with any significant research into this in the decades it's been noted. At the fact that a symptom flare up means being treated to intrusive thoughts of mutilating my own genitals just to make the maddening sensation stop. At the fact that it seems more and more likely each day that I'll be the sort of endless medical struggle I read about so many others facing with this diagnosis.\n\nPeople who are suffering with this have hardly anywhere to turn, and no sure answers. We have horror stories of misprescribed psychotropic medications, electro-convulsive therapy, and clitoridectomies done in desperation. We have doctors making light of our situation with inappropriate comments about our sex lives and a miserable handful of half-hearted medical journals.\n\nI'm sure most of you reading this know this intimately, but I guess I'm just hoping for some small amount of catharsis from writing all this down.

I haven't partook in any sexual activity with anyone. I started frequently masturbating 4 years ago, but my frequent would be 3 - 4 times a week and sometimes 2 or 3 times in a single day.\n\nMy first acknowledgement below lead to everything making sense about why I believe I might be experiencing PGAD.\n\nA couple nights ago I was playing a (can be considered) violent video game, (so you can assume what I was doing) and I was suddenly aroused. I laughed about it and was jokingly like \"woah, is this my thing? I hope not.\" An hour had passed, and the feeling was still there, so I decided to search what my problem was. PGAD was the first to show. I read through many sites/articles and realized that I've experienced this multiple times before, but I unknowingly chose to neglect it. And now I wish that I continued to not know about it because now I'm too aware.\n\nThat night after learning about PGAD, I was remembering times when I was randomly aroused. And the few times I can remember the most is when I was in the car going somewhere and I was aroused. Other times being late at night. I'm always up late and will usually stay up until 4 or 5am. That's probably due to me just not doing anything with my life at the moment, but is that what's really happening? Maybe... but maybe it could also be because I'm constantly aroused. I'm not too sure about that.\n\nI failed to mention above, that at those times, I knew I was aroused, but just thought that maybe it was my hormones and that it was normal to feel that way almost everyday. And that when I feel it, it mainly starts off as a lingering feeling, and it's easy to not notice at first, but then it becomes more intense and that's all I can think about, but I can't always go and relieve myself of that feeling. I do not remember how long this has been going on for, but it's been at least maybe 5 months or more. Somewhere below I mention I've had spasms for the past year, but I'm not really sure if the two are fully connected.\n\nIt's quite an embarrassing feeling to have when your constantly around your family. I almost feel quite ashamed of it because I can already be aroused and just have to continue a conversation with someone. And it's even worse because my little nephew lives with us, so everyone always interacts with him, so I can't just be that aunt that ignores him. I honestly hate having to mention him while talking about this, but it's worse having to be around him and feel that way. I'm suddenly overwhelmed with sadness trying to write this part.\n\nThis one site said muscle spasms were apart of it. For maybe the past year, I've been experiencing those, but I thought it was something else. Still could be something else, but it seems that I do have them when I'm aroused. It's like my whole body shakes, but mainly my right arm tenses up and shakes the most. At times it can be very exhausting. It'll happen for a few minutes when I'm either lying down or sitting, rarely when I'm standing, unless the feeling is very strong. Another thing is that when the feeling is really really strong and feels like I need to take care of it right then and there, it's like from that spot and up to my abdomen, I tighten up (it almost feels very forceful), but it doesn't continually stay that way, it's more so like a pulsating feeling.\n\nSometimes masturbating feels like a chore. I can be physically aroused, but mind isn't in sync with that arousal. They both need to be in sync for me to even climax quickly. With how strong it can feel, I would think I should be able to finish within maybe 5 to 10 minutes, but instead it can take up to 30mins or longer. Sometimes just after I climax once, I feel exhausted so I can't even continue once the feeling comes back around. The feeling can come back after maybe an hour, but it can also be back within the hour. I can't always do it because I live in a chaotic house with many people that can walk in on me at any time, so sometimes I just have to suffer with the feeling.\n\nI've only told one person about this, and that person was my online friend. He told me to just continue masturbating until the feeling goes away, I laughed and told him \"I have things to get done, I just can't do that all day.\" Overall he wasn't being rude or trying to make jokes out of it, he just didn't understand fully and didn't know how to give me advice on the subject, which is understandable. I'm afraid to tell my mother because I know she will treat me differently once I do. I fight with her quite a bit, but when it comes to health overall, everyone doesn't hesitate to speak out about it. I do not have health insurance atm, and I honestly don't know how to handle all that type of stuff, she would be the one to help me, but I don't know how to bring any of this up to her. If I do tell her, it would of course be very minimal information.\n\nAnd that is that. Sorry if that's very long, I'm not that best at explaining things or I'll ramble too much and sometimes forget important details, so hopefully whoever reads this can understand what I mean.

I've been having PGAD symptoms for about 3 years, and haven't been able to pinpoint the cause. It did seem to start oddly enough when I was trying to get healthier - cut back on drinking, eating healthier, exercising more, trying allergy shots instead of constantly taking medicine. It started where I would feel really agitated every few days and need a \"release,\" but later these feelings got closer and closer together where they were almost every day. I will say that for me the feelings are relieved by orgasm, but usually only for a day at most, and the feelings would often linger after. After a while it got to the point where I felt so disgusting and had an aversion to sex. Couldn't even look at people making out on TV.\n\nI have been to regular doctors on this issue, a couple of which said, \"usually women have the opposite problem.\" I then tried an OB/GYN who gave me complete workup including ultrasound, neurologist, physiatrist, and now psychiatrist. I have tried varying my exercises, stretches, mindfulness and breathing, which somewhat helped but certainly didn't solve the issues. I have tried various medicines - hormones (progesterone), which helped marginally but causes other issues; amitriptyline, which helped in that it numbed things somewhat so lessened the intensity; Cymbalta, which made the feelings actually painful so only took it a few days.\n\nSo coming to the point. The only real relief I have found is through psychiatric medicine. The psychiatrist I consulted about not only PGAD but also mood issues diagnosed me with bipolar and OCD, and prescribed medication to treat those issues. By far the one that has helped me the most has been Abilify (aripiprazole). My doctor thinks the root cause of my PGAD is anxiety/OCD. I was very skeptical of this since I actually experience strong physical sensations rather than thoughts/fantasies, but I couldn't rule out that it was psychosomatic. She said Abilify can help with bipolar stability as well as anxiety/OCD. \n\nWell, cut to a few weeks later and not only did Abilify help stabilize/lift my mood, but the sensations haven't been nearly as bad and I have actually felt attraction and desire for sex again. Truly a miracle for me because I was to the point where I wanted to just cut sex completely from my life and never wanted arousal again. I can enjoy thinking about and experiencing sex again. The PGAD still has flared a bit, but I'd say half or less what it was. I'm thinking that if it continues to flare I can always try upping the dose a bit. The effectiveness already has been amazing for me because I am only on a starter/child's dose and it started helping within a few days!\n\nI'm not advocating everyone go out and take Abilify but just wanted to share my experience to give others hope. I know what it is to lay there sobbing and wanting to die because it is such torture. Now I feel I may be able to have a normal life again. From what I have read of PGAD, it can have different root causes and therefore different treatments, but trying medication can be worthwhile. I never would have guessed that this particular medicine, an atypical antipsychotic, would help, but it did. I'm glad I was willing to try something my doctor suggested even though I didn't imagine it would help with this issue.

I want to tell my story here, it might be a bit confusing or lengthy but I'll tell it anyway.\nIt started about 8 months ago, with what I'd assume at the time was just intrusive sexual thoughts. I hadn't felt any arousal for about a year before this, and was coming to terms with the idea that I may be asexual, when suddenly I felt like everything was sexual or arousing to me, including things that I found distressing (I thought for a while I may have pOCD, thats still on the table but its all very confusing). \nIntrusive thoughts definitely played a part in it but what was impacting me most was that things that I'd never found sexually appealing before and that ordinarily wouldn't be sexual at all seemed to be making me aroused. Just existing seemed to be what was triggering it. Despite this, I couldn't really enjoy masturbation, I'd always found it kind of underwhelming but after getting these feelings they felt even more so, as if I couldn't satisfy myself in the least, even with orgasm. I've ended up masturbating an incredible amount more than I ever used to, up to 3 or 4 times a night when its at its worst.\nOver time, I feel like the intrusive thoughts aspect has lessened. I don't know if I'm getting used to them, learning to cope with them better, whether they've just been going away or what. But the constant arousal has stayed, as has the constant feelings of dissatisfaction.\nSince this started, I've felt that this arousal completely overrides all my other feelings and its made me horribly depressed. I have a nonsexual partner who I loved deeply and I believe I still do on some level, but its as if those positive feelings have been absolutely smothered. They're insanely understanding and supportive about this (I'm very open to them about it) and I wish I could feel the comfort I know I should from that, but I just can't. I signed up for a mindful self-compassion program but when they recommend to hug yourself or think about things to comfort yourself, there's just nothing there but arousal and the overwhelming need to masturbate. I'm strongly considering seeking out a sexual relationship to have on the side (with all parties consenting, my partner knows about this) in case thats the problem, but I'm afraid what its going to mean if that doesn't change anything for me.\nI've talked to two therapists about it now, (about to move on to the third) but neither of them have understood. They focus in on trying to cure the shame I feel about this arousal, and I can understand where they're coming from but it all just makes me feel misunderstood and hopeless. \n\nI'm not as concerned about learning the name for this as I am to know if its possible to feel joy again. If this is PGAD, will I ever again be able to feel good about wearing a nice outfit, eating nice food, or hanging out with animals? Will I be able to feel platonic affection and love again and feel comforted by a hug? I'm scared that this arousal will be all that's left of me as it feels like it has been for the last 8 months. Has anyone with this been able to overcome the emotional toll and manage to enjoy life in spite of it, or is it better to accept I may not feel these things again and just try to live my life despite it?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 370, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New To This But I Think I May Have PGAD", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/nzig2o/new_to_this_but_i_think_i_may_have_pgad/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "MyAlternativeBeing", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8owrxoo7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1623419696, "domain": "self.PGADsupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/nxgje9/cant_do_anything_today/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nxgje9", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/PGADsupport/comments/nxgje9/cant_do_anything_today/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1623419708, "score": 1, "selftext": "Having a very bad flair up, can't even move without being pushed over the edge several times over, I need a holiday", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 368, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can't do anything today", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/nxgje9/cant_do_anything_today/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "zielona_ges", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6fdhfcit", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1622667677, "domain": "self.PGADsupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/nqw92l/paroxetine/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nqw92l", "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/PGADsupport/comments/nqw92l/paroxetine/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1622667701, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi guys, I just wanted to post here, maybe it will help someone.

However, PGAD is a dysfunction that does not include the trigger that sets off MY \u2018waves.\u2019 When my bladder fills up, there is a point where my pudendal nerve is either extremely compressed or innervated. Sometimes I will be in a deep sleep and be violently awoken by my shaking body and surge of hormones, or I will be at school at my desk... or at work talking to my boss. I\u2019ve learned to hide these waves, because it happens to me dozens upon dozens of times per day. Each time this happens to me... it feels like my body is being involuntarily raped.\nAfter every day, I am exhausted, angry, and scared. After every day, I sob the words: \u201cit\u2019s not my fault,\u201d ...but sometimes it feels like it is... because I am so misunderstood.\nWhat will my married life be like? What will happen if I ever get pregnant? What will dating different people be like?\nI\u2019ve done everything alone, because people don\u2019t understand.\nI\u2019ve seen doctors about my case, and each doctor doesn\u2019t know what to do because there aren\u2019t cases like mine that they or other doctors have ever seen. Not to mention, I have been invalidated time and time again from doctors who do not believe me. I have done so much research... yet have found no answers; just a further hole to dig.\nHowever, After 5 years of this torture, I still haven\u2019t put down the torch. Even though I cannot confide in friends much, even after it feels like I\u2019m being raped time and time again by my own body, even after I am sapped of my energy, have trauma, depersonalization, anxiety, and fear from my pelvic floor dysfunction... I\u2019m still fighting.\nEven though I haven\u2019t found a person out there who is like me at all.... I\u2019m still fighting.\nEven though I\u2019m terribly alone with a problem which has done so much damage in my life, I\u2019m still looking for reconciliation.\nI yearn for light to be shed on those who are silently suffering who I wish weren\u2019t judged. People with seizures wouldn\u2019t be judged like I would be... even though people with seizures have episodes just as involuntary.\nTo the women and men out there who may be silently suffering as I have been... come forth. Whether anonymously or in-person, do so purposefully. People around you who YOU think are amazing and strong people... could be struggling with demons beyond your comprehension, and many times its all the same: nobody\u2019s fault. It is a mere fact of life that can best be helped through acceptance, humility, education, validation, and love. \n\nOverall... know there are those perhaps within your own family... who cannot get help and are stuck. Do not let the predispositions of men prevent YOU from enveloping humility. Love \u2014notwithstanding the things you don\u2019t understand. Embrace everyone, as we all have beating hearts... though many times faint.\n\nI wish that I had found a person much like me before I had dug a hole this deep. Hopefully, however, I put this shovel to rest in light of my greatest goal: Peace and unwavering Reconciliation.\n\nI have found that the best remedy for some people with PGAD is to talk it out. Feel free to message me to vent, ask questions, or anything really. I feel compassion for all of you. \n\nLet\u2019s keep fighting.\u2665\ufe0f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 363, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I have Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/nlkq6y/i_have_persistent_genital_arousal_disorder/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "universalist_", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_c2xa9pe4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1621609080, "domain": "self.PGADsupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/nhuiec/i_think_i_have_pgad/", "gildings": {}, "id": "nhuiec", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/PGADsupport/comments/nhuiec/i_think_i_have_pgad/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1621609091, "score": 1, "selftext": "I have ADHD and RLS (the later correlates in a fairly robust way with PGAD) and masturbate several times per day on average.

I have finally accepted after 20 years that I have this. It started when I was around 7 or 8 and grew into really excessive masturbating and a bad porn habit.

I thought I would share my experiences for anyone who's new to this.\n\nI believe I've had this all my life, and in fact I believe it was triggered by childhood abuse because my symptoms were some of my earliest memories. Before I figured out how to cope with them, I spent countless miserable nights unable to sleep no matter what I did. You all know what it's like, when you think orgasming might help relieve the pressure but only makes it worse. There were nights I really just wanted to end it all or just cut out my privates, anything to stop the sensation and get some sleep.\n\nThere were also times when I didn't have flare-ups as badly, and thinking back, those occasions were when I was more active and doing a lot of pilates and ballet barre exercises. Notably, I was flare-up free for a few years after I gave birth to my daughter naturally. The birth must have shifted things around down there.\n\nWhen I got older (adult), some of my coping strategies for bad flare-ups included taking Advil before bed. Before I researched the symptoms, I figured it might have been a nerve issue, and took a chance that pain relievers would block nerve signals enough for me to sleep. Advil would take the edge off so that the sensation wasn't as \"loud\" and allowed me to sleep until it wore off. This led to Advil every night for a few months sometimes. Not ideal, but at least I got some sleep.\n\nMy symptoms were bothersome only at night, since I kept busy throughout the day to distract myself from it. I guess you would call my case rather mild.\n\nAbout 7 years ago during a particularly bad flare-up, I thought to enter my symptoms online and see if anything would pop up. I was so relieved to find the early info about PGAD and a group on PGAD (I've forgotten where it was now) that I cried. I wasn't nuts, after all. And I wasn't the only person experiencing this.\n\nOf course, I still haven't told my doctor about this because there's so little information about it out there. As it was, I had to really advocate for myself to get treated for hypothyroidism; I didn't need to add another thing to fight with my doctor over, lest they flag my file and start treating me like a troublemaker or hypochondriac. At least with hypothyroidism, I had lab results to back me up. \n\nAnyway, I had a bad flare-up this week and came here, and found some great tips that I really appreciate. Stretching, staying active, avoiding sex and orgasms, moving around more... These were great reminders.\n\nI'm lucky that my symptoms are so easily managed. I hope you all find treatments that work for you. I really doubt that this condition is as rare as the medical field says it is.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 347, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My experiences (46F)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/n1mekq/my_experiences_46f/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "karikaturaMe", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9fxee459", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1619105206, "domain": "self.PGADsupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/mw78tu/it_started/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mw78tu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/PGADsupport/comments/mw78tu/it_started/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1619105218, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hello, I'm female 24.

(I\u2019m a 29 years old white male.) While my testosterone levels are naturally very high (1000+ ng/dL and even 1400+ ng/dL once I used to do weightlifting without me taking steroids), I have never experienced my onanism primarily as an arousal issue, though there\u2019s that too, or as a perversion issue (I don\u2019t even enjoy porn), but truly as a dependence issue. What do I mean by that?  \n\nWell, I have had (untreated) inattentive ADHD and RLS since childhood. Which are complex syndromes, but based on the current paradigms, hypothesized as resulting from dysfunctional dopamine systems. But with me being born in a third world country, neither would be treated adequately. Even in the first world countries, there is a pronounced tendency to trivialize both conditions, not only in the popular discourse, but even among most clinicians who would scoff at the notion of the two being mentioned in the same breadth as (say) bipolar disorder or diabetes. Yet based on my personal experience, I can most sincerely attest that having either one is disabling enough, but having two comorbidly is literally living hell.  \n\nMasturbation has been my coping mechanism to (temporarily) control both (by \u201cartificially\u201d flooding my brain with dopamine, endorphins and all that), as well as my chronic depression, possibly stemming from the same (genetic) dopaminergic dysfunction, but additionally exacerbated by a very difficult life and a catastrophic childhood. If the aftermath of me reaching an orgasm, my RLS symptoms would be ameliorated for some time. My depression would temporarily lift... Etc.  \n\nAlso, I would often experience tingling and a very idiosyncratic restlessness in my genital area (mostly not even accompanied by an erection) which would go away only after an orgasm. I read about PGAD (persistent genital arousal disorder) but am not sure whether that applies to me or not, since it apparently is more common in women but is at the same time related to RLS, if I\u2019m not mistaken. I would often (have to) masturbate while studying. It is what it is. (To say this feels very embarrassing...)  \n\nAt 29, I have true CFS like symptoms and my RLS and ADHD are aggravated... but are finally treated with Ritalin and Lyrica. My urge to masturbate has diminished once I added Ritalin and Lyrica. I also have severe IBS and major depression disorder cluster of symptoms. No damage to my genitals, but chronic anhedonia, mental and physical fatigue. Truly CFS like. And I have run out of examinations to do. My brain MRI is normal but my brain fog is catastrophic. My short term memory and verbal fluency are barely existent, my long term memory has taken a great toll too. Whereas I have once been considered precocious and had my IQ estimated at +3SD in my early teens. My dream was to complete a PhD in pure maths... I have a passion for knowledge and a desire to do good... Alas...  \n\nSo I have been wondering whether all those years of masturbation might be the cause of my symptoms. (My blood tests are completely normal. Both narcolepsy and IBD were ruled out with polysomnography and colonoscopy.) Yet I felt ashamed to raise the question explicitly in front of my GP and instead tried to suggest it elliptically. Only to be told that the consensus on masturbation is that it is mostly healthy. That cases of CFS being caused by excessive masturbation are literally unheard of.  \n\nNevertheless, as a rule of thumb, too much of anything is hardly a good idea. I have read some online reports of young men complaining about masturbation getting out of control. They suggested that excessive masturbation (like cocaine, alcohol or meth abuse) causes the brain to reduce the density of dopamine receptors in the long run, which might bring about many cognitive and physical symptoms.  \n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the neuro-biology of chronic fatigue is still poorly understood. Some suggest to pay attention to the immune system, others to mitochondria or to the gut microbiote... But in many proposed causative chains, whether bidirectional, multidirectional or unidirectional... the topic of central dopamine is invariably brought up... Inflammatory cytokines reduce the density of dopamine receptors in basal ganglia... Gut issues mess up one\u2019s levels of neurotransmitters etc. etc.  \n\nBrutally oversimplified, have I perhaps brought genuine brain damage onto myself by \u201eartificially\u201c creating supraoptimal levels of endorphins, dopamine, other neurotransmitters and all that, and by doing so inflicted damage on my brain\u2019s reward systems? Neurotoxicity resulting from oxidative stress? Decreased availability of receptors? I have already heard the consensus on masturbation (mostly healthy etc.), but my case is very peculiar. And the research on this issue seems to be in its infancy...  \n\nSo I came here hoping to see whether anyone might help me out? Even the most seemingly minuscule advice or inconsequential suggestion might prove to be very of huge usefulness!  \n\nThanks in advance.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 337, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Perhaps this sub might help me out?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/mtz07e/perhaps_this_sub_might_help_me_out/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "IPrimalPrey", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_9jxn7d1e", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1618789234, "domain": "self.PGADsupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/mtodib/i_need_advice_of_males_with_pgad/", "gildings": {}, "id": "mtodib", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/PGADsupport/comments/mtodib/i_need_advice_of_males_with_pgad/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1618789245, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\n\nthis post might be a bit weird and maybe it seems like a \"joke\" to ask for such a stupid question.\n\nAnd I might also look like an asshole.\n\nSo I apologize in advance.\n\n\nOK, now to the issue:\n\nI met a guy that I really, really like and we got to a point now that makes it appropriate to talk about intimacy/sex.\n\n\nI was afraid of this conversation bcs I have some \"weird\" issues when it comes to sex.\n\nHonestly, it always feels so bad to \"complain\" about my \"issues\" compared to the real problems of others, but it is what it is. \n\nSo pls don't be too harsh on me. \n\nI am not exactly sure why, but I need very specific mental and physical stimulation to have a satisfying sexual experience. \n\nTo be exact:\n\nI only come from PIV when I feel dominated by the man. \n\nThere is literally nothing else that I am able to enjoy. \n\nAnd I do, unfortunately, have also a high sex drive. \n\nThat means I am not able to \"handle\" that myself and I am completely dependent on my partner. \n\nThis is something very important to me and I know it sounds very \"shallow\" to say this, but I am pretty sure a relationship with a person who can't help me out with my needs won't work on the long term. \n\nI am always afraid to tell somebody about having some \"issues\", but it turns out he does to.\n\n\nHe told me that he suffers from PGAD and that it makes things very difficult as well.\n\nI don't know much about PGAD and also could not find a lot of helpful information online. \n\n(That's why I'm here!) \n\nHe said that he experiences diffrent \"phases\" from time to time. \n\nFor example, he might be highly aroused (unwanted) for hours. \n\nOther times he just has (multiple) spontaneous orgasms and results in pain.

became terrified i may have this so i kept falling deeper into the rabbit hole and googling every little thing and looking at reddit posts i have horrible health anxiety and just horrible anxiety in general and once i feel like i have something i pretty much convince myself i have it and start getting every symptom eventually these symptoms went away when i stopped thinking about it a few days later i got a uti so i went to the doctor and they said i had too many b strep bacterias in my urine so she gave me some amoxicillin and i have been taking it the uti took a while to clear up but it finally did and im better now but about 3 days ago i remembered how i felt with the pgad symptoms at the beginning or the month and started freaking out and getting symptoms again and then for some reason i remembered it causes spontaneous orgasms which terrifies me now i feel like if i start thinking about it too much i will have an orgasm i keep feeling like i could have one and i start panicking but that makes it worse bc i cant tell if im having one or if its just a panic attack my heart starts beating super quick and i get like a flash of heat i dont really feel anything super strong down there it just terrifies me ive always been kind of scared of sex anyways and i fear this will make it worse if i dont stop worrying about it i just wanted someone to reassure me ig my

I don\u2019t do anything to provoke it or masturbate. It just happens randomly. \n\nIf you are a male with this, you\u2019ve probably read stories of possible pinched nerves in the lower back or seen women doing pelvic floor stretches. The pinched nerve scenario is likely but men don\u2019t have the same pelvic issues as women and the stretching isn\u2019t the same for men. \n\nI constantly feel a \u201cpulse\u201d or throbbing that has a rhythm to it.

I just wanted to make this post because someone is maybe going through what I was. For about a week I had all the PGAD symptoms and it was horrible. I couldn\u2019t sleep at all, I could barely eat, and I cried a ton. I have a history of hypochondria btw. There was intense tension throughout my body, and it felt like I was on the brink of an orgasm constantly. On the first day with these symptoms I searched them up and found out about PGAD. Everything online was terrible and it made me feel so hopeless. The more I researched and thought about it, the worse I felt. After 5 days, I found a post on here about a girl who\u2019s PGAD had been caused by blocked stool pressing on her nerves. I have a history of constipation so I became hopeful this was what had caused my PGAD. Once I had convinced myself it was the constipation causing this, in 2 days my PGAD was completely gone!! The relief from feeling like it was curable got rid of my symptoms. I\u2019m quite sure it was my anxiety and hypochondria causing the symptoms to manifest in my head the whole time. I know this isn\u2019t the case with everybody, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s someone out there like me, and i hope this gives you hope :)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 271, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "PGAD is gone!", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/kfyw37/pgad_is_gone/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SylvieXandra", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1l94fl6o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1608257389, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/kfbt8f/it_will_only_let_me_post_images_im_a_teen_girl/", "gildings": {}, "id": "kfbt8f", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/PGADsupport/comments/kfbt8f/it_will_only_let_me_post_images_im_a_teen_girl/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "GJEACmu5AulSEEkVyIKDEhnRLjuAZd-3kM4TAQO2VJs", "resolutions": [{"height": 144, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/yvc5frmctu561.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=271bba913b3ce7990d7ff7f1f18c48ac71fa242b", "width": 108}, {"height": 288, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/yvc5frmctu561.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cacd18bd2ce3b92997d6debdc3018bb81289d9aa", "width": 216}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/yvc5frmctu561.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55fc1e6121728210318487942a88f01256a3efcb", "width": 320}, {"height": 853, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/yvc5frmctu561.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ed9105f22234aa8748ccacc0fd23a8a7c3927d9", "width": 640}, {"height": 1280, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/yvc5frmctu561.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56e541f8b6efbfc012ca54faac83331134b5088a", "width": 960}, {"height": 1440, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/yvc5frmctu561.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba66367000e425b0045ad792ddac2e38e4e72132", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 4032, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/yvc5frmctu561.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0edce060097a0c7d2f8e2247372604e46df6fee0", "width": 3024}, "variants": {}}]}, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1608266875, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 271, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/dUhg4h7C6jIloyaEyKizxJIsyYF0cZvkt5F4xT3lO5k.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "It will only let me post images.

It seems to be worse when i lay down or close my eyes. I'm unable to go to sleep and focus on my school work. I feel fatigued and unable to ignore it, no matter what I'm doing. I have tried to look things up that's similar and all i get is uti results. It has similar symptoms to a uti but my pee is not cloudy or doesnt feel exactly to a uti (I've had them in the past). It goes away for a few hours then comes back and its driving me crazy. The closest thing I found to my symptoms is PGAD, which is why I'm asking for your opinion here. Its genuinely so uncomfortable and I have tried to masturbate to relieve my symptoms but it doesnt work. I have a constant urge to pee however nothing comes put or feels relieving. I'm genuinely distraught and scared. Im sorry if this isnt the right sub to put this in but I'm out of options. My parents dont seem to take me very seriously and I have nowhere else to turn to.

Also, I feel as if I cannot fully empty my bladder. Could this be PGAD? And if it is, can PGAD go away by its self, or is it permanently there?

I thought the pressure, contractions, urgency to pee, urgency to ejaculate, burning, PE, and lack of good feeling from ejaculations were all just part of premature ejaculation.\n\nAs we all know the subject of PGAD online is very sparse and almost impossible to talk to anyone about. I recently went to a Pelvic Floor PT here in Los Angeles and after telling them about all my symptoms they are the ones that told me what PGAD was. It finally makes sense to me! All these sensations are enough to drive you insane especially since there is such little information online about it. And for men it\u2019s essentially not even discussed. What an isolating feeling this is. Especially since it\u2019s accompanied by premature ejaculation I can\u2019t even talk to my partners about it. The only thing that has kept my dating life alive is taking SSRI\u2019s to delay ejaculation. \n\nI\u2019ve been seeing an acupuncturist in LA that focuses on pelvic pain and PGAD. Besides needles all over your body he puts 8 1.5\u201d needles into all your pelvic floor muscles which is then attached to a TENS unit. My lifelong pelvic pain ALL WENT AWAY after 1 treatment!!! Even my PGAD feeling of pressure behind my eyes and in my throat have almost essentially gone away. I am having a flareup right now and it\u2019s definitely causing my contractions to go insane but I\u2019m going to acupuncture twice a week and sometimes he hits a spot that flares me up big time. These contractions for a male are basically the same contractions that occur right as you are ejaculating. So essentially I am walking around constantly almost about to ejaculate. It\u2019s so hard to have normal conversations with people when you are always on the verge.... you know what I mean. \n\nThe one thing that has driven me insane as been that for me I have a squeezing and I have contractions. The squeezing comes from anxiety. I can literally feel the squeeze based on what I\u2019m thinking about the moment. The contractions on the other hand come directly from sexual thoughts. If I see a woman I am attracted to I immediately start getting those contractions that inevitably cause ejaculation. I will say that, besides the occasional flareup, this acupuncture has gotten rid of 85% of all my symptoms. The one that one go away are those damn contractions that happen from sexual thoughts. Until I get those to go away I will continue to have premature ejaculation I believe. \n\nIf anyone is in the Los Angeles area and wants a referral to this guy he is next level and if he can help me this much I\u2019d love to spread the word.\n\nThanks for reading", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PGADsupport", "subreddit_id": "t5_11etuk", "subreddit_subscribers": 258, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "35 Year old male with life-long PGAD and PE", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/k3f7cz/35_year_old_male_with_lifelong_pgad_and_pe/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "OrangeClementine0214", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_13561vsw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1606439898, "domain": "self.PGADsupport", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PGADsupport/comments/k1rkz4/can_hemorrhoids_cause_pgad/", "gildings": {}, "id": "k1rkz4", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/PGADsupport/comments/k1rkz4/can_hemorrhoids_cause_pgad/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1606439908, "score": 1, "selftext": "Ever since I got an anal fissure and hemorrhoids, I got the constant irritated \"itchy\" vein feeling in my perineum area that leadsto arousal in the vagina area.\n\nIt gets worse when I sit down and after bowel movements.

So I\u2019m not sure how common this is, but I\u2019ve had pgad since childhood. It feels like a persistent irritating feeling of pressure in my penis that won\u2019t go away. As a child I could only get a moments relief by applying pressure to my groin/penis and I would get a \u201cmini\u201d orgasm (not really sure if it even was an orgasm at that age) that would relieve the pressure for a few moments. Then the feeling of pressure would invariably return again- I\u2019d sometimes spend a long time before bed just trying to make the pressure go away by repeatedly having these \u201cmini\u201d orgasms- all this before puberty even! The \u201cmini\u201d orgasms were not satisfying at all, just a way to try and get relief like scratching an itch. After puberty the pressure would go away after a real orgasm/ejaculation but still only for a short time. I\u2019ve noticed that the only time it completely goes away is when I\u2019m completely abstinent ie no sex, masturbation or orgasms whatsoever for a period of about a month- of course actually maintaining such a long bout of abstinence can be difficult. My penis is frequently half-erect (but not visibly so, unless Im in gym shorts, thankfully) for days at a time. I used to think this was normal and remember chatting with two of my friends one female and one male. I told the the female friend \u201cwell flaccid penis size varies like crazy- some days it\u2019s much larger even near the size of an erection for the entire day despite being flaccid and not being really aroused\u201d My male friend was like \u201cuh no, thats not normal-mine stays the same when flaccid always\u201d. (I dont remember why on earth we were discussing this though \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02) \n\nOverall my case isn\u2019t as bad as some of the people\u2019s here- it does make me not too thrilled about sex in general though because having consistent orgasms makes the pressure and discomfort worse, and orgasm only feels satisfying for a minute or two until the pressure returns. Pretty much after every orgasm I have to fight the desire to orgasm again to get rid of the pressure after it returns- if I give in and orgasm a second or third time the pressure keeps intensifying. After the first orgasm it\u2019s like a mild itch, but after the second or third its like having ants crawling on you and having to resist the urge to get rid of them. \n\nHas anyone else had pgad before puberty?
